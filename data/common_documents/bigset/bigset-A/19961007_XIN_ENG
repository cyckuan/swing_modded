<HEADLINE> Corsican Separatists Suspected in Bordeaux Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Corsican separatists were strongly
suspected to have a hand in the Bordeaux explosion which caused
extensive damage to the city hall Saturday night, Agence France
Presse (AFP) quoted an anonymous source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which took place at 11:41 p.m. (2141 GMT), just a
few hours after Prime Minister Alain Juppe left the city,
shattered many windows of the reception hall but would not
postpone the Franco-British summit planned for November 7-8 in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the explosion, the premier, who is also the mayor of
the southwestern city, returned to inspect the damage and discuss
possible measures.
</P>
<P>
Investigators, who first suspected the Basque separatists for
having staged the attack, now placed suspicion away from the
Basques usually active in the region because the kind of bomb
planted in this attack was never used by the group.
</P>
<P>
The Corsican separatist group FLNC strongly attacked Prime
Minister Alain Juppe on September 19 for having denied the
existence of the Corsican people and closed the door for all major
progress made over the Corsican issue in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Juppe and his interior minister Jean-Louis Debre ordered in
August a reinforcement of police force in the Corsica and empowered
police to arrest whoever bears illegal weapons in public places,
following a series of bomb attacks on public buildings there.
</P>
<P>
Henri Desclaux, attorney-general of Bordeaux, said that
the Basque separatist group ETA had no clear involvement in the
event.
</P>
<P>
The French government has promised to provide economic
aid to Corsica to end 20 years of violences there.
</P>
<P>
The FLNC, which has been fighting for independence for 20
years, suddenly banished a half-year-old ceasefire in September
and staged a series of bomb attacks in Corsica and southern
France.

BONN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Anke Huber of Germany beat
Croatia's Iva Majoli 5-7, 6-3, 6-1 to retain her title at the
450,000 U.S. dollars Leipzig Open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Huber, seeded fourth, advanced to the finals
after world No. 1 Steffi Graf pulled out of the WTA tournament
on Saturday due to her knee problem.
</P>
<P>
Huber, ranked sixth in the world, began nervously and made
error after error, falling behind 1-5 in the first set before
calming down.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Majoli, ranked No. 4 in the world, led 3-0 in
the second set before losing it completely.
</P>
<P>
Huber won the Leipzig Open last year by default after

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
today called on the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah
Masood to give up resistance for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Taliban's acting Foreign Minister
Mullah Mohammed Ghaus as saying in Kabul that Masood would face
further attacks by the Taliban unless he stopped resistance.
</P>
<P>
Ghaus said, "we prefer negotiations with all parties involved
in the conflict and the same applies to Masood."
</P>
<P>
"If Masood wants peace, we also are not supporters of war and
want peace and security, but if he is not ready to negotiate with
us we will continue our campaign in the Panjshir valley," Ghaus
added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban today launched a massive offensive against Masood's
troops in the Panjshir Valley, about 150 kilometers north of
Kabul, and the fierce fighting is reportedly continuing.
</P>
<P>
Masood's troops fled the Afghan capital on the night of
September 26 and the Taliban captured Kabul early next morning.
</P>
<P>
Now, Masood's men had holed up in the Panjshir Valley, the
hometown of Masood, and prepared for a final showdown with the
advancing Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Army to Embark on Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Defense Ministry
is exploring ways of making its 40,000 strong national army
become self-sufficient in food to cut down on costs in view of
rising prices, Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said land to start production is available, but
there is no money for capital investment.
</P>
<P>
''Food is very expensive, though we have never run out of food
to feed the soldiers we want to embark on our own food
production,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has come under pressure to cut the defense
budget which takes 11 percent of the national budget of 33
billion Zimbabwe Dollars (3.3 billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In line with the western-backed economic reforms, the
government has reduced the size of the army from 51,000 to
40,000.
</P>
<P>
''We have reached the 40,000 target, but we will continue to
cut down so that we have an allowance to recruit younger
soldiers,'' Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the army's commanders have been instructed to look
into the logistics of embarking on the food production project
soon.

HARARE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Women managers from 16 African
countries will start a two-week workshop on Monday at the Zimbabwe
Institute of Public Administration and Aanagement (ZIPAM) on

ZIPAM said today in a statement that because of the increased
number of women at high managerial levels in the public service there
was need to equip them with knowledge and skills.

The women also had to be sensitized on the changing management and
leadership styles brought on by the public service reform, said
ZIPAM.
</P>
<P>
''This program seeks to address the following problems: low
visibility of senior women managers in the workplace, the need to
strengthen women's leadership and management syles, to enable them to
complement those of their male peers,'' the institute said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt to Probe Army Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The government has agreed to
intervene in the allegations of rampant abuse of the 300,000 U.S.
dollars defense forces benefit fund saying it will appoint
external auditors to probe and restructure its operations.
</P>
<P>
''It is in the interest of the Ministry of Defense that an
audit should be done and thereafter the structure of the fund
will be reviewed,'' Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said today.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Defense Forces fund, which is independent of the
military establishment, was launched in 1988 and registered three
years later as a welfare fund.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the fund are to help secure housing for the
thousands of homeless soldiers and assist aggrieved members and
their dependents in times of death or distress.
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that the top men have borrowed from the fund's
varying sums of money totalling 270,000 U.S. Dollars without
providing securities.
</P>
<P>
''At the end of the audit we want to see the fund being
restructured to ensure transparent management,'' Mahachi said.

<HEADLINE> Supercomputer Pioneer Seymour Cray Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Seymour Cray, 71, the father
of supercomputers, died Saturday in a Colorado hospital as a
result of injuries he suffered on September 22 in a traffic
accident.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol said that a careless
driver attempted to pass the vehicle Cray was driving. His car
clipped another car, which went out of control and hit Cray's
vehicle. Cray was hospitalized in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Cray had devoted his life to making the world's biggest,
fastest and most powerful computers -- supercomputers -- and
largely succeeded.
</P>
<P>
He became a computer scientist in 1950. In 1957, he cofounded
Control Data Corp., where he helped build the first computer to
use transistors rather than the unreliable vacuum tube. His 1976
Cray-1, which he designed and built at his own company, had 10
times the power of any other computer in the would at that time.
In 1985, the Cray-2 had 10 times the speed and power of the
Cray-1.
</P>
<P>
Cray also was the inventor of Reduced Instruction Set
Computing, the technology that speeds up processing time in
desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
However, Cray's 1989 Cray-3 was a failure, the new and more
powerful machine did not attract enough buyers. The legendary
scientist, who seldom slowed by money problems, announced he was
working on the Cray-4. But money ran out, and he filed for
bankruptcy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In August of this year, Cray reentered the supercomputer
business as head of a new Colorado Springs company, SRC Computers
Inc.

<HEADLINE> Fair Opens in Nepal for Grand Hindu Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An eight-day fair opened here
today to celebrate a forthcoming grand festival in Nepal, which
will fall later this month.
</P>
<P>
The dashain festival celebration fair, sponsored by the
Department of Tourism of Nepal and Kathmandu municipality, is
aimed to promote Nepalese culture, arts and crafts as well as to
provide entertainment for tourists visiting Nepal on the occasion,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The dashain festival, the biggest and most popular festival
among the dominant Hindu community in the country to celebrate the
advent of the autumn season religiously and culturally, falls on
October 19 to 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
Opening the dashain celebration fair today, Minister for
Information and Communications Chiranjibi Wagle said that it would
be a great help to the general public if they are provided with
goods at fair prices on the occasion of the grand festival.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested such programs be organized outside the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
The dashain celebration fair will feature sales of daily goods,
food festivals, cultural shows and various contests with public
participation, the organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Calls for Concrete Results in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher stressed today the urgency of achieving
concrete results in the Israeli-Palestinian talks to be resumed
later today at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Christopher said the
recent Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed "demonstrated the great
urgency of reaching some concrete results as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
He said that his mission here is trying to find ways to "seek
the best results" in the resumed negotiations, which he said
would focus on how to best implement the signed agreements,
especially on the issue of redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"Implementing the interim agreement is the best way to
restore and construct confidence between the parties," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that, in order to have these negotiations
succeed, it was essential that both sides understand better the
needs of each other and take certain requirements into account.
</P>
<P>
Although denying that he sought to reopen negotiations on the
signed agreements, Netanyahu insisted that both sides make
security arrangements that would make any agreement work and
"give a future" to both Israeli and Palestinian children alike.
</P>
<P>
"We have not proposed the opening of the accord. We have
proposed the framework of agreement to adapt to the necessary
security situation," he said, adding that Israel intended to
protect the safety of Jewish settlers in the volatile West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Citing the security needs, Netanyahu also denied that he has
committed himself to any date for the conclusion of talks when
he attended the summit held with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Jordanian King Hussein last week in Washington, which
was hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his understanding of Netanyahu's security concerns,
Christopher admitted that that security issue will "figure very
prominently" in implementing the agreement. He said that the
contacts would be within the existing agreement, but the
implementation of which should take into account the changes
of situation, especially after the recent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Netanyahu also refuted the claim that he
was under pressure from the U.S. government, which is reportedly
eager to rescue the peace process by forcing Israel to make some
concessions.
</P>
<P>
"The United States wants to help in every way possible to
find a way to increase cooperation and understanding to advance
the process... It's something that is perfectly acceptable to
us, and we welcome it. It is not an expression of pressure," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was sent by President Clinton here to urge
Israelis and Palestinians to make quick progress in the talks in
order to rescue the fragile peace process, in the wake of the
recent bloody clashes that killed 75 people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators from the two sides would discuss Israel's
redeployment in the West Bank of Hebron, closure of the
territories, safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and the opening of the archaeological underground tunnel near the
Al Aqsq Mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tunnel led to the outbreak of the four-day
bloodshed between stone-throwing Palestinians and Israeli
soldiers, which has pushed the peace process into the worst
crisis in two years.

ISLAMABAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- UN special envoy to
Afghanistan Norbert Holl today paid a one-day visit to Kabul and
held talks with the Taliban acting Foreign Minister Mullah
Mohammed Ghaus.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time in a week for Holl to visit Kabul and
held talks with Ghaus.
</P>
<P>
So far, no details of today's talks were available.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from Kabul quoted some local analysts as
saying that the talks likely focused on relations between the
Taliban and the Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostam who controlled
seven provinces in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Chasing the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood,
the Taliban had reached the crucially strategic Salang pass, 120
kilometers north of Kabul, and opened a front-line with the Uzbek
Militia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Dostam had sent thousands of troops to the
Salang Pass district.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Ghaus warned Dostam to cooperate with the
Taliban or face attack.

<HEADLINE> UN Human Rights Rapporteur Visits Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province is moving in a positive direction,
special U.N. human rights rapporteur Elisabeth Rehn and Kosovo
District Head Aleksa Jokic said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"proof of this is the recently signed agreement by Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova on the return of Albanian minority students to school," a
statement issued after the meeting between Rehn and Jokic said.
</P>
<P>
Rehn arrived in Yugoslavia Sunday for a several-day visit to
see the humanitarian situation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
"Education institutions will seek solutions within the verified
plans and programs composed by the education ministry and in
keeping with Serbia's laws," Tanjug news agency quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, both Rehn and Jokic underscored the
importance of the recent polio vaccination of children in Kosovo.
The action engaged Albanian doctors and much of the Albanian
minority population.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the 2 million population in Kosovo are
Albanians. A strong separatist movement in Kosovo has been seeking
an independence from Yugoslavia's Serbian republic to join
neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Rehn and Jokic concluded that the health institutions in Kosovo
have no other problems except financial troubles. This was
supported by the fact that more than 90 percent of the patients
and over 60 percent of the employees of the clinical center in
Kosovo provincial capital Pristina are minority Albanians.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Rehn visited the children's hospital in
Pristina.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces, Hezbollah Guerrillas Clash in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, thwarted an infiltrating
attempt of an Israeli force in the western sector of south
Lebanon today, the state-run Lebanese National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources described the morning fighting
between the Hezbollah guerrillas and the Israeli troops and
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia as "the most
violent clashes since this month."
</P>
<P>
At least one SLA militiaman was injured in the fighting, the
security sources in south Lebanon noted.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, announced that one group of its
fighters blocked an Israeli force attempting to penetrate
towards the south Lebanese border town of Haddatha at 9:15
a.m. (07:15 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"The fighters showered the enemy with fierce and direct fire
and forced the enemy to pull out of the combat," the Islamic
Resistance said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It added in the statement that another group of its
guerrillas attacked an Israeli patrol on a road near the town of
Al-Tiri in the Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas used machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades
in the assault, killing and wounding several Israeli soldiers,
the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a third group of Hezbollah guerrillas fired
artillery at a SLA position at Al-Jabousi, destroying a T-54
tank and an ammunition depot.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that big fires and black smokes were seen
rising from the position and explosions were heard even in
distant areas.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli client militia confirmed the morning
fighting, but denied any casualties.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Israeli warplanes carried out an air raid at
Hezbollah's guerrilla bases at Iglim Al-Toffah, a south Lebanon
ridge often used by Hezbollah militants as a springboard to launch
attacks on the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone."

<P>
No casualties were caused in the air strike, the third in the
same area since Israel's April "Grapes of Wrath" operation in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Local military observers pointed out that the clashes did not
go beyond the daily frictions on the last active battlefront of
the Arab-Israeli conflict where Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla
campaign against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Twenty Israeli soldiers have been killed and dozens of others
wounded by Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon since the
beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Takes Steps to Improve Coffee Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Coffee and
Tea Authority announced here today that it has taken measures to
improve coffee quality and raise its competitiveness in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Authority General Manager Tsegaye Birhane said quality decline
which usually occurs during coffee preparation could be overcome
through consultative and other services rendered to coffee
growers in the extension program.
</P>
<P>
Picking coffee beans prior to maturity for financial reasons
is one of the major causes for quality decline, he said, adding
that a system meant to extend loan service to coffee growers is
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
He said the authority is working on measures to boost coffee
price to encourage farmers produce qualitative and well-prepared
coffee.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of quality testing equipment in regions will be
overcome soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
There is a plan, he said, to expand coffee washing centers in
a bid to raise the amount of exported washed coffee which stood
at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Measures against lax inspection at control stations are now
being taken besides the installation of an information network to
supervise the activities of controllers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is Africa's third largest coffee producer after
Uganda and Cote d'Ivoire. It plans to export 108,000 tons of
coffee in 1996/97, 6,000 tons more than that of 1995/96.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Start Continuous Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
Steering Committee this evening started a new round of continuous
talks on the implementation of the Interim Agreement to expand
Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held at the Erez Checkpoint between Israel and the
Gaza Strip, began at 20:00 p.m. local time (1800 GMT). The talks
are expected to focus on the Israeli army's redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron, which has been delayed for more than
half a year.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to ask for changes in the security
arrangements agreed to under the Interim Agreement, also known as
Oslo 2, in light of the recent violence between Israel and the
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, triggered off by the opening of
the Hasmonean Tunnel by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more
than 70 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the confrontation, which had included
exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and the Palestinian
police, U.S. President Bill Clinton called for an emergency
summit in Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, attended by Clinton,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of
Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians agreed to hold
round-the-clock talks starting today to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that one change, expected to be asked
for by Israel at the negotiations, is the demand that the
Palestinian policemen who are deployed in Hebron carry pistols
instead of automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation to the Steering Committee is headed
by former army general Dan Shomron, while, Saeb Erekat, PNA
local government minister, leads the Palestinian side to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross, who arrived in
Israel this morning together with Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, also participated in today's opening session of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the negotiations, Christopher held separate meetings
with Netanyahu and Arafat in an attempt to help the two sides to
solve their disputes and advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said earlier today that the Israeli army's
redeployment in Hebron and general security arrangement are the
two main issues on the agenda of the new negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Likud party in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu
said Israel plans to maintain the Jewish presence in Hebron, as
well as to preserve the holy sites in the disputed West Bank
town.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that no target date has been set for the
conclusion of the talks. He said the talks will end only after all
security issues, triggered by the recent violent clashes, are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also held consultations with
the Israeli Steering Committee to finalize Israel's position for
this evening's negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. President Bill Clinton has
said that he expected "positive results" from the Erez talks.
</P>
<P>
In a message delivered to Arafat in Gaza today by Edward
Abington, U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem, Clinton praised the
Palestinian leader for his effort to bolster the peace process,
adding the US will do all it can to advance the process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said this morning that the Palestinians will also raise
the issues of Hasmonean Tunnel, releasing of Palestinian
prisoners, the passage route between the West Bank and Gaza Strip
during the talks.

<HEADLINE> France Tightens Security in Bordeaux after Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- France today reinforced security
in the southwest city of Bordeaux after a bomb attack Saturday
night caused extensive damage to its city hall.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who is also the mayor of
Bordeaux, vowed this evening to maintain "an extremely firm line"
toward Corsican separatists, who were suspected to have made the
attack,
</P>
<P>
Juppe, who will meet Justice Minister Jacques Toubon and
Interior Minister Jean-Luois Debre Monday to discuss ways to
toughen crackdown on terrorists, said "90 percent of the Corsican
people" want the government to crack down on Corsican separatists.
</P>
<P>
A unit of the elite anti-riot Compagnie Republique de Security
(CRS) and a mobile police force have been deployed around public
buildings of Bordeaux for "permanent guard".
</P>
<P>
The local commissioner in charge of security Bernard Fragneau
admitted that the security measures were loose in the city when
the mayor, Alain Juppe, was not in his mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
Juppe, extremely angry after the attack which he described as
"traumatizing enough", said on television that"the state cannot
yield to terrorism" and "should not let itself be intimidated".
</P>
<P>
"We have before us the terrorists. We will not soften... One
cannot let the law be ridiculed as it has been for such a long
time," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The first secretary of the Socialist Party Lionel Jospin today
expressed his solidarity and sympathy with Juppe over the bomb
attack.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Leaves Libya for Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan left Tripoli today for Nigeria, the last leg of his
controversial African tour.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister wrapped up his two-day official
visit to Libya after meeting with Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said at a joint press conference with visiting
Erbakan that he wanted to see a place also for the Kurdish
people under the sun, as the Turkish prime minister listened
in silence.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's visit to Libya also threatened to cause a government
crisis as Turkish Interior Minister Mehmet Agar refused to sign
the customary cabinet decision on the trip, which has an apparent
blessing from the military and security services.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan told reporters in Tripoli that Turkey has no Kurdish
problem, but has terrorist one, thus echoing the government's
resolve to stamp it out earlier.
</P>
<P>
He accused the West of planning to divide Turkey and slammed
the U.S.-sponsored sanctions against Libya for its alleged
support to international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During Erbakan's visit in Libya, the official talks centered
on overcoming the financial constraints plaguing Turkish
contractors' undertakings in Libya and their unpaid claims
totaling over 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said the two sides also agreed to boost the
annual trade volume to two billion dollars from the current level
of 623 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Libyan officials, Erbakan also sought new
stakes for Turkish contractors from Tripoli's plans for the
construction of 60,000 new apartments and 20,000 classrooms.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Acting PM: Government to Stick to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's acting Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that her
government will keep upholding democracy and secularism.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks after a meeting with President Suleyman
Demirel, who made a series of statements recently conspicuously
stressing the inviolability of secularism and pro-Western reforms
introduced by Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Fears about a gradual return to an Islam-based state, which
were sparked by Necmettin Erbakan's rise to power in July but died
down later through the Islamists' moderate performance in office,
were rekindled by pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) leader's foreign
policy initiatives to forge closer ties with Moslem Iran and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Ciller also dismissed the Western misgivings about
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's trip to Libya, saying
Turkey draws up its own foreign policy and there was nothing
wrong in Erbakan's visit to Libya.

<HEADLINE> French Economy Is Moving into Good Lane: Juppe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
said today that the French economy is moving into a good lane and
the growth rate in 1997 will be double that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said this on television in the "Seven-on-Seven" program
contributed to the debate of his economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Juppe, whose support rate dropped to the record low of 27
percent last week, said that one does not rule for winning high
support rate, but for what he feels to be correct for the country
and people.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, facing protests of employees of public
sector and private doctors for his austerity budget plan for 1997,
also promised the French people that their sacrifices will pay and
that it is not the moment to "slacken" yet.
</P>
<P>
He again described the unified monetary unit, the euro, which
France is striving to join, as "a fantastic trump" of France and
Europe, which he said would allow Europe to speak on the same
stand as the dollar and the yen in world financial market.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said that although there are still a lot of problems on
unemployment, the consumption this year will rise by 2 percent,
which he said would allow the creation of 100,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of adopting a proposal by former
prime minister Edouard Balladur to cut the rate of repayment of
social insurance, and vowed to carry on the reform in social
security which is aimed at cutting public spending in health
sector.
</P>
<P>
Three trade unions of private doctors have decided to stage a
strike on October 17 to protest the austerity plan in social
security sector by the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> EU Delegation Visits Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An European Union (EU)
delegation headed by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring
arrived in Israel this evening in a potentially controversial
trip to offer support for advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Immediately following his arrival, Spring held talks with
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on the current situation in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in light of the recent violent
confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Spring is also expected to meet with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat this evening, or
Monday in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet whether Spring will visit the Orient
House, PLO headquarters in Jerusalem, a move probably would
cause harsh objection from the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has already signaled that it would
strongly disapprove of any visit by the EU to the Orient House,
which is located in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It also raised the possibility that it would not meet the EU
troika delegation, made up of ministers of Ireland, Italy and
the Netherlands, current, past and next EU presidents, if the
delegation goes to the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Spring paid a visit to the PLO officials at the
Orient House, which led to the cancellation of a planned meeting of
Israeli President Ezer Weizman with the Irish foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of France and Italy are pressing to reaffirm
Europe's desire to play a role in rescuing the Middle East peace
process, which has been dominated by the mediation efforts of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
They said that they are disappointed that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's mediation has failed to make headway toward defusing
the current Middle East crisis.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Kuwaiti Voters Expected to Cast Votes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 107,169
eligible voters are expected to cast their votes in Kuwait's 1996
parliamentary elections scheduled Monday, an increase of 25,836
compared to the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
They will decide the fate of 230 candidates and elect the
eighth 50-member National Assembly in the Gulf country, which has
the only parliament in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait's election law, every Kuwaiti male at the
age of 21 years or more has the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwaiti females who account for 50.4 percent of
Kuwait's 708,000 population are still denied the right to
vote under the election law.
</P>
<P>
The normadic Bedoins also have no right to vote even if they
might have been living in the country for the whole life.
</P>
<P>
The election campaign was marked by elite intellectuals
contesting for parliamentary seats. A report by the official
Kuwaiti News Agency showed that 137 out of the 230 candidates are
university graduates, of whom 23 are Ph.D holders.
</P>
<P>
This year's campaign also witnessed the increasingly
collective political activities despite the fact that political
parties are not yet legalized in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to attract voters to their electoral centers,
candidates provided all kinds of facilities from air conditioning
to lavishing buffets to voters.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates also sought the help of known religious figures
or prominent economists and journalists to promote their
political views.
</P>
<P>
Some even worked out new ways to attract voters, such as
adopting a comic approach in their speeches or even including
musical and artistic shows in their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the Institute for Scientific Research said he
hopes the new parliament would help push forward the process of
democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some voters expressed their desire to see women voters cast their
votes in polling stations in next parliamentary elections four
years later.

<HEADLINE> GCC Calls for Strengthening Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The army chiefs of staff of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states today held a meeting to
discuss ways of enhancing military cooperation among them in
Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported that Omani Chief of Staff
General Khamis Bin Hameed Al-Kalbani, who presided over the
two-day meeting, said in his opening speech that regional and
international developments necessitate coordination among the
Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
KUNA quoted informed sources as saying that the meeting
discussed implementation of decisions adopted at the previous GCC
summit that agreed on expanding their military personnel, under
their joint forces "the Peninsula Shield" based in Saudi Arabia, to
25,000 from the present 8,000.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, which include Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, held many military
exercises within their own framework and with their western
allies since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The member states are among the world's largest arms buyers
and some have expressed concern over Iran's armament and Iraq's
threat.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also tackled the proposed "GCC Belt" project that
will link the radar systems of the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states hope to integrate their air defense facilities
and create a joint early warning system which will ring and
trigger a response if any member is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the ambitious plan is expected to be completed by
the end of the century and would need considerable funding.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the primary agreement, no practical steps
have been taken towards the implementation of the proposed
joint warning system.

<HEADLINE> China Actively Building Civil Servant System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's provisional regulation
on its civil servant system of October 1, 1993, stated the
categories and recruiting, appraisal, promotion, and dismissal
methods for government employees at all levels, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
It also introduced a system of rotation to ensure honesty and
good government.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels is now trying hard to implement the
system, which they believe could improve employee quality and help
them win the battle against corruption and low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"The civil servant system is an important part of China's
political structural reform, as well as a major indicator of the
success of the country's personnel system reform," said Hou
Jianliang, director of the Policy and Regulation Department of the
Ministry of Personnel .
</P>
<P>
"After its promulgation, the regulation got the attention of
both the central and local governments, where most of its measures
have been strictly followed," Hou noted.
</P>
<P>
Departments of the State Council, China's cabinet, and 25
provincial governments are close to finishing categorization and
personnel selection work.
</P>
<P>
The regulation requires that new civil servants be selected by
a public exam, and central authorities have held the exams
yearly since 1993, and 18 provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
All governments above the provincial level have set up a
standardization system and have started appraising employees' work.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 and 1995, almost all the employees of various
departments of the State Council went through the annual appraisal
process, and nearly 70 people failed to pass.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, a dismissal system was started
last year in the governments of Shenyang, Qingdao, Chongqing,
Beijing, and Shanghai cities, and Hainan, Hunan, Jiangsu, and
Guangzhou provinces, as well as in the public security system.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of people dismissed from
government jobs across the country was more than 3,300.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou, the civil servant system has won favorable
comments from all kinds of people, and the public recruiting exam,
appraisal, and dismissal system seem to be viewed quite favorably
by the public.
</P>
<P>
"Our ministry will speed up implementing the new system, to
build an honest and clean civil service team, one of quality and
efficiency, as soon as possible," he vowed.

<HEADLINE> GCC Army Chiefs of Staff Conclude Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Army Chiefs of Staff of
the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) concluded their 14th
closed-door meeting today in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia,
after making deliberations on a number of security issues.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the meeting, Omani Chief of Staff General Khamis
Bin Hameed Al-Kalbani, delivered a short speech at the conclusion
of the meeting, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
He said that what they discussed at the meeting "showed the
desire and determination of all to proceed toward more
cooperation and coordination among the GCC armed forces."
</P>
<P>
KUNA said Al-Kalbani declined to elaborate details about the
outcome of the meeting, which started on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to divulge issues to be referred to the
next defense ministerial council meeting scheduled for November
11-12 in Muscat, capital of Oman.
</P>
<P>
But media reports said the meeting discussed implementing
decisions of the previous summit, which agreed on expanding their
military personnel under their joint forces, "the Peninsula
Shield," based in Saudi Arabia to 25,000 from the present 8,000.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of staff also tackled the proposed "GCC Belt"
project, which will link the radar systems of the member
states and establish an early warning system to guard against
any foreign attack.
</P>
<P>
Despite the primary agreement, no practical steps have yet
been taken toward an implementation of the proposed joint
warning system.
</P>
<P>
However, Al-Kalbani said in his opening speech on Sunday
that "the GCC states have accomplished a lot in the field of
military cooperation," adding that the GCC leaders realize the
importance of such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The GCC consists of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Some 2 Million Crimes Reported in Russia in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikv said today that almost 2 million crimes were reported n
Russia in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Kulikov said grave crimes made up
the majority of all offenses.
</P>
<P>
The number of contract murders, criminal groupings and
terrorist organizations continues to grow, involving young people
and women, the minister said, adding that one third of all crimes
is committed by people affected by drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 5,000 criminal groupings were exposed and
criminal proceedings were instituted against 14,000 crime barons.
</P>
<P>
Police solved over 40 contract murders and about 200,000
economic crimes and confiscated 4,500 weapons, Kulikov said. In
his words, police also arrested 24 criminal groupings, solved over
3,000 crimes committed by them and exposed almost 235,000 people
who violated the passport regime in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about corruption in law enforcement agencies, Kulikov
said over 72,000 people have been sacked in 1996 for "negative
behavior" and 600 police officers have faced trial on charges of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that despite "the general complex crime
situation in the country," the number of premeditated murders,
thefts and robberies has decreased. The streets of Russian cities
have become safer, he pointed out.

KATHMANDU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of gastroenteritis
is prevailing in a western Nepali district as a record number of
885 patients have been brought to local hospitals in the last few
days, the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>

Many patients had to return home after basic treatment, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Corsican Separatists Claims Responsibility for Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Corsican separatists claimed
responsibility this afternoon for Saturday night's bomb attack on
Prime Minister Alain Juppe's mayoral office in Bordeaux in
southwest France.
</P>
<P>
In a statement sent to local police in Ajaccio, Corsica, the
outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) said,
"Claimings: Attack City Hall of Bordeaux 05/10/96," local media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, armed police discovered a huge arms cache in
southern Corsica, seizing a number of high caliber hand guns,
rifles, blank registration documents, and other documents, an
interior ministry communique issued this afternoon said.
</P>
<P>
Two people were arrested in the raid.
</P>
<P>
The claim by the FLNC could trigger a major crackdown on
Corsican separatists by French police and paramilitary
gendarmerie, who were ordered today by Juppe to do everything
necessary to identify the attackers and bring them to justice.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's bomb attack, which badly damaged Bordeaux's city
hall only hours after Juppe had left it, was an escalation of the
FLNC's 20-year bombing campaign for greater autonomy for the
Mediterranean holiday island.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Women Hold Sit-in for Political Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 7 (Xinhua) -- To keep their struggle for
political rights alive, Kuwaiti women held a peaceful sit-in
today as the national polling activities were under way on the
election day.
</P>
<P>
Under the current relevant law, Kuwaiti women are barred from
voting.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 women gathered in front of one electoral office
in Udailiya, while groups of women started to gather outside the
Social League where the sit-in is planned as the male voters
have been going to the polling stations to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
The women activists carried banners with them calling for
equality and underlining the constitutional legitimacy of women's
demands.
</P>
<P>
"Yes to equality ... no to segregation. The constitution
granted us the right and the law banned it" were seen on the
colorful slogans women carried above their head during the
sit-in.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Constitution grants equal rights and obligations
for women and men. But the election law of the country denied
the women their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, women constitute 50.4 percent of the population of
708,000. Registered male voters who were expected to cast their
votes today total 107,000, about 17 percent of the whole
population.
</P>
<P>
The male voters will select 50 persons from 230 candidates to
form the second post-Gulf War Kuwaiti parliament today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait University political sciences professor Dr. Maasouma
Mubarak said the aim behind the sit-in was to increase public
awareness of women's problems.
</P>
<P>
She said the sit-in reflects Kuwait's civilized and modern
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Bahia Dashti, a housewife, urged the future members of the
national assembly to pay due attention to the issue of women's
political rights, "especially that Kuwaiti women are politically
mature."
</P>
<P>
Sadika Ramadan, 50, said that her whole family were taking
part in the sit-in because they believe that it is time to grant
women full political rights.
</P>
<P>
She said her 70-years-old mother insisted on joining the
sit-in despite her poor health condition and expressed the hope
that the new parliament would seriously raise the issue.
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old student said she participated in the sit-in to
make sure that by the time she reaches the voting age, women
would then have full political rights.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the election campaign, activists for
women's rights have held sporadic protests to demand political
rights.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti women first demanded political rights 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of women activists submitted a memo to the
speaker of the parliament in December 1971, formally making a
demand for women's political rights after the first women's
conference in Kuwait, but it was rejected.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a new proposal in this regard was put forward but
was turned down again.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue of women's political rights in Kuwait was
raised by previous parliaments, and the 1992 parliament discussed
suggestions to give women the right to vote ahead of giving them
the right to be nominated to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah once said in a comment in regard to the
issue that "the door is not closed."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A Memorandum of Understanding on
Cooperation in Securities and Futures Regulation was signed today
in Beijing, another sign of international cooperation in
securities and futures for China.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, and Her Majesty's Treasury and the Securities and
Investment Board of the UK.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the Sino-British memorandum will provide a
means of co-operation between securities and futures regulators,
and will lay a foundation for Chinese enterprises to raise funds
in the British securities market, and mark a new stage of
co-operation between the Chinese and British securities markets,"
said Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the Chinese commission.
</P>
<P>
Raising funds on the international capital market is one of
China's major policies. The country first selected state
enterprises to issue B-shares, for overseas investors, on Chinese
stock exchanges in 1991, and 82 Chinese enterprises have issued B
shares, raising 2.8 billion US dollars worth of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
China began experimenting with issuing shares on overseas stock
markets in 1993, and 24 Chinese firms have issued shares in Hong
Kong and New York, raising a total of 4.4 billion US dollars worth
of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Angela Knight, economic secretary to the British treasury, said
she was "looking forward with expectation to the first listing on
the London Stock Exchange of a major Chinese company."
</P>
<P>
"The memorandum, with its focus on regulatory cooperation,
will play an important role in helping to ensure that our
respective financial markets are fair, honest and efficient," she
explained.

<HEADLINE> Delhi High Court Takes Charge of MPs' Bribery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi High Court today
took direct charge of a multi-crore bribery case by appointing
three men of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as officers
of the court responsible for the investigation into the MPs'
bribery case.
</P>
<P>
The court asked the three officers to directly report to the
court about the progress made in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"No one will interfere in the work of investigation of these
officers who will have the liberty to approach the court for any
direction of order if need so arises," said the court.
</P>
<P>
The high court fixed the next hearing of the case for October
17 and asked the officers to file a new report about the case as
it was not satisfied with an earlier report by the CBI.
</P>
<P>
The former government headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao allegedly
bribed four MPs to defeat the no-confidence motion against the Rao
government in July 1993. The four MPs have been arrested and put
into jail.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today called for cooperation with Turkey to maintain
security and tranquility in Iran's border areas.
</P>
<P>
While meeting outgoing Turkish Ambassador to Iran Ahmet Mithat
Balkan here today, Rafsanjani said that Iran attaches great
importance to protection of security and tranquility on its
border areas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president assured the Turkish ambassador that the
Iranian government does not allow any group to get involved
in anti-Turkey activities from Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani recommended more cooperation between the two
countries' border guards to safeguard their common border.
</P>
<P>
"There are enormous grounds for Iran-Turkey cooperation at
bilateral, regional and international levels and therefore they
should make optimum use of the existing capacities for this
purpose," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
There exists a border security problem between Iran and
Turkey. Tehran had accused Ankara of violating its territory by
launching missile and artillery attacks in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Balkan, however, said that his mission in Tehran has been the
most fruitful part of his diplomatic career.
</P>
<P>
He voiced willingness of Turkish officials to consolidate
relations with Tehran, especially in the wake of a visit to
Tehran by Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan last month.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention a latest Turkish spy case
during the meeting between Rafsanjani and Balkan.
</P>
<P>
Iran said on Sunday that it arrested a Turkish spy in
its northwestern city of Orumiyeh. However, it did not reveal
his name and identity.

<HEADLINE> Single Sperm Baby Girl Born in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's first case of single
sperm fertilization has proven to be successful, producing a baby
girl who was born in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The first such case took place in 1992, and it has turned out
to be a method of reproduction more advanced than the vitro
fertilization method, and one with a higher pregnancy rate.
</P>
<P>
The baby's parents are farmers in rural Guangdong. They were
unable to conceive for many years because the husband's sperm
count was low. The technique is now being used for many couples
suffering from sterility, and has a pregnancy rate as high as 27
percent.

<HEADLINE> Bank Slashes Zimbabwean Govt's Borrowing Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
today criticised the government for over-borrowing from the
private sector, which it said has limited local companies'
ability to invest.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the bank said the projected
government borrowing from local business community, which was
estimated at 527 million U.S. Dollars out of the total government
debt of 562 million U.S. Dollars so far this year, was too high
to maintain the country's sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"This is evidence enough to show that the government is
crowding out the private sector," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the government efforts to cut inflation,
which fell to a three-year low of 18 percent in August, would be
frustrated by excessive growth in money supply as the government
continues to rely more on local funds.

<HEADLINE> China Setting Up New Personnel System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Before 1978, all skilled workers
in China were referred to as "cadres" and were under state
control, no matter what they did -- government employees,
management and technical personnel in businesses, or people at
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The state looked after school enrollment, job arrangements,
management tasks, and set salaries and welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
Changes have taken place after more than a decade of reforms,
however, Hou Jianliang, director of the Policy and Regulations
Department under the Personnel Ministry, says: "Our personnel
system has already bid farewell to the traditional mode of the
planned economy, and is getting more accustomed to the socialist
market economy."
</P>
<P>
"The shortcomings of the old personnel system included a lack
of scientific categorization for cadre management,
over-centralization of power, and obsolete or incomplete
management methods," Hou explained.
</P>
<P>
The reforms' goals are to create an open and competitive
selection system for high-quality personnel, a vigorous personnel
management system, and making full use of everyone's talent.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he believes China's reforms have achieved the
following things:
</P>
<P>
A personnel system based on scientific categorization coming
into existence, and a competitive personnel management system.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels across China has implemented the civil
service system, and an overwhelming majority of enterprises and
institutions are autonomous in employment and personnel management.
</P>
<P>
A new salary system is in place in government and other
institutions, and a new social security system that covers
pensions, unemployment, and medical care is being set up.
</P>
<P>
Labor markets for skilled personnel have been developed and are
improving. China has over 3,700 agencies handling skilled
personnel, which each year help as many as one million people find
jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The new personnel management system has helped train a large
number of skilled personnel for the country's modernization drive,
greatly helping economic growth and social progress," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the number of professional and
technical personnel has gone from less than 8 million in 1978 to
more than 26.7 million today. The number of skilled personnel with
senior professional titles is 1.33 million.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Orders Speeding Up of Bomb Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today ordered the Paris Public Prosecutor's Office to speed up the
inquiry into Saturday night's bomb attack on his mayoral office in
Bordeaux in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
Juppe also announced the government will beef up security at
sensitive sites in Paris and other major French cities following a
meeting with Justice Minister Jacques Toubon and Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre this morning.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister has asked that everything should be put
into work to accelerate the progress of the on-going inquiry so
that the perpetrators of this attack can be identified and brought
to justice," said a communique issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast is just one more headache for Juppe who is
already facing numerous problems from unemployment to widening
differences within his parliamentary majority over his policies.
</P>
<P>
Although the attack happened in Bordeaux, it is the
anti-terrorist arm of the Paris Public Prosecutor's Office which
has the authority to carry out the inquiry, said Bordeaux's public
prosecutor Patrice Davost.
</P>
<P>
In a show of solidarity with Juppe, who is mayor of Bordeaux,
German President Roman Herzog will visit the city on October 18,
the German general consulate in Bordeaux announced.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the bomb attack
which badly damaged Bordeaux's city hall only hours after Juppe
had left it on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Investigators continue to hold the Canal Historique faction of
the banned Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) as the most
probable culprit, because the explosive used in the attack is
frequently used by the Corsican separatists.
</P>
<P>
The separatists have waged a 20-year bombing campaign for
greater autonomy for the Mediterranean holiday island.
</P>
<P>
However, the police inter-regional scientific laboratory in
Toulouse, which is charged with investigating the explosive and
its detonator, today refused to comment on speculation over who
was responsible.
</P>
<P>
French media quoted informed sources as saying that there had
been reports of possible terrorist attacks on Marseille and
Bordeaux last weekend, contradicting an earlier statement by Juppe
that the government had received no threat of an attack.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Marseille, Jean-Claude Gaudin, reportedly
reinforced security measures around public buildings in his city
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Francois Santoni, secretary general of the A Cuncolta, the
legal wing of the FLNC-Canal Historique, accused Juppe in August
of an attitude of contempt and racism toward the Corsican people.
</P>
<P>
A shaky truce started eight months ago is due to formally
expire next Saturday. But in recent weeks, separatists have
targetted homes and offices belonging to Juppe's allies on Corsica.
</P>
<P>
An observer on the island said that this latest bomb seemed to
signal the FLNC-Canal Historique was about to spread its campaign
to mainland France in a new round of fighting with the
government.

<HEADLINE> China's State of Environment Stable: Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate to an ESCAP
environment meeting said here today that China's environment state
has remained basically stable during the last one and a half
decades since it initiated reform and opening up to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Shukong, Chinese representative to the third session of
the committee on environment and sustainable development of the
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP),
said the stableness was largely due to the earnest enforcement of
environmental laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
It was also due to persistence in the nation's strategy of
"synchronizing the planning, implementation and development of
environmental construction, economic construction and urban and
rural construction," Zhong told the five-day session being
attended by over 70 representatives from 20 ESCAP members.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China also adhered to the "three major
policies -- prevention first; intensified management; and the
polluter pays."
</P>
<P>
During the said period, Zhong said, the sewage-treatment rate
has been improved from 32 percent to 76 percent on average among
industrial enterprises above the county (district) level.
</P>
<P>
Public hygiene and sanitation in urban areas have also been
improved, and the nation's forest-covered rate has been raised
from 8.6 percent in 1949 to the present 13.92 percent, including
about 35 million hectares of man-made forests and
eco-shelter-belts resulting from the sustained nationwide efforts
at large-scale afforestation, which has been acclaimed as "the
green great wall".
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, however, environmental pollution tends to
spread in a number of rural areas, especially in a number of
small-scale township enterprises, notably tiny paperworks with
annual output of under 5,000 tons, which discarge pollutants
causing pollution of rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
While some of those polluting mills have been ordered to close
down, others have been requested to incorporate environmental
protection measures with deadlines set under relevant laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
In short, he said, Chinese government departments at all levels
will exert greater efforts to integrate environmental and
developmental concerns in the course of implementing China's
'agenda 21', in line with the 'agenda 21' adopted at the UN
conference on environment and development (UNCED) in Rio de
Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
At the five-day session which opened here today, the committee
is expected to consider emerging issues in the implementation of
agenda 21, in particular environment policies, energy development,
water and mineral resources and space technologies.
</P>
<P>
The committee are also expected to deal with the issue of
funding for environment protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China has never been a threat to
the world's grain and food safe supply, Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun said today at an international symposium on China's grain
and agriculture: prospects and policy.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the position and views of the Chinese government
on its grain and agriculture, Jiang said that the country will
continue its efforts to safeguard the world's grain and food
supply.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese are fully capable of supplying
themselves with enough food and clothing, and that future
developments in China's agriculture will demonstrate this.
</P>
<P>
China has had some success in developing its agriculture over
the past 47 years, and especially in the past 18, when the country
introduced the policy of reforms and opening up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also explained the potential and opportunities of
agricultural development in China and explained the major steps
China will take in the future for sustained development of its
agriculture and rural economy.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Remains Strong in International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Mines and Energy
Minister IB. Sudjana said here today the price of oil in the
international market will remain strong until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The price of crude oil is indeed being affected by the
political situation in the Middle East," Sudjana said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the increasing demand from the United States
and other developed countries, not to mention decreasing
productions in the North Sea, may result in reduced supplies in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
World oil-producing states, which strictly follow the oil
production ceiling, also contribute to reduced oil supplies, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil in the world market stands at 22 US
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
On the plan to increase the selling price of premium-grade
gasoline in the country, Sudjana said he has yet to receive a
report of a private firm which manages premium-grade gasoline
production.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there are often rumors of a rise in the
price of premium-grade gasoline, which has a limited market, he
said, adding that a plan to increase oil prices is subject to the
relevant ministers' approval.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Bargains With Russia on Military Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Georgia's President Eduard
Shevardnadze said today the Georgian parliament would not ratify a
treaty allowing Russian military bases on its territory unless
Russia helped his country regain the breakaway region of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Shevardnadze stressed that the treaty was
linked to the "restoration of territorial integrity" of Georgia
with Russian help.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia held the key to solving the Abkhazian problem.
</P>
<P>
He described as "an extremely well-balanced" document "based
solely on principle" last week's parliamentary resolution
insisting that Russian troops stationed in Georgia either bring
Abkhazia back to Georgia or get out.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Russian leaders to take a definitive line
toward "the separatist regime in Abkhazia and sever any links with
it."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that establishing fully-fledged strategic
relations between Russia and Georgia is in the interests of both
nations and that relations with Russia remain paramount for
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea region of Abkhazia, sandwiched between Georgia
and Russia, unilaterally declared independence from Georgia in
1993. Separatists, backed by mercenaries and arms from Russia's
northern Caucasus region, drove out Georgian government troops in
a lightning campaign.
</P>
<P>
Georgia accused Russian military units of backing the
separatists.
</P>
<P>
Georgia joined the Commonwealth of Independent States and gave
Moscow rights to use Georgian military bases in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which is trying to mediate in the three-year-old
conflict, has a 3,000-strong peacekeeping force close to the
border between the province and Georgia proper.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Palestinian Demand for Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel has turned down a
Palestinian requirement for resuming joint military patrols in
the West Bank, Israeli security sources were quoted as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Israel refused to resume the patrols at this stage because
the Palestinian security forces "have failed to draw conclusions
from their recent bloody conflicts with Israeli soldiers," Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said Israel demanded that the Palestinian
side take steps to punish those policemen who "had shot at
Israeli soldiers" in the bloodshed in late September, during
which 15 Israeli soldiers along with some 60 Palestinians were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian joint patrols which had been conducted
under the Oslo agreements and regarded as a way to build mutual
trust between the Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police, were
halted immediately late last month in the wake of the violence.
</P>
<P>
While the joint patrols in the Gaza Strip resumed as soon as
the situation there was calmed, those in the West Bank are still
put on hold, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused the Palestinian policemen of "turning their
weapons at their Israeli counterparts" in the joint patrols,
thus creating deep mistrust and suspicion between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak had expressed doubt
whether the situation which had existed before the crisis could
be restored.
</P>
<P>
"The situation, in which it is not clear when there is
cooperation and when they are shooting at our soldiers, is
impossible and unacceptable," he said in the wake of last
month's violence.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Israel is demanding for creation of a buffer
zone between Israeli troops and Palestinian forces at friction
points so as to prevent demonstrators from approaching Israeli
outposts and deter further attacks by the Palestinian
policemen. The Palestinian side has rejected such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israel army today further lifted the closure
imposed on the territories. The internal closure was lifted in

<HEADLINE> India's Supreme Court Not to Monitor Cases Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court today made
it clear that it would not monitor two cases being dealt with by
the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Trial Court
against former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
It said that it would not monitor the CBI investigation into
the St Kitts forgery and L. Pathak cheating cases against Rao for
his involvement in the two criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that charge sheets have been filed by the
CBI in the competent court, it is that court which is now to deal
with the case in accordance with law, the Supreme Court said.
</P>
<P>
It was now within the domain of the concerned court to give any
direction considered necessary for further investigation, if any,
or to proceed against any other person who also appears to have
committed any offense in that transaction, the Supreme Court
added.
</P>
<P>
In the CBI's charge sheets, former prime minister Rao was
involved in the 100,000 US dollar cheating case in 1983 and in
forging documents to show that former prime minister V.P. Singh
and his son had opened a secret account at St Kitts Islands in the
West Indies in 1988.

ISLAMABAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani government has
established a child-care foundation in the country for the welfare
of working children, sources from the Pakistani Export Promotion
Bureau (EPB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the foundation will deal particularly
with the welfare issue of children engaged in the carpet and sport
goods industry.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has been set up to counter the propaganda and
so-called concern of the western world regarding denial of health
and educational facilities to the working children in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will be governed by a board of governors, which
includes some eminent Pakistani human right activists.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the EPB has been busy in dealing with the
child labor issue in the carpet manufacturing industry in Pakistan
and the vicious media propaganda which the industry is being
subjected to in the West.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, a series of meetings were also held between
the EPB and the Pakistan Carpet Manufactures and Exporters
Association as well as Sports Goods Manufacturers Association.

<HEADLINE> HK to Play Bigger Role in Infrastructure in China's Inland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will have an
increasing role to play in the infrastructure development in
China's inland areas in the coming years, Victor Fung, chairman of
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international seminar jointly organized in Hong
Kong by TDC and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) of
 the United States, Fung said that over the past 15 years, Hong
Kong companies have already taken a strong lead in building new
roads, bridges, tunnels, ports and power plants that support the
rapid economic growth in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that under China's ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000),
greater emphasis was being placed on balanced regional
development, including infrastructure projects in interior
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The ninth Five-Year Plan is forecast by the World Bank to need
between 289 and 370 billion US dollars in funds by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's service economy, in particular its
financial services sector, was set to play a vital role in an era
when the inland areas would seek more capital funding for
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that five years ago, there were no listed companies on
the Hong Kong stock exchange specifically for the purpose of
investing in infrastructure projects in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
But today, he said that there are at least 10 listed
infrastructure companies which, by market capitalization, are all
in the stock market's top 100.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was no better place than Hong Kong for
international business leaders to meet their counterparts from
China's inland areas on the important subject of building China's
21st century infrastructure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Construction Minister
Hou Jie today was given a special award for his outstanding
contribution to human settlement work by the United Nations for
helping tens of millions of Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the UN prize is given annually for
achievements by groups or individuals in housing construction.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Tangshan, Shenzhen, and Shanghai were given the
award for reconstruction work and renovation of old or
earthquake-damaged buildings.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the prize, given on World Housing Day,
shows that China has had some successes in housing construction
and in improving housing conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past five years, a total of 1.3 billion
sq. m. of urban housing has been built, with average per capita
living space hitting 7.9 sq. m., and another 1.2 billion sq. m. of
housing is to be built in the coming five years, to reach the goal
of 9 sq. m. per capita by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that, in spite of the achievements,
China still has 4 million households with average per capita
living space of less than 4 sq. m., and still needs to renovate 34
million sq. m. of old housing.
</P>
<P>
The task of improving housing conditions is immense, the
minister said, and the government and all departments concerned
will spare no effort to raise as much money as possible to go on
improving housing conditions for Chinese citizens.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Wraps up Shuttle Diplomacy in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher concluded his shuttle diplomacy here today
after meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Levy, Christopher urged the foreign
minister to take a high profile in peace talks with the
Palestinians so to avoid the collapse of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added that Levy would meet with Palestinian senior official
Abu Mazen if the talks face difficulties in the future. Mazen is
the deputy to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Christopher and Levy also discussed the possible locations for
future Israeli-Palestinian talks, including Cairo, Taba and
Eilat. The Palestinian side preferred they would be held in
Cairo, but Levy said Israel proposed the Erez crossing, the
current place of bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Levy promised Christopher that he would discuss the matter
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later on.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Christopher said that
he was assured that Israel did not seek to reopen negotiation of
the signed agreements. He added that the talks that resumed
overnight would be non-stop until reaching a solution.
</P>
<P>
"The United States places great emphasis on the statements of
both the prime minister and foreign minister that they do not
intend to modify or rescind the existing agreements but that they
will move to implement them," Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Christopher also held talks with
President Ezer Weizman to discuss the peace talks held at the Erez
Crossing. Israeli government confirmed today Weizman would meet
with Arafat at his Caesarea home to discuss the current situation
in the wake of the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Levy, Christopher departed the country
for his African tour, concluding his shuttle diplomacy here aimed
at rescuing the fragile peace process which has been dealt a
severe blow by recent Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Christopher tried to urge both Israelis and Palestinians to
achieve tangible results in their negotiations to prevent the
collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Christopher also traveled to the Gaza Strip to
hold meeting with Arafat. Earlier Sunday, he also held talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Christopher stressed the urgency of achieving quick progress
in Israeli-Palestinian talks so to rescue the peace process. While
stating the importance of Israel's honoring the signed
agreements, Christopher expressed understandings of Israel's
demand for making security adjustments within the framework of the
agreements, especially on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed talks in the
framework of the joint steering committee Sunday night at the
Erez crossing in the Israel-Gaza border. Top on the agenda
was the Hebron redeployment, which is the first stumbling
block of any progress.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreeed to set up three sub-committees to
discuss respectively the Hebron issue, security arrangements and
economic affairs. The sub-committees would convene late today.
</P>
<P>
It seems the gap between the two sides remains wide as the
Palestinian side insisted Israel should implement existing
agreements "accurately and honestly", while Israel demands certain
security adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Israel justified its demand for security arrangements, citing
that Palestinian security forces killed 15 Israeli soldiers in
the clashes last month with weapons given by Israeli
government.

<HEADLINE> Delhi High Court Reserves Order on Former PM's Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi high court, which
began hearing here today on former prime minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao's plea for anticipatory bail in the St. Kitts forgery case,
reserved its order and protected him of any arrest till the
pronouncement of the order in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The court also passed similar orders on the anticipatory bail
pleas of the other two accused in the case, former union minister
K.K. Tewary and former enforcement director K.L. Verma, against
whom the chief metropolitan magistrate(CMM), Prem Kumar, in a
Delhi court last Friday issued non-bailable arrest warrants.
</P>
<P>
The central bureau of investigation (CBI) opposed the
anticipatory bail applications saying that the high court should
not entertain these at all.
</P>
<P>
In its earlier charge sheet, the CBI accused Rao and the other
two of forging documents to purportedly show that former prime
minister V.P. Singh and his son opened a secret account at the St.
Kitts islands in the West Indies and deposited over 20 million US
dollars in it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Arguing for Rao, his counsel R.K. Anand today said that the
trial court has already made up its mind against the former prime
minister and it would be a futile exercise to approach the CMM's
court for bail.

<HEADLINE> Two Scientists Share Nobel Prize for Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nobel Prize for Medicine
was today awarded jointly to an Australian and a Swiss researcher
for their work on the human immune system.
</P>
<P>
Research carried out in the 1970s by Peter Doherty from
Australia and Rolf Zinkernagel on how the immune system recognizes
virus-infected cells was "highly relevant" to the fight against
multiple sclerosis, diabetes and certain kinds of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Their discovery has shed new light on "the general mechanisms
used by the cellular immune system to recognize both foreign
micro-organisms and self molecules," said the medicine panel of
the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery relates both to efforts to strengthen the immune
response against invading micro-organisms and certain forms of
cancer and to efforts to diminish the effects of auto-immune
reactions in inflamatory diseases, such as rheumatic conditions,
multiple sclerosis and diabetes."
</P>
<P>
Doherty and Zinkernagel carried out their research work in
1973-1975 at the John Curtin School of Medical Research in
Canberra, Australia. They found that white blood cells must
recognize both the virus and certain self molecules in order to
kill the virus-infected cells.
</P>
<P>
This theory constituted a foundation for further understanding
the specificity of the cellular immune system and gave an impetus
to later immunological research.
</P>
<P>
Peter Doherty, born in 1940 in Australia, is now chairman of
the Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital in the United States and adjunct professor of the
Departments of Pathology and Pediatrics of University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Zinkernagel, 52, is now director of the Institute of
Experimental Immunology in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Nobel Prizes, named after Swedish chemist Alfred Bernhard Nobel
who died in 1896, were set up in 1901 in the fields of chemistry,
physics, medicine, peace and literature. The prizes are awarded to
outstanding scholars around the globe on December 10 each year,
the anniversary of Nobel's death.

BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) held its sixth session on October 6 and 7 in Beijing,
with British Hong Kong government and Airport Authorities giving
briefings on progress at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The panel also heard a report on progress on the 1997-98
budget, given by Chen Zuo'er, Chinese representative of the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. The panel also discussed assets
to be left for the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Panel members said they hope that airport authorities will
improve management of construction and that British Hong Kong
government departments fulfill their supervisory role to ensure
that the airport is completed in April, 1998, and stays within the
original budget.
</P>
<P>
The panel also said they hope that China and Britain will
continue to co-operate and compile a budget that considers various
sectors' interests and leaves sufficient assets to the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The panel discussed the reaction of various parts of Hong Kong
society to a regional development strategy that was introduced by
British Hong Kong government officials at the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Because it will have a significant effect on Hong Kong's future
development and some topics have not be thoroughly studied, the
panel suggested that the British Hong Kong government prolong the
consultation period for six months at least.

expansion of the gold market in the Chinese mainland, Raymond Chan
Fat Chu, president of Hong Kong's Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange
Society, said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to mark the 86th anniversary of the society, Chan
said that Hong Kong, as a major financial center in Asia, is also
an important transit center for gold and gold-jewellery between
China and the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the year of 1997 approaching, the role is
expected to be more important.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has become the second largest gold market
in terms of demand in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that located in the right time zone, the Hong Kong
market completes the 24-hour gold trading link with London and New
York. It is for these reasons that Hong Kong's gold market is used
by local and international bullion traders, jewelers and
professional investors for arbitrage, trade and hedging their
positions in gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
In each of the past ten years, Hong Kong imported an average of
270 tons of gold and is ranked alongside the major gold markets,
New York, London and Zurich, he added.

<HEADLINE> International Congress on Respiratory Diseases Ends in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Doctors warn that smoking,
deterioration of the environment, and ignorance may cause more
suffering from respiratory illness, according to the Fourth
Congress of the Asian Pacific Society of Respirology, which ended
here today.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that people should pay more attention to
prevention and treatment of respiratory illnesses, especially lung
diseases. There are 150 million asthmatics worldwide, for example,
and the number is increasing in most countries at a rate of 20 to
50 percent every decade.
</P>
<P>
In rural parts of China, where 900 million people live, chronic
respiratory ailments remain the major cause of death. They are the
third biggest killer among urban Chinese, after cardiovascular
diseases, and malignant tumors, according to Prof. Zhao Mingwu of
the No. 3 Hospital of Beijing Medical University.
</P>
<P>
"People should watch out for the danger of smoking,
environmental pollution, and their own ignorance of diseases, even
though new technology and medicines are being developed to combat
the diseases," Zhao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, also the secretary of the organizing committee of this
four-day congress, said the congress was a success.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we've reached the goal of promoting medical
research in Asia-Pacific nations and giving Chinese medical
experts opportunities to exchange research results with their
foreign counterparts," Zhao noted.
</P>
<P>
There were 25 special presentations and seven special reports
at the congress, on topics such as bronchial asthma and chronic
obstructive lung diseases. Some 40 experts from the United States
and Europe were invited to give special reports on the latest
researches on respiratory diseases. More than 1,400 specialists
from the Asia-Pacific region participated, providing 1,600
papers.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine presidential
palace has assured Nur Misuari, governor of the autonomous region
of Muslim Mindanao, here today of its "full support" for his
drive against kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Aguirre, chief of the presidential management, said
after Misuari met with President Ramos that the national police
and the armed forces all support his fighting against kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed that the governor will be fully supported by
the national police and the military in his efforts to maintain
peace and order in the Mindanao areas, especially with respect to
providing all the necessary measures to address the problem of
kidnapping in the area," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
He said the president "emphasized" to Misuari that under the
law, the regional command of the national police and the armed
forces in Mindanao "are under his operational control and
supervision".
</P>

Misuari, who also lead the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), said a day before that he would seek the presidential
palace's nod in forming a special task force manned by MNLF
members to run after kidnap-for-ransom rings that have long
plagued the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out today that he would try to solve the
kidnapping problem through peaceful means.

kidnapping cases in which 148 people were kidnapped in the first
eight months of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- With the deepening of the
educational exchanges, some 1,340 students from Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao have come to study at colleges in Beijing and other
cities in the country, according to a source from the State
Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
Among these students, 1,163 were recruited after examinations,
while 177 were selected on the basis of recommendations from their
schools, and did not take examinations.
</P>
<P>
The SEC source said that this year, students from Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao have chosen a wider scope of majors, which include
traditional Chinese medicine, law, economy, ancient Chinese
literature, arts, and politics. The studies of traditional Chinese
medicine and other traditional Chinese culture are favorites,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the education levels of the new students are
increasing, and more postgraduates have been recruited.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide a favorable environment to the students
from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, the SEC has decreed that
colleges must carefully handle the recruitment work and strengthen
teaching and daily life management in order to guarantee
high-quality education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight state departments, including the SEC, jointly
issued a circular this May requiring relevant colleges and
departments to provide any necessary assistance to students for
their schoolwork, daily life, travelling, and obtaining residency.
</P>
<P>
At present, students recruited by Qinghua University have begun
their courses, and are satisfied with their curricula.
</P>
<P>
Nip Fai, a student from Hong Kong said he believes he will gain
a lot through five years' study in Qinghua, as the university
improves the overall ability of the students, and is also a
world-famous university with a history of 85 years.
</P>
<P>
"Qinghua University seemed unattainable for me in the past, but
since I have the chance to study my favorite major, architecture,
here, I feel very lucky," said Tai Kam Fai, a student from Macao.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Position Over Nigeria's Democratization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has refuted the statement
made by Canada at the U.N.general assembly conference last week
over its democratization programs, saying that it was riddled
with ''malicious falsehood''.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, according to local press reports today,
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy renewed the call for
multilateral action against the Nigerian government and for the
international community to fight for democracy in Nigeria,
Burundi and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction, Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi
said the Canadian foreign minister's call is against the
principle of sovereign equality of states, non-interference in
the internal affairs of other states and peaceful co-existence,
which has long been regarded as the basis for international
relations.
</P>
<P>
Tom Ikimi noted that ''these hallowed principles'' are being
eroded by some powerful states. Concern about human rights should
be carefully defined to recognizing the right of states to curb
excesses which threatened their security, as well as the safety
of its citizens, he added.
</P>
<P>
''We must...guard against the use of human rights as a pretext
for advancing the individual or collective interests of one
section of the international community against the other,'' he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tom Ikimi held that the U.N. has been misled by erroneous
reports in some sections of the international community into
adopting a resolution of last year on human rights situation in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister said that the smooth conduct of
the local government election and political party registration in
Nigeria have demonstrated the country's transition to civil rule
program is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria and Canana have been sour since
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth after it killed nine
Ogoni minority activists last November. Canada has been calling
for further sanctions against Nigeria despite the disagreement of
the Commonwealth ministerial action group, which was set up to
monitor Nigeria's democratization process and recommend whether
further sanctions are necessary.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria closed down early last month its high commission in
Canada because of ''financial reasons''.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Developed Countries to Honor Aid Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation here
today urged developed countries to honor their commitments on
funding resources to help developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the environment committee meeting of the Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Chinese
representative Zhong Shukong said that some developed countries
failed to reach the official development assistance (OFA) target.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics published in 1996 showed that the OFA offered
by developed countries on the average has fallen further to 0.29
percent of their gross national product (GNP), except Norway,
Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands whose OFA has reached
or exceeded the 0.7 percent target, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Under the global consensus reached at the Rio Earth Summit in
1992, developed countries reaffirmed their commitments to reach
the U.N. target of setting aside 0.7 percent of their gross
national product (GNP) to assist developing countries, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
To the extent that they have not yet achieved that target,
developed countries agreed to augment their aid programs in order
to reach that target as soon as possible and to ensure prompt and
effective implementation of the 'agenda 21' reached at the Rio
earth summit in 1992, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Some developed countries have agreed to reach the target by the
year 2000 and others have agreed to make their best efforts to
increase the level of their official development aid, Zhong added.
</P>
<P>
The funding issue is one of the three outstanding issues that
need to be resolved in keeping with the consensus reached at the
Rio earth summit, stated Zhong.
</P>
<P>
Zhong also called for developed countries to promote their
transfer of environmentally-sound technology on favorable or
non-commercial terms to developing countries, saying that
"technologies being privately owned" should not be used again as
excuses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zhong stressed that environmental and social
issues should not be linked with international trade.

KAMPALA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's traders today ended
their week-long strike against the government's move to collect
the Value Added Tax (VAT) after seeing little hope to win their

<P>
Shops and markets in capital Kampala opened following a
televised speech to the nation delivered last Saturday by
President Yoweri Museveni who threatened to revoke strikers'

</P>
<P>
Museveni said the government is determined to implement the
decision because collecting VAT is "necessary" to help Uganda

"There is no hope to have the government scrap the VAT,"
said a shopkeeper who opened his shop today.

Consumer commodities remained expensive in the markets.
Traders said they had bought the goods at high prices during the

KUALA LUMPUR, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it
will accept whatever decision by the International Court of

Malaysia and Indonesia earlier today agreed to settle the
territorial dispute through the ICJ during the talks between

Suharto at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport near here.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that whatever decision, whether it favors Malaysia or
Indonesia, is not the issue because we have agreed to accept the
ICJ decision," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuala Lumpur-Jakarta ties would not be affected if the
ICJ decided that the two islands belonged to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that we must maintain the good relations
between Indonesia and Malaysia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries must prepare the documents to support
their claims for submission to the ICJ.

of 3.42 billion US dollars, while it continues to accelerate the
development of port construction and shipping service.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ningbo has successfully contracted with the
world-renowned Esso Corporation to invest 29.30 million US dollars
in producing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and 29 million US
dollars to produce lubrication oil.
</P>
<P>
Other overseas corporations interested include ARCO, Pepsi,
AMOCO of the United States as well as Samsung, Daewoo, LG of the
Republic of Korea. Projects involve LPG collecting, beverage
production, electricity generation, and shipbuilding and repairing.
</P>
<P>
The local government has also offered additional training to
employees in foreign-funded enterprises and relieved investors of
some unreasonable charges.
</P>
<P>
Ideas and means for attracting investment have changed in
Ningbo as well, which have brought the city more direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase project of Ningbo's Beilun Power Plant, which
started in May, has loaned 550 million US dollars through the
World Bank, accounting for one third of the total investment.
</P>
<P>
Another 30 million US dollars have been channeled into the city
from banks in Hong Kong and France, for projects involving raw
material production and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the January-July period show that the city's
1,448 overseas-funded enterprises yielded an output value of 13
billion yuan (about 1.6 billion US dollars), with total sales and
profits of 12 billion and 720 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The three figures go up 24, 29, and 84 percent, respectively,
against the corresponding ones from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Britain Turns Less Attractive to HK Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- More Hong Kong young people
are opting to study in the United States and Australia, instead of
Britain, which used to be the more popular destination.
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled by the Education Department show that about
10,100 local students have been granted visas to study overseas in
the first eight months of 1996, the South China Morning Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The United States ranked first in attracting 3,800 Hong Kong
students, followed by Australia and Canada. Britain, once the most
attractive place for Hong Kong people to study overseas, drew
only some 1,800 students, representing a 17-percent drop from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Many students prefer Australia and North America because of
lower tuition and cost of living, said the English
newspaper. Besides, Britain will be no different from other
countries after 1997 when Hong Kong is returned to China.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Hong Kong students are now applying for
master or doctoral degree programs in the mainland. There were
140 applicants in the academic year of 1997, compared to 17 in
1991, according to the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Advanced technology has helped
Guangdong Province strengthen its police force and solve more than
1,700 criminal cases in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
To improve work efficiency, Guangdong established 28 security
posts on roads that connect with other provinces. Most of its
cities and counties have organized police patrols, and have opened
"110" telephone service and public security centers.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid 1980s, Guangdong has set up cooperative systems
between different police forces and regions to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Guangdong police have spent 120 million yuan (about
15 million US dollars) for advanced equipment and instruments to
improve their technical levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more efforts have been made to develop information
services. More than 20 percent of criminal cases have been solved
with the help of detectives.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Seminar on China's Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on
China's infrastructure development opened here today with the
participation of officials from China's southern provinces and
foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Realizing China's Potential: World Class Models for
Infrastructure Development," the seminar is to focus on
infrastructure development in four areas -- mobility, energy,
communications and water supply.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) of the United
States, the seminar is to look into models of successful
infrastructure development in China and in the world and assess
their relevance to China at present and in the future.
</P>
<P>
Yao Dinghai, deputy director of the Planning Commission of
Guangdong Province, said Hong Kong's investment in Guangdong has a
multi-faceted impact on the province's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that up to now, Guangdong has utilized overseas capital
amounting to 53 billion U.S. dollars, of which three-fourths come
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's large-scale investment in Guangdong has
greatly promoted the province's industrialization and economic
progress.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has contributed to
each other's prosperity and development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Yu Jinman, director of the Planning Commission of Fujian
Province, said Hong Kong is an important gateway for Fujian to
enter the Southeast Asian and international markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that from now on, Fujian will not only need to boost
cooperation with Hong Kong, it will also need to get support from
Hong Kong as an international financial, trading and
transportation hub.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, leading officials from the planning commissions
of Hainan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also
expressed their willingness to increase inputs into infrastructure
construction through cooperation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lester Thurow of MIT, a senior operations advisor of
the World Bank and high-ranking officials of TDC also exchanged
views on infrastructure development in China.

<HEADLINE> World's Population Will Peak in 84 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The world's population will peak
at around 10.6 billion in 2080 and then decline, as the birth rate
all over the world is falling faster than expected, a report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the report, to be published by
Earthscan here on Wednesday, life expectancy in the Third World
will probably increase by only about one year per decade.
</P>
<P>
The findings are believed to be from the most sophisticated
assessment yet of the world's population changes.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the survey have gathered predictions about
fertility, death and migration rates and put them together in
every possible combination, leading to 4,000 different
scenarios. They have been able to attach a probability to each set
of figures for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the predictions show that the population, which
was 5.8 billion in 1995, will never go higher than 10.6
billion. By the end of the 21st century it will be 10.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Lutz, of the International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, led the study.

<HEADLINE> Cities Drawing More People Despite Worsening Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Living conditions in cities are
worsening as more and more people, especially those in developing
countries, are flowing into urban areas, said the United Nations
today.
</P>
<P>
The global urban population will reach 3.2 billion by the year
2000, with most of them in the developing world, showed data
released by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"Cities and towns are thus seriously affected by poverty and
its effects of overcrowding, environmental degradation, inadequate
housing and lack of infrastructure services," said officials from
the U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Poor people in cities have to live under dangerous and
environmentally degrading circumstances, it added.
</P>
<P>
The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction said
cities and city dwellers are at unprecedented risk to floods,
earthquakes, hurricanes, landslides and other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
It blamed these risks on the high density of population in
slums and squatter settlements in cities in the developing world,
the use of hazardous ground, such as unstable slopes, reclaimed
land and river banks, and the concentration of poorly-constructed
and badly-maintained buildings.

<HEADLINE> No Significant Alleviation in Sub-Saharan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank said there has no
significant alleviation in poverty in Sub-Saharan countries
though the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have
grown by four percent in some of them last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its annual report of 1996 that the
Sub-Saharan countries must realize an annual income growth
ranging from six to seven percent, the poverty will be reduced
significantly.
</P>
<P>
''In most of the continent, growth is not nearly sufficient to
make a dent in poverty reduction, and despite recent
improvements, Africa's GDP and export growth rates, savings and
investment levels, and social indicators remain below those of
other regions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
While some of the countries in the region experienced growth
rates of five percent or more in 1995, Zambia, Zaire, Zimbabwe,
Somalia and others registered declines, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Lesotho, Malawi and Uganda registered a five percent
or more growth and altogether 30 countries' economies were
improved in Africa in 1995, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough May End Chemotherapy Side-effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Geneticists believe that they
have found a way to beat the harmful side-effects of chemotherapy,
which often leaves cancer patients more ill than before going into
hospital, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
For years, doctors' efforts to help patients have been blocked
because healthy cells are destroyed along with tumours during
treatment, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Now the cells, particularly vulnerable bone marrow, could
survive, preventing the chances of secondary tumours and
increasing the likelihood of recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The theory is quite simple. If you sprayed your whole garden
with weed killer, you would kill weeds and flowers. But if the
flowers could be altered to produce a substance that protected
them, only the weeds would die. We've managed to get cells to
produce such a substance so that chemotherapy only affects the
cells we want to kill," the newspaper quoted Joseph Rafferty, of
Manchester's Paterson Institute, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have developed a mutant version of the protein ATase
which repairs DNA inside cancers and thwarts the benefits of
chemotherapy. The research could lead to treatments that leave
healthy cells unharmed while destroying less resistant cancer
cells.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Peace Process in Danger: Lebanese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz has warned that the Middle East peace process was in
danger as a result of the Israeli government's policy of refusing
peace, a Beirut conservative daily reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
He made the warning during an interview with the media upon
his arrival in the capital city of Beirut Sunday night after
attending the 51st General Assembly of the United Nations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
On his way home, the Lebanese foreign minister paid a brief
visit to Paris and held a meeting with his French counterpart
Herve de Charette.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz told reporters at the Beirut International Airport that
on the sidelines of the general assembly, he held meetings with
foreign ministers of Arab, Islamic and other countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the atmosphere dominating the U.N. general
assembly was "the atmosphere of the Middle East conflict and what
is happening in Palestine (Palestinian self-ruled areas) as a
result of the policy followed by the present Israeli government."
</P>
<P>
A recent Washington summit of U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Jordan's King of Hussein, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat was also
 a prominent topic discussed during the assembly, Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
It was "clear" that Netanyahu's policy was to refuse the
peace process, he said, and this policy had been expressed by
the Israeli prime minister "officially and in details in a
communique issued by the Israeli government upon its formation."
</P>
<P>
"So what is now taking place is not surprising," the foreign
minister pointed out, "the provocations such as the opening of a
tunnel under the Al Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) or the (Israeli)
military movements are only an expression of Netanyahu's policy
and his faiths."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the present situation is extremely
complicated because of this policy and the peace process, which
was deadlocked for (because of) this policy, is in danger,"
Boueiz underlined.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that after the upcoming American
presidential elections in November the new U.S. Administration
would make efforts in order to set the peace process on "the
desired track."

<HEADLINE> Appeal Trial of Former South Korean Presidents Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The appeal trial of former South
Korean presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo and their
followers was held at the Seoul High Court today over verdicts
handed down against them for mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
Chun, Roh and 14 former South Korean officers, including the
former Commander of the Army 20th Division, Park Jun-byung, who
was acquitted by the Seoul District Court, were present at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, the Seoul District Court sentenced Chun to death
and Roh to 22 years and six months in prison respectively on
charges of mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
It also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million
dollars for the bribes they had allegedly accumulated while in
office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sentences ranging from four to 10 years were given
to 13 former South Korean officers who helped the two
ex-presidents in their quest for power.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh as well as their followers appealed their cases to
the Seoul High Court on August 30 as they refused to accept the
verdicts made by the Seoul District Court.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from the roles played by
the two former presidents and their cronies in the military coup
on December 12, 1979, and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation
until February 1988. He was succeeded by his friend, Roh, who
stepped down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
During the proceeding which lasted more than an hour today,
Judge Kwon Sung accepted most of the 40 witnesses requested by
both the defense and the prosecution, including former President
Choi Kyu-hah and former Army Chief of Staff Chung Seung-hwa.
</P>
<P>
According to South Korean law, the appeal trial has to be
completed within four months after the Seoul District Court handed
down the sentence.
</P>
<P>
If the defendants refuse to accept the verdicts made by the
Seoul High Court, they can appeal their cases to the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
However, a final decision by the supreme court has to be made
within four months of the completion of the appeal trial.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Production Down by 7.6 Pc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing output of
Singapore for August this year declined by 7.6 percent from the
same period of last year, because of the slowdown in the
electronics industry, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The output of chemicals, transport equipment, plastic products
and petroleum industries also declined, the EDB said, adding,
however, that the cumulative output for the first eight months
recorded a growth of 6.4 percent over the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
It said that the output of electronic products and components
declined by 5.1 percent year-on-year. Personal computers (PC),
consumer electronics, telecommunication equipment and
semiconductors segments showed lower level of output, whilst the
disk drive and printed circuit board assembly segments showed
positive growth.
</P>
<P>
The electronic industry's growth for the first eight months of
this year stood at 12.6 percent, compared with the same period in
1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
The output for the chemicals industry, including petroleum,
pharmaceuticals, petrochemical and specialty chemicals, decreased
by 12.4 percent in August. But, cumulative output for the first
eight months increased by six percent.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry declined by 9.2 percent compared to
August last year, due mainly to lower output by a major refinery
which experienced technical start-up problems after its shutdown
maintenance in July.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the decreases, cumulative output of the
petroleum industry for the first eight months increased by 5.6
percent, the EDB said.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia
today discussed the possibility of building a bridge to link
Peninsular Malaysia and North Sumatra, Indonesia, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Soeharto and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad agreed during their talks here earlier today that
the proposed bridge is "a good idea" and it would be discussed
further, Alatas briefed reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
For such a project, it is primarily the private sector that
ought to come up with the capital and the two governments ought to
further discuss this possibility, said Alatas who is accompanying
Soeharto on a two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed bridge would enhance land communication

allow tourists from neighboring countries to bring their own cars
to visit Indonesia, he said.

conducive to the peace, stability and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here this afternoon with visiting Laotian Vice

during the past few years, there has been a smooth development of
Sino-Laotian good-neighborly friendship and constant high-level

GUANGZHOU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong

</P>
<P>
This is the first time overseas investors have received

period last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Construction of Nanning-Kunming Railway Proceeds Swiftly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Workers have started laying
rails on the Xingyi-Badu section in Guizhou Province of the
Nanning-Kunming Railway.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the railway line, listed as one of the state
key construction projects, began in 1990. It will start from
Nanning, capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, linking to
the seashore area of Beibu Gulf by a feeder in the east, and end
at Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, in the west, traveling
through the southwest corner of Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The railway will have a total length of 898 km.
</P>
<P>
So far, rails have been laid on the section in Yunnan Province,
the northern part of the section in Guizhou Province, and on the
sections from Nanning, capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, to Bose, and from Bose to Tianlin, both in Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Deshu, an official in charge of the entire
railway project, the construction of the line in Guizhou, with a
length of 218.1 km, will be the most difficult because of
geological conditions there.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Ministry of Railways has called on scientists
and technology experts from across the country to tackle obstacles
facing the construction.
</P>
<P>
Workers have finished most of the main construction work on the
section, including the building of bridges, tunnels and roadbeds,
and have laid rails on 101.7 km of the entire section in Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
Railway Minister Han Zhubin said the construction of the
Nanning-Kunming Railway is a major step by the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council for
implementing the strategy of accelerating the economic development
of central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
It is also of great significance for speeding up exploitation
of local resources in southwest China and promoting national unity
in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Han was there to attend an event held on September 26 at Xingyi,
the prefectural seat of the Bouyei-Miao Autonomous Region in
southwest part of Guizhou Province, which marked the end of an era
without railway lines in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He also called on construction workers to make sure that rail
work on the entire line is completed by next March as scheduled.

An early-August flood in Changting caused 96 deaths and

Nearly 5,500 shelters have been built in the county seat, and

But Luo said there still is a grave shortage of funds needed

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations to Continue Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
Steering Committee is scheduled to continue negotiations today at
the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip on the
implementation of an interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
The talks, due to start this afternoon at the Palestinian side
of the Erez checkpoint, will focus on the Israeli army's
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began their negotiations on Sunday night in an
opening session, which was also attended by U.S. Middle East
special coordinator Dennis Ross, at the Israeli side of the Erez
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
During the session, which Israeli media termed as "a public
relations event," with the substantial work set for today, the
several subcommittees were formed to immediately start working on
Hebron redeployment as well as economic, military and civilian
matters.
</P>
<P>
Both sides brought radically different agendas to Sunday's
talks, with Israel focusing on the Hebron redeployment and
adjustments to security arrangements, and the Palestinians aiming
to implement the entire agreement without changes.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Dan Shmoron, head of the Israeli
delegation, said that Israeli and the Palestinian negotiators
intended to work at "a hasty pace" to reach an agreement, so that
the implementation of the interim agreement, also known as Oslo 2,
could be continued.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian delegation,
said that the two sides were determined to preserve the peace
process and to "give it every chance it deserves."
</P>
<P>
"I know that Palestinians and Israelis will understand that we
are able to put the peace process on track, when we start
implementing the agreement on the ground," Erekat added.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee on the Hebron redeployment, headed by Shmoron
and Erekat, will convene for the first time when the Steering
Committee resumes the negotiations today.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to ensure the negotiators to concentrate on the
talks and reach an agreement as soon as possible, the media will
be reportedly barred from covering those talks on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are seeking a date for Israel's withdrawal
from the Palestinian sections of the city, which according to the
Oslo accords should have taken place last March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government indicated that the agreement
is fundamentally flawed, and wanted to renegotiate security
arrangements, particularly after last month's violent
confrontation between Israeli soldiers and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontations, triggered off by the opening of
the Hasmonean Tunnel by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more
than 70 people were killed and nearly a thousand others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the fierce clashes between Israeli troops and
the Palestinian police, U.S. President Bill Clinton sponsored an
emergency summit in Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, attended by Clinton,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, as well as King Hussein
of Jordan, Israel and the the Palestinian Authority agreed to hold
round-the-clock talks starting Sunday to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that one change, to be asked by
Israel during the negotiations, is to demand the Palestinian
policemen who are deployed in Hebron to carry pistols, not
automatic weapons.

International Astronautical Federation (IAF) opened here today,
kicking off a five-day rally of scientists and experts in the
aerospace circles.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that China has hosted an IAF congress.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin spoke at the opening ceremony in

The president said that space undertakings aimed at peaceful
development and the utilization of space resources are a
magnificent feat in the best interests of mankind, and that the
21st century will witness a rapid expansion of the space industry,
which has a broad prospect for growth.
</P>
<P>
Promotion of the space program requires closer international
cooperation between all countries of the world, and those that
have acquired space technology should do more in this regard,
Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said China has listed its space program as a major link in
the country's overall development strategy and has always taken
every means to support its growth.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, devote ourselves to the space program and
try our best to score new achievements," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pledged that the Chinese government and people will make
bigger contributions to the peaceful utilization of space
resources and the expansion of the sphere of space utilization, as
well as to the progress and civilization of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1950, the IAF has 129 members from 45 countries
and regions. "Expanding the Utilization Area of Space" is the
theme of the 47th IAF Congress.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech to the congress, Chinese state councillor
Song Jian hailed the "remarkable, amazing" achievements that
mankind has made in the space field during the past half century
and the huge benefits derived from the application and transfer of
space technology.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the opening of the congress, Jiang met with
officials from the IAF, the International Academy of Astronautics
and the International Institute of Space Law, including IAF

<HEADLINE> Four Japanese Cable TV Operators to Buy U.S.-Made Modems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Four Japanese cable television
network operators are planning to buy cable modems from
Hewlett-Packard Co. of the United States, an official of the Tokyu
Cable Television Co. said today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese cable operators plan to install the modems, a key
device for multimedia products, in users' homes to link their
personal computers with cable television networks, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The four companies include the Tokyu Cable Television in
Yokohama near Tokyo and local cable television network operators
in Yokohama near Tokyo, Aichi Prefecture, and Suwa, Nagano
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The joint procurement is likely to accelerate standardization
of cable modems and is also expected to reduce operating costs for
cable television companies, because the equipment is priced at
one-third that of domestically produced ones, industry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The four operators will jointly begin telecommunication
services such as access to the Internet from April next year.
They currently offer cable television services to 300,000
households, or 10 percent of the nation's three million cable
television subscribers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends His Foreign Policy in Debate With Dole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
called the U.S. foreign policy successful during his term in a
debate with Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
In the first presidential debate with Dole at Hartford of
Connecticut, Clinton, who is seeking re-election, said that the
United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath
of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest
force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that the United States has managed the aftermath
of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in
Russia; the removal of Russian troops from the Baltics; the
integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new
partnership with NATO and with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the
United States tonight, and have not been in our administration for
the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But, Dole criticized Clinton and said that the United States
has spent 3 billion U.S. dollars on Haiti but there are still
problems.
</P>
<P>
Dole also said that there was no cease-fire in Northern Ireland
and there are still lots of problems in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. deployment in Bosnia, Dole said that the Americans
should not have gone to Bosnia in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Dole particularly mentioned the failure of the U.S. mission in
Somalia and the 18 American soldiers killed in the African country
when thousands of U.S. troops were there during Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.S. deployment in Kuwait was to repel
Iraq's threat to Kuwait and other neighboring countries and that
the American policy toward Cuba was to pressure the nation to
change.
</P>
<P>
Dole said he agreed with Clinton on the matter.
</P>
<P>
A second and final debate between Clinton and Dole is scheduled
for October 16 in San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President to Meet with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman is to host Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday to
discuss the Israeli-Palestinian relations in the wake of recent
violence.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held at Weizman's home in Caesarea, was
finalized after Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reopened
peace talks at the Erez checkpoint Sunday night, the Hebrew daily
Ha'aretz reported today.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's meeting with Arafat is apparently a gesture of good
will to the Palestinians as Israel tries to calm down the current
tension which threatens to jeopardize the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the meeting with Arafat was announced in August by
Weizman who said he would host Arafat in response to a letter from
the Palestinian leader who complained about the stagnation of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's announcement also exert pressure on hardline Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who originally refused to meet with
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of Weizman as well as that of U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Netanyahu held his first meeting with Arafat at the
Erez checkpoint in early September, during which both agreed to
proceed with the peace talks based on signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed talks soon after
the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting, but failed to bridge the wide gap
between the two sides, especially on the issue of Israeli
redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, a widespread bloodshed between stone-throwing
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers was sparked by Israel's opening
of an archaeological underground tunnel near the Al-Aqsa Mosque in
east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians accused of being a plot to
undermine the Moslem holy sites.
</P>
<P>
The four-day violence left more than 70 people dead, including
15 Israeli soldiers and over 1,000 others wounded, creating the
worst crisis since the two sides made peace in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the intensified mediation of the U.S. government, Israel
and the Palestinian Authority resumed talks Sunday to try to
resolve differences through peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation in the territories remains tense and the
lack of quick results could spark larger-scale violence
again.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Approves Largest Financial Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's largest financial
takeover occurred on October 5 when the central bank allowed the
Guangdong Development Bank to purchase Zhongyin Trust and
Investment Company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China has revoked the business
license of Zhongyin, which has been under investigation by the
central bank over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that the takeover has not only protected the
rights and interests of the creditors, but also will have a
far-reaching significance for the deepening of China's economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Zhongyin was set up in 1988 by the Bank of China and a number
of other investors. An official auditing shows that Zhongyin and
its subsidiaries had liabilities of nearly four billion yuan by
September 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhongyin was troubled by low-quality assets, poor solvency,
inadequate capital stock, and excessive extension of loans, which
have combined to drive it to the verge of bankruptcy, the experts
point out.
</P>
<P>
The central bank decided to put Zhongyin under its surveillance
last October, noting that the rights and interests of the
depositors had been severely affected due to the company's rule
violations and chaotic management.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Development Bank, a joint-stock regional
commercial bank established in 1988 with a registered capital
volume of more than two billion yuan, has assets valued at more
than 50 billion yuan at present. Its subsidiaries engage in
securities, funds, gold, and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The bank will inherit all the creditor's rights and liabilities
of Zhongyin, according to the central bank's decision.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Dole Hold First Presidential Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Robert Dole debated on
the role of the federal government, tax cuts, Medicare, education
and economic growth in their first debate today.
</P>
<P>
The two presidential candidates challenged each other on a wide
range of issues during the 90-minute session at the Bushnell
Theater in Hartford, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
Jim Lehrer of the Public Broadcasting Service served as
moderator.
</P>
<P>
"I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole
keeps his word," Dole said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is seeking re-election, said he had kept most of
his 1992 campaign promises. He defended his record, citing as
examples banning certain assault weapons and making it harder for
cigarette companies to target children.
</P>
<P>
"We are better off than we were four years ago -- let's keep it
going," Clinton said, stressing that 10 million new jobs had been
created and deficit reduced for six years in a row.
</P>
<P>
Dole disagreed by saying that under Clinton, "Americans are
working harder and paying higher taxes."
</P>
<P>
Dole reiterated his promise to cut taxes by 15 percent and
called Clinton a "warmed over liberal".
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the "Dole-Gingrich" 1995 Republican budget
would have devastated Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Dole countered by saying that Clinton was "scaring the
seniors". He said the Republican budget increased spending on
Medicare, just not as much as Democrats wanted.
</P>
<P>
While Dole promoted his 548-billion-dollar tax cut plan,
Clinton called it a "tax scheme" that would either make the
deficit explode or require unacceptable cuts in Medicare and
education.
</P>
<P>
Dole noted that drug use among teenagers had doubled during
Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
The president said he took some responsibility for that and
promised to keep fighting teen drug use.
</P>
<P>
On the role of government, Dole said, "I trust the people; the
president trusts the government."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said he trusted the people, too, but that the
government had a critical role in areas such as protecting the
environment, putting more police on the street and regulating
tobacco sales to keep children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
A second and final debate between Clinton and Dole was
scheduled for October 16 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
A vice-presidential debate between Vice-President Albert Gore
and Republican nominee Jack Kemp is to take place on October 9 in
St. Petersburg, Florida.

<P>
WUHAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese and compatriots
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan have recently signed investment
contracts worth 50 million yuan with the city of Tianmen in
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed at a three-day trade fair and
gathering for people whose roots are in Tianmen, held recently in
the city, known as the largest ancestral hometown to overseas
Chinese in the country's inland area.

annually, local business officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some 280,000 overseas Chinese who left Tianmen now live in 44
countries and regions throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Since China began to introduce reform and opening-up policies
18 years ago, the city has improved its investment environment and
issued a set of favorable policies to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the city, which has advantageous geographical
conditions, a Hong Kong company decided to increase its investment
in a water pump project from 6.5 million to 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city has approved 72 joint ventures, 30 of
which have gone into operation. Total overseas investment in
Tianmen has reached 11.97 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to purchase goods worth one billion yuan for

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Indonesia to Settle Dispute Through World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia
today agreed to settle their territorial dispute over Ligitan and
Sipadan islands through the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
at the Hague, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting between Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Indonesian President Soeharto who
arrived here Sunday for a two-day working visit, Abdullah briefed
reporters after attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to submit their claims to the ICJ for arbitration
to end their 27-year-old territorial dispute over the two small
islands off Sabah's east coast, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders have voiced their aspiration that the issue
could be settled amicably without creating any difficulties or
tension.
</P>
<P>
"They decided that the matter be referred to a third party and
the best avenue was through the ICJ," said Abdullah, adding that
the matter will be submitted to the ICJ simultaneously by Malaysia
and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries would hold a meeting
soon to decide on the procedures to bring the case to the world
court, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Indonesia have made overlapping claims to the tiny
islands since 1969 and set up a joint working group in 1991 to
determine their ownership.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, both members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), have also exchanged memoranda to explain
each other's stand on the claims.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Mahathir and Soeharto felt that the issue should
not be allowed to drag on and that the matter should be resolved
now after more than two years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed other bilateral, regional and
international issues such as bilateral trade and their stand on
ASEAN and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's visit here is part of regular bilateral meetings
between the two leaders held alternately in Malaysia and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto will leave for Jakarta later in the afternoon.

NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- India would amend its
copyright law to protect the latest international technologies and
new digital-based processes and databases, a government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Final changes to the law would be effected after deliberations
at the forthcoming conference to be held in Geneva under the aegis
of the World Intellectual Property Organization.
</P>
<P>
A core group of the government has been set up to examine and
decide on the country's position on what changes are required. The
group has representatives from the Commerce Ministry, External
Affairs Ministry, Science and Technology Department and industry
representatives from the film, software and music industries, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike patents where India's stance is defensive, in the case
of copyrights India is an interested party since it stands to lose
large sums of money on account of piracy of films and other
literary works.
</P>
<P>
India amended its copyright law extensively in 1994 in
accordance with the trade-related intellectual property rights
agreement. The intention is now to adjust the copyright regime and
to incorporate protection of information on the Internet, the
official added.

<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Continued bullish trend on the
Dhaka Stock Exchange (DES), Bangladesh's main bourse, Sunday
pushed its market indicators to new records for the second
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
According to the market sources, the DSE all share price index
jumped 114.89 points to cross the 2000-mark in an extraordinary
bullish trend of trading on speculations and rumors that resulted
in a heavy buying pressure.
</P>
<P>
The price index heated up to 2,005.25 points Sunday from
Saturday's 1,890.36, a leap of 104 points from the previous day's
position.
</P>
<P>
Market capitalization, that was equal to 3.12 billion US
dollars Saturday, also hit a new record Sunday when this key
indicator jumped to an all-time high of 3.31 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another record was set in terms of turnover as shares and
debentures worth 298.9 million taka (about 7.27 million US
dollars) were transacted in a single day of trading in this
country's largest bourse.
</P>
<P>
Trading has been booming because the number of all categories
of investors has increased in recent months, said DSE President
Imtiaz Hossen, who also attributed the latest spurt to
"overconfidence" of investors in the future of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The DSE all share price index crossed the 1000-mark just three
months ago when the new government of Sheikh Hasina was set up
after nearly two years of political turbulence.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Court to Start Hearing in 3 Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The supreme court and the
Delhi high court will start here today hearing in three cases
against former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and his fate will
hinge on the judgment of the cases.
</P>
<P>
While the supreme court takes up the Delhi police plea for a
change of venue in the L. Pathak cheating case of 100,000 US
dollars in which Rao has been named as a co-accused along with
Godman Chandraswami and his associate, the high court will hear
Rao's anticipatory bail plea in the St Kitts forgery case in which
non-bailable arrest warrant has been issued against Rao. Also
coming up in the Delhi high court is the MP bribery case in which
four tribal leaders have already been lodged in jail under
judicial custody.
</P>
<P>
Of the three cases, the St Kitts case is of immediate urgency
for Rao as the high court reprieve to him in the case ends on
Monday. With the execution of a non-bailable warrant pending
against him, Rao will be pleading before the high court for
leniency in view of his ill health and old age of 76.
</P>
<P>
Rao's counsel had managed to secure for him a reprieve on last
Friday evening immediately after a Delhi court issued a
non-bailable arrest warrant against him accusing him of forging
documents to show former prime minister V.P. Singh's son as a
secret bank account holder in the Caribbean island of St Kitts.
Justice Mahajan in the Delhi high court had stayed the execution
of the non-bailable warrant against Rao till this Monday, when his
anticipatory bail will come up for detailed hearing.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Court to Start Hearing in 3 Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- If the court decides against
Rao, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will be left with
no choice but to arrest him unless he secures relief from the
supreme court.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court is scheduled to determine today whether the
Tis Hazari district court's complex, which is the court of special
judge Ajit Bharihoke, is secure enough for Rao to appear on
October 9 for the trial in the L. Pathak cheating case or whether
it be shifted to some other high-security area. Bharihoke had
summoned Rao to appear before him on September 30 for framing of
cheating and criminal conspiracy in the 100,000 US dollar cheating
case. The supreme court has granted Rao personal exemption from
appearance at the lower court till it takes a final view on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
UK-based non-Indian resident businessman L. Pathak said in his
early testimony before a Delhi court that he gave 100,000 US
dollars to Godman Chandraswami and his associate on assurance of
Rao, the then external affairs minister, in 1983 to secure
contracts to supply newsprint and paper pulp to India. He said he
was duped by them.
</P>
<P>
The third case, in which Rao is accused of hatching a
conspiracy to bribe four MPs to vote in favor of his government
during a vote of no-confidence in July 1993, is also coming up for
hearing in the Delhi high court Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rao's fate now depends on what view the judges take on his
pleas in the above-mentioned three criminal cases against him.

DAMASCUS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa
Tlass warned Sunday that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu implements his threats and carries out a military
adventure, he will regret because Israel will pay heavy losses it
can not bear.
</P>
<P>
Tlass accused Israel of blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's refusal to return the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, made it
impossible for peace talks to be held, Tlass told ruling party
newspaper al-Baath on the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the
1973 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
He urged Arabs to take coordinated action to face Israeli
threats and not to make any meaningless concessions to Israel.

<P>
Tension escalated last month when Israel and Syria accused

<HEADLINE> Thai Gov't Urged to Pay More Attention to Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has been
urged to pay more attention to the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand
growth triangle (IMT-GT).
</P>
<P>
Siripong Chanrusmee, chairman of the Business Council of the
IMT-GT, criticized the Thai government for neglecting its work on
the growth triangle, saying the related programs had made little
progress during the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
If the authorities do not start to pay more attention to the
IMT-GT, his council should be dissolved, Siripong was quoted as
saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The IMT-GT was initiated in 1993 by the then Chuan Leekpai
government, which envisaged a special economic zone to increase
trade and investment among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Yet, some issues still remained unsolved because they need the
government's involvement, such as Thailand's proposal that
Indonesia open its checkpoints around the clock, and plans for
fishery cooperation, Siripong said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment (BOI) under the prime minister's office
recently proposed to set up a special investment promotion zone in
12 provinces in the northeast but none in the south, he said,
adding that it could show the government lacks interest in the
growth triangle.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government agreed in September 1995 to designate the
IMT-GT as a special economic zone which would enjoy more
privileges than others, while the BOI argued that the five
southern provinces, which are part of the IMT-GT, were already
well developed.
</P>
<P>
Without a status as a special economic zone, the IMT-GT will
not survive, Siripong stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia had established a cross-border industrial
zone near Sadao in Shongkhla province, using Thai labor and
certain Thai raw materials, while Thailand had made almost no
progress in the same regard.
</P>
<P>
Thailand recently had asked Malaysia to delay the sixth IMT-GT
meeting because Thailand cannot make any firm commitments until
the next government is in place.

regions.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is first secretary of the Myanmar State Law and
Order Restoration Council (SLORC), made the remarks here Sunday at
a meeting of the Work Committee for the Development of Border
Areas and National Races, the official paper The New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of the work committee,
disclosed that Myanmar has spent over 4.31 billion kyats (718
million US dollars according to the official exchange rate) for
border area development since 1988 when the SLORC took over
power.
</P>
<P>
He said that special priority is being given to transport,
education, health and agricultural works in the development of the
border regions.
</P>
<P>
Second secretary of the SLORC Lieutenant General Tin Oo, who is
vice-chairman of the work committee, disclosed at the meeting that
funds allocated for border area development in 1996-97 fiscal year
amount to 942.4 million kyats (157 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Previously, some Myanmar border areas were dominated by
internal anti-government armed groups. Now 15 of the 16 armed
groups as well as drug king Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army have
returned to the legal fold.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Table Bill on Women's Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
table a bill on women's equal property rights soon in the ongoing
parliament session, according to a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Nava Havi Acharya said Sunday
that consensus has been reached among major political parties in
the country to table the long-awaited bill to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public hearing program held by several
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in legal and women's
fields, the minister said it is the main responsibility of the
political parties to create public opinion in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Chief whip of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) Devi Ojha said at the hearing
that his party fully supports the bill, adding that women should
be provided with access to policy-making bodies.
</P>
<P>
Participants from the NGOs at the program expressed their
dissatisfaction over the government's delay in tabling the bill in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court issued a directive in September last year
ordering the government to prepare the bill within one year, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to them, Nepal's existing property law denies women
the right to parental property although the country's constitution
provides for equal rights for men and women in all areas.

Highway now links the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Haibei in
Qinghai Province with the Gansu Corridor in northwest China's Gansu
Province, today's "People's Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Currently, highways in the province's six Tibetan autonomous

<P>
Over the past decade, Qinghai Province earmarked 120 million
yuan each year for building transport facilities in areas
inhabited by ethnic minority groups.

In the past five years, the province has invested 720 million
yuan for building and rebuilding 3,366 km of highways, and
constructing 303 bridges and 21 bus stations in the six Tibetan
autonomous regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of Public
Health has banned sales and manufacturing of cosmetics containing
hydroquinone in the country, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
After years of study, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
under the ministry has concluded that hydroquinone, found in sun
block lotion and sunspot protection lotion, has some side effects,
the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
The FDA indicated that users may suffer from rashes and skin
irritations or develop permanent sunspots after prolonged use.
</P>
<P>
Companies which have imported or manufactured cosmetic products
containing hydroquinone before July are allowed to sell their
remaining stock until next year.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who sells products illegally after that period will face
 imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to 60,000 baht
(2,400 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Insurer Pays for Failed Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance
(Property) Co. has paid 25.9 million US dollars in indemnity for
China Telecommunication and Broadcasting Satellite Corp. (CTBSC),
for the failed launch of a ChinaSat-7 satellite in August.
</P>
<P>
ChinaSat-7, worth 128 million US dollars, was a commercial
telecommunications satellite made by Hughes Space and
Communication Company of the United States. The satellite was
launched on August 18 with a Long March-3 rocket carrier from the
Xichang Satellite Launching Center, in southwest Sichuan
Province. It failed to enter the preset orbit when the rocket
halted its launch 48 seconds ahead of schedule, during the second
phase of its third-stage flight.
</P>
<P>
ChinaSat-7 was the first high-risk satellite project for PICC
Property after the restructuring of its former parent company, the
People's Insurance Company of China, in July.
</P>
<P>
A company official said that PICC Property will continue to
serve as the main insurer for CTBSC's second Dongfanghong-3
telecommunications satellite and underwrite a series of satellite
launches for other domestic clients.

northwest China's Gansu Province has donated some two million yuan
(240,000 US dollars) to public welfare facilities in his hometown,
in Guanghe County in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Purge Tapes, Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Illegal stalls closed up and
hawkers vanished following a week-long purge of local black market
audio-visual products in Guangdong Province, today's "China Daily"
said.
</P>
<P>
The campaigns were initiated late last month to beat back a
recent resurgence in pornography and copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
The series of campaigns will mainly attack illegal dealers,
gang leaders, and people who attempt to abet criminal activities,
Li Lanfang, an official for copyright administration in Guangdong
Province, was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, Guangdong has battled hard against the
manufacture and marketing of pornographic products and a rise in
copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of the year, local law enforcement
departments had cracked more than 500 cases, impounded 2.1 million
audio-visual products plus 230,000 books and magazines, revoked
the business licences of 1,600 illegal dealers and brought to
discipline six CD-ROM makers engaged in illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
The current campaigns stress not only closing down illegal
street dealers but going to the root of the problem by mopping up
underground networks of production, marketing and transportation
(including smuggling), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign to contain the latest surge in
porn-products and copyright piracy, enterprises and dealers of
audio-visual products, books, printed media and electronic
publications will be required to sign legal pledges not to market
erotic, smuggled or pirated publications.
</P>
<P>
If caught doing so, their business licences will be revoked
immediately, and they will be fined heavily and disciplined by law.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong also plans to create a provincial monopoly in the
wholesale of audio-visual products, according to the paper.

<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Researchers and doctors in China
for the past five years have been perfecting their system of using
radioisotopes in medical science.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the isotope institute of the China Institute for
Atomic Energy Science started a key project of Tc-99 research in
1991, and ultimately developed Technetium-99 equipment that uses
radioisotopes to diagnose tumors and diseases of the heart, brain,
liver, and kidneys.
</P>
<P>
They have production lines that can manufacture 5,000 Tc-99
units and 50,000 doses of Tc medications annually, creating a
sales volume of 27 million yuan on the market in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the radioisotope products used in the
world's diagnostic medicine are Tc-99. Before 1988, all Tc-99
equipment in China was imported.

LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Savo Milosevic scored a first
half hat-trick to lead Yugoslavia to rout the Faroes 8-1 in a
World Cup qualifier at Toftir, Faroe Islands on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic kicked off the avalanche of goals in the European
group of six tie with a goal after seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
His second in the 36th minute was a delightfully executed lob
over goalkeeper Jens Knudsen's head.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic completed his hat-trick on the stroke of halftime
when he followed up to score from close range after Knudsen had
dived to block a shot from Sinisa Mihajlovic.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia stayed atop Group 6 with three wins in as many games.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other game, Switzerland defeated Finland 3-2 in
their Group 3 match. The win gave the Swiss three points in two
games and a four-way tie atop the standings with Norway,
Azerbaijan and Hungary. Finland has two losses in two games.
</P>

CANBERRA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard has written to Chief Minister of
the Northern Territory Shane Stone expressing reservations about
the practical and material benefits from the national inquiry of
the stolen-children conducted by the Human Rights and Equal
Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- the International Monetary Fund has urged the federal
government to slash unemployment benefits and workers' benefits
such as holiday loading, super and sick leave in a bid to reduce
unemployment, but the U.S.-style low-wage labor market has been
rejected by Treasurer Peter Costello.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard was "playing with fire" by not
speaking out against racism, the Opposition said yesterday. The
increasing heated racism debate -- sparked last month by
independent MP Pauline Hanson -- could damage Australia's
interests in the region.

XI'AN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- As many as 26 couplets written on
scrolls and 16 inscribed boards from the Ming and Qing dynasties
(1368-1911) have been found in Liuba County, in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts were found in the Zhangliang Temple, on Zhibai
Mountain, which was built in memory of Zhang Liang, one of the
main advisers of Liu Bang, and who helped him to found the Han
Dynasty (202 BC-220).
</P>
<P>
The writing on the scrolls and the inscriptions were mainly in
praise of Zhang, who had many achievements but claimed no credit
for himself and avoided any show of arrogance.

<HEADLINE> Senior British Tory Figure Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Lord McAlpine, a former treasurer
and ex-deputy chairman of the Conservative party, is switching his
allegiance to Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum Party, BBC reported
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The defection by such a senior figure is a new blow to John
Major on the eve of the most troubled Tory conference for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The former treasurer told the BBC he had already confided in
former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, under whom
he served, about his change of allegiance and that he was not
afraid of being branded a traitor.
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith's Referendum Party has shaken the Conservative Party
to its foundations by planning to fight the next election with a
demand for a referendum over Britain's future in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
McAlpine said: "If the Referendum Party was standing, I think I
would have to break a habit of a lifetime and probably vote for
them."
</P>
<P>
McAlpine's defection came at worse moment for Major. Apart from
deep divisions over Europe, the Conservatives have in recent days
been mired in a persistent row over parliamentary corruption.

<HEADLINE> US Scientist Says Virus Could Be Behind Gulf War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An American scientist said
today that he had discovered genetic material that could provide a
clue as to why so many Gulf War-era veterans became ill after
serving in the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
Microbiologist Dr. Howard Urnovitz, in a study being presented
Monday to a conference of Gulf War Veterans, told the Associated
Press that the genetic marker could point to the existence of a
virus. The virus, in turn, could make veterans exposed to chemical
agents or other toxins more susceptible to illness.
</P>
<P>
Urnovitz said that he found unique genetic bands in 29 of 36
veterans from California and Arkansas who were deployed to the
Gulf and in all eight Arkansas veterans tested who didn't serve in
the Gulf. A random selection of 22 nonmilitary civilians found the
band in only one.
</P>
<P>
He said that his study could be "terribly important" if it
leads to discovery of a virus that could have put Gulf War veterans
at substantially higher risk of illness when exposed to chemical
agents or other pollutants common to war environment.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms found among gulf War veterans--fatigue, memory loss,
aching joints and respiratory problems-- were similar to those in
"epidemic fatigue syndromes," health problems that have afflicted
large populations in industrial areas after viral infections.
</P>
<P>
Urnovitz said that epidemic fatigue syndrome has been detected
at least a dozen times in the last 60 years where many people were
exposed to pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The study came as the Pentagon is under increased pressure from
Congress and veterans' groups to examine the extent of U.S. troops
exposure to chemical agents. The Pentagon announced last month
that it has allocated five million u.s. dollars to study the effects
of low-level chemical agent exposure.
