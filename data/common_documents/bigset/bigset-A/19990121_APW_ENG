<HEADLINE>  NBA Officially Opens for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Get ready for the busiest day in NBA history.  
</P>
<P>
	Tons of trades are waiting be made, nearly 200 free agents are  
ready to start signing and training camps are opening. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``will be the craziest day in the history of the league,''  
agent Keith Glass said, ``and I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one.  
</P>
<P>
	After 204 days, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and  
countless fits, starts, fights and snags, the NBA lockout finally 
came to an official end Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six and a half months of pent-up business was to be conducted at  
2 p.m. EST today, with the floodgates opening on what should be 
well over 100 transactions. The schedule comes out at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' commissioner David Stern said after he  
and union president Patrick Ewing signed the nearly 300-page 
collective bargaining agreement. ``It was an incredible relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with the biggest unanswered free agent question  
being the future of Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Suns made a last-ditch effort to woo him to the  
desert after their own prized free agent, Antonio McDyess, decided 
to take less money to play for the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix can make moves to get about $8 million under the salary  
cap. That would mean the Suns could not offer Gugliotta the maximum 
$9 million. The Timberwolves, by comparison, can offer him the 
maximum with 12 1/2 percent raises -- a total of $86.2 million over 
seven years -- and then possibly trade him to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, Gugliotta could choose simply to stay in Minnesota.  
</P>
<P>
	That answer, and so many others about who will play where, what  
the schedule will look like and whether the fans will return, will 
be answered soon. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess decided early Wednesday evening to return to the  
Nuggets, the team he played for in his first two NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real close call,'' said McDyess' agent, James Bryant.  
``It came down to a question of do you want to inherit a contender 
or do you want to build one? Phoenix is a great franchise, but 
Denver is doing a lot of exciting things that haven't come out 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland was wondering whether the Washington Wizards  
would improve their offer of $30 million guaranteed for three 
years, with two additional non-guaranteed years. The Wizards issued 
a take-it or leave-it deadline of midnight Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's agent, David Falk, was trying to engineer a  
sign-and-trade deal, while also contemplating whether to advise 
Strickland to sign a one-year deal with another team and then 
re-enter the free-agent market next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman, meanwhile, said he will not retire.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK, so here's the deal,'' Rodman wrote in a message posted on  
his Web site. ``I've had some long discussions with the people I 
love, the ones whose opinions matter most to me, and I've decided 
not to retire after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he has would like to play in Chicago, Los Angeles, New  
York or overseas, Rodman also wrote: ``There's one thing I have 
always told my fans I would do in my last game that I still haven't 
done. I'm sure you know what it is, but I still have to come back 
for at least one more game so that I can get buck naked on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other players and their agents worked feverishly to finalize  
deals. Among the tentative agreements: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Christian Laettner heading to the Detroit Pistons in a  
sign-and-trade deal sending Charles O'Bannon and Scot Pollard to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Damon Stoudamire agreed to re-sign with Portland for $81  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dell Curry, the last of the original Hornets, was considering  
Portland or Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta and its free-agent forward, Alan Henderson, were far  
apart on money. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rick Fox agreed to take the $1.75 million exception from the  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Knicks reportedly reached agreements with their two free  
agents, Charlie Ward and Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Olden Polynice was deciding between the SuperSonics and  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Derek Harper was joining the Los Angeles Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Billy Owens was signing with Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jud Buechler was set to sign with Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Michael Stewart was close to signing with Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerome Kersey was headed to San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sam Perkins was ready to sign with Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric Murdock was joining New Jersey.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Rap impresario Master P, recently of the CBA's Fort Wayne  
Fury, was reportedly reporting to Hornets training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other unresolved questions was where Charlotte  
free-agent center Vlade Divac would sign. The Suns were interested 
if they lose both McDyess and Gugliotta, and the Sacramento Kings 
were weighing whether they should renounce the rights to free-agent 
Corliss Williamson in order to clear enough salary cap room to meet 
Divac's asking price. Several league sources insisted the 
SuperSonics were making a late push for Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	Other free agents, including Hot Rod Williams and Brent Barry,  
still were not sure where they would be signing. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were a slew of unconfirmed trade rumors involving  
Donyell Marshall, Bob Sura and John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a pent-up demand for information about players and  
playing, not about negotiators and negotiating,'' Stern said. 
``We're ready to get back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league released the schedule of exhibition games, with the  
first Sunday night at the United Center, with the Indiana Pacers 
taking on a team no one will recognize -- the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season will begin Feb. 5.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Gov. Proposes Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- The prospect of billion-dollar budget  
shortfalls has Alaska's governor making two proposals once 
considered political death: reinstating an income tax and slicing 
off a chunk of the state's most sacred cow, the $24 billion Alaska 
Permanent Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Low prices for oil that provides most of the state's general  
revenue are expected to cause huge budget gaps several years. 
Keeping state government operating will require transfusions from a 
cash reserve that could be exhausted in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Alaskans pay no state income tax and no state sales  
tax while taking home an annual dividend from the Permanent Fund. 
The wildly popular payout reached a record $1,540.88 last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is we have the wealth and resources to fix the  
problem of stabilizing our fiscal future,'' Gov. Tony Knowles said 
Wednesday in his State of the State speech. ``The question is, do 
we have the wisdom and the will to make the savings and investment 
necessary to achieve a sustainable balanced budget or will we 
continue to borrow from the future?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state ditched its income tax in 1980 after oil money began  
flowing into the treasury in massive amounts. The state took in 
$4.1 billion in 1982, more than three times its projected general 
revenue for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time the average annual price for a barrel of North Slope  
crude drops a dollar, Alaska loses about $95 million. The price 
slipped under $9 a barrel in December, a record low for a commodity 
that usually sells for about $16 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	The new income tax would fall most heavily on people who come to  
Alaska only to work before returning to homes in the Lower 48. A 
family of four with a household income of less than $60,000 would 
pay nothing, Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax is expected to take in $350 million, about a third of  
the projected shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The part of the plan that could spark outrage from the public  
and send nervous politicians running for the exits is the dip into 
earnings of the sacrosanct Permanent Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund was created as a rainy-day account to guard against an  
inevitable decline in oil revenue, but the Legislature's decision 
to begin paying dividends in 1982 turned it into a political 
minefield. Elections turn on the barest hint that a candidate might 
support raiding the fund or reducing the dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles, a Democrat beginning his second and last term in the  
governor's mansion, wants to take $4 billion of the profits the 
fund has rolled up in the booming stock market and add it to the 
state's cash reserve. The reserve would then theoretically earn 
enough every year to bridge the remaining budget gap for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles has promised to submit any plan to spend Permanent Fund  
dollars to a public vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hurdle the proposal must clear is the  
Republican-dominated Legislature, where any mention of an income 
tax is unpopular and tapping the fund is no more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any solution to the fiscal gap will not be adopted by this  
Legislature until we make further reductions to state spending,'' 
Senate President Drue Pearce said of Knowles' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rank-and-file Republicans were even more blunt.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's robbing Alaskans' pocketbooks without cuts in  
government,'' said Rep. Ramona Barnes, a Republican from Anchorage.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Oppose Fortier Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Prosecutors asked a federal appeals court on  
Thursday to uphold the 12-year sentence given to the prime witness 
in Oklahoma City bombing case he knew the key details of the bomb 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to requests from Michael Fortier to reduce his  
sentence and the $200,000 restitution he was ordered to repay, 
prosecutor Sean Connelly said ``Fortier's own lack of murderous 
intent is no basis for ignoring the reality'' of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier earlier asked the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to  
review the sentence, claiming the judge who sentenced him should 
have used guidelines for involuntary manslaughter instead of felony 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, who served in the Army with Timothy McVeigh and Terry  
Nichols, pleaded guilty to failing to alert authorities in advance 
about the 1995 plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 
The blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and transporting  
stolen firearms that prosecutors said were sold to help pay for the 
bomb's ingredients and the living expenses of McVeigh and Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the judge already had reduced the sentence from  
14 years to 12 for his ``substantial assistance,'' but also noted 
that ``Fortier indisputably obstructed justice'' when he first 
claimed no knowledge of the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Low Oil Prices Shrink Exxon Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil  
company, reported a 38 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings 
Wednesday, citing weak prices for crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's earnings for the last three months of 1998 were $1.53  
billion, or 62 cents per diluted share, down from $2.50 billion, or 
$1 a diluted share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the decline, Exxon's profits exceeded analysts'  
expectations of 57 cents per share, as reported by First Call Corp. 
The company's stock closed up 12 1/2 cents to $71.12 1/2 in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenues fell 15 percent to $29.66 billion from  
$35.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A sharp decline in crude oil prices has forced a wave of  
cost-cutting and consolidation in the global oil industry. Exxon 
announced last month that it planned to acquire Mobil Corp., one of 
the biggest mergers of all time, in hopes of trimming costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon chairman Lee R. Raymond attributed the decline in  
fourth-quarter earnings to ``weaker crude oil prices which on 
average were over $6 per barrel or 33 percent lower than last year. 
Average crude oil prices for the year were at their lowest level in 
over 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's other markets also saw weak prices, along with weaker  
chemicals margins which saw earnings decline 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, profits dropped 25 percent to $6.37 billion, or  
$2.58 per diluted share, compared with $8.46 billion, or $3.37 per 
diluted share, in 1997. Full-year revenues were $117.5 billion, 
compared with $136.7 billion for all of 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Reeves' College Coach Helps Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Marvin Bass barely flinches during Dan  
Reeves' jaw-jutting, vein-popping, ear-splitting tirades. 
</P>
<P>
	In a world full of yes-men -- and they really emerge from the  
woodwork when you're coach of the year and taking the Atlanta 
Falcons to their first Super Bowl -- Bass is the one person who can 
tell Reeves, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I usually speak my peace, say what needs to be said,'' Bass  
drawled with a shrug Thursday. ``But I don't have to say too much 
around Dan. He's got everything under control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he sauntered off the practice field, Bass hardly looked like  
the kind of guy who could stand up to the fiery Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79-year-old shuffled along slowly, both hands buried in the  
pockets of his khaki trousers. Narrow eyes and silver sideburns 
emerged from beneath his cap. A grizzled face was pockmarked with 
the wrinkles and experiences of a full life. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a head coach, you need somebody who will tell you what you  
should hear and not what you want to hear,'' said Reeves, who has 
been relying on Bass' rustic wisdom for almost four decades. ``He's 
there to tell me, `You're wrong, that's not the way to do it.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Bass' formal title is ``assistant to the head coach,'' but a  
more accurate moniker would be ``father-figure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's great to have around,'' Reeves said. ``He told me, `I  
don't want to be just a coach you're giving a job to. I want to 
contribute.' He does. He does a really good job helping us be our 
best. He has ideas and thoughts that help our coaching staff. And 
he makes it fun to go out to eat. The night before the game, he is 
hilarious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their relationship began in 1961 at the University of South  
Carolina. Bass became head coach of the Gamecocks the same year 
Reeves arrived on campus as a gritty, cocksure freshman who quickly 
made it clear he was a coach-in-the-making. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a natural,'' Bass said. ``They come along once in a  
lifetime, guys like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after taking over as the starting quarterback, Reeves was  
calling his own plays. He would set 10 schools records and never 
forget the man who made it all possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been like a father ever since I played for him at South  
Carolina,'' Reeves said. ``I always said if I ever got a head 
coaching job, I was going to hire him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chance finally came in 1981 when Reeves was hired by the  
Denver Broncos. Bass had to finish up a stint as Calgary's 
defensive coordinator in the Canadian Football League, but was 
reunited with Reeves a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they spent 11 seasons in Denver, taking the Broncos to  
three Super Bowls. Reeves was the hotheaded young boss, Bass the 
gentle voice of reason. The roles switched since their days at 
South Carolina, but Bass didn't mind serving as underling in their 
new relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, I've always enjoyed being an assistant more than  
being a head coach,'' Bass said. ``I always thought I could be 
myself more as an assistant than I could as a head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bass spent five seasons at South Carolina, compiling a record of  
17-29-4, and also headed the Birmingham team in the short-lived 
World Football League during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of his 40-plus years as a coach have been spent working  
for someone else. He's been on college staffs at North Carolina, 
Georgia Tech, Richmond and William &AMP; Mary. He was an assistant with 
the Buffalo Bills during two separate stints in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	After Reeves was fired by the Broncos in 1992, Bass returned to  
South Carolina to devote full attention to his wife, Audrey, who 
had a stroke three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	When she died in 1996 after a 52-year marriage, Bass nose-dived  
into depression and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors were giving me all kinds of pills for depression,  
but they weren't doing any good,'' Bass said. ``I was just watching 
the cracks in the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Reeves, ousted after four seasons with the New York Giants,  
was hired by the Falcons in January 1997, he immediately called up 
his old friend. Bass consulted his doctor, who advised, ``Marvin, 
the best thing in the world for you would be to get out of the 
house and get busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he did. Bass downplays his role in the daily operation of the  
Falcons, but he breaks down film, helps out at practice and sits in 
on meetings. His life had a purpose again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to take those damn depression pills anymore,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after the Falcons' improbable season, Reeves and Bass will  
be returning to the Super Bowl for the fourth time to meet the 
Broncos Jan. 31. There's a twinkle in the old man's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football has been like a hobby for me,'' he said. ``You don't  
retire from hobbies, you retire to hobbies. That's why I enjoy it. 
It keeps me young being around the players.''

<HEADLINE> Three Die in N.M. Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A single-engine airplane lost a wing  
over wintry Sandia Peak and crashed Wednesday, killing at least 
three people. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers battling darkness, rugged terrain, rain and fog found  
the wreckage shortly before 9 p.m., nearly six hours after the 
airplane went down on the outskirts of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Goodman, state search and rescue officer, said the flight  
plan for the Cessna 210 listed three people aboard for a trip from 
Scottsdale, Ariz., to Wichita, Kan. All three victims were from 
Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand they were at a golf tournament and were flying  
back to Wichita,'' Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were trying to determine whether anyone else was on  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	State Public Safety Department Secretary Darren White said  
debris from the crash was strewn over an area of 300 yards to 500 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``A wing separated, and the plane spiraled down,'' said Don  
Gibson, the civilian incident commander for the search operation.

	When she died in 1996 after a 52-year marriage, Bass nose-dived  
into depression and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors were giving me all kinds of pills for depression,  
but they weren't doing any good,'' Bass said. ``I was just watching 
the cracks in the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Reeves, ousted after four seasons with the New York Giants,  
was hired by the Falcons in January 1997, he immediately called up 
his old friend. Bass consulted his doctor, who advised, ``Marvin, 
the best thing in the world for you would be to get out of the 
house and get busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he did. Bass downplays his role in the daily operation of the  
Falcons, but he breaks down film, helps out at practice and sits in 
on meetings. His life had a purpose again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to take those damn depression pills anymore,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after the Falcons' improbable season, Reeves and Bass will  
be returning to the Super Bowl for the fourth time to meet the 
Broncos Jan. 31. There's a twinkle in the old man's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football has been like a hobby for me,'' he said. ``You don't  
retire from hobbies, you retire to hobbies. That's why I enjoy it. 
It keeps me young being around the players.''

<HEADLINE> Warriors Open Camp to Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Eleven players sweated through  
ballhandling and passing drills as the Golden State Warriors 
finally opened their long-delayed training camp Thursday. The 
team's real action was taking place off the court, though. 
</P>
<P>
	As practice began at 11 a.m., general manager Garry St. Jean was  
on the phone finalizing the deal sending Latrell Sprewell to the 
New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, snags in the rookie contract of first-round  
draft pick Antawn Jamison were worked out. And throughout the day, 
St. Jean was trying to re-sign free agent forward Jason Caffey and 
fill out the rest of his squad's roster. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last few days, as the NBA lockout was being lifted, St.  
Jean was working from early morning to late night to try to improve 
a team that went 19-63 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``About the only thing I've had to eat all week is macaroni and  
cheese,'' St. Jean complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison could not participate in practice because his contract  
had not been signed. Donyell Marshall, now the team's 
longest-serving player with Sprewell gone, stood on the side 
because of a strained right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only been here 3 1/2 years and to be here the longest is  
funny,'' said Marshall, the subject of trade rumors this week. 
``I've been here longer than most of the people in the front 
office, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 11 players who worked out Thursday, fewer than half could  
be with the team on opening day. The Warriors reportedly were 
working on possible trades, and the team was looking at several 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Bimbo Coles was one of those players who worked out Thursday but  
was not quite sure how long he'll be a member of the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is if you're going to go somewhere else, you  
may as well work hard now because you've got to be in shape if you 
go somewhere else,'' he said. ``Any time your name is mentioned in 
trade talk you start to wonder. It's always in the back of your 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach P.J. Carlesimo said he had no idea of his starting lineup  
for this season, especially since the players acquired from the 
Knicks are not expected to join the Warriors until Friday at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got a long way to go,'' he said. ``We know we  
still have a lot of work to do with the roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing near the spot where Sprewell choked him 13 months ago,  
leading to the suspension of Sprewell for the rest of the 1997-98 
season, Carlesimo said he got no sense of closure simply because 
Sprewell had been traded to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the three players get here and we get them in our  
uniforms, that's the only closure I need,'' he said. ``We played 
without Latrell for a long time last year and we played without 
anyone in his place. This is a significant step forward for us.''

<HEADLINE>  NBA Officially Opens for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Get ready for the busiest day in NBA history.  
</P>
<P>
	Tons of trades are waiting be made, nearly 200 free agents are  
ready to start signing and training camps are opening. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``will be the craziest day in the history of the league,''  
agent Keith Glass said, ``and I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one.  
</P>
<P>
	After 204 days, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and  
countless fits, starts, fights and snags, the NBA lockout finally 
came to an official end Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six and a half months of pent-up business was to be conducted at  
2 p.m. EST today, with the floodgates opening on what should be 
well over 100 transactions. The schedule comes out at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' commissioner David Stern said after he  
and union president Patrick Ewing signed the nearly 300-page 
collective bargaining agreement. ``It was an incredible relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with the biggest unanswered free agent question  
being the future of Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Suns made a last-ditch effort to woo him to the  
desert after their own prized free agent, Antonio McDyess, decided 
to take less money to play for the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix can make moves to get about $8 million under the salary  
cap. That would mean the Suns could not offer Gugliotta the maximum 
$9 million. The Timberwolves, by comparison, can offer him the 
maximum with 12 1/2 percent raises -- a total of $86.2 million over 
seven years -- and then possibly trade him to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, Gugliotta could choose simply to stay in Minnesota.  
</P>
<P>
	That answer, and so many others about who will play where, what  
the schedule will look like and whether the fans will return, will 
be answered soon. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess decided early Wednesday evening to return to the  
Nuggets, the team he played for in his first two NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real close call,'' said McDyess' agent, James Bryant.  
``It came down to a question of do you want to inherit a contender 
or do you want to build one? Phoenix is a great franchise, but 
Denver is doing a lot of exciting things that haven't come out 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland was wondering whether the Washington Wizards  
would improve their offer of $30 million guaranteed for three 
years, with two additional non-guaranteed years. The Wizards issued 
a take-it or leave-it deadline of midnight Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's agent, David Falk, was trying to engineer a  
sign-and-trade deal, while also contemplating whether to advise 
Strickland to sign a one-year deal with another team and then 
re-enter the free-agent market next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman, meanwhile, said he will not retire.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK, so here's the deal,'' Rodman wrote in a message posted on  
his Web site. ``I've had some long discussions with the people I 
love, the ones whose opinions matter most to me, and I've decided 
not to retire after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he has would like to play in Chicago, Los Angeles, New  
York or overseas, Rodman also wrote: ``There's one thing I have 
always told my fans I would do in my last game that I still haven't 
done. I'm sure you know what it is, but I still have to come back 
for at least one more game so that I can get buck naked on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other players and their agents worked feverishly to finalize  
deals. Among the tentative agreements: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Christian Laettner heading to the Detroit Pistons in a  
sign-and-trade deal sending Charles O'Bannon and Scot Pollard to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Damon Stoudamire agreed to re-sign with Portland for $81  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dell Curry, the last of the original Hornets, was considering  
Portland or Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta and its free-agent forward, Alan Henderson, were far  
apart on money. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rick Fox agreed to take the $1.75 million exception from the  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Knicks reportedly reached agreements with their two free  
agents, Charlie Ward and Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Olden Polynice was deciding between the SuperSonics and  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Derek Harper was joining the Los Angeles Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Billy Owens was signing with Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jud Buechler was set to sign with Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Michael Stewart was close to signing with Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerome Kersey was headed to San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sam Perkins was ready to sign with Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric Murdock was joining New Jersey.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Rap impresario Master P, recently of the CBA's Fort Wayne  
Fury, was reportedly reporting to Hornets training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other unresolved questions was where Charlotte  
free-agent center Vlade Divac would sign. The Suns were interested 
if they lose both McDyess and Gugliotta, and the Sacramento Kings 
were weighing whether they should renounce the rights to free-agent 
Corliss Williamson in order to clear enough salary cap room to meet 
Divac's asking price. Several league sources insisted the 
SuperSonics were making a late push for Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	Other free agents, including Hot Rod Williams and Brent Barry,  
still were not sure where they would be signing. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were a slew of unconfirmed trade rumors involving  
Donyell Marshall, Bob Sura and John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a pent-up demand for information about players and  
playing, not about negotiators and negotiating,'' Stern said. 
``We're ready to get back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league released the schedule of exhibition games, with the  
first Sunday night at the United Center, with the Indiana Pacers 
taking on a team no one will recognize -- the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season will begin Feb. 5.

<HEADLINE>  Fossil Suggests Dinosaurs Were Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The best-preserved dinosaur fossil ever found  
suggests some of the extinct animals had the super-powerful lungs 
needed to be fast and deadly hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	A 110 million-year-old fossil of a baby dinosaur called  
Scipionyx is so well-preserved that researchers believe it bears 
the image of some of the animal's internal organs, said Nicholas 
Geist, a paleobiologist at Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extraordinary condition of the fossils allows us to hang  
some meat on the bones of these animals,'' said Geist, the senior 
author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you usually get in fossils is just bones, but in this one  
there are remnants of liver, large intestine, windpipe and 
muscle,'' he said. ``It is like a Rosetta stone for dinosaurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scipionyx was a theropod, a type of meat-eating dinosaur that  
walked on its hind legs, had a long tail, small forearms and a big 
head with a large mouth and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft tissue impressions show that the Scipionyx had a  
two-partition abdominal cavity, with the lungs and heart in one 
section and the liver and guts in the other. The liver was 
connected by muscle to a pelvic bone, Geist said, suggesting the 
animal had a breathing system called a hepatic piston. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a system, muscles pull against the liver, causing the  
breathing cavity to expand slightly. That forces air into the lungs 
at a high rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is necessary for sustained activity,'' said Geist.  
``These theropods were exceedingly fast and dangerous animals. They 
were not slow and sluggish like many modern reptiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mammals have a diaphragm muscle that causes the lung cavity to  
expand and draw in air. The ability to rapidly ventilate the lungs 
is essential for moving swiftly for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinosaurs' lung capacity may be one reason they dominated  
mammals for about 150 million years, said Geist. Mammals during 
this period were small and no match for the meat-eating dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	``These dinosaurs were fierce animals that could run prey down  
over extended distances,'' Geist said. ``This was like a 
turbocharged lizard. The mammals couldn't get a foothold and just 
tried to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hepatic piston works best in a warm, mild climate such as  
the Earth enjoyed during most of the dinosaur era. When the climate 
chilled, the dinosaurs were in trouble, Geist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals may have been so specialized for the warm  
climate, that even a minor change over an extended period may have 
helped do them in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all experts agree that the Scipionyx fossil gives such  
precise evidence of a hepatic pump breathing system, said Paul 
Soreno, a dinosaur expert at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many in the field, that interpretation is controversial,''  
said Soreno. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scipionyx fossil, the only dinosaur ever found in Italy, is  
small enough to hold in two hands and the animal may have been only 
days old when it died. Geist said it perished in a saltwater marsh 
that preserved its body structure. 
</P>
<P>
	No fossil for an adult Scipionyx has been found and Geist said  
the animal species probably grew to only about the size of a large 
dog.

<HEADLINE> Sunoco Net Income Up 79 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Despite sagging revenues, Sunoco Inc.'s  
earnings rose 79 percent in the fourth quarter as improved 
efficiency and lower crude oil prices gave the refining company's 
profits a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunoco's earned a net profit of $52 million, or 55 cents a  
share, for the last three months of 1988. A year earlier, quarterly 
profits were $29 million, or 25 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 16 percent to $2.14 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sunoco beat analysts' forecasts of 50 cents a share, as reported  
by First Call Corp. The company's stock rose 56 1/4, or 1.6 percent, 
to $34.75 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Bud Davis said revenue sagged partly due to  
tighter profit margins on fuels -- including gasoline that routinely 
sold for less than $1 a gallon -- and chemicals, while sales of 
those products remained virtually flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributing to the higher profits was an $18 million increase  
in earnings at the company's Sun Northeast Refining unit due to 
improved efficiency and lower crude oil prices. Income from the 
manufacture of coke used in steelmaking increased $7 million due to 
production from a new coke plant at East Chicago, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Sunoco's net income rose 6 percent to $280  
million, or $2.95 per share, from $263 million, or $2.70 a share, 
for 1997. Revenue for 1998 was $8.58 billion, down from $10.53 
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia-based Sunoco is one of the country's largest  
independent oil companies, operating five U.S. refineries and 
marketing Sunoco gasoline in 17 states from Maine to Virginia and 
west to Indiana. The company sells lubricants and petrochemicals 
worldwide.

<HEADLINE>  Investigator Details Utah Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Packages of cash and gifts worth $100,000 and  
more were common in Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Olympics, the IOC's chief investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the head of a six-member panel looking into the  
worst corruption scandal in Olympic history, said the payments were 
part of Salt Lake's plan to win favor for the Utah capital and, 
while perhaps not criminal, went far beyond the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Salt Lake folks were out to win friends, and they  
clearly thought friends would be more likely to support them than 
enemies, and did everything they could to strengthen those friendly 
ties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cases would be dealt with swiftly and firmly by the  
IOC executive board when it receives his report this weekend, and 
that offenders would be asked to resign or face expulsion. He said 
his investigation was treating all of the dozen members implicated 
on the same level. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, in his most extensive remarks since the scandal broke a  
month ago, also apologized for the corruption cases, especially to 
Salt Lake, which he said won the games on merit. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day-long series of speeches and interviews at a sports  
marketing summit, Pound refused to identify the IOC members under 
investigation or say exactly what gifts Salt Lake bidders 
apparently passed their way. 
</P>
<P>
	But he refused to deny a Wall Street Journal report that the  
payments totaled almost $800,000. And he said they were spread 
fairly evenly among a group that represented about 10 percent of 
the IOC's 114 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the members, but not all, received gifts in six  
figures,'' he said. ``That was in direct cash and benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the amounts had grown as IOC investigators reviewed  
books of the Salt Lake City bid committee that won the games in 
1995 on a fifth try. The payments, Pound said, started in late 
1991, shortly after Salt Lake had lost the 1998 Winter Games to 
Nagano by four votes, and continued in a few cases beyond the 
winning vote. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators were now ``99.5 percent'' sure they had  
identified the members who broke the rules in Salt Lake, the IOC 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other investigations are under way into the scandal,  
including ones by the Justice Department and the Utah attorney 
general. While those investigations will look at possible illegal 
activity, Pound, a Canadian tax lawyer, said his group found 
nothing ``with the earmarks of criminal action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if no direct bribes or vote buying in the secret ballot  
could be documented, Pound said, he had no doubt where the payments 
were aimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said that while his report being finalized deals only with  
the Salt Lake bid, broader investigations of how the IOC picks 
cities for the Olympics were needed. He said letters would be sent 
to all committees that bid for Summer and Winter Games from 1996 
through 2006, asking for details of any improprieties in their 
campaigns or improper approaches by members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense that Salt Lake is the first and only  
time this has happened,'' he said. ``We'll go from here to there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Games in 1996 were the first awarded fully under IOC  
ethics rules limiting gifts from bid cities. The 2006 Winter Games' 
host will be picked by the IOC in June. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was vital that those other bid committees tell all  
they know before a special general assembly in March called to deal 
with the corruption issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be best for all of us to deal fully, fairly and  
finally with this issue and not have it drag on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said a permanent way to investigate corruption was  
needed by the IOC, both to root out wrongdoers and cement faith of 
sponsors, fans and athletes that the Olympics are clean on all 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be an ongoing mechanism to deal with this,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The oversight could come from an extension of his own panel's  
tenure or be a piece of an overall ethics code for the IOC, a 
private club whose main asset has become a billion-dollar sports 
marketing machine over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about how many members were implicated in the scandal,  
Pound said to ``stick with'' the number of 13 given last week by 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. One member, Pirjo Haeggman of 
Finland, has since resigned. The Journal reported that 16 members 
would be implicated in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound disputed Samaranch's description of the investigation  
as having turned up nine ``serious'' cases worthy of expulsion and 
four other cases with fairly minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``A case is a case is a case,'' he said, noting that the only  
penalty provided in the IOC's bylaws was expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supreme recourse for us is to expel a member, and that is  
what we are prepared to do,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Sports Summit, Pound apologized for the  
scandal and said the case had left the IOC ``profoundly 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to express our sincere apologies for the actions of  
certain IOC members,'' said Pound, who spoke to an audience of 
sports marketing leaders. ``Their conduct has been completely 
contrary to everything the Olympic movement has worked so hard to 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
	``These actions are also an affront to the Olympic athletes who  
have inspired us through the years and whose lives so poignantly 
embody the Olympic ideals. ... Moreover, the IOC would like to 
express its deepest regrets to the people and community of Salt 
Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Salt Lake City won the 2002 Games ``because it  
produced the best, most comprehensive bid. End of story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are as well prepared as a city can be and they will,  
without a doubt in my mind, produce the greatest Winter Games we 
have seen to date,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Peter Tallberg, a Finnish member of the IOC for 23  
years, denied that his three sons working in Olympic bidding cities 
bore any significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to fear, and my conscience is fully clean,''  
Tallberg said. ``There is nothing special in the employment of my 
sons. The IOC has no rules against normal friendly and family 
connections. I have not done anything contrary to the IOC 
regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tallberg's youngest son, Peik, worked at a plumbing company  
owned by Paul Henderson, chairman of Toronto's bid for the 1996 
Summer Games. His middle son, Andreas, worked in Stockholm when the 
Swedish capital was bidding for the 2004 Summer Games, and his 
eldest son, Mathias, worked for an advertising agency in Sydney 
after the Australian city was elected to host the 2000 games.

<HEADLINE> Surgeon General Backs Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Placing tobacco in the same category as crack  
cocaine, Surgeon General David Satcher said Thursday that 
regulations on smoking are necessary to protect children and 
encourage overall good health. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children don't decide in utero whether they're going to be  
exposed to tobacco, alcohol, or crack cocaine,'' he told 200 people 
attending a summit on children's health hosted by the city's 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need in this country a system that actually promotes  
healthy lifestyles, and that includes avoiding toxins like tobacco, 
excessive use of alcohol and illicit drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher said President Clinton's State of the Union announcement  
Tuesday that the Justice Department would follow the lead of states 
and sue the tobacco industry ``makes a lot of sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher also supported Clinton's plan to raise cigarette taxes  
55 cents a pack and had little trouble coming up with ways to spend 
the money. He'd like to see more research on ways to get teen-agers 
to quit smoking, and what makes them start in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not measured yet the impact of smoking in the movies  
or on TV, where the hero or heroine is smoking,'' he said. ``I 
don't see anything that it has to do with the script, yet we often 
see them with cigarettes in their mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking is responsible for more than 400,000 deaths each year,  
making it the leading cause of death in the United States, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pippen, Houston Delay Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Almost four hours after a scheduled welcome to  
Texas for Scottie Pippen, the Houston Rockets called off the 
announcement late Thursday night, citing problems in the wording of 
the collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a problem with the collective bargaining agreement as  
it was written last year and as it was written this year,'' Rockets 
owner Les Alexander said. ``Because of that problem, it's going to 
take some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to get done, possibly as soon as tomorrow.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pippen said he still looked forward to being a member of the  
Rockets. He's already been in Houston getting accustomed to his new 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to thank all the fans for being very warm to me  
around the city the little time I've been here,'' Pippen said. 
``I'm looking forward to bringing a champion here. I can see I'm 
going to have a wonderful career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, said the problem was not with  
Pippen's five-year, $67.2 million contract. The Rockets and Pippen 
declined to define the contract problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the (Pippen's) contract,'' Sexton  
said. ``It's just that with us getting a chance to look at the 
collective bargaining agreement so late today, we have to work 
through the night to get it corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have it corrected later tonight. It has nothing to do  
with the trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rudy Tomjanovich canceled the scheduled first practice  
that was supposed to follow the announcement of Pippen's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls signed Pippen, then sent him to the Rockets  
for a second-round draft choice and forward Roy Rogers. Pippen will 
be paid $10.6 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also re-signed free agent Charles Barkley for $1  
million. With typical flare, Barkley signed his contract on the 
10th tee at La Quinta, Calif., where he was playing in the Bob Hope 
Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets started the day with only three players under  
contract, center Hakeem Olajuwon, guard Brent Price and second year 
guard-forward Rodrick Rhodes, who is out 6-8 weeks following 
surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right pectoral muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets called a 6 p.m. EST news conference to announce  
Pippen's signing but delayed the announcement for one hour to 
complete the deal. That turned into a lengthy wait for the Rockets 
players, who lounged in their locker room at Westside Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, had been with the Bulls since the 1987-88 season  
when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. He averaged 19.1 
points and 5.2 rebounds last season when the Bulls won their sixth 
NBA championship of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen will form a formidable front line with Barkley and  
Olajuwon, following the retirement of Clyde Drexler after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives the Rockets three of the players ranked among the  
top 50 in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets are hoping for the same result as in 1995 when they  
got Drexler from the Portland Trailblazers and won a second 
straight NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets sent Chucky Brown, Mark Bryant, Sam Cassell and  
Robert Horry to Phoenix in 1996 to bring Barkley on board but 
another title didn't follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-game schedule is conducive to the aging Rockets. Barkley  
is 35, Pippen 33, Olajuwon 36, and Eddie Johnson 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have four days to get ready for the first exhibition  
game, on Tuesday against the San Antonio Spurs in Houston. Houston 
opens the regular season Feb. 5 at Los Angeles against Lakers. The 
home opener is Feb. 8 against the Denver Nuggets.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Food maker Sara Lee Corp. reported Thursday that  
its second-quarter profits after charges rose despite weaker sales 
in its processed meats and coffee divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Dec. 26, net income was $322 million,  
or 34 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $1.3 billion, or 
$1.36 a share, the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Both periods included charges. The current quarter included a  
charge of $50 million, or 5 cents a share, to recall hot dogs and 
other meat produced at its Bil Mar Foods plant in Michigan after 
reports they might be contaminated with listeria, a type of 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, Sara Lee took a $1.6 billion charge, or  
$1.69 a share, to restructure and write down assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those charges, net income rose to $371 million, or 39  
cents a share, from $346 million, or 34 cents a share, the year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. The company's stock fell 87 1/2 
cents a share, or 3.4 percent, to $25.06 1/4 in afternoon trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue inched higher, to $5.29 billion from $5.28 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based maker of Coach leather goods, Jimmy Dean  
sausages and Hanes underwear reported strong gains in its intimate 
apparel, household and body care businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in its coffee and tea division fell 4.4 percent, while  
sales in the food division fell 1.3 percent, which the company 
blamed on lower commodity prices that were passed on to the 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee has been selling it manufacturing assets, allowing  
others to make its goods and marketing the brand names.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. reported  
fourth-quarter profits of $68.7 million, or 47 cents a share, 
meeting analysts' expectations but lower than their competitors, 
which beat Wall Street's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette saw its year-end earnings dip 32  
percent from the $101.4 million, or 77 cents a share, the New York 
investment bank earned in the final quarter of 1997, adjusted for a 
stock split last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $1.29 billion, down slightly from  
revenues of $1.33 billion in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, DLJ's competitors like Merrill Lynch and Bear  
Stearns reported profits that easily topped analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, DLJ's stock fell $4.93 3/4. or 9 percent, to $47.31 1/4  
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the all of 1998, DLJ earned $371 million, or $2.65 a share,  
compared with $408 million, or $3.16 a share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the year were a record $5.41 billion, up almost 16

<HEADLINE> Alaska Gov. Proposes Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- The prospect of billion-dollar budget  
shortfalls has Alaska's governor making two proposals once 
considered political death: reinstating an income tax and slicing 
off a chunk of the state's most sacred cow, the $24 billion Alaska 
Permanent Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Low prices for oil that provides most of the state's general  
revenue are expected to cause huge budget gaps several years. 
Keeping state government operating will require transfusions from a 
cash reserve that could be exhausted in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Alaskans pay no state income tax and no state sales  
tax while taking home an annual dividend from the Permanent Fund. 
The wildly popular payout reached a record $1,540.88 last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is we have the wealth and resources to fix the  
problem of stabilizing our fiscal future,'' Gov. Tony Knowles said 
Wednesday in his State of the State speech. ``The question is, do 
we have the wisdom and the will to make the savings and investment 
necessary to achieve a sustainable balanced budget or will we 
continue to borrow from the future?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state ditched its income tax in 1980 after oil money began  
flowing into the treasury in massive amounts. The state took in 
$4.1 billion in 1982, more than three times its projected general 
revenue for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time the average annual price for a barrel of North Slope  
crude drops a dollar, Alaska loses about $95 million. The price 
slipped under $9 a barrel in December, a record low for a commodity 
that usually sells for about $16 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	The new income tax would fall most heavily on people who come to  
Alaska only to work before returning to homes in the Lower 48. A 
family of four with a household income of less than $60,000 would 
pay nothing, Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax is expected to take in $350 million, about a third of  
the projected shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The part of the plan that could spark outrage from the public  
and send nervous politicians running for the exits is the dip into 
earnings of the sacrosanct Permanent Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund was created as a rainy-day account to guard against an  
inevitable decline in oil revenue, but the Legislature's decision 
to begin paying dividends in 1982 turned it into a political 
minefield. Elections turn on the barest hint that a candidate might 
support raiding the fund or reducing the dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles, a Democrat beginning his second and last term in the  
governor's mansion, wants to take $4 billion of the profits the 
fund has rolled up in the booming stock market and add it to the 
state's cash reserve. The reserve would then theoretically earn 
enough every year to bridge the remaining budget gap for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles has promised to submit any plan to spend Permanent Fund  
dollars to a public vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hurdle the proposal must clear is the  
Republican-dominated Legislature, where any mention of an income 
tax is unpopular and tapping the fund is no more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any solution to the fiscal gap will not be adopted by this  
Legislature until we make further reductions to state spending,'' 
Senate President Drue Pearce said of Knowles' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rank-and-file Republicans were even more blunt.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's robbing Alaskans' pocketbooks without cuts in  
government,'' said Rep. Ramona Barnes, a Republican from Anchorage.

<HEADLINE>  Fossil Suggests Dinosaurs Were Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The best-preserved dinosaur fossil ever found  
suggests some of the extinct animals had the super-powerful lungs 
needed to be fast and deadly hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	A 110 million-year-old fossil of a baby dinosaur called  
Scipionyx is so well-preserved that researchers believe it bears 
the image of some of the animal's internal organs, said Nicholas 
Geist, a paleobiologist at Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extraordinary condition of the fossils allows us to hang  
some meat on the bones of these animals,'' said Geist, the senior 
author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you usually get in fossils is just bones, but in this one  
there are remnants of liver, large intestine, windpipe and 
muscle,'' he said. ``It is like a Rosetta stone for dinosaurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scipionyx was a theropod, a type of meat-eating dinosaur that  
walked on its hind legs, had a long tail, small forearms and a big 
head with a large mouth and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft tissue impressions show that the Scipionyx had a  
two-partition abdominal cavity, with the lungs and heart in one 
section and the liver and guts in the other. The liver was 
connected by muscle to a pelvic bone, Geist said, suggesting the 
animal had a breathing system called a hepatic piston. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a system, muscles pull against the liver, causing the  
breathing cavity to expand slightly. That forces air into the lungs 
at a high rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is necessary for sustained activity,'' said Geist.  
``These theropods were exceedingly fast and dangerous animals. They 
were not slow and sluggish like many modern reptiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mammals have a diaphragm muscle that causes the lung cavity to  
expand and draw in air. The ability to rapidly ventilate the lungs 
is essential for moving swiftly for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinosaurs' lung capacity may be one reason they dominated  
mammals for about 150 million years, said Geist. Mammals during 
this period were small and no match for the meat-eating dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	``These dinosaurs were fierce animals that could run prey down  
over extended distances,'' Geist said. ``This was like a 
turbocharged lizard. The mammals couldn't get a foothold and just 
tried to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hepatic piston works best in a warm, mild climate such as  
the Earth enjoyed during most of the dinosaur era. When the climate 
chilled, the dinosaurs were in trouble, Geist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals may have been so specialized for the warm  
climate, that even a minor change over an extended period may have 
helped do them in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all experts agree that the Scipionyx fossil gives such  
precise evidence of a hepatic pump breathing system, said Paul 
Soreno, a dinosaur expert at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many in the field, that interpretation is controversial,''  
said Soreno. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scipionyx fossil, the only dinosaur ever found in Italy, is  
small enough to hold in two hands and the animal may have been only 
days old when it died. Geist said it perished in a saltwater marsh 
that preserved its body structure. 
</P>
<P>
	No fossil for an adult Scipionyx has been found and Geist said  
the animal species probably grew to only about the size of a large 
dog.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Co. Profits Up for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (AP) -- Genentech Inc. reported  
Thursday its fourth-quarter profits fell 12 percent from the same 
period of 1997, when the biotechnology company had substantial 
one-time revenues from one customer. 
</P>
<P>
	The biotechnology company earned $37 million, or 28 cents per  
diluted share, from $41.5 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter rose to $304.3 million from $277.1  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech's fourth-quarter 1997 results reflected substantial  
revenues from a deal with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. It did not 
have a similar deal in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did report good sales of two new drugs, including  
Herceptin, used by patients with metastatic breast cancer, and 
Rituxan, used to fight non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Herceptin won FDA 
approval in late September. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech reported a 41 percent increase in yearly profits, to  
$182 million or $1.40 per share from $129 million, or $1.02 per 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for 1998 were $1.15 billion, up from $1.02  
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Research and development expenses dropped to 34 percent of  
revenues, compared to 46 percent in 1997. But other costs 
increased, such as marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech has sold $30 million worth of Herceptin since  
launching the therapy on Oct. 5, and Rituxan sales totaled $163 
million in its first full year on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Activase decreased to $213 million from $261 million in  
1997 as doctors turned to other therapies for heart patients, and 
sales of growth hormone products decreased to $214 million from 
$227 million in 1997 due to increased competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Genentech rose 37 1/2 cents to close at $79 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Investigator Details Utah Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Packages of cash and gifts worth $100,000 and  
more were common in Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Olympics, the IOC's chief investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the head of a six-member panel looking into the  
worst corruption scandal in Olympic history, said the payments were 
part of Salt Lake's plan to win favor for the Utah capital and, 
while perhaps not criminal, went far beyond the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Salt Lake folks were out to win friends, and they  
clearly thought friends would be more likely to support them than 
enemies, and did everything they could to strengthen those friendly 
ties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cases would be dealt with swiftly and firmly by the  
IOC executive board when it receives his report this weekend, and 
that offenders would be asked to resign or face expulsion. He said 
his investigation was treating all of the dozen members implicated 
on the same level. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, in his most extensive remarks since the scandal broke a  
month ago, also apologized for the corruption cases, especially to 
Salt Lake, which he said won the games on merit. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day-long series of speeches and interviews at a sports  
marketing summit, Pound refused to identify the IOC members under 
investigation or say exactly what gifts Salt Lake bidders 
apparently passed their way. 
</P>
<P>
	But he refused to deny a Wall Street Journal report that the  
payments totaled almost $800,000. And he said they were spread 
fairly evenly among a group that represented about 10 percent of 
the IOC's 114 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the members, but not all, received gifts in six  
figures,'' he said. ``That was in direct cash and benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the amounts had grown as IOC investigators reviewed  
books of the Salt Lake City bid committee that won the games in 
1995 on a fifth try. The payments, Pound said, started in late 
1991, shortly after Salt Lake had lost the 1998 Winter Games to 
Nagano by four votes, and continued in a few cases beyond the 
winning vote. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators were now ``99.5 percent'' sure they had  
identified the members who broke the rules in Salt Lake, the IOC 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other investigations are under way into the scandal,  
including ones by the Justice Department and the Utah attorney 
general. While those investigations will look at possible illegal 
activity, Pound, a Canadian tax lawyer, said his group found 
nothing ``with the earmarks of criminal action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if no direct bribes or vote buying in the secret ballot  
could be documented, Pound said, he had no doubt where the payments 
were aimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said that while his report being finalized deals only with  
the Salt Lake bid, broader investigations of how the IOC picks 
cities for the Olympics were needed. He said letters would be sent 
to all committees that bid for Summer and Winter Games from 1996 
through 2006, asking for details of any improprieties in their 
campaigns or improper approaches by members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense that Salt Lake is the first and only  
time this has happened,'' he said. ``We'll go from here to there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Games in 1996 were the first awarded fully under IOC  
ethics rules limiting gifts from bid cities. The 2006 Winter Games' 
host will be picked by the IOC in June. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was vital that those other bid committees tell all  
they know before a special general assembly in March called to deal 
with the corruption issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be best for all of us to deal fully, fairly and  
finally with this issue and not have it drag on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said a permanent way to investigate corruption was  
needed by the IOC, both to root out wrongdoers and cement faith of 
sponsors, fans and athletes that the Olympics are clean on all 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be an ongoing mechanism to deal with this,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The oversight could come from an extension of his own panel's  
tenure or be a piece of an overall ethics code for the IOC, a 
private club whose main asset has become a billion-dollar sports 
marketing machine over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about how many members were implicated in the scandal,  
Pound said to ``stick with'' the number of 13 given last week by 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. One member, Pirjo Haeggman of 
Finland, has since resigned. The Journal reported that 16 members 
would be implicated in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound disputed Samaranch's description of the investigation  
as having turned up nine ``serious'' cases worthy of expulsion and 
four other cases with fairly minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``A case is a case is a case,'' he said, noting that the only  
penalty provided in the IOC's bylaws was expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supreme recourse for us is to expel a member, and that is  
what we are prepared to do,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Sports Summit, Pound apologized for the  
scandal and said the case had left the IOC ``profoundly 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to express our sincere apologies for the actions of  
certain IOC members,'' said Pound, who spoke to an audience of 
sports marketing leaders. ``Their conduct has been completely 
contrary to everything the Olympic movement has worked so hard to 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
	``These actions are also an affront to the Olympic athletes who  
have inspired us through the years and whose lives so poignantly 
embody the Olympic ideals. ... Moreover, the IOC would like to 
express its deepest regrets to the people and community of Salt 
Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Salt Lake City won the 2002 Games ``because it  
produced the best, most comprehensive bid. End of story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are as well prepared as a city can be and they will,  
without a doubt in my mind, produce the greatest Winter Games we 
have seen to date,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Peter Tallberg, a Finnish member of the IOC for 23  
years, denied that his three sons working in Olympic bidding cities 
bore any significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to fear, and my conscience is fully clean,''  
Tallberg said. ``There is nothing special in the employment of my 
sons. The IOC has no rules against normal friendly and family 
connections. I have not done anything contrary to the IOC 
regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tallberg's youngest son, Peik, worked at a plumbing company

<HEADLINE>  Gulf War Veteran Leads George Mason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- George Evans is a Gulf War veteran who  
bought back guns for the U.S. Army on the streets of Haiti, drove 
Gen. John Shalikashvili around Belgium and watched in horror as 
people jumped into fires to find food in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is a 27-year-old sophomore forward who is leading George  
Mason to its best basketball season this decade. He leads the team 
in scoring, rebounding, blocked shots -- and level-headed 
perspective. After all, missing a layup in a game is nothing 
compared to the fight to liberate Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a lot,'' Evans said. ``But I thank God I have the  
life that I have now. I'm just trying to make it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Evans' latest mission, helping turn the Patriots into a  
winning program, is easy. Even though he grew up in Portsmouth, 
Va., and was based less than 100 miles away in Aberdeen, Md., 
during his seven-year stint in the Army, basketball in the D.C. 
area to him meant Georgetown, Maryland and George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never heard of George Mason until I got a call from (Paul)  
Westhead,'' said Evans, who was recruited by several schools 
because of his play with a touring Army select team. ``I signed a 
letter of intent without even visiting the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westhead is the former NBA coach whose effort to bring his  
run-and-gun style to George Mason was a failure in four losing 
seasons. He also had numerous off-the-court problems with players. 
When Westhead was fired in 1997, Evans was ready to change his mind 
about attending George Mason until new coach Jim Larranaga 
re-recruited him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 1 1/2 years later, Larranaga, Evans and a roster of good  
athletes with growing defensive prowess have the Patroits (9-8, 6-2 
Colonial Athletic Association) playing well. They started a 
school-best 5-0 in the CAA and trailed first-place Old Dominion by 
a half-game following Wednesday night's 77-68 victory over Virginia 
Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine victories match the total from last year's 9-18 team,  
and a winning record is possible for the first time since Ernie 
Nestor's team went 20-12 in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here, I said that George Mason is a sleeping  
giant,'' Larranaga said. ``The biggest thing was establishing a new 
philosophy. We spend a lot of time with players off the court. We 
tell them they are role models. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The offense) changed from Day One. The first 3-pointer that  
(6-foot-9 center) Nik Mirich shot was the last. Before the ball hit 
the rim, there was a substitute at the scorer's table. I think I 
got my message across right away that it was going to be a lot more 
disciplined and a lot more fundamentals stressed. And, most 
importantly, putting a lot of emphasis into the defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which meant Evans would be just the player to lead the team in  
the locker room. Larranaga's two words to describe Evans are 
discipline and respect, essentials from military life that transfer 
easily to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned a lot about discipline and teamwork'' in the Army,  
Evans said. ``I learned that I had to depend on someone else more 
than I could depend on myself. He's watching my back and I'm 
watching his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, who has to put up with good-natured ``old man'' banter  
from teammates, left the Army because it began to wear on him after 
so many high-stress assignments. His decision to get a college 
degree has brought more stress: His wife took a job in Florida, so 
he only gets to see her and their 7-year-old daughter during 
college breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Evans said. ``But I can't let my wife know it's  
tough, because she barely handles it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans leads the CAA in scoring (17.7 points), and is in the top  
five in rebounding (8.5), blocks (2.82) and steals (2.05). Still, 
his exploits don't come close to filling even half of the 
10,000-seat Patriot Center, which never has been sold out for a 
basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Larranaga says success eventually will draw fans. For Evans,  
that could start with winning the CAA. Then he could emulate his 
brother Darrian, a senior forward for South Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went to the (NCAA) tournament last year,'' Evans said.  
``I'm trying to get there this year.''

<HEADLINE> Kings Owner Won't Get Baseball Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A week after Jim Thomas said he was  
selling his controlling interest in the NBA Sacramento Kings and 
Arco Arena, the city dropped him from a list of possible developers 
for a baseball stadium and entertainment complex adjacent to the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy City Manager Jack Crist said Thomas Development Partners  
had requested a 30-day extension on a scheduled Tuesday 
presentation of its proposal for a sports, entertainment and retail 
complex that would have included an 8,000-seat minor league park. 
</P>
<P>
	Crist said the Thomas proposal, one of three pending for the  
site, would not be considered further. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going past the pretty package stage and getting to the  
nitty-gritty,'' Crist said on Wednesday, explaining why Thomas 
wasn't given an additional 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he asked for the delay so the Maloof family from New  
Mexico and Las Vegas, which bought out his interest in the Kings 
and Arco effective July 1, could have time to get familiar with the 
ballpark project. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 30 days was for the Maloofs,'' Thomas said in a telephone  
interview from Los Angeles. ``For them to get up to speed with our 
project and get involved and take it over. That was the whole 
point. We didn't have a chance to work out any details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he has always felt it important for the developers  
of the 100-acre, city-owned site to be part of the Kings and Arco 
ownership so there is no conflict over what is developed next to 
the basketball team's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the city makes a big mistake in splitting those up,''  
he said. ``Obviously, if you own the arena, you're very concerned 
about what is going next door. You don't want anything that is 
competitive or undermines the arena in any way. There are parking 
issues and a whole lot of other issues to be considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family, which owned the NBA Houston Rockets from 1979  
through 1982, purchased a one-quarter interest in the Kings one 
year ago for $37.5 million, with an option to purchase the rest of 
Thomas' 53 percent interest in the team and arena. No details last 
week's sale have been revealed.

<HEADLINE> United Technology Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Machinery maker United Technologies Corp.  
reported fourth-quarter profits of $287 million today, an 18 
percent increase above the same quarter a year ago. Strong showings 
in its aircraft and refrigeration businesses were factors in the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings, were equivalent to $1.16 per diluted share, beat  
analysts' expectations of $1.11 a share, as reported by First Call 
Corp. The company's stock was up $3, or 2.7 percent, to $115 in 
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, UTC earned $244 million, or 97 cents per  
diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the fourth quarter rose 10 percent to $6.80 billion,  
up from $6.20 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	At UTC's Carrier heating and air-conditioning business,  
operating profit increased 45 percent in the quarter on 20 percent 
higher revenues. Pratt &AMP; Whitney, UTC's jet-engine business, 
boosted profit 16 percent on 4 percent revenue growth mainly due to 
improved performance in Pratt &AMP; Whitney Canada and the large 
military engine business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said profits at its automotive business fell 43  
percent during the quarter due to customer pricing pressures, 
higher spending on future programs and a write-off at an interior 
trim plant. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC also said it has hired an investment firm to explore a  
possible sale of its automotive operations. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC Chairman George David said consolidations within the  
automotive components industry prompted the company to retain 
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. to look at alternatives for UTC Automotive. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, earnings rose 17 percent to $1.26 billion, or  
$5.05 per diluted share, compared with $1.07 billion, or $4.21 per 
share, in 1997. Annual revenues climbed 6 percent to $25.72 
billion, up from $24.22 billion in 1997.

<HEADLINE> A New Twist in Bizarre Yale Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A woman accused of faking her  
credentials to get into Yale University, then concocting a phony 
rape story after failing to show up in court, got a one-week delay 
in her case today after her lawyer disclosed yet another bizarre 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Norman A. Pattis said that he had received an  
anonymous letter on Yale stationery, claiming that his client, 
Tonica Jenkins, had been mistreated by Yale. Attached to the 
letter, he said, were photos of Jenkins bound and gagged. 
</P>
<P>
	The anonymous letter appeared to be on university letterhead and  
purported to be from someone in the neurobiology program in which 
Jenkins was enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, which Pattis said he received Wednesday night, was  
presented in court during the hearing in which Superior Court Judge 
Roland D. Fasano had scheduled for Jenkins to answer an ultimatum 
on accepting a plea bargain or going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pattis said he had ``no idea, none'' on whether the letter was  
authentic. 
</P>
<P>
	Fasano told Pattis he would give the defense lawyer the benefit  
of the doubt and gave him until a week from today to investigating 
the letter and photos. Jenkins, 23, was present during today's 
hearing but did not speak. She did nod when the judge told her the 
case had been postponed a week. 
</P>
<P>
	No one questioned her in court on the circumstances of the  
photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins was arrested in December 1997 on charges that she got  
into Yale's graduate program in neurobiology that fall by forging 
transcripts and submitting phony recommendations. The university 
had awarded Jenkins a $10,600 grant and a $4,500 stipend when she 
began classes. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials had begun looking into her background when she  
twice tried to skip exams. 
</P>
<P>
	If she does not accept the plea agreement, Jenkins faces trial  
charges of larceny, forgery, escape and two counts of failure to 
appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded innocent to those charges, as well as a charge of  
attempted escape after she allegedly tried to flee when she was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	She was declared a fugitive last summer when she failed to  
appear in court for a hearing. The following day, police found her 
at home in Ohio. She told police there that a man had abducted her 
from a parking lot in New Haven, raped her, put her in the trunk of 
her car and drove south. She said she escaped after the rapist 
abandoned the car in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	When she arrived in Connecticut the following week, Superior  
Court Judge Richard A. Damiani said he didn't believe her story and 
sent her to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins spent three weeks at the York Correctional Institution  
for women in Niantic before posting $150,000 bond. While in prison, 
she allegedly attacked and injured two guards and another person 
who attempted to subdue her. She was charged with two counts of 
assault on a corrections officer. Those charges could be folded 
into the forgery case if Jenkins accepts the state's offer, Pattis 
has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins never filed a formal claim with police on the alleged  
rape. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was transferred from Damiani to Fasano as part of a  
routine court rotation of duties.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers Try To Turn Tables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Who's on trial here, President Clinton or his  
accusers? 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers are trying to turn the tables on GOP House  
prosecutors, claiming their impeachment case is politically 
charged, flawed and unfair. Perjury? Nonsense, they say. 
Obstruction of justice? No case, they claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-written indictment ``falls well below the most  
basic, minimal standards and should not be used to impeach and 
remove this president,'' presidential counselor Greg Craig told the 
Senate Wednesday. His colleague, Cheryl Mills, accused the House of 
encouraging senators to ignore evidence that exonerates Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a legal basis for impeaching Clinton, the president's  
lawyers suggest, the only reason for putting him on trial is a 
partisan campaign to embarrass and weaken him and push him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do not inject a poison of bitter partisanship into the body  
politic which, like a virus, can move through our national 
bloodstream for years to come, with results none can know or 
calculate,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	But political strains run deep through this impeachment drama,  
from the party-line votes against the president in the House 
Judiciary Committee and the full House to the all-Republican makeup 
of the 13-member House prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a strong advantage for the White House if it can keep  
the impeachment case on a partisan footing. After a year of the 
Monica Lewinsky saga, Americans still give Clinton high approval 
ratings, want him to stay in office and hope the impeachment case 
goes away. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate decides Clinton's fate on a partisan vote, the  
president wins. To achieve the 67 votes required to throw Clinton 
out of office, Republicans would have to peel away at least 12 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, himself a former federal  
prosecutor, complained that Clinton's attorneys were improperly 
trying to make it a case of the GOP managers versus the White 
House. ``This should not be a battle between the managers and the 
White House defense team,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while attacking the Republican prosecution, the White House  
presented a show of humility for the Senate judges, Republicans and 
Democrats alike. To lawmakers who have complained about legalistic, 
hairsplitting responses from the White House, Craig said, ``We 
apologize to you and to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's trial runs longer, likely into February,  
Republicans run the risk of being seen as obsessed with impeachment 
instead of matters like Social Security and education that 
Americans care about. Many Republicans fear there is a real threat 
that, on the heels of election losses in November, they could lose 
control of the House and Senate two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the trial runs on, there also are more opportunities for  
surprise that could sting Clinton. There are no advantages for 
Republicans or Democrats. ``The Democrats take the president's 
line'' that shorter is better, said Stephen Hess, political analyst 
at the Brookings Institution. ``The Republicans have seen this 
whole scandal like a third rail -- any institution that touches it 
gets badly burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's strong poll numbers climbed even higher after his  
State of the Union address Tuesday night. In an outpouring of 
support, more than 20,000 snow-weary people turned out in Buffalo, 
N.Y., to cheer Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a prominent conservative, television evangelist Pat  
Robertson, said Clinton ``hit a home run'' in his speech and that 
``from a public relations standpoint, he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing and get on  
with something else,'' Robertson said on his television program, 
``because it's over as far as I'm concerned.''

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke May Have To Pay Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials want Richard  
Holbrooke, President Clinton's choice to be U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations, to pay a civil penalty for alleged improper 
contacts with former colleagues in the government, officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged conflict of interest was uncovered during an FBI  
investigation begun after Clinton announced his choice of Holbrooke 
for the high-profile diplomatic post seven months ago. The 
nomination has yet to be submitted to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are negotiations under way that stem from our  
investigation,'' one Justice Department official said, requesting 
anonymity. ``The negotiations (with Holbrooke and his attorney) are 
over a possible civil penalty for improper conflicts of interest.'' 
No criminal violations were uncovered by the FBI probe, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Justice official said the case involved Holbrooke's  
allegedly contacting former State Department colleagues sooner than 
the law allowed after he went to work in February 1996 for the 
investment banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. 
Federal ethics laws limit the lobbying contacts that former 
officials can have for a period after leaving the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty in such a case would likely be a fine of several  
thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that the FBI had cleared  
Holbrooke of allegations of improper contacts with U.S. Embassy 
officials in Hungary in 1995, but had questioned his contact with 
at least one U.S. Embassy employee in South Korea within months 
after Holbrooke's departure from the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Holbrooke nor his attorney was immediately available to  
respond to the report from officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quoted a friend of Holbrooke as saying the Korea  
contact was ``ridiculously minor'' and offered no financial reward 
for Holbrooke or his employer. Holbrooke's friends were quoted by 
the Times as saying he balked at paying a several-thousand-dollar 
fine because he believed he had done nothing wrong and because such 
a settlement might endanger his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said last month they hoped the  
investigations could be wrapped up early this year, and Holbrooke, 
chief architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace accord and recent 
settlement in Kosovo, cleared of any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hasn't wavered in his support of Holbrooke, despite the  
delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the tremendous effort he did in Kosovo, the president is  
even more determined to make sure he takes up his spot at the 
United Nations as expeditiously as possible,'' White House 
spokesman David Leavy said last month.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The trade deficit shot up to $15.5 billion in  
November as American exports of aircraft, computer equipment and 
farm products fell sharply while imports climbed to an all-time 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	The November deficit was up 14 percent from a revised October  
figure of $13.6 billion, the Commerce Department reported today. 
U.S. manufacturers continued to be battered by the global financial 
crisis, which has cut deeply into their export sales while 
triggering a flood of cheaper imports into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, with one month still to be counted, the U.S. trade  
deficit in goods and services has already hit an all-time high of 
$153.9 billion, surpassing the old mark of $153.4 billion set back 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	After December is counted, the deficit for the year is likely to  
climb to around $164 billion, far above last year's $110 billion. 
And economists are predicting even worse news for 1999 as 
recessions over more than one-third of the globe cut into U.S. 
exports and beleaguered Asian countries try to export their way 
back to prosperity by shipping goods to America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has taken to insisting that the  
United States cannot be the ``importer of only resort'' and has 
called on Europe, the other region of the world still prospering in 
the face of global adversity, to take more goods as well. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his State of the Union address this week,  
also announced the United States will push for launching a new 
global round of trade liberalization talks aimed at countering 
rising protectionist forces. 
</P>
<P>
	However, domestic political pressures are forcing Clinton to  
take a tougher protectionist line when it comes to one key 
industry, steel. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday  
that if December trade figures do not show ``substantial declines'' 
in imports of Japanese steel, the government will begin proceedings 
to slap penalty tariffs on Japanese steel imports into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade figures released today indicate that the surge in  
steel imports had begun to abate in November although steel imports 
for all of 1998 are still far ahead of the 1997 pace. Steel imports 
from Japan were down $47.3 million to $306 million in November. But 
for the first 11 months of the year, steel imports from Japan were 
up $1.27 billion to $2.88 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in Japanese steel has contributed to a sharp widening  
in the trade gap between the world's two largest economies and led 
to growing trade frictions in a number of areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration continues to insist that until the Japanese  
government deals more forcefully with its worst recession in a half 
century, the rest of its troubled Asian nations have little hope 
from emerging from their own deep downturns. 
</P>
<P>
	While America's deficits with both Japan and China were down  
slightly in November, for the year they were running well ahead of 
the 1997 pace. For Japan, the deficit totaled $58.2 billion through 
November, up 14 percent from a year ago, and for China, the 
11-month total was $52.9 billion, an increase of 15.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the entire Pacific Rim region, epicenter of the crisis that  
began in Thailand in July 1997, the U.S. trade deficit is up a 
sharp 34 percent to $148.7 billion through November. 
</P>
<P>
	For November, imports rose 0.4 percent to an all-time high of  
$94.1 billion. This reflected big increases in imports of computer 
chips, telecommunications equipment, autos and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports fell 1.9 percent to $78.7 billion as sales of farm  
products such as soybeans, rice and wheat declined. Sales of 
manufactured goods including commercial aircraft, computer 
equipment, computer chips and telecommunications products were down 
as well.

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey State Police, outraged over  
having to provide security at a benefit concert for convicted cop 
killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, must work the event after state officials 
concluded there was no legal way to cancel it. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I deplore this concert and its cause, legally our  
hands are tied,'' Attorney General Peter Verniero said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine and Bad Religion  
headline the sold-out, $30-a-ticket concert scheduled for Jan. 28 
at the Meadowlands complex, a few miles west of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the $480,000 in proceeds will be donated to the  
defense fund of Abu-Jamal, a black former radio reporter on 
Pennsylvania's death row for the 1981 killing of a white 
Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero said the state couldn't sue to cancel the concert  
because of a 1997 federal judge's decision that went against the 
state when it tried to block a Marilyn Manson concert. The ruling 
said the state-run Continental Airlines Arena -- the same site as 
next week's concert -- was a public venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Robinson, New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority  
president and chief executive, said the promoter, DelsenerSlater in 
New York, told him about the concert's purpose only a week before 
tickets went on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticketholders who are no longer interested in attending the  
concert will be reimbursed, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	State police routinely back up private security at the  
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers scheduled to work the concert will not be able to  
request a change in assignment, State Police spokesman John Hagerty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``State police put their emotions aside every single day,''  
Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Graffin, lead singer of Bad Religion, said the groups  
organized the concert to raise awareness about the ``evils'' of the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings, including the 1995 book ``Live  
from Death Row,'' have made him a celebrity around the world, 
attracting the support of death penalty opponents and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal was convicted in the shooting of Daniel Faulkner, 26,  
who had stopped Abu-Jamal's brother for a traffic violation. Police 
found the dying officer and a wounded Abu-Jamal lying near his own 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has said police coerced an eyewitness to testify  
against him and stacked a jury with whites. Police and prosecutors 
have said he was fairly convicted.

<HEADLINE> Penalty Phase Begins in Capano Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Prosecutors asking that a wealthy lawyer  
be executed for murdering his mistress said Wednesday that Thomas 
Capano arranged to have another woman harassed after she spurned 
his advances. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Marandola, who worked for a friend of Capano's, testified  
that Capano pursued her incessantly during the late 1970s and early 
1980s. She said she refused the married lawyer's advances because 
she was engaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marandola, 44, said Capano told her his wife was pregnant  
but that ``he wished it was me giving birth to his child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marandola then said she received harassing telephone calls  
from an anonymous caller who said he knew about previous sexual 
encounters she had with Capano and would tell her husband if she 
didn't pay up. 
</P>
<P>
	That caller, Joseph Riley, taped the phone calls he had with Ms.  
Marandola and Capano and turned them over to the FBI, saying Capano 
had arranged for him to make the calls, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls, which were played in court, show Riley and Capano  
plotting how and when the calls should be made, with Capano urging, 
``The pressure has to be strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the jury convicted Capano, a 49-year-old former state  
prosecutor and adviser to a governor and a mayor, of killing Anne 
Marie Fahey, who disappeared in June 1996. The same jury began a 
hearing Wednesday to decide whether Capano should be executed or 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Capano killed Ms. Fahey, the governor's  
scheduling secretary, because she wanted to end their secret 
affair. Capano claimed another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, 
accidentally killed Ms. Fahey. Ms. MacIntyre denies this. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano said he dumped Ms. Fahey's body in the Atlantic Ocean to  
protect Ms. MacIntyre and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors told the jury Capano should be executed because of  
the nature of Ms. Fahey's death and the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing is expected to last into next week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defense Prepares Day 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concluding the first phase of President  
Clinton's impeachment trial, his lawyers are urging senators to 
reject allegations of legal wrongdoing and focus on ``the big 
picture'' -- an attempt by a married man to hide an extramarital 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	For their third and final day of oral presentations to rebut  
perjury and obstruction of justice charges, the Clinton team is 
combining the methodical arguments of private lawyer David Kendall 
with the oratory of Dale Bumpers. Bumpers, a former Democratic 
senator from Arkansas and longtime friend of Clinton, is known as a 
gifted public speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Bumpers finishes, senators who have been forced under trial  
rules to sit in uncharacteristic silence will have another 
unfamiliar task -- submitting questions in writing to Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist, who as presiding officer will read them and ask 
the lawyers and House prosecutors to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning is expected to begin Friday and continue  
Saturday. Some 70 questions have been submitted by Republicans so 
far, a GOP spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The question period may be the phase of the trial conducted in a  
bipartisan spirit. Subsequent motions to dismiss the case and call 
witnesses such as former White House intern Monica Lewinsky likely 
will break down largely along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said they oppose dismissal and support the need  
for limited live testimony from key witnesses such as Ms. Lewinsky, 
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and presidential secretary Betty 
Currie -- and should get their way with a 55-45 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with a two-thirds majority needed to make Clinton the  
first president evicted from his job, Democrats hold the votes for 
acquittal and show no signs of backing a move to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.  
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union 
address Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to 72 
percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One well-known conservative Republican, evangelist and  
broadcaster Pat Robertson, said Clinton pulled off such a public 
relations coup in the address that there is no chance he will be 
convicted. ``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing 
and get on with something else,'' he said on ``The 700 Club'' 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers was chosen to make the argument that the House case was  
a ``partisan rush to judgment'' that doesn't meet with the ``higher 
duty the Senate has always had,'' an adviser to the White House 
said Wednesday. Bumpers, who retired this year after 24 years in 
the Senate, also was chosen because he can talk ex-senator to 
senator, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, in town to attend a Senate  
lecture series sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., declined a chance to discuss the impeachment trial. But 
speaking in the Old Senate Chamber Wednesday evening, the former 
Republican president lamented that today in Washington, ``we are 
confronted with a deficit of decency -- one that deepens by the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's defense before senators Wednesday, Deputy White  
House Counsel Cheryl Mills argued that House managers ignored 
testimony from Mrs. Currie in order to falsely accuse the president 
of trying to obstruct the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense lawyer cited Mrs. Currie's testimony that Clinton  
never asked her to pick up gifts from Ms. Lewinsky after the 
presents were subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. Mrs. Currie 
testified it was Ms. Lewinsky who asked her to retrieve the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Ms. Mills said the prosecutors ignored Mrs.  
Currie's testimony that Clinton was not trying to pressure his 
secretary when he questioned her about her recollection of his 
actions with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those facts, those stubborn facts that just don't fit,''  
Ms. Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the House prosecutors said later that Ms. Mills had  
actually made a good case -- their case -- for the calling of 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went straight to Monica Lewinsky and attacked her  
credibility on the gift issue. And certainly the testimony of 
Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie is in conflict, and she emphasized 
that over and over again, of course supporting the credibility of 
Betty Currie,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a decision that the senators have to make, when you  
have testimony in conflict, as to which direction you're going to 
go. And the only way you resolve that is by calling of witnesses 
who are, in fact, in conflict,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mills finished with an emotional flourish, contending ``the  
foundation of the house of civil rights was never at the core of 
the Jones case. The foundation of the house of civil rights is in 
the voices of all the great civil rights leaders and the soul of 
every person who heard them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, continuing a defense theme that Clinton's conduct was  
terribly wrong but not criminal or impeachable, she told the Senate 
that the law must be upheld ``even when it protects behavior that 
we don't like or is unattractive or is not admirable or that might 
even be hurtful.''

<HEADLINE> Some Patients Wait Longer for Organ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Nebraska, patients wait for nearly a year  
and eight months for a liver transplant. In neighboring Iowa, the 
wait is just 46 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Disparities like this stretch across the country, according to a  
sweeping, seven-volume government report being released today and 
obtained Thursday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in waiting times were found among all types of  
transplants. Federal officials said it was fresh evidence of how 
arbitrary geographic barriers make for an unfair system. They said 
that in New York City, patients waited nearly 10 times as long as 
similar patients across the Hudson River in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge difference, and it's hard to ignore,'' said Dr.  
Claude Earl Fox, who heads the Department of Health and Human 
Services division that oversees the transplant program. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the gap? In some communities, people are more likely to  
donate organs, creating a larger supply there. Also, the best 
transplant programs tend to attract large numbers of patients, 
creating longer waits in those areas. Nebraska, for instance, is 
home to a large liver transplant program, as is Pittsburgh, where 
the wait for a typical patient with type O blood lasted 721 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to equalize waiting times, HHS has ordered a change in  
the way scarce organs are allocated. It is crucial to thousands of 
American families: Some 4,000 people die each year awaiting a 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, organs are distributed geographically, offered first  
to patients in the community where they are donated, then to 
patients in the region. The government wants to offer organs to the 
sickest patients first, no matter where they live, as long as they 
have a reasonable chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report was prepared by the leading opponents of a policy  
change, the United Network for Organ Sharing. The group coordinates 
the transplant system under a contract with the government, which 
asked for the study. A copy of the 2,400-page document was obtained 
by the AP under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also finds a wide disparity in how effective the  
nation's 63 organ banks are at counseling families considering 
donation and at making transplants happen -- reaching the same 
conclusion as an AP analysis in September. 
</P>
<P>
	In its examination of waiting times, the report looked at liver,  
heart, kidney, pancreas and lung transplants. In an attempt to 
control for variables that may affect waiting times, it analyzed 
the statistics by race, age, blood type and how sick patients were. 
</P>
<P>
	In virtually every instance, the report documented differences  
among regions and organ banks. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, although the differences were narrower for the  
very sickest patients, even they waited just two days for a liver 
transplant in Oklahoma and Oregon -- but 16 days in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences have narrowed since 1996, the last year covered  
in the report, contended Dr. Joshua Miller, president of the 
American Society of Transplant Surgeons. Transplant centers have 
stepped up efforts to make sure all of the most critically ill 
patients have equal access. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, the disparity stems from inconsistent policies about  
how sick patients should be before they're put on a waiting list, 
Miller said. Some have put patients on them earlier, creating 
longer lists. The network and the government have been working to 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the larger issue of how to allocate scarce organs, the  
network and HHS have been fighting for months. Transplant surgeons 
say the government proposal would lead to more deaths because 
sicker patients would get more organs, and they are less likely to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can fight about it all day,'' said Dr. William Pfaff, a  
surgeon at the University of Florida who heads the transplant 
network. ``You're not going to drastically improve anyone's 
situation by shipping organs across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But government officials point to differences like those between  
New York City and New Jersey, separated by a state line and a 
river, but with large differences in waiting times. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York patient with blood type O, the most common, would  
wait nearly twice as long for a new kidney, three times as long for 
a heart and 10 times as long for a liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``An organ that could save a life may be literally stopped at  
the border,'' HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--A large difference in organ banks' success at getting people to  
donate. In Mississippi, there were just 6.4 organ donors for every 
1,000 hospital deaths; in Madison, Wis., there were 34. 
Explanations included the program's effectiveness, the ethnic 
makeup of the community and the proportion of deaths that are 
medically appropriate for donation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Blacks waited twice as long for kidney and pancreas  
transplants, because there are more blacks in need of transplant 
than there are black donors. Often, organs from black people make 
better medical matches for black patients. 
</P>
<P>
	For all its detail, though, the report fails to give waiting  
times for individual transplant hospitals -- something government 
officials say patients need to choose among transplant programs.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Decry Bush, Moderates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Presidential hopefuls courted  
conservative activists Thursday by attacking the early GOP 
front-runner, George W. Bush, and ``mushy moderates'' in the 
establishment wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no  
substitute for a muscular, substantive agenda,'' millionaire 
businessman Steve Forbes told the Conservative Political Action 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he did not mention Bush by name, Forbes clearly was  
referring to the Texas governor and his ``compassionate 
conservative'' ideology. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadening his attack, Forbes reminded the crowd of influential  
conservative activists that Bush's father, former President Bush, 
and Elizabeth Dole's husband, former Senator Bob Dole, lost the 
last two presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mrs. Dole and Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle,  
considering presidential bids of their own, Forbes said the 
fledgling 2000 field includes names that ``sound familiar. But, my 
friends, we have been down that electoral cul-de-sac twice before. 
I suggest we try something new for a change -- like winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was soon joined by other GOP hopefuls, including former  
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and activist Gary Bauer, in drawing 
the battle lines between the party's conservative and establishment 
wings. The strategy is most important to Forbes and Alexander, 
neither of whom is well rooted in social conservative circles. 
</P>
<P>
	The sniping, coming a year before the first primary votes will  
be cast, was part of a busy day in GOP politics. Among the other 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
	--Quayle said Thursday night he will file a formal statement of  
candidacy next week, the first step in his bid for the presidency. 
``I've thought about this for a long time. I've wanted to be 
president for a long time, and the year 2000 is looking like my 
opportunity,'' he said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' ``When you say 
compassionate conservatism, you are basically attacking 
conservatism because you are saying conservatives aren't 
compassionate,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Republican National Committee, opened its three-day winter  
meeting in Washington. The highlight will be the vote Friday to 
determine whether to oust Chairman Jim Nicholson for the party's 
poor showing in 1998 elections. Supporters of Florida party 
Chairman Tom Slade, the only challenger, gained some momentum 
Thursday but needs several Nicholson backers to switch their 
allegiance in secret balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	--A controversial resolution that would have forbidden the RNC  
from taking money from the gambling industry was rejected by an RNC 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who received three standing ovations  
at CPAC, warned against playing politics with religion. ``If we are 
going to try to use God as a wedge issue, I think it's wrong and 
it's dumb,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said he doesn't believe  
New York Gov. George Pataki has any plans to enter the presidential 
primaries, but, D'Amato told an Albany radio station, ``if the 
leaders stumble along the way, he could then move to run for 
president or certainly be selected as the vice presidential 
nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki announced Wednesday he has formed a political action  
committee to finance his stepped-up travel across the country for a 
series of speeches and to make donations to other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Dole did not attend CPAC, but the governor's office  
quickly responded to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is somewhat perplexing that fellow Republicans would attack  
a popular conservative governor of a very conservative state whose 
overwhelming re-election proved a conservative philosophy can erase 
the gender gap and attract a record number of minority voters while 
remaining true to conservative principles,'' said Bush spokeswoman 
Karen Hughes in a telephone interview from Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, Bauer and Forbes compared Bush's ``compassionate  
conservative'' slogan to his father's promise to be a ``kinder and 
gentler'' Republican. They want the conservative activists, many of 
whom are still angry at President Bush for raising taxes, to punish 
the son for the father's missteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not long after we qualified our language, we were qualifying  
our principles,'' Alexander said, referring to the elder Bush. ``We 
accepted a tax increase ... and soon found ourselves vacating the 
White House for the first time in 12 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer didn't criticize Bush in his speech, but told reporters  
that conservatives ``need to know that the last Bush talked about 
kinder and gentler, and that resulted in an election loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' rhetoric was the toughest.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the siren song of these  
mushy moderates, make no mistake: They will take us down to defeat 
once again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes confirmed later that he had Bush and his ``compassionate  
conservative'' slogan in mind when he gave the speech. ``The phrase 
itself is fine. The key is whether it will be followed by 
substantive issues the public wants,'' he said. ``They've had 
enough sizzle. They want steak.''

<HEADLINE>  Pinochet Hearing Resumes in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A hearing in Britain's House of Lords to determine  
the legality of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's arrest is revolving around 
two questions: Whether acts of torture can be prosecuted by any 
country, and if his status as a former head of state protects him 
from facing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Britain and Spain rolled through nearly a century of  
legal history Wednesday, the third day of arguments, to bolster 
their position that the former Chilean dictator cannot claim 
immunity from charges of crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	They will continue presenting evidence to Britain's highest  
court today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, 83, was arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant accusing  
him of ordering murders, kidnapping and torture throughout his 
17-year regime. Spaniards were among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it at its lowest form, torture is an internationally  
recognized crime and states have a duty to not accord immunity to 
people accused of this,'' Christopher Greenwood, a lawyer for 
Britain and Spain, told the seven-judge panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers contend that the aging general's arrest  
violates his rights to state immunity under British law. They will 
probably not begin presenting their case until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time the House of Lords has considered  
Pinochet's case. The first ended in a 3-2 decision denying him 
immunity in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords faces intense pressure to make its decision  
stick, after the embarrassment of overturning its own ruling last 
month when one of the judges who had ruled against Pinochet was 
found to have close ties to Amnesty International, a human rights 
group lobbying to bring him to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people were  
killed or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police 
after he overthrew elected Marxist Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish government also claims Pinochet began ordering  
torture in the months before his coup on Sept. 11, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet loses again in the House of Lords, the extradition  
battle will begin. But if the lords uphold a Nov. 25 High Court 
decision quashing his arrest, he would be free to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santiago, Pinochet's successor as army commander in chief,  
Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, said the army ``is a bit more optimistic 
this time'' that Pinochet will return to Chile soon. ``However, we 
cannot proclaim victory until the general is here,'' Izurieta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who was arrested in London while recuperating from  
back surgery, is not attending the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Lucia Hiriart, made a rare public appearance Wednesday  
when she went to pray at a church near the rented mansion west of 
London where her husband remains under police guard.

<P>
	The House of Lords faces intense pressure to make its decision  
stick, after the embarrassment of overturning its own ruling last 
month when one of the judges who had ruled against Pinochet was 
found to have close ties to Amnesty International, a human rights 
group lobbying to bring him to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people were  
killed or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police 
after he overthrew elected Marxist Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish government also claims Pinochet began ordering  
torture in the months before his coup on Sept. 11, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet loses again in the House of Lords, the extradition  
battle will begin. But if the lords uphold a Nov. 25 High Court 
decision quashing his arrest, he would be free to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santiago, Pinochet's successor as army commander in chief,  
Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, said the army ``is a bit more optimistic 
this time'' that Pinochet will return to Chile soon. ``However, we 
cannot proclaim victory until the general is here,'' Izurieta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who was arrested in London while recuperating from  
back surgery, is not attending the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Lucia Hiriart, made a rare public appearance Wednesday  
when she went to pray at a church near the rented mansion west of 
London where her husband remains under police guard.

<HEADLINE>  Iraq Claims U.S. Blackmailing Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq accused the United States on Thursday  
of secretly trying to pressure the Arab world into isolating 
President Saddam Hussein's regime in its dispute with the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf released what he said  
was a confidential U.S. government letter, obtained by Baghdad and 
dated Jan. 12, that urges Arab governments to support the American 
position on Iraq. Al-Sahhaf described the contents as ``full of 
venom, vicious lies, allegations and distortions of facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, distributed to journalists, was photocopied on plain  
paper with no letterhead or U.S. markings. There was no way to 
determine its authenticity, and Washington had not confirmed the 
existence of such a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the letter -- with jabs by al-Sahhaf against  
Washington and its Arab allies -- came as Baghdad hardened its 
position over proposals currently before the United Nations to 
reform its disarmament and sanctions regime on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sahhaf said the letter was given to Arab governments by U.S.  
embassies in the region in a bid to rally support before a Jan. 24 
meeting of Arab League foreign ministers. He said he plans to 
attend the meeting in Cairo and will see how many Arab nations toe 
the American line. Iraq has stepped up its verbal assaults on Arab 
states, particularly Egypt and Persian Gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter urges the Arab League to demand from Saddam full  
compliance with U.N. resolutions and to desist from calling for 
either a lifting of sanctions or a restructuring of the U.N. 
Special Commission, the arms inspection team known as UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, while Saddam is challenging the U.N. at every turn and  
calling for the overthrow of Arab governments, is not the time to 
call for lifting sanctions or restructuring UNSCOM,'' the letter 
reads. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has refused to allow inspectors from UNSCOM return to the  
country in response to Dec. 16-19 U.S.-British airstrikes. Under 
U.N. resolutions, UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has dismantled its 
weapons of mass destruction programs before the Security Council 
can lift trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the post-airstrike impasse, the United States, France and  
Russia have put forward separate proposals for various degrees of 
reform to U.N. dealings with Iraq. The U.S. plan would ease 
restrictions on the sale of Iraqi oil but not change UNSCOM or its 
role. The French and Russian plans would lift the trade embargo and 
replace UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	But Saddam's Cabinet insisted Thursday it would reject any of  
the plans if the country proposing it did not condemn the 
U.S.-British airstrikes and back Baghdad's claims for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any resolution that is not approved by Iraq is deemed  
rejected, even if it is issued by the Security Council,'' the 
Cabinet said in a statement on the official Iraqi News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sahhaf added that any proposal also must lift the sanctions  
immediately and order the dismantling of weapons of mass 
destruction in other Middle East countries, especially Israel.

<HEADLINE> Yashin NAC Donation Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Ottawa Senators star Alexei Yashin wanted the  
National Arts Centre to pay up to $85,000 a year to his parents as 
a condition of his 5-year, $1-million donation to the center, the 
NAC said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, the center said the money, to be paid to  
Yashin's parents though Tatiana Entertainment Inc., was part of a 
side-deal agreed to by John Cripton, former chief of the arts 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors was not advised of the arrangement, Jean  
Therese Riley, chairwoman of the board, said in the statement. It 
came to light only after Cripton departed -- amid controversy over 
other matters -- in October. 
</P>
<P>
	A review by prominent Ottawa lawyer David Scott concluded the  
agreement was ``illegal, unenforceable and could not possibly be 
honored by the NAC,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments were supposedly to be made to Yashin's parents for  
services rendered. 
</P>
<P>
	But Scott wrote in his legal opinion that ``it is now recognized  
that the intent was that such payments would not be dependent upon 
the actual delivery of services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No money was ever paid to Yashin's parents.  
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million donation by the Senators' center and captain was  
announced with much fanfare by the arts center a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yashin made only the first annual payment of $200,000. It  
was disclosed this week that he would make no more contributions 
for ``personal reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His withdrawal from the deal came after the NAC told Yashin's  
lawyer and agent that his parents would not be getting any money. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Yashin, who was in Boston  
with the Senators for a game. His agent, Mark Gandler, could not 
immediately be reached.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 83 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet stocks were sharply lower in early  
afternoon trading, dragging blue chip stocks down with them, after 
an influential Wall Street analyst said the ``bubble'' in those 
stocks is close to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 83.67 at 9,252.24, expanding Wednesday's drop 19.31 points to 
close at 9,480.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks opened lower and blue chips meandered this  
morning until Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cautioned 
that the spectacular rally in Internet stocks, which has pulled the 
market higher in the last several weeks, ``will come to a very bad 
end.'' Biggs' comments, made in Tokyo, intensified the sell-off in 
technology shares, which spread to the blue chips in early 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said Biggs' comments were neither surprising nor new,  
but that Internet stock prices had gone so high, they were viewed 
as an excuse to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get something this frothy, people definitely look for  
a reason to sell,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jeffries &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., the Nasdaq composite was down 69.54 at 2,345.95,  
after climbing to a record high of 2,415.49 on Wednesday. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 22.88 at 1,233.74. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were lower, with Amazon.com down 14 at 99 in  
heavy Nasdaq volume. On the Big Board, America Online was down 8 1/8 
at 140 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	One exception was Lycos, up 3 3/4 108 9/16, after The Financial  
Times reported the company was seeking a strategic partner. The 
Internet portal company had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 2 to 1 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 594.2 million 
shares, off from Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> McDyess, Denver Signing Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Antonio McDyess' return to Denver wasn't a slam  
dunk after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between McDyess and the Nuggets stalled Thursday  
night when McDyess began having second thoughts, preventing the 
sides from reaching a contract agreement that appeared to be a done 
deal only 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre turn of events included several closed door meetings  
in the Nuggets locker room as the Colorado Avalanche and Calgary 
Flames played a hockey game at McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the first period, McDyess and his agents, Tony Dutt and  
James Bryant, sat in a luxury box with Dan Issel, general manager 
of the Nuggets, and Charlie Lyons, chairman and CEO of Ascent, the 
company that owns the Nuggets and the Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Lyons took his young son, Daniel, into the locker room,  
and Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix, a former agent, 
briefly joined the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospitality, however, failed to help McDyess make a  
decision, and Nuggets spokesman Tommy Sheppard said he did not 
expect a news conference to be held Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not reached an agreement yet,'' Sheppard said at about  
8 p.m. ``We hope to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess and his agents declined to talk to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, traded from Denver to Phoenix 15 months ago, flew to  
Denver on Thursday and was at McNichols Arena for a scheduled 3 
p.m. news conference. His introduction was put off until 5:30 and 
ultimately postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't ready to do anything yet,'' Issel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked when a deal might be reached, Issel said, ``I have no  
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, a 24-year-old forward, had narrowed his choices to  
Phoenix and Denver and seemed ready to accept a six-year, $67.5 
million contract offer that was the maximum the Nuggets could offer 
under the new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, the Suns were keeping quiet about the developments.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really can't make any comment about what's going on, but  
it's interesting to say the least,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo 
said. ``We'll just have to see what transpires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say whether Phoenix still would be interested in  
signing McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have my feelings about what's going to happen, but we're  
just going to have to let it play out,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Suns said earlier Thursday that they had renounced  
their rights to McDyess, team spokeswoman Julie Fie said the 
announcement was premature. The Suns would be unable to exceed the 
salary cap to re-sign McDyess if they renounced his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that McDyess did not know Denver would not  
re-sign popular forward LaPhonso Ellis, but Issel would not comment 
when pressed on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to take any more questions,'' a clearly  
frustrated Issel said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, who came to Denver after a draft-day trade in 1995,  
averaged 15.8 points and 7.4 rebounds in two seasons with the 
Nuggets but was traded to Phoenix for a handful of draft picks Oct. 
1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made after former Nuggets general manager Allan  
Bristow refused to give in to McDyess' demand for a $100 million 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristow explained his decision by saying McDyess wasn't a  
``franchise'' player worthy of a nine-figure salary 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly stung by the comment, McDyess openly criticized Bristow  
and accused the Nuggets of being cheap. Just a month later, he said 
he would not rule out a return to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	During his one year in Phoenix, McDyess saw diminished playing  
time but still averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds in 81 games.

<HEADLINE> Suns Close To Deal for Gugliotta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns are close to a deal with free  
agent Tom Gugliotta, a source close to the situation told The 
Associated Press today. 
</P>
<P>
	No contract has been signed, but the source, speaking on the  
condition of anonymity, said ``there is a substantial chance'' that 
Gugliotta would sign with Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns turned up the heat on their efforts to sign Gugliotta  
since they learned Wednesday night that Antonio McDyess would not 
re-sign with Phoenix and instead would go to the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix renounced 10 free agents, including McDyess, today in  
the first step to clear the salary cap room needed to sign 
Gugliotta. The Suns also were expected to trade three players to 
Chicago for Luc Longley, another move that would allow them more 
cap space. 
</P>
<P>
	In that deal, already confirmed by the Suns, the Bulls would  
sign Longley to a contract, then trade him to Phoenix for Mark 
Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns general manager Bryan Colangelo said Wednesday night that  
the team would be able to clear a maximum of about $8 million to 
offer a free agent. That's short of the $9 million maximum allowed 
under the new collective bargaining agreement, but the source said 
the figures were close enough that it wouldn't be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year, $52.8 million contract would contain a clause  
allowing Gugliotta out of the deal after five years, when he would 
be eligible for a much bigger raise as a 10-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta averaged 20.1 points per game for the Timberwolves  
last season but missed 41 games after undergoing foot surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have made $86 million over seven years by re-signing  
with Minnesota but has indicated all along that the money would not 
prevent him from signing with a team that he felt was the right fit 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Colangelo identified the 6-foot-10 forward as one of the  
``big three'' free agents up for grabs this season. The others were 
Scottie Pippen, expected to be signed by Chicago and traded to 
Houston, and McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, 29, played four seasons in Minnesota after two  
seasons with the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to McDyess, the Suns renounced Kevin Johnson, George  
McCloud, Mike Brown, Horacio Llamas, Loren Meyer, Marko Milic, 
Dennis Scott, Wayman Tisdale and Hot Rod Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA has eliminated the 56-day waiting period to re-sign  
renounced free agents, meaning the Suns might be able to able to 
re-sign some of those players later.

<HEADLINE> NYPD To Seize Drunken Drivers' Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anyone arrested for driving drunk in New York  
City will have their cars seized and not given back unless they are 
acquitted of the charges, the police commissioner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing more serious to the innocent public than  
people who drive drunk,'' Commissioner Howard Safir said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYPD plans to implement its so-called ``Zero Tolerance  
Drinking and Driving Initiative'' within the next month, Safir 
said. He said New York is the first major city to implement such an 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the forfeiture provision in the city's administrative  
code, police can seize ``instrumentalities of crime,'' Safir said. 
But the provision does not specifically say that police can seize 
cars from drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a creative use of a law designed to deal with  
instrumentalities of crime,'' Safir said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, cars of people arrested for drunk driving are held by  
police until someone comes to pick them up, Safir said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil  
Liberties Union, thinks Safir's plan can be legally challenged 
because the provision does not cite drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``The executive branch can't add punishment to the drunk driving  
laws,'' Siegel said. ``We recognize that drunk driving is a serious 
crime, but an open-ended grant of authority ... is not adequate in 
our perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 6,368 people were arrested for drunk driving in the  
city, down slightly from 1997 when there were 6,836 arrests. There 
were 31 fatalities attributed to DWI last year, compared with 52 in 
1997, according to police statistics.

<HEADLINE> Big Right Sets up Next Tyson Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's handlers are wasting no time  
setting up his second comeback fight. 
</P>
<P>
	A Showtime television executive confirmed Thursday that Tyson  
would fight April 24, and said an opponent would probably be 
selected sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lock,'' Showtime executive producer Jay Larkin said  
of the date for Tyson's next fight, which will be held at the MGM 
Grand hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible opponents for Tyson include Axel Schulz, Lou Savarese,  
Shannon Briggs and Michael Moorer, he said. That, of course, is 
contingent on Tyson not going to jail next month when sentenced on 
a no-contest plea stemming from his assault on two men following a 
traffic accident in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's spectacular fifth-round knockout of Francois Botha on  
Saturday night saved him from a possible embarrassing defeat that 
would have derailed his latest comeback and plans to fight four 
times this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson lost every round on the scorecards of two of the three  
ringside judges when he flattened Botha with one punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what Mike Tyson is about, amazing one-punch power,''  
Larkin said. ``Mike ended the fight in the way fight fans want to 
see him end the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said some 750,000 homes bought the fight at an average  
price of $45, beneath the 1 million or so he hoped for. But he said 
a short time to promote the fight and a bad date brought on by 
Tyson's desire to fight quickly cut into the buy rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still the biggest pay-per-view event since  
Tyson-Holyfield II,'' Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be shown again on Showtime Saturday night as part  
of the network's ``Free Preview Weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's trainer, meanwhile, said Thursday that Tyson's 19 months  
out of the ring were the main cause of his wild punches and failure 
to throw combinations against Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little worried the first couple of rounds,'' Tommy  
Brooks said. ``He came out and was the Mike Tyson that fought 
Evander Holyfield, not the Mike Tyson that I had worked with the 
last couple of months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said Tyson's next opponent would be a ``formidable''  
fighter and that Tyson would have to continue to improve to keep 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inactivity shakes your confidence,'' he said. ``Tyson is a  
warrior, he's a fighter. He's looking forward to being one of the 
top contenders again. He has to re-establish the confidence within 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Tyson news, a May 19 trial date was set for a lawsuit  
claiming Tyson owes former co-manager John Horne 10 percent of the 
proceeds of five fights, beginning with the Botha fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles W. McCoy Jr. on  
Thursday rejected a motion to dismiss Horne's suit against the 
former heavyweight champion.

	The judge set the date for trial, but also asked lawyers for  
Tyson and Horne to attempt to resolve the dispute through 
mediation. Tyson was not in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne, along with promoter Don King and co-manager Rory  
Holloway, claim they have a 1995 contract with Showtime and Tyson 
for 10 fights. But after Tyson was disqualified for biting 
Holyfield in the fifth fight of that contract, and served a 
suspension from boxing, he signed with new handlers and sued King, 
Horne and Holloway.

<HEADLINE> Aetna HMO Loses $120.5M Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Goodrich fought a losing battle with  
his HMO over coverage of an experimental cancer treatment, and he 
died thinking he had saddled his wife with huge medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Goodrich responded by suing Aetna U.S. Health Care for  
wrongful death, claiming the company refused to pay for treatment 
its own doctors recommended at a hospital outside the plan's 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after Goodrich's death, a San Bernardino County jury  
on Wednesday awarded Mrs. Goodrich a record $120.5 million, finding 
Aetna committed ``malice, oppression and fraud,'' and contributed 
to the shortening of Goodrich's life. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $116 million in punitive damages and $4.5  
million for medical expenses and loss of companionship. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna said it would appeal, but the case's effects still will be  
felt, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, 
nonprofit group that lobbies on consumer health care issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every economic incentive exists for them to deny and deny and  
delay and delay,'' he said. ``HMOs now will have to think twice 
before they decide to deny benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich eventually had high-dose chemotherapy and a bone marrow  
transplant for his stomach cancer before he died at age 44, but 
Aetna refused to pay for it, attorney Michael J. Bidart argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich's death was ``truly a tragedy'' but Aetna never delayed  
or denied any medical care he sought, Aetna said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we acted fairly at all times,'' the HMO said,  
noting that all of Goodrich's medical expenses were covered either 
by Aetna or Goodrich's second insurance provider. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said Goodrich was ``never an appropriate  
candidate'' for the experimental treatment because his cancer had 
progressed too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers said the jury's award was by far the largest in the  
nation ever against an HMO for denying health care. The previous 
record was a total of $89.3 million in 1993 against HealthNet in 
neighboring Riverside County, said Mark Hiepler, an attorney in 
that case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodrich case provided fodder for both sides in the battle  
over HMO patient rights, which is expected to be a major issue 
before the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill by Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., would expand the ability  
of Americans to sue HMOs. Currently, people covered by 
employee-based health plans can try to recover only the cost of the 
denied treatment. The few exceptions include government and church 
employees such as Goodrich, a former San Bernardino County 
prosecutor, who may sue for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of plans to allow expanded lawsuits argue that it will  
increase HMO costs and thus those of consumers without necessarily 
helping patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have here is a man who died of a terrible disease ...  
and then years later a family member being awarded, pending an 
appeal, a large sum of money. We think there are better ways,'' 
said Susan Pisano, vice president of the American Association of 
Health Plans, an HMO industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pisano said the better solution is offering independent  
reviews of HMO decisions when there is a disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna recently announced that, beginning in July, its 6 million  
members will be able to appeal insurance coverage denials to 
committees of independent physicians. Aetna said it will abide by 
the decisions.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns on Dietary Supplement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A chemical widely sold in health food stores  
and over the Internet is dangerous and should not be consumed, the 
government warned in linking the substance to one death and 54 
cases of severe reactions including seizures and comatose-like 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical -- sold as a dietary supplement and under half a  
dozen names including GBL and Blue Nitro -- claims to have such 
effects as building muscle, enhancing sexual performance and 
reducing stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, GBL can act on the central nervous system to cause  
life-threatening reactions, the Food and Drug Administration said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really want to get out a clear warning to consumers that  
this is a dangerous product, and they should not be using it,'' 
said Joe Levitt, FDA's director of food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has learned of 55 people who suffered reactions,  
including a woman found dead in her home after ingesting GBL. 
Nineteen other people lost consciousness, many with such difficulty 
in breathing that they required insertion of breathing tubes. 
Several GBL users were found incoherent while driving, and one was 
involved in a car crash. Others appeared to have suffered seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were young adults, but four patients were teen-agers and a  
fifth was an 11-year-old. The FDA provided no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is tracking down at least six companies that sell GBL or  
gamma butyrolactone. The government says GBL is not a dietary 
supplement but a derivative of a powerful party drug banned in the 
United States since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	When people ingest GBL, it breaks down into the drug known as  
GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate. GBH is a potent drug that some 
scientists are studying in carefully monitored clinical trials as a 
potential treatment for narcolepsy, but all other uses of GHB are 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that ban, the FDA two years ago discovered laboratories  
illegally producing the odorless, tasteless chemical as a party 
drug. It was blamed for dozens of hospitalizations and at least 
three deaths during a brief resurgence, and it became known as a 
``date rape'' drug after rendering women helpless when it was 
slipped into their drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Because GBL breaks down into the banned GHB drug, it is by law  
illegal, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is asking manufacturers to recall all GBL products,  
and one company, Florida-based Trimfast Group Inc., has agreed. It 
is recalling Revivarant, sold as a liquid in 32-ounce bottles, and 
Revivarant G, sold as a powder to be mixed in drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	If other companies do not pull GBL off the market, the FDA could  
seize the products. ``FDA is considering all potential regulatory 
actions at its disposal'' and ``will act expeditiously to protect 
the public health,'' agency officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the recalled Revivarant, the FDA said GBL is sold  
by companies in Florida and California under the brand names Blue 
Nitro or Blue Nitro Vitality, GH Revitalizer or GHR, Remforce, 
Renewtrient and Gamma G.

<HEADLINE> Russia May Run out of Grain Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia may exhaust its strategic grain reserves in  
1999 because of a poor crop last year, a top agriculture official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Food and Agriculture Minister Viktor Semyonov said Russia had  
grain reserves of 27.5 million tons to 33 million tons in 1998, 
when the harvest was much smaller than normal, according to the 
ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Semyonov did not say how much grain Russia has in its reserves  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia produced 43 percent less wheat in 1998 than in 1997, but  
officials said at the time it still had enough grain to feed its 
people in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union and the United States are expected to give  
Russia food aid later this year because of the poor harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Semyonov said the agriculture industry was planning to introduce  
stabilization measures to support domestic agricultural producers, 
including protective customs and tariff policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's ailing agricultural sector has been in crisis for years  
because of poor management and Soviet-era bureaucratic 
restrictions. It's problems have increased since economic crisis 
struck Russia last August.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Plane Crashes in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Military investigators are trying to  
determine what caused a Massachusetts Air National Guard fighter 
jet to crash after screaming over the rooftops of homes in upstate 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the $8.8 million A-10 ejected before the jet  
crashed Wednesday night in a swampy area near Kasoag Lake, about 30 
miles north of Syracuse. The pilot suffered only minor cuts and 
bruises, said R.D. Murphy, a spokesman for Fort Drum Army base. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet flew at treetop level over houses and crashed in the  
woods about a quarter-mile southeast of the home of Agneta 
Ingersoll, who was watching television when she heard a terrible 
thundering and looked out her window. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought the sound was thunder, but then I thought,  
`That can't be right,''' Ingersoll said. ``There was a bright 
light, and then an explosion. It happened so fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 homes near the crash site were evacuated because of  
fuel from the crash, said Williamstown Fire Chief Chip Hamblin. No 
one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot had been on a training run at a Fort Drum gunnery  
range. Maj. Karen Platt, a spokeswoman for the 104th Fighter Wing 
of the Massachusetts Air Guard, said the pilot has served in the 
Westfield, Mass.-based unit for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything happened pretty quickly. There was one radio call  
and then a couple of minutes later the plane was on the ground,'' 
said Col. Dan Swift, wing commander. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet, first built in 1976, was the first Air Force plane  
designed specifically for close air support of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Drum, in nearby Watertown, sent two Blackhawk helicopters  
and an air ambulance to the scene. The pilot was rescued by one of 
the helicopter crews, Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> USDA Redefines `Organic' Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- In a reversal, the government is  
planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any 
food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with 
antibiotics, a top agriculture official told farmers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new labeling plan responds to an outcry from farmers last  
year against an earlier set of rules the farmers considered too 
permissive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to  
protect the integrity of your industry,'' said Keith Jones of the 
Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is developing the first national standards on  
organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and 
industry guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually  
for the last seven years. In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms  
trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming 
Research Foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call  
organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides,  
herbicides or preservatives. Livestock should be raised in open-air 
environments, without antibiotics or hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the organic farmers defeated USDA proposals to allow  
irradiation, genetic engineering and sewage sludge in organic 
production. The original rules also would have permitted 
applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited by industry 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000  
protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to 
withdraw the proposal and try again. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones shared key details of the department's latest proposals  
Thursday with the nation's largest gathering of organic farmers at 
the Ecological Farming Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding a hand-drawn paper target to his chest, he conceded that  
the federal agency has failed the organic farmers in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that in the current environment the USDA can't do  
anything right,'' he said. ``But I can tell you today we have a 
commitment to get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a generally sympathetic reception.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob  
Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is on the 
National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers. 
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, some farmers were skeptical that his verbal assurances  
may not hold once rules are published again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but  
we still believe in it. That's kind of where we are in this 
process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for 
Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,''  
said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a 
Santa Fe, N.M. company. ``For many of us, this is a continuation of 
a lifetime of work. First it was civil rights. Then it was 
anti-war. Now it's food security.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Newspaper Folds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The Independence Morning Post, a Taiwanese  
daily known for its liberal comments, announced Thursday it would 
stop publishing after a decade of heavy losses and a drop in 
advertising revenues brought on by Taiwan's economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Cheng-chu, a construction tycoon who publishes the paper,  
said losses have been heavy since he took over in 1994. Last year's 
red ink came to 300 million Taiwan dollars ($9.3 million). 
</P>
<P>
	``The Morning Post was established after Taiwan ended a ban on  
the establishment of new newspapers and opened up an era for free 
competition,'' said a front-page announcement in the newspaper, 
which has a circulation of 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``But after 11 years of endeavor, we still end up incurring  
losses,'' the Morning Post said. ``Suspending publication is our 
only choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning Post's vice president, Lin Sen-hung, said the daily  
will stop publication as soon as Friday because a longer lead time 
would only undermine morale and harm the paper's quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper executives said the daily will lay off 250 of its 600  
employees, while transferring the remaining workers to the 
affiliated Independence Evening Post, which still makes profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has escaped the Asian financial turmoil largely unscathed  
but an economic slowdown -- led by a property slump -- has cut into 
advertising revenues for the island's 28 daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hung Fu Group, owned by Chen, faced financial troubles late  
last year when a finance subsidiary ran into problems with late 
bill payments. That prevented Hung Fu from continuing to shoulder 
the Morning Post's debts, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Back Gore for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Election Day is nearly two years away and Al  
Gore hasn't officially declared his candidacy, but the nation's 
``first responders'' in times of crisis aren't wasting any time. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Fire Fighters on Thursday  
became the first national union to endorse Vice President Gore's 
expected campaign to become president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Firefighters and paramedics are known as the nation's first  
responders and that is why we wanted to be the first national 
organization to endorse the most active and involved vice president 
in our nation's history,'' said Al Whitehead, president of the 
225,000-member union. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's membership is evenly divided between Republicans and  
Democrats, said union spokesman George Burke, but its legislative 
conference and national convention both authorized the union's 
executive board to make the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	An endorsement from the firefighters has tangible advantages:  
the national union and its local affiliates spend more than $8 
million on politics during a two-year election cycle and its 
members, many of whom aren't covered by collective bargaining 
agreements, tend to be politically active. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're committed to helping him raise money,'' Burke said.  
``We're going to step up like we did for Clinton the last time.''

<HEADLINE> Martian Landscape Tied to Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Underground volcanic action on ancient Mars sculpted gorges far  
larger than the Grand Canyon and melted enough water to feed floods 
of biblical proportions, two geologists suggest in a study 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	Most scientists have attributed the gorges to the bowing and  
stretching of the terrain from surface forces. Under the new 
theory, such features were instead shaped from below by rising 
wedges of molten rock known as dikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the theory, the dikes would have also melted vast  
quantities of ice. This would explain the colossal floods that 
scientists generally believe scoured Mars 2 billion to 3 billion 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory, which appeared today in the journal Nature, was  
devised by geologists Dan McKenzie and Francis Nimmo at the 
University of Cambridge in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Under their scenario, dikes pushed up to within several miles of  
the surface, forcing the rock above to jut upward and outward. The 
area in the middle sagged, forming a canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the molten rock melted ice in the frozen ground,  
underground pools formed and spread and the rock above -- as if 
afloat -- shifted into the broken, chaotic pattern characteristic of 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The water trapped underground could have offered the sort of  
warm, moist oases where some have suggested that life could have 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	When the water ultimately found its way to the surface, it  
collected in the canyons. The two geologists calculated that such a 
process could have let loose floods of 400 trillion gallons or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie argued that a gigantic dike larger than any on Earth,  
or a series of smaller ones, could run beneath the canyon network 
known as the Valles Marineris, the planet's best-known landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Valles Marineris stretches about 2,500 miles -- roughly the  
distance from New York to San Francisco -- and runs as deep as six 
miles. Its walls tower more than five times higher than the Grand 
Canyon's. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred McEwen, a geologist at the University of Arizona,  
challenged the molten dike theory as a full explanation for Mars' 
canyons. He said there is scant evidence that there was full-scale 
volcanic activity, such as volcanoes or lava flow, at the time the 
gorges took shape.

<HEADLINE> Korda Energized by Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The kick is back.  
</P>
<P>
	Defending Australian Open champion Petr Korda, whose game and  
exuberance were stifled after he returned a positive test for 
steroids last year, resurrected his trademark victory kick today 
after an easy three-set win in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	After a five-set test in the first round, the spikey-haired  
Czech swept over 104th-ranked Spaniard Julian Alonso with pinpoint 
serving and a flurry of passing shots from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of what Korda said were some ``improper and  
insulting'' comments from some spectators, he had an unexceptional 
day. There was no sign of soreness in the ankle he twisted in the 
first-round match against Spain's Galo Blanco, and unlike his 
compatriot, Alonso shook Korda's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Although again forced to play away from center court, normally  
the defending champion's privilege, Korda had the vocal support of 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	They cheered when he served his 11th ace to set up match point.  
Two points later, they cheered again when Alonso hit the final 
return into the net. Korda clenched his fists, then walloped a ball 
high into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda saluted the crowd as he walked from the court, then almost  
as an after thought, dropped his bag and performed the scissor 
kick, a trademark from last year's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a high spirit,'' he said. ``I have my head up. I'm  
trying to play tennis here only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the exhausting match against Blanco, Korda said he knew he  
needed to improve his game. After struggling for the past six 
months -- he dropped in the rankings from 13 at the end of 1998 to 
20 after the drug scandal broke -- he said putting two straight wins 
together was ``fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the small steps,'' he said. ``If you fall with the  
small ones, your butt is not going to be so sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A taste of victory has given him a taste for more.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not comparing the years, but I am a different person than  
I was last year. I know how it is to win a Slam. That can help me a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda will meet Todd Martin in the third round on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Give Sprewell Another Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A face-to-face meeting with Latrell Sprewell was  
enough to persuade the New York Knicks to acquire the league's most 
notorious choke artist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks made the Sprewell trade official Thursday, announcing  
they had dealt John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings to the 
Golden State Warriors for the three-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell brings a tarnished reputation to a team anxious over  
the public relations risk. He was suspended for 68 games last 
season and had his contract terminated after he choked and 
threatened to kill coach P.J. Carlesimo at a Warriors practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks got special permission from the league to speak with  
Sprewell in person, and Madison Square Garden president Dave 
Checketts, general manager Ernie Grunfeld and coach Jeff Van Gundy 
were among a four-man contingent that flew to Sprewell's hometown 
of Milwaukee last Sunday to speak to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you can be completely sure about anyone after  
a couple hours in a meeting, but for two hours he looked me face to 
face and answered my questions, even the tough ones, in a real 
straightforward manner,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted another chance.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will get that chance with the Knicks, who suddenly find  
themselves without two of their most familiar faces of the decade, 
Starks and Charles Oakley. They have only one holdover from the 
team that went to the NBA Finals in 1994, Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who will be paid $17.3 million for the two years left  
on his contract, was expected to join the team Friday but would not 
be able to practice until the three ex-Knicks passed their 
physicals. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not at a practice Thursday night at which 13 players  
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to judge him, I'm here to coach him,'' Van Gundy  
said. ``I'm not really thinking about what happened in the past, 
I'm really thinking about what we can do in the future. He's a 
talent, he's a competitor and he's a compliment to some of the 
other guys we have here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to give us a better chance to win. That's how I had  
to make the decision,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three years ago, when the Knicks traded Anthony Mason to  
Charlotte, Checketts made an issue of saying the team would only 
bring in solid citizens. He used Dennis Rodman as a prime example 
of the anti-Knick. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell hasn't exactly fit that description, with a checkered  
past that includes a reckless driving accident, numerous lawsuits 
against his former agent and the NBA, and an ugly fight with former 
teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot has happened in my thinking over past 48 hours or so,''  
Checketts said. ``For me to make the statement I made about not 
wanting certain players on our team, I guess I would have to say 
it's pretty judgmental and self-righteous, and I regret having said 
those things because it's not fair for me to judge people. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the final hour, I said I really owe it to fans of the New  
York Knicks to do everything I can to help us win,'' he added. 
``This is a team that's been eliminated in the second round of the 
playoffs the last four years, and you just don't get a chance to 
get a talent like this, it just doesn't come along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks outbid the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers for  
Sprewell, giving up three bench players -- albeit very good bench 
players -- for a player who should make them the favorite to win the 
Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, an explosive scorer, will be used mostly in a  
three-guard alignment on offense and will be asked to be a 
defensive stopper against small forwards, shooting guards and point 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is an incredible basketball talent, and so I adjusted  
my thinking and said it's worth it,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they need a rebounder to replace Oakley, Checketts and  
Grunfeld dismissed reports that the Knicks were interested in 
Dennis Rodman. Grunfeld said the team will bring in additional 
players Thursday night for physicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, New York agreed to contracts with free agents  
Charlie Ward ($25 million for five years) and Chris Dudley ($28 
million for four years). 
</P>
<P>
	Still undetermined is who of the six legitimate starters  
(Sprewell, Allan Houston, Ewing, Larry Johnson, Ward and Marcus 
Camby) will have to come off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell is 28, a three-time All-Star and was once first team  
all-NBA, so there's no questioning his talents,'' Grunfeld said. 
``But you don't expect it to click overnight. It will take time to 
jell, but we're committed to making this thing work.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Adding Kerr, Kersey, Elie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The frontcourt duo of David Robinson and Tim  
Duncan got some help from other well-known NBA players -- and a shot 
at the NBA title -- on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the league finally began signing players and holding training  
camps, the San Antonio Spurs acquired Steve Kerr of the Chicago 
Bulls, Jerome Kersey of the Seattle SuperSonics and Mario Elie of 
the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, one of the best 3-point shooters in league history, was a  
key player on three consecutive Chicago Bulls championship teams, 
and said the Spurs have a good shot at the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	```They're one of the best teams in the league for sure,'' he  
said. ``It wasn't that tough a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson said he hoped that the addition of Kerr and Elie  
would propel the Spurs to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that,'' Robinson said. ``I haven't won the championship  
yet, so I can't tell you what the ingredients are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has repeatedly said San Antonio needs  
more consistency in its outside shooting, particularly in light of 
injuries the last two seasons to forward Sean Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott will be back this season after missing the second half  
of last season with a left quadriceps tendon injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said Thursday was a ``great day'' for the Spurs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We like what's happened,'' he said. ``We like the makeup of  
the team. But it's going to take a while to blend them together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Express-News reported Thursday that Kerr is  
receiving a five-year, $11 million deal; Elie has agreed to a 
two-year, $3.7 million contract; and Kersey is signing either a 
one- or two-year deal with a starting salary of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of the new Spurs players is Antonio Daniels, who was  
acquired last summer from Vancouver for Carl Herrera and the rights 
to draft pick Felipe Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs might opt to do without Vinny Del Negro, who left to  
play for an Italian team during the lockout but could return to the 
NBA if he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Person, after a workout with some Spurs teammates, told  
reporters Wednesday his tenure with San Antonio was ending. He 
expected to be traded to Chicago along with a draft pick in the 
Kerr deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a finished chapter,'' Person said. ``I have to move on  
and write another one.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Examines Fishing Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by what it labeled ``an unprecedented  
number of deaths,'' the Coast Guard announced Thursday it was 
forming a task force to examine a recent spate of fishing boat 
deaths and losses off the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force -- which could be operating within a week -- will  
be led by the Coast Guard and include fishing vessel experts, other 
federal agencies and members of the commercial fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Its goal will be to identify any common causes and to examine  
issues such as crew qualification, training and the performance of 
safety equipment. Task members, who hope to complete their work by 
March, will also aim to provide quick feedback to the industry to 
see where prevention efforts may be refocused. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the National Transportation Safety Board is  
investigating whether the U.S. Coast Guard botched the handling of 
a distress call sent by the Adriatic, a clam boat that later sank, 
NTSB officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard spokesman Jack O'Dell defended its response, saying  
the static-garbled ``mayday'' message was unintelligible and did 
not contain enough information to warrant a search. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Coast Guard is talking with the fishing industry  
to prevent capsizing caused by improperly loaded boats, prevent 
flooding caused by overlooked maintenance of the hull and related 
equipment, and ensure that lifesaving equipment is operable and 
that crews are trained in the use of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know that any of these are causal in any of these  
cases, but the likelihood is there, so we want to make sure they 
look at these things,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Gwen Keenan, a spokeswoman 
at Coast Guard headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 28, the Predator was lost off Ocean City, Md., killing  
one and leaving a survivor. On Jan. 6, the Beth Dee Bob was lost 
off Manasquan Inlet, N.J., killing two and leaving two missing. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 8, the Cape Fear was lost off New Bedford, Mass.,  
killing one and leaving one missing and three survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the 65-foot Ellie B. struck a jetty in Manasquan,  
N.J., when its skipper fell asleep at the wheel. Three crew members 
jumped overboard and were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Adriatic was lost off Barnegat Light, N.J.,  
leaving four missing and presumed drowned. The search for those 
crew members was suspended Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NTSB investigators have been sent to New Jersey to probe  
the Coast Guard's response to the ``mayday'' call from that boat.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Trust Profit Beats Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. made $96 million, or 89  
cents a share, in the final quarter of last year, easily beating 
Wall Street's expectations, but trading losses took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by Germany's Deutsche  
Bank, saw its profits fall 54 percent from the fourth quarter 1997, 
in part because of unanticipated losses in Indonesia, Thailand and 
Korea. In the fourth quarter of 1997, the company earned $207 
million, or $1.82 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust's fourth-quarter performance, while below last  
year's, was better than the third quarter of 1998, when the 
volatile markets sent shudders through the industry and cost 
Bankers Trust $488 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have scaled their exposure in emerging markets, but they  
have more room to go there,'' said Brad Ball, an analyst with 
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Their core investment banking 
operations are showing some improvement and momentum going into 
1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market has since regained its ground and international  
operations are recovering, but Bankers Trust still lost $46 million 
in Asian markets and $24 million in Latin America during the last 
three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter was $1.44 billion, down slightly from  
$1.36 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust's results echoed those posted Tuesday by its  
competitors like J.P. Morgan and BankAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected earnings of  
58 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Bankers Trust were up 62 1/2 cents to $87.06 1/4 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Bankers Trust lost $6 million, or 38 cents a  
share, compared with a gain of $866 million, or $7.66 a share, for 
all of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $5.09 billion vs. $6.22 billion.

<HEADLINE> Fossil Suggests Dinosaurs Were Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The best-preserved dinosaur fossil ever found  
suggests some of the extinct animals had the super-powerful lungs 
needed to be fast and deadly hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	A 110 million-year-old fossil of a baby dinosaur called  
Scipionyx is so well-preserved that researchers believe it bears 
the image of some of the animal's internal organs, said Nicholas 
Geist, a paleobiologist at Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extraordinary condition of the fossils allows us to hang  
some meat on the bones of these animals,'' said Geist, the senior 
author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you usually get in fossils is just bones, but in this one  
there are remnants of liver, large intestine, windpipe and 
muscle,'' he said. ``It is like a Rosetta stone for dinosaurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scipionyx was a theopod, a type of meat-eating dinosaur that  
walked on its hind legs, had a long tail, small forearms and a big 
head with a large mouth and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft tissue impressions show that the Scipionyx had a two-  
partition abdominal cavity, with the lungs and heart in one section 
and the liver and guts in the other. The liver was connected by 
muscle to a pelvic bone, Geist said, suggesting the animal had a 
breathing system called a hepatic piston. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a system, muscles pull against the liver, causing the  
breathing cavity to expand slightly. That forces air into the lungs 
at a high rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is necessary for sustained activity,'' said Geist.  
``These theopods were exceedingly fast and dangerous animals. They 
were not slow and sluggish like many modern reptiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mammals have a diaphragm muscle that causes the lung cavity to  
expand and draw in air. The ability to rapidly ventilate the lungs 
is essential for moving swiftly for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinosaurs' lung capacity may be one reason they dominated  
mammals for about 150 million years, said Geist. Mammals during 
this period were small and no match for the meat-eating dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	``These dinosaurs were fierce animals that could run prey down  
over extended distances,'' Geist said. ``This was like a 
turbocharged lizard. The mammals couldn't get a foothold and just 
tried to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hepatic piston works best in a warm, mild climate such as  
the Earth enjoyed during most of the dinosaur era. When the climate 
chilled, the dinosaurs were in trouble, Geist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals may have been so specialized for the warm  
climate, that even a minor change over an extended period may have 
helped do them in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all experts agree that the Scipionyx fossil gives such  
precise evidence of a hepatic pump breathing system, said Paul 
Soreno, a dinosaur expert at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many in the field, that interpretation is controversial,''  
said Soreno. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scipionyx fossil, the only dinosaur ever found in Italy, is  
small enough to hold in two hands and the animal may have been only 
days old when it died. Geist said it perished in a saltwater marsh 
that preserved its body structure. 
</P>
<P>
	No fossil for an adult Scipionyx has been found and Geist said  
the animal species probably grew to only about the size of a large 
dog.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Ends Down, Corn, Soybeans Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures retreated Thursday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures gained on word that economic  
uncertainty in Brazil had delayed some exports. Prices also saw 
support from drier weather in competing South American growing 
regions and from continued technical buying tied to heavy losses 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by concern about the weak export  
picture and ample supplies. U.S. exporters in recent weeks have 
been losing business to competitors from Australia, Canada and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.68 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1 cent to $2.16 a bushel; March oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.07 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to $5.30 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated, while pork futures were mixed on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle fell .65 cent to 62.50 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 73.55 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs rose .83 cent to 41.65 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
rose .85 cent to 56.90 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Truce Called in Italian Radio Tiff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Pa. (AP) -- A tug-of-war between two radio stations that  
both want to use the same name for competing Italian programming 
has been resolved, at least until their battle goes to trial in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	WEEX, where a program called Tempo Italiano originated, agreed  
that John and Pamela Richetta may continue to use the name for the 
show, now broadcast on WEST, Richetta's attorney Steve Goudsouzian 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties agreed to abide by a judge's earlier decision about  
the ownership of the name until the civil actions they filed 
against each other go to trial or otherwise get resolved, 
Goudsouzian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Richettas were host of a six-hour Sunday morning show on  
WEEX for a year before signing a contract with rival station WEST 
beginning this year. 
</P>
<P>
	After they left, WEEX started a replacement show, Festa Musica  
D'Italia, which airs at the same time with former Mayor Sal Panto 
Jr. as host. 
</P>
<P>
	The two stations sought to prevent each other from using the  
name Tempo Italiano. WEEX claimed it owned the name because it 
hired the Richettas; the Richettas said they owned it because they 
had registered the name under their promotion company, which did 
all the marketing for the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Northampton County Judge Alfred T. Williams had approved a  
temporary injunction Jan. 8 giving Richetta Promotions the right to 
use the name. 
</P>
<P>
	WEEX general manager Jeff Frank did not return messages seeking  
comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  Karl Malone, Jazz Agree on New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone and teary-eyed Utah Jazz owner  
Larry Miller said today they have agreed to agree on a new contract 
that would be signed when the NBA All-Star forward becomes a free 
agent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner and player, who had been at odds during the off-season  
and NBA lockout, said they had resolved their differences in a 
marathon meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I listened to him express concerns, excitement and dreams  
about the future,'' said the emotional Miller, who fought tears 
through a 90-minute press conference. ``The Karl Malone I know is 
still alive and well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post, citing unnamed sources, and The Salt Lake  
Tribune, which did not cite a source, said the prospective 
four-year contract would pay Malone an average of $16.5 million per 
season. The Post said the contract includes an option year. The 
Tribune said it would take effect in 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, Malone and Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, all denied  
today that any such deal had even been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have an agreement, but we can't right now,''  
Miller said, referring to a clause in the league's new collective 
bargaining agreement that forbids a veteran from signing a new 
contract until his existing one has expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was among several owners who fought unsuccessfully to  
delete that clause from the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential deal cited by the newspapers would represent the  
maximum the Jazz can offer their franchise player under the new 
collective bargaining agreement. Malone, who never has been an 
unrestricted free agent, is in the final year of a four-year, $20.2 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said Miller, Malone and Manley met Wednesday night  
at the Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is a very important person to this franchise, and I've  
always tried to do whatever we could to accommodate him,'' Miller 
said last week. ``I want him back (in Utah), and I expect he will 
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone is the only one of 10 Jazz players under contract who  
hasn't attended the team's workouts at its new practice facility in 
West Valley City during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If Malone and Miller have a deal in place, it would be another  
twist in Malone's strange odyssey since the Jazz lost their second 
straight NBA Finals in June to Michael Jordan and the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	While the lockout dragged on, Malone took up professional  
wrestling and started a sports talk show. On Nov. 11, he said he 
would demand a trade when the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he retracted the comment days later, the father-son  
relationship between Malone and Miller appeared strained. But Jazz 
executives remained confident that Malone, who never has played for 
another team, would be back for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had too many great years with Karl Malone. That type of  
commitment is something you don't take lightly and you don't 
forget,'' Jazz general manager Tim Howells said this month. ``We 
want Karl back. We want Karl to finish his career here.''

<HEADLINE>  Karl Malone, Jazz Agree on New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone and teary-eyed Utah Jazz owner  
Larry Miller said today they have agreed to agree on a new contract 
that would be signed when the NBA All-Star forward becomes a free 
agent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner and player, who had been at odds during the off-season  
and NBA lockout, said they had resolved their differences in a 
marathon meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I listened to him express concerns, excitement and dreams  
about the future,'' said the emotional Miller, who fought tears 
through a 90-minute press conference. ``The Karl Malone I know is 
still alive and well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post, citing unnamed sources, and The Salt Lake  
Tribune, which did not cite a source, said the prospective 
four-year contract would pay Malone an average of $16.5 million per 
season. The Post said the contract includes an option year. The 
Tribune said it would take effect in 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, Malone and Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, all denied  
today that any such deal had even been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have an agreement, but we can't right now,''  
Miller said, referring to a clause in the league's new collective 
bargaining agreement that forbids a veteran from signing a new 
contract until his existing one has expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was among several owners who fought unsuccessfully to  
delete that clause from the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential deal cited by the newspapers would represent the  
maximum the Jazz can offer their franchise player under the new 
collective bargaining agreement. Malone, who never has been an 
unrestricted free agent, is in the final year of a four-year, $20.2 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said Miller, Malone and Manley met Wednesday night  
at the Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is a very important person to this franchise, and I've  
always tried to do whatever we could to accommodate him,'' Miller 
said last week. ``I want him back (in Utah), and I expect he will 
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone is the only one of 10 Jazz players under contract who  
hasn't attended the team's workouts at its new practice facility in 
West Valley City during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If Malone and Miller have a deal in place, it would be another  
twist in Malone's strange odyssey since the Jazz lost their second 
straight NBA Finals in June to Michael Jordan and the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	While the lockout dragged on, Malone took up professional  
wrestling and started a sports talk show. On Nov. 11, he said he 
would demand a trade when the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he retracted the comment days later, the father-son  
relationship between Malone and Miller appeared strained. But Jazz 
executives remained confident that Malone, who never has played for 
another team, would be back for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had too many great years with Karl Malone. That type of  
commitment is something you don't take lightly and you don't 
forget,'' Jazz general manager Tim Howells said this month. ``We 
want Karl back. We want Karl to finish his career here.''

<HEADLINE> Bears To Decide on Coach Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Chicago Bears president Michael  
McCaskey interviewed Arizona defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis 
Thursday and said he hopes to make a decision soon on who will be 
the team's next coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've now interviewed five very strong candidates, five  
excellent coaches,'' McCaskey said. ``In the next four or five 
days, we should be making an announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides McGinnis, others under consideration are: Buffalo  
offensive coordinator Joe Pendry; Kansas City defensive coordinator 
Gunther Cunningham; Green Bay offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis, 
and Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick Jauron. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was recommended by Mark Hatley, Bears' vice president of  
player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis, who was the Bears' linebacker coach from 1986-95  
before joining the Arizona Cardinals, reportedly is the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never read a lot into that,'' McGinnis said. ``During  
this process, Mark and Mike have brought in some very qualified 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven of his 10 seasons with the Bears, the defense ranked  
among the top six in fewest yards allowed. McGinnis was part of a 
defensive staff that led the NFL in fewest points allowed in 1986, 
a league record 187. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Cardinals' defense over the last three years has  
ranked 21st, 27th and 21st in total yards allowed.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 71.83 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell sharply today on a fierce  
sell-off in Internet-related shares and concerns about Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 71.83 at 9,264.08. The Dow got as low as 9,228.55, 
down nearly 103 points. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 
nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 
moderately heavy. 
</P>
<P>
	On a percentage basis, broad market indexes were off much more  
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 21.37 to 1,235.25, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 70.67 to 2,344.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,130 up, 1,960 down and 487 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 866.21 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
899.21 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 8.06 to 588.03, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.38 to 704.99. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.56 to 424.06.  
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks opened weaker as sellers moved in at the opening  
bell to shed some of these high-flyers and book profits. The 
selling intensified after Barton Biggs, global investment 
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, warned in Tokyo that the 
spectacular rally in Internet stocks, which has helped pull the 
entire market higher in the last several weeks, ``will come to a 
very bad end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This afternoon Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist  
at Gruntal &AMP; Co., chimed in with his own warning. In an interview 
with CNBC, Battipaglia said, ``There is market risk in the Internet 
stocks right now.'' Internet stocks rose sharply on buying 
momentum, but the buying momentum has stalled as investors viewed 
the rich valuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Battipaglia said, the momentum is working the other way,  
and investors are selling them just as indiscriminately as they 
bought them earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get something this frothy, people definitely look for  
a reason to sell,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jeffries &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The sell-off in technology shares spread to blue chips in early  
afternoon as concerns about Brazil mounted, despite the 
legislature's approval of an important pension reform measure aimed 
at getting the troubled economy back on its feet.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Lenard Sidelined Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat were dealt a surprising blow  
Thursday when starting guard Voshon Lenard was found to have a 
stress fracture in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-year guard was noticeably absent when the Heat opened  
its fourth training camp under coach Pat Riley. He is expected to 
undergo surgery and be out 8-10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, I feel for Voshon,'' point guard Tim Hardaway said. ``He  
was ready to play from the get-go. That hurts the team from the 
very start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, it was a low-key opening for Miami in comparison to  
others on the most frenzied day in NBA history. The Heat's only 
significant move was to come to terms with free agent guard Terry 
Porter, who played last year in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat went to camp with 12 players from the team that won its  
second straight Atlantic Division title last year. Four of those 
were reserves signed to contracts Thursday -- forwards Mark 
Strickland and Keith Askins, center Marty Conlon and guard Rex 
Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' center Alonzo Mourning said. ``I've said from day  
one that the most important thing is to keep our core guys 
together. That's the way teams succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami had been working to pry guard Latrell Sprewell from Golden  
State, but lost out to New York in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuity could take on even more importance this year, as  
teams have only two weeks to prepare for a 50-game season that will 
feature games on back-to-back nights 14 times and three sets of 
three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard,'' Riley said. ``We have a package of  
things we want to put in. It'll have to be more whole-math teaching 
instead of breaking things down. But we've got to get a system 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat play exhibition games Jan. 30 and Feb. 1 against  
Orlando, then open the regular season Feb. 5 at home against 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley will have to adjust his plans to the absence of Lenard,  
who had been a regular at the Heat's informal workouts while 
waiting for the new collective bargaining agreement to be signed. 
But an examination of the bump on his leg showed the stress 
fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves the Heat, with only two proven scorers in Mourning  
and Hardaway, scrambling to fill the void. Small forward Jamal 
Mashburn could move into the backcourt, or Majerle could move into 
the starting lineup. Porter also can play the off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to win with that, we can,'' Hardaway said. ``We've  
got to keep the faith in everybody and play harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free agent Brent Barry, who struggled in Riley's system and has  
given every indication he won't wear a Miami uniform again, may yet 
become part of the solution as part of a sign-and-trade deal. Deals 
with Chicago for Scott Burrell and Golden State for Clarence 
Weatherspoon have been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley stressed that a sign-and-trade ``doesn't necessarily have  
to happen. If the right team comes along (to offer Barry a deal), 
he doesn't have to wait for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat also have their $1.75 million salary-cap exemption to  
go after another scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was flying to Miami late Monday and would sign after  
undergoing a physical. The Heat were in the market for a backup 
point guard after losing Eric Murdock to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to have him,'' Riley said. ``When we lost Eric, we  
had to move quickly. I'm glad he was available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other players brought to camp Monday were guard Randy  
Livingston, forward Jamie Watson and center Amal McCaskill.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defense Prepares Day 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concluding the first phase of President  
Clinton's impeachment trial, his lawyers are urging senators to 
reject allegations of legal wrongdoing and focus on ``the big 
picture'' -- an attempt by a married man to hide an extramarital 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	For their third and final day of oral presentations to rebut  
perjury and obstruction of justice charges, the Clinton team is 
combining the methodical arguments of private lawyer David Kendall 
with the oratory of Dale Bumpers. Bumpers, a former Democratic 
senator from Arkansas and longtime friend of Clinton, is known as a 
gifted public speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Bumpers finishes, senators who have been forced under trial  
rules to sit in uncharacteristic silence will have another 
unfamiliar task -- submitting questions in writing to Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist, who as presiding officer will read them and ask 
the lawyers and House prosecutors to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning is expected to begin Friday and continue  
Saturday. Some 70 questions have been submitted by Republicans so 
far, a GOP spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The question period may be the phase of the trial conducted in a  
bipartisan spirit. Subsequent motions to dismiss the case and call 
witnesses such as former White House intern Monica Lewinsky likely 
will break down largely along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said they oppose dismissal and support the need  
for limited live testimony from key witnesses such as Ms. Lewinsky, 
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and presidential secretary Betty 
Currie -- and should get their way with a 55-45 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with a two-thirds majority needed to make Clinton the  
first president evicted from his job, Democrats hold the votes for 
acquittal and show no signs of backing a move to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.  
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union 
address Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to 72 
percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One well-known conservative Republican, evangelist and  
broadcaster Pat Robertson, said Clinton pulled off such a public 
relations coup in the address that there is no chance he will be 
convicted. ``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing 
and get on with something else,'' he said on ``The 700 Club'' 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers was chosen to make the argument that the House case was  
a ``partisan rush to judgment'' that doesn't meet with the ``higher 
duty the Senate has always had,'' an adviser to the White House 
said Wednesday. Bumpers, who retired this year after 24 years in 
the Senate, also was chosen because he can talk ex-senator to 
senator, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, in town to attend a Senate  
lecture series sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., declined a chance to discuss the impeachment trial. But 
speaking in the Old Senate Chamber Wednesday evening, the former 
Republican president lamented that today in Washington, ``we are 
confronted with a deficit of decency -- one that deepens by the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's defense before senators Wednesday, Deputy White  
House Counsel Cheryl Mills argued that House managers ignored 
testimony from Mrs. Currie in order to falsely accuse the president 
of trying to obstruct the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense lawyer cited Mrs. Currie's testimony that Clinton  
never asked her to pick up gifts from Ms. Lewinsky after the 
presents were subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. Mrs. Currie 
testified it was Ms. Lewinsky who asked her to retrieve the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Ms. Mills said the prosecutors ignored Mrs.  
Currie's testimony that Clinton was not trying to pressure his 
secretary when he questioned her about her recollection of his 
actions with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those facts, those stubborn facts that just don't fit,''  
Ms. Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the House prosecutors said later that Ms. Mills had  
actually made a good case -- their case -- for the calling of 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went straight to Monica Lewinsky and attacked her  
credibility on the gift issue. And certainly the testimony of 
Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie is in conflict, and she emphasized 
that over and over again, of course supporting the credibility of 
Betty Currie,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a decision that the senators have to make, when you  
have testimony in conflict, as to which direction you're going to 
go. And the only way you resolve that is by calling of witnesses 
who are, in fact, in conflict,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mills finished with an emotional flourish, contending ``the  
foundation of the house of civil rights was never at the core of 
the Jones case. The foundation of the house of civil rights is in 
the voices of all the great civil rights leaders and the soul of 
every person who heard them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, continuing a defense theme that Clinton's conduct was  
terribly wrong but not criminal or impeachable, she told the Senate 
that the law must be upheld ``even when it protects behavior that 
we don't like or is unattractive or is not admirable or that might 
even be hurtful.''

<HEADLINE> Troops, Strikers Clash in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COSTESTI, Romania (AP) -- Striking coal miners wielding clubs and  
homemade explosives clashed today with riot troops trying to block 
their march to the Romanian capital. At least a dozen police 
officers were injured and some were taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	The police used tear gas and smoke bombs to try to disperse  
miners seeking higher pay but retreated from their roadblock in 
face of the rampaging mob. 
</P>
<P>
	Private television station Antenna 1 reported about 50 police  
were taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miners are attacking in an organized way like an army,''  
government spokesman Rasvan Popescu said. ``They have taken 
prisoners among the policemen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The violence erupted after the miners rejected the government's  
offer for more negotiations aimed at ending their 16-day-old strike 
and advanced on the 3,400 special troops massed along a main road 
to Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested an unspecified number of miners as they tried to  
break through police lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are determined to prevent an outbreak of even worse  
violence. In two previous visits to the capital in 1990 and 1991, 
miners rampaged for days, leaving nine people dead, dozens injured 
and forcing one government to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Radu Vasile earlier named a government team to  
negotiate with the miners in a nearby city. But the miners insist 
the premier be present. 
</P>
<P>
	President Emil Constantinescu, emerging from an emergency  
government meeting, said the conflict was ``no longer a labor 
dispute'' and was ``damaging the authority of the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantinescu later fired his interior minister, according to  
Popescu, the government spokesman. Gavil Dejeu, widely criticized 
for failing to stop the miners' advance, was replaced by Constantin 
Dudu Ionescu, a 42-year-old former deputy defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The miners are pressing for 35 percent wage hikes and the  
equivalent of $10,000 severance pay -- demands the government says 
it cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Miners make an average of $209 a month, about twice the average  
monthly salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Shouting obscenities, the miners hurled rocks and threw homemade  
gasoline bombs at police today, surrounding one group of officers 
and chasing them up a hill. The troops then retreated from the 
roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash broke out after 7,000 miners had spent the night a few  
miles away, considering the government's offer and deciding whether 
to challenge the special forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops had piled massive concrete slabs across a narrow bend in  
the road to deter a possible onslaught. They sang military and 
popular Romanian songs overnight, warming themselves by fires as 
temperatures dropped to below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Around midday, hundreds of miners in cars and trucks approached  
the police blockade, throwing rocks and yelling and cursing at the 
troops before scattering as smoke bombs landed among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't leave!'' yelled some police troops wielding riot  
shields at the blockade in Costesti, 120 miles northwest of 
Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are not Romanian!'' the miners shouted back, referring to  
their lack of support for the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more miners marched behind them, reaching the site  
later with their fiery leader, Miron Cozma. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time this week that a showdown caused  
injuries. Twenty-four miners and police were injured on Monday, the 
day the march began. 
</P>
<P>
	The striking miners set off from the western Jiu Valley on  
Monday, breaking through police lines and clambering over 
roadblocks, clashing with police several times. 
</P>
<P>
	They paused in their march to Bucharest on Wednesday upon  
hearing that anti-riot troops were waiting.

<HEADLINE>  Walsh Appointed 49ers GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- After six months of uncertainty  
caused by a front-office exodus, questions about who's in charge of 
the San Francisco 49ers were answered by Bill Walsh's appointment 
as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be my job to manage the organization, the operational  
side of it, in particular, and to deal with the real challenges 
that will be occurring in the next few months,'' said Walsh, back 
for his third tour with the 49ers, but his first exclusively as an 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh originally came to San Francisco in 1979, winning three  
Super Bowls in 10 years as coach while overseeing drafts or trades 
that produced such players Joe Montana, Steve Young and Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also an awkward stint under George Seifert as a  
consultant in 1996 in which his suggestions were routinely ignored. 
That won't be the case this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't return to the San Francisco 49ers in a  
subordinate role, and I think that's understandable,'' Walsh said. 
``Not that I haven't worked well with others or for others. I did 
that for George Seifert for one year. But the role has changed, 
where I can really, truly express my beliefs and implement those 
beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Walsh in the executive ranks will be Terry Donahue, 54.  
The former UCLA coach and broadcaster, Donahue was hired as the 
team's player personnel director. Walsh said Donahue also will be 
groomed to eventually succeed him as the team's chief football 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The additions bring a sense of closure to six months of  
organizational upheaval marked by the resignations of Carmen Policy 
and Larry Thrailkill as team president and Dwight Clark as general 
manager and the firing of Vinny Cerrato as player personnel 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now there's a sense of stability,'' said Walsh, who  
was signed to a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't come here, for example, to clean house or to get  
this thing straight. It could be that everyone is doing a solid job 
and performing well and there could be no changes. It could be that 
there will be some changes. We're just going to go to work, 
continue as we have and see where that takes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh took pains to say he was there to complement the efforts  
of coach Steve Mariucci, signed to a new five-year contract last

San Francisco went 12-4 this season and beat Green Bay in the 
playoffs before losing to Atlanta in the divisional round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not going to interfere with Steve, other than a  
play or two I might try to call during a game,'' Walsh said, 
laughing. ``I'm in total harmony with Steve Mariucci.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the 49ers facing a salary cap crunch -- they're a projected  
$24 million over next season's limit -- Walsh said he and his staff 
face major challenges in holding the roster together. He also said 
he expects to focus more on the draft than free agency in 
addressing team needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy, but you have a choice of pyramiding  
or mortgaging into the future further or trying to deal with it 
directly,'' Walsh said. ``We can't do it cold turkey, but we 
certainly have to be looking closely at where we are with our squad 
and the cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also hopes to hire former 49ers receiver Gene  
Washington as an executive vice president, which would make him one 
of the highest ranking blacks in a front office role. Washington, 
52, currently is the NFL's director of football development. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's addition to the 49ers front office could coincide  
with the resolution of exiled co-owner Eddie DeBartolo's bid for 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo is awaiting NFL clearance to resume active ownership  
of the team. He ceded day-to-day control to his sister, co-owner 
Denise DeBartolo York, in December 1997 when he was targeted in a 
Louisiana gambling fraud probe. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last October to failing to report a  
felony crime and was placed on probation and fined $2 million. He 
also must testify against former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, who 
allegedly received $400,000 from DeBartolo as part of an 
influence-peddling scheme involving issuance of riverboat casino 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is expected to decide by this spring whether to allow  
DeBartolo to regain control of the team.

<HEADLINE> Hollings Recovers From Eye Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings isn't  
trying to make a fashion or political statement with his dark 
sunglasses. The South Carolina Democrat simply is recovering from 
eye surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollings wore the sunglasses Tuesday night during President  
Clinton's State of the Union address. He also has worn them at 
times during the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's operation involved fitting Hollings' left eye with  
an improved lens device, a follow-up to cataract surgery he had in 
1972, spokesman Maury Lane said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  Walsh Appointed 49ers GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- After six months of uncertainty  
caused by a front-office exodus, questions about who's in charge of 
the San Francisco 49ers were answered by Bill Walsh's appointment 
as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be my job to manage the organization, the operational  
side of it, in particular, and to deal with the real challenges 
that will be occurring in the next few months,'' said Walsh, back 
for his third tour with the 49ers, but his first exclusively as an 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh originally came to San Francisco in 1979, winning three  
Super Bowls in 10 years as coach while overseeing drafts or trades 
that produced such players Joe Montana, Steve Young and Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also an awkward stint under George Seifert as a  
consultant in 1996 in which his suggestions were routinely ignored. 
That won't be the case this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't return to the San Francisco 49ers in a  
subordinate role, and I think that's understandable,'' Walsh said. 
``Not that I haven't worked well with others or for others. I did 
that for George Seifert for one year. But the role has changed, 
where I can really, truly express my beliefs and implement those 
beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Walsh in the executive ranks will be Terry Donahue, 54.  
The former UCLA coach and broadcaster, Donahue was hired as the 
team's player personnel director. Walsh said Donahue also will be 
groomed to eventually succeed him as the team's chief football 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The additions bring a sense of closure to six months of  
organizational upheaval marked by the resignations of Carmen Policy 
and Larry Thrailkill as team president and Dwight Clark as general 
manager and the firing of Vinny Cerrato as player personnel 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now there's a sense of stability,'' said Walsh, who  
was signed to a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't come here, for example, to clean house or to get  
this thing straight. It could be that everyone is doing a solid job 
and performing well and there could be no changes. It could be that 
there will be some changes. We're just going to go to work, 
continue as we have and see where that takes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh took pains to say he was there to complement the efforts  
of coach Steve Mariucci, signed to a new five-year contract last 
week, and praised him as one of the finest coaches in the league. 
San Francisco went 12-4 this season and beat Green Bay in the 
playoffs before losing to Atlanta in the divisional round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not going to interfere with Steve, other than a  
play or two I might try to call during a game,'' Walsh said, 
laughing. ``I'm in total harmony with Steve Mariucci.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Loses $603M in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Drug and food maker Monsanto Co. announced a  
$603 million loss in the fourth quarter Thursday, blaming costs 
tied to restructuring and research projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, officials said the company will eliminate 1,700 jobs  
this year -- about twice as many as had been announced when a 
restructuring plan was outlined two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly loss amounted to $1 per share. In the fourth  
quarter of 1997, the company earned $5 million, or 1 cent per 
share. Revenues during the quarter ending Dec. 31 were $2.1 
billion, compared to $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto stock closed down $1.31 1/4 cents, or 3 percent, at  
$39.56 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto, based in St. Louis, makes a variety of products  
ranging from Nutrasweet artificial sweetener to herbicides to drugs 
for arthritis and insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Monsanto and American Home Products called off what  
would have been the largest ever merger of life sciences companies. 
Monsanto spokeswoman Lori Fisher said the failed merger had nothing 
to do with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto reported restructuring and special charges of $625  
million in the quarter. The company said part of the charge covers 
the costs to eliminate about 1,700 jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Monsanto said it would eliminate between 700 and  
1,000 jobs and nonessential businesses as part of a restructuring 
aimed at focusing on the seed and drug businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an estimate in November,'' Fisher said. ``As estimates  
sometimes have a way of turning out, when we got back in there and 
looked at what we really wanted to do the actual number of jobs to 
be eliminated in this restructuring is 1,700.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts are just beginning and will continue through the year,  
Fisher said. Monsanto has about 31,500 workers at plants around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will be ``across the board, across businesses, across  
geographic areas,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the debt they're taking on, they are having to really  
tighten their belt,'' analyst William Fiala of Edward Jones said. 
``They're going through a period where they're spending money for 
future growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter results also included charges of $233 million,  
primarily for research and development associated with the 
purchases of DeKalb Genetics Corp., Plant Breeding International 
Cambridge Limited, and the international seed operations of Cargill 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Monsanto lost $250 million, or 41 cents per share,  
on sales of $8.6 billion. In 1997, Monsanto earned $294 million, or 
77 cents per share, on sales of $7.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Bucks, Karl Finally Get Started </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks got their first  
feel of ``Camp Karl'' on Thursday, running 18 full-court sprints 
following a spirited workout under new coach George Karl. 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 sprints, Armon Gilliam missed a free throw,  
guaranteeing three more sprints, and then Michael Curry missed, 
promising two more. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Glenn Robinson sank two free throws to the relief of  
his tired teammates and Day 1 of the new regime assembled to return 
the Bucks to the playoffs after a seven-year absence was in the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is pumped up and excited about being out here, so  
we're really not looking at it as being tough,'' Robinson said. 
``We're looking at it as taking care of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Star guard Ray Allen skipped practice with a case of strep  
throat, but Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor, the sixth pick in the NBA 
draft, ran the sprints and sneaked in a few seconds of scrimmage 
before signing a contract believed to be worth $6 million over 
three years with club options for two more. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, who was fired by Seattle after a successful stint with the  
SuperSonics, said he inherited a solid team from his predecessor 
Chris Ford. But the rust was evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone's in shape, but I don't think anyone's  
that far away, either,'' Karl said. ``It's going to take some time 
to get some legs and get some bounce to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl had a bad case of cabin fever during the owners' six-month  
lockout that prevented him from going about the business of 
rehabilitating both the Bucks and his own coaching career following 
a nasty breakup in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm at home. I feel like I'm back where I'm  
supposed to be,'' said Karl, dressed in a purple Bucks T-shirt and 
matching cap. ``As I told the team last night, making the playoffs, 
playing in May is going to be our very simple goal for us. And I 
think we'll do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for Karl's defense-oriented philosophy to  
show up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the aggressiveness of the team and I thought the  
biggest surprise to me was defensively, they had some concepts and 
some feel to what we do,'' Karl said. ``I was encouraged. With Ray 
not playing and Traylor not here, I thought it was a very solid 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy with the first day.''  
</P>
<P>
	And the players were very tired.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's good when it's over and you can concentrate on what you  
got done,'' Curry said. ``I think guys worked really hard and they 
put you in situations where you can't do anything but work hard and 
that's important for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Terrell Brandon didn't mind the hard work. He missed  
much of last season with a foot injury and was excited just to be 
back on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rejuvenated because I'm healthy,'' Brandon said. ``And  
having a new coach adds to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does having Traylor on hand in time.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 284-pound University of Michigan product couldn't  
wait to contribute, so he slipped onto the court a few times even 
while the finishing touches were being put on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to take care of business off the court because I  
could start taking care of business on the court,'' said Traylor, 
whose top priority was to buy his grandmother a new house. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks, who return 10 players from last year's team, signed  
four free agents to one-year contracts: Kipp Christianson, Mike 
Higgins, Donny Marshall and Donald Royal. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl said the roster will change before the Bucks open their  
abbreviated 50-game season at Charlotte on Feb. 6, five days before 
their home opener against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we got our ears open, I think there will be some new  
bodies in here,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl said the lockout was particularly tortuous on him because  
he didn't have a chance to start molding his team last summer, much 
less this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were days of craziness. There were days I didn't  
understand. I was angry, I was out of control maybe. ... I wasn't 
getting along with many people,'' Karl said. ``It's behind us. I'd 
rather not rekindle that misery that we've brought on the game. 
It's better that we forget about it and heal it rather than rehash 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order for fans to feel the same, Karl knows the team must  
show improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to play hard and we've got to win,'' Karl said. ``We  
may not have to win immediately, but we've got to play hard 
immediately.''

<HEADLINE> McFarlane May Be McGwire Ball Buyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, ALberta (AP) -- A former resident of Calgary who is a  
comic book creator and part owner of the Edmonton Oilers might be 
the mystery buyer of Mark McGwire's 70th home-run ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd McFarlane, 37, whose Spawn comic books, action figures and  
TV series have earned him an international cult following, already 
owns the first home-run ball McGwire hit during the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was suggested to McFarlane's father Bob that his son was  
the one who paid $3 million for the baseball at an auction earlier 
this month, he asked: ``Who let the cat out of the bag?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, he said his son denies he is the anonymous  
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got hold of Todd's secretary and she said they are denying  
they have the ball,'' the elder McFarlane said from the family's 
home in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob McFarlane confirmed his son told him he was going to bid for  
the record-setting ball, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd McFarlane was in Los Angeles working on negotiations for  
the movie Spawn 2 and could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Senate Gets Chance To Ask Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the prosecution and defense arguments  
finished in the impeachment trial of President Clinton, the Senate 
opens a 16-hour question-and-answer period Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said at the conclusion of  
the White House's arguments on Thursday that the next phase would 
begin at 1 p.m. EST and last five hours, with Democratic and 
Republican senators taking turns, and Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist reading the questions. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous agreement to alternate between parties for two hours  
at a time has been scrapped, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will reconvene at 10 a.m. EST on Saturday to continue  
the session in the same fashion for an undetermined amount of time, 
Lott said, under an agreement reached with Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Lott and officials close to him, senators will  
submit their questions to Lott and Daschle, who will forward them 
to Rehnquist. Rehnquist will ask the question, and whoever it is 
aimed at -- either House prosecutors or Clinton's lawyers -- will 
answer. Lott encouraged everyone to be brief. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders did not set a time limit on the answers because  
they are confident Rehnquist will be vigilant about clipping those 
who wander. Any senator could rise to suggest Rehnquist speed up an 
answer to a question, according to Lott spokesman John Czwartacki. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of questions have been received by the leaders of both  
parties, who are culling them to avoid repetition. They range from 
factual questions on the differences between testimony to 
constitutional queries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, any senator can submit a question at any time during  
the proceedings, Czwartacki said.

<HEADLINE> Ford Subsidiaries Post Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s parts, financing and  
rental-car subsidiaries Thursday reported increased earnings for 
the fourth quarter and for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Visteon Automotive Systems, Ford's parts unit, earned $132  
million for the quarter, up 175 percent from the $48 million earned 
in the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $4.6 billion, up 3 percent 
from $4.4 billion a year ago. For the year, Visteon earned $712 
million, up 37 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford chief financial officer John M. Devine said Visteon was  
making progress in its effort to attract more non-Ford business. 
Ford's expected to spin off Visteon once its business is 
diversified enough to operate on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Credit Co., the world's largest automotive finance company,  
reported a fourth-quarter profit of $234 million, up 7 percent from 
a year ago. Excluding one-time charges, earnings totaled $240 
million, up 10 percent. The company said the increase reflected 
lower credit losses, lower taxes and higher financing volume, which 
were offset partly by higher lease depreciation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Ford Credit earned $1.08 billion, up 5 percent  
from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hertz Corp., Ford's rental vehicle unit, earned a fourth-quarter  
record of $48 million, up 37 percent from the previous record of 
$35 million in the October-December period of 1997. Ford's share of 
that profit was $39 million. Hertz earned $277 million for the 
year, up 37 percent. Ford's share was $224 million.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Tornado Sirens Didn't Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- Emergency alert sirens malfunctioned as a  
killer storm bore down on this western Tennessee town, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Madison County residents were killed in the storm Sunday  
night, dozens were injured and hundreds of homes were destroyed. 
Two other people died in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, the alarm failure didn't matter because there was no  
siren within earshot. But many were within the estimated one-mile 
hearing radius, said Madison County Commissioner Jim Ed Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The residents deserve better. Nobody should put up with  
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the city's 20 sirens failed in tests Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Darryl W. Samuels, Jackson Police Department's central dispatch  
director, said in a memorandum released Wednesday he called in the 
tornado warning from his home in a nearby community after a 
Nashville television station reported the approaching storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Central dispatch personnel had received a National Weather  
Service report and tried unsuccessfully several times to encode the 
sirens, he said. Samuels then drove to the police station and tried 
a manual encoding, but only some of the sirens worked. By that 
time, the storm was hitting the western suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel W. Vaughn, deputy director of the Jackson-Madison County  
Emergency Management Agency, said that at county budget hearings, 
he has been repeatedly ``shot down'' in requests for money to 
upgrade the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting money for an upgrade ``may be easier after this  
disaster,'' said county Mayor J. Alex Leech. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, some residents held a brief prayer service amid  
the debris and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lord, we need your healing hands to be with us,'' said  
Dietrich Kirk, youth pastor at Northside United Methodist Church of 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Christy Frederick and her family were among those at the  
service, pausing from their effort to salvage possessions from the 
wreckage of their home in suburban Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	When the tornado hit, 36-year-old Frederick, her fiance, Bill  
Lindsey, and her three children sought refuge in a small hall. A 
wall fell on them, but was held up a foot or so by Lindsey. The 
family escaped critical injury, though Frederick's 15-year-old son 
had a broken arm and broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just forced us down on top of each other,'' he said. ``It  
was better then. I knew we were somewhat secure. We just had to 
ride a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said volunteers have been coming forward since the  
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people have volunteered with equipment and things like  
that, we've had to cut that off because they're getting in each 
other's way,'' said Ron Barry, chief of Jackson's Public Works 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassie Mills, 15, and other teens carried soft drinks and snacks  
to survivors and workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel really bad because nothing happened to my house,'' said  
Cassie, who doesn't live in the area. ``Now, all these people don't 
have anything.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Money May Not Go to D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of senators today promised  
legislation to block a federal effort to grab a share of the $246 
billion in settlements reached by the states with the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire said the  
states will sue the federal government ``the first time a penny is 
deducted'' from the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government's claim to part of the settlement is  
``absolutely wrong and we're going to fight it every step of the 
way,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who joined Sens. 
Bob Graham, D-Fla., Slade Gorton, R-Wash., Evan Bayh, D-Ind., and 
George Voinovich, R-Ohio, in voicing their support for the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government was not involved in either the lawsuits  
by four states that won $40 billion from the tobacco industry or 
the settlement last fall in which the other 46 states won $206 
billion, Graham said. ``It would be unseemly now at the end of the 
process for the federal government to try to recoup'' some of the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration argues the federal government has a right to  
much of the money because many state suits were to recover money 
spent on Medicaid. The federal government pays for at least half of 
Medicaid in every state. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have said they are willing to negotiate  
the dispute, suggesting that the states might be able to keep all 
the money if they promise to spend it all on public health. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gregoire said the only ``amicable resolution is the U.S.  
Congress saying the federal government has no claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison and Graham said they would work to attach legislation  
barring federal recouping of any state money to any tax- or 
tobacco-related legislation the Congress considers this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, President Clinton said in his State of the Union  
address Tuesday that the federal government would initiate its own 
lawsuit to recover the billions of dollars it spends to treat 
people made sick by smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would compensate Medicare, Defense Department,  
veterans and federal employee health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton praised Clinton for the idea, saying ``that's what he  
ought to do rather than demanding this money'' from the states.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One week into defending antitrust charges,  
Microsoft is reasserting its contention the company does not 
exercise monopoly power in the high-tech industry despite the 
dominance of its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyers were expected today to concentrate on the  
prices it charges computer makers for its popular Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
	Its first witness, economist Richard Schmalensee of the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, testified previously that a 
true monopolist would set Windows prices 16 to 40 times higher than 
the roughly $50 it now charges computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies on Wednesday ended nearly  
four days of questioning Schmalensee. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Richard Urowsky said he expected to finish with  
the economist today. He asked Schmalensee on Wednesday whether 
Microsoft's high profits -- it reported almost $2 billion in 
quarterly profit earlier this week -- suggested monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems hard to me to walk away from the evidence that  
Microsoft is a highly profitable company,'' said Schmalensee, 
adding that high profits do not prove monopoly power. ``Successful 
companies tend to earn extraordinary returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, the government turned to what legal experts  
consider some of the strongest evidence against Microsoft by asking 
about alleged exclusionary agreements with the nation's computer 
makers and Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Microsoft limits how personal computer makers can  
alter the basic appearance of its dominant Windows operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee admitted that computer makers have no choice but to  
agree to demands because there effectively is no alternative to 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies showed Schmalensee an angry e-mail to Microsoft from an  
executive at Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's second-largest 
computer company, complaining about such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had a choice of another supplier, based on your actions  
in this area, I assure you would not be our supplier of choice,'' 
wrote John Romano, a manager at Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee called Romano ``clearly an angry person.'' But he  
said there were many examples of what he called ``channel 
conflict,'' where a manufacturer's legal actions make its 
distributors irate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be surprising ... if Microsoft reducing the freedom  
of action in some respects didn't cause them upset,'' Schmalensee 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft imposed restrictions as early as 1996 to discourage 
distribution of competing Internet software from rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sworn statements from executives at several PC companies  
indicated they were reluctant to sell Netscape's browser if already 
forced to distribute Microsoft's. Both products let people view 
information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In some agreements with Internet providers, Microsoft offered  
its browser free -- despite spending millions of dollars on its 
design -- if they agreed to limit distribution of Netscape's 
software below thresholds, often to fewer than 15 percent of their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies suggested that Microsoft has spent $500 million to develop  
its Internet browser since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that its agreements with computer makers and  
Internet companies are legal. It calls its distribution deals 
similar to those in other industries and says limits on PC makers 
ensure a ``common Windows experience'' even for customers using 
computers from different manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee called Microsoft's attempt to protect its design of  
Windows a ``plausible rationale'' for its restrictions on PC 
makers.

<HEADLINE> Missile Plan No Threat to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia should not view the Clinton  
administration's new commitment of $6.6 billion to building a 
national missile defense as a threat to its nuclear strength or a 
first step toward abandoning the landmark Anti-Ballistic Missile 
treaty, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Thursday that Secretary of Defense  
William Cohen was misunderstood when he told reporters that the 
United States might abandon the ABM treaty if Russia did not agree 
to amend it in ways that permit national missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary did not threaten to withdraw from the treaty,''  
Robert Bell, director of defense programs on the National Security 
Council, said. Bell said the administration has not decided whether 
to try to amend the ABM treaty, or if so what changes may be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Wednesday the administration ``will propose to  
explore with the Russians modifications'' to the treaty that would 
allow Washington to proceed on missile defenses. Cohen was asked 
what the administration would do if Moscow refused to amend the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then,'' Cohen said, ``we have the option ... to simply pull  
out of the treaty,'' as permitted with six months notice. He and 
other administration officials stressed their preference to 
preserve the ABM treaty as a means of constraining the spread of 
offensive missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ABM treaty remains, in the view of this administration, a  
cornerstone of strategic stability,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell also stressed that a decision on whether to deploy missile  
defenses will not be made before June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposed 2000 budget, to be submitted to Congress  
early next month, will include an additional $6.6 billion for 
national missile defense, raising the price tag to $10.5 billion 
through the year 2005 for a network of high-technology radars and 
missile interceptors. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has balked at changing the ABM treaty to let the  
Americans deploy a national missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will discuss the  
idea with Russian officials when she visits Moscow next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine the Russians will have a number of questions of  
their own,'' Bell said, adding there have been regular contacts on 
these issues over the past week. Clinton wrote to President Boris 
Yeltsin recently to outline U.S. plans for missile defense and to 
urge Yeltsin not to view them as a strategic threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials discounted Cohen's statements about a growing  
threat of long-range missile attack facing the United States from 
North Korea and other small powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any military expert understands that these states have not,  
and, in the near future, will not have guaranteed means of 
delivering weapons to U.S. territory,'' Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, 
chief of the international cooperation department at the Russian 
Defense Ministry, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore, the Russian Defense Ministry regards the U.S.  
statements on withdrawal from or revision of the ABM treaty as a 
threat to Russian security interests,'' Ivashov was quoted as 
saying by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	China joined in the criticism. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry  
spokesman Sun Yuxi said his government believes a U.S. missile 
defense system ``would only undermine security and stimulate the 
proliferation of missiles.'' China is the only nation other than 
Russia with nuclear missiles capable of reaching U.S. territory, 
though its arsenal is far smaller than Russia's.

<HEADLINE> Shields To Do All in Senior Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Scott Shields was invited to the Senior Bowl  
as a punter. He won't let that stop him from doing other things. 
</P>
<P>
	A versatile player from Weber State, Shields came to the Senior  
Bowl with a mission: He wants to prove to the NFL scouts and 
coaches that he can do anything they ask him. 
</P>
<P>
	A seven-time selection -- yes, seven -- to the All-Big Sky team,  
there's no telling where Shields will line up in Saturday's Senior 
Bowl. He was a safety, punter and placekicker during his four years 
at Weber State and somehow persuaded North coach Jon Gruden to let 
him work out a safety this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scouts are always interested in the people who can do a  
lot of different things,'' Shields said. ``I can play safety, I can 
punt, I can do kickoffs. Anything they want from me, I can do it. I 
can be on an NFL team for one primary position and also be the 
ultimate backup at the other positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shields was the Big Sky Conference's Defensive Player of the  
Year this season with 97 tackles and six interceptions as a strong 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He also kicked 67 career field goals -- including a 55-yarder --  
and averaged 41.9 yards per punt for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	And at 6-foot-4, 227 pounds, the scouts love his size -- some  
have even said he could play linebacker in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is just stunned by my size when they find out I'm a  
punter,'' Shields said. ``So I tried to come out and show I had 
speed as well, and that I can play safety in the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time selection to the Associated Press All-America team  
as an all-purpose player, Shields is the best player you've never 
heard of. Shields could have been one of the biggest names at the 
Senior Bowl if he hadn't gone to Weber State, but the Ogden, Utah, 
school was the only one interested in letting him do it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most schools said I could play either football or soccer, but  
not both,'' Shields said. ``I wanted to play football, but I wanted 
to handle all the kicking and play safety. Every big school that 
was interested in me said one or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Shields went to Weber State, which makes him yet another  
small school player trying to make a name for himself in front of 
the hundreds of scouts and coaches at the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shields doesn't think he has anything more to prove than any  
other player here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came down here and saw all these players that I've seen on  
T.V. and everyone had heard of them, but no one had heard of me,'' 
Shields said. ``So for me, it was my opportunity to show I can play 
with them and I can even be one of them.''

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes in Arkansas Kill Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tornadoes and funnel clouds tore across  
Arkansas on Thursday, killing at least three people. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm system that forecasters had been warning about since  
earlier in the week collapsed the front of a downtown Little Rock 
grocery store, damaged a restaurant and knocked over trees at the 
Governor's Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of injured exceeded a dozen statewide and tens of  
thousands were without power. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were hurt at the Harvest Foods store that was  
imploded in a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lights flickered a couple times, then it went black,''  
said Derrick Stallworth, who was on the soda pop and bottled water 
aisle when the storm hit. ``I decided to hit the floor, then I saw 
the roof coming down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The store pharmacist was among the injured. Witnesses who were  
outside the store said it was hit by a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real one, in the sky and coming down. Black and  
white. So many different colors,'' said Michelle Johnson, who 
watched the storm roll in. 
</P>
<P>
	Trees were damaged at the Arkansas Governor's Mansion just south  
of downtown but the house was spared and Gov. Mike Huckabee and his 
family were not hurt, said Huckabee's spokesman Jim Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornado warnings were issued for more than half of the state's  
75 counties in an outbreak that forecasters had been talking about 
since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Searcy Schools Superintendent Tony Wood said a member of the  
school board was killed in the tornado at Center Hill, 45 miles 
northeast of Little Rock, when a twister struck the victim's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person was killed in a building at North Little Rock and  
a woman was killed when a tree fell on her car in the neighborhood 
south of the Harvest Foods, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries were reported from many of the 38 counties for where  
warnings were posted. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the storms followed the same path as a March 1, 1997,  
outbreak that killed 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail the size of grapefruits was reported at Sardis, south of  
Little Rock, and the size of baseballs at Maumelle, northwest of 
Little Rock. Smaller hail was reported in Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60,000 people were without power between Little Rock and  
the Missouri state line, Entergy Arkansas spokesman Dan Daugherty 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Bumpers Makes Plea for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a plea to former colleagues, retired Sen.  
Dale Bumpers told senators today they must resist a House effort to 
remove President Clinton from office in a drive that ``is dangerous 
to the unique mix of pure democracy and republican government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech that mixed self-deprecating humor, emotional  
descriptions of his friendship with Clinton and repeated references 
to his own reverence for the Constitution, Bumpers closed out the 
White House opening defense argument with a personal appeal after 
the president's lawyers relentlessly attacked the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have taken a solemn oath to be fair and impartial. I know  
you all, I know you as friends and I know you as honorable men and 
I am perfectly satisfied to put that in your hands, under your 
oath,'' said Bumpers, who retired from the Senate in December after 
24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He denounced Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky  
controversy as ``a breach of his marriage vows'' and a ``terrible 
moral lapse'' -- but not a crime that was impeachable. He spoke 
eloquently of the human toll the president's mistake had on 
Clinton's family, while chiding House prosecutors for a lack of 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned the senators that the idea of removing Clinton for  
such offenses is ``dangerous to the political process and is 
dangerous to the unique mix of pure democracy and republican 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh colleagues, you have such an awesome responsibility,''  
Bumpers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though mostly serious, he also brought laughter to the floor. He  
recalled how he and Clinton had once survived a rough plane landing 
in Arkansas one snowy day. ``We jumped out and ran away unscathed -- 
to the dismay of every budding politician in Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he reminded his recent colleagues that he was not there as  
Clinton's friend but as a former senator concerned about the 
precedent a conviction of Clinton would set. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that the Founding Fathers had put impeachment in the  
Constitution ``to protect the public, not punish the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton's private lawyer charged that House impeachment  
prosecutors had ignored evidence that would exonerate the president 
in an ``attempt to fit some of the facts into a sinister pattern'' 
of obstruction of justice. ``The direct evidence disproves the 
charges,'' David Kendall argued as the Clinton team completed its 
opening presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's presentation was methodical, unrelenting and a stark  
contrast to that of Bumpers. He spared no words for the president's 
critics in denouncing the Whitewater investigation as ``tortuous 
and meandering'' and said he was before the trial to rebut the 
``rhetoric'' of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The final presentation came one year to the day after the  
Lewinsky allegations became public and thrust the presidency into 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is more than rhetoric. It means that in  
proceedings like these, where important rights are being 
adjudicated, that evidence matters. Fairness matters. ... The 
presumption of innocence matters,'' argued Kendall, who has 
represented the president through a variety of legal controversies

	``The rule of law is not the monopoly of the House managers, and  
it ought to be practiced in these proceedings as well as talked 
about in speeches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closing statement invoking Thomas Jefferson and George  
Washington, Kendall pleaded with senators to ``cool the passions of 
the moment'' and cast aside the ``poisonous partisanship'' of the 
House impeachment vote. ``We ask only that you give this case and 
give this country the constitutional stability and the political

<P>
	The president's criminal lawyer focused his attack on the  
impeachment article accusing Clinton of obstruction, saying it was 
``based on circumstantial evidence, and that evidence is at best 
profoundly ambiguous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His assessment of the House prosecutors' case was harsh. At one  
point, he ridiculed as ``entirely untanable '' Rep. Bob Barr's 
assertion last week that Clinton tried to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in 
New York to avoid a subpoena in the Paula Jones sexual harassment. 
``She was just as vulnerable to subpoena in New York as 
Washington,'' Kendall retorted. 
</P>
<P>
	He dissected in great detail the allegation that Clinton had  
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	With a touch of sarcasm, Kendall read Ms. Lewinsky's testimony  
that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job 
for my silence.'' And then he asked, ``Is there something difficult 
to understand here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall noted that Ms. Lewinsky had testified she believed she  
was filing a true affidavit when she denied having ``sexual 
relations'' with the president and that Clinton ``showed no 
interest in viewing'' the affidavit before it was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	He charged that those were ``obviously exculpatory'' facts that  
``the House managers simply ignored in their attempt to fit some of 
the facts into a sinister pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators will soon get their first chance to ask questions of  
the two sides, submitting those queries through Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist. That questioning is expected to begin Friday and 
continue Saturday. Some 70 questions have been submitted by 
Republicans so far, a GOP spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said they oppose dismissal of the charges and  
support the need for limited live testimony from key witnesses such 
as Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and presidential 
secretary Betty Currie -- and they should get their way with a 55-45 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with a two-thirds majority needed to make Clinton the  
first president evicted from his job, Democrats hold the votes for 
acquittal and show no signs of backing a move to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.  
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union 
address Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to 72 
percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One well-known conservative Republican, evangelist and  
broadcaster Pat Robertson, said Clinton pulled off such a public 
relations coup in the address that there is no chance he will be 
convicted. ``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing 
and get on with something else,'' he said on ``The 700 Club'' 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, in town to attend a Senate  
lecture series sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., declined a chance to discuss the impeachment trial. But 
speaking in the Old Senate Chamber Wednesday evening, the former 
Republican president lamented that today in Washington, ``we are 
confronted with a deficit of decency -- one that deepens by the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's defense before senators Wednesday, Deputy White  
House Counsel Cheryl Mills argued that House managers ignored 
testimony from Mrs. Currie in order to falsely accuse the president 
of trying to obstruct the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those facts, those stubborn facts that just don't fit,''  
Ms. Mills said.

<HEADLINE>  Bumpers Makes Plea for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a plea to former colleagues, retired Sen.  
Dale Bumpers told senators today they must resist a House effort to 
remove President Clinton from office in a drive that ``is dangerous 
to the unique mix of pure democracy and republican government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech that mixed self-deprecating humor, emotional  
descriptions of his friendship with Clinton and repeated references 
to his own reverence for the Constitution, Bumpers closed out the 
White House opening defense argument with a personal appeal after 
the president's lawyers relentlessly attacked the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have taken a solemn oath to be fair and impartial. I know  
you all, I know you as friends and I know you as honorable men and 
I am perfectly satisfied to put that in your hands, under your 
oath,'' said Bumpers, who retired from the Senate in December after 
24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He denounced Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky  
controversy as ``a breach of his marriage vows'' and a ``terrible 
moral lapse'' -- but not a crime that was impeachable. He spoke 
eloquently of the human toll the president's mistake had on 
Clinton's family, while chiding House prosecutors for a lack of 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned the senators that the idea of removing Clinton for  
such offenses is ``dangerous to the political process and is 
dangerous to the unique mix of pure democracy and republican 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh colleagues, you have such an awesome responsibility,''  
Bumpers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though mostly serious, he also brought laughter to the floor. He  
recalled how he and Clinton had once survived a rough plane landing 
in Arkansas one snowy day. ``We jumped out and ran away unscathed -- 
to the dismay of every budding politician in Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he reminded his recent colleagues that he was not there as  
Clinton's friend but as a former senator concerned about the 
precedent a conviction of Clinton would set. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that the Founding Fathers had put impeachment in the  
Constitution ``to protect the public, not punish the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton's private lawyer charged that House impeachment  
prosecutors had ignored evidence that would exonerate the president 
in an ``attempt to fit some of the facts into a sinister pattern'' 
of obstruction of justice. ``The direct evidence disproves the 
charges,'' David Kendall argued as the Clinton team completed its 
opening presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's presentation was methodical, unrelenting and a stark  
contrast to that of Bumpers. He spared no words for the president's 
critics in denouncing the Whitewater investigation as ``tortuous 
and meandering'' and said he was before the trial to rebut the 
``rhetoric'' of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The final presentation came one year to the day after the  
Lewinsky allegations became public and thrust the presidency into 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is more than rhetoric. It means that in  
proceedings like these, where important rights are being 
adjudicated, that evidence matters. Fairness matters. ... The 
presumption of innocence matters,'' argued Kendall, who has 
represented the president through a variety of legal controversies 
dating to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is not the monopoly of the House managers, and  
it ought to be practiced in these proceedings as well as talked 
about in speeches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closing statement invoking Thomas Jefferson and George  
Washington, Kendall pleaded with senators to ``cool the passions of 
the moment'' and cast aside the ``poisonous partisanship'' of the 
House impeachment vote. ``We ask only that you give this case and 
give this country the constitutional stability and the political 
sanity which this country deserves,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stoudamire Set To Sign With Blazers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Damon Stoudamire could have squeezed the  
Portland Trail Blazers for every last penny. He will settle for 
being the highest-paid point guard in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire will re-sign with the Blazers for $81 million for  
seven years, agent Aaron Goodwin said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ecstatic,'' Goodwin said. ``Damon made the decision to do  
the deal because he wanted to be with this team and because he 
wanted to get the Blazers fans behind the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was expected to be officially announced at 2 p.m. EST  
today, the earliest NBA teams can begin training camps. It's also 
Blazers owner Paul Allen's 46th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire, traded to his hometown from the Toronto Raptors as  
part of a six-player deal last season, was among the players who 
lost the most under the new collective bargaining agreement, 
finalized Wednesday by the league and players union lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin initially said he was pursuing a seven-year, $86.2  
million deal, the most allowed for a fourth-year player under the 
labor agreement. But the agent said Stoudamire took less money to 
stay in Portland and to get a deal done before camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to take a fair deal, and he feels that he's got  
one,'' Goodwin said. ``He wanted to move on, and I commend him for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle guard Gary Payton had the previous largest contract for  
a point guard, $79.9 million for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin said Stoudamire got a ``megadeal,'' considering what  
other point guards will make under the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at what (Washington Wizards free agent) Rod Strickland  
was offered -- $30 million over three years,'' Goodwin said. ``For 
Damon to get $81 million is incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire still isn't the highest-paid player on the team.  
Rasheed Wallace signed a six-year, $80 million contract extension 
before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers, who haven't won a playoff series since losing the  
1992 NBA Finals to the Chicago Bulls, made Stoudamire the 
cornerstone of the franchise last Feb. 13 when they acquired him, 
Walt Williams and Carlos Rogers from Toronto for Kenny Anderson, 
Gary Trent and Alvin Williams, as well as two first-round draft 
picks and cash. Anderson was then dealt to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the trade, Stoudamire said he wanted to remain in  
Portland, where he was a star at Wilson High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where he wanted to be,'' Goodwin said. ``It's a  
win-win for everyone involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire will make $9 million this season. He made $1.7  
million last season, the last of his three-year deal with the 
Raptors. He was the first draft pick of the expansion Raptors in 
the 1995 draft, the No. 7 pick overall, out of Arizona. He was 
named NBA Rookie of the Year in 1996 after averaging 19 points and 
9.3 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	After boosting his scoring average to 20.2 in 1996-97,  
Stoudamire slipped to 17.3 points and 8.2 assists last season, but 
was bothered by a badly sprained ankle for much of his time with 
the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Stoudamire running the team, Portland made the playoffs for  
the 16th straight year, but was beaten by the Lakers 3-1 in the 
opening round. It was the sixth straight time the Blazers were 
eliminated in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers are reportedly close to signing their other major  
free agent, center Arvydas Sabonis. The 34-year-old Lithuanian, who 
averaged 16 points and 10 rebounds for Portland in his third NBA 
season, opted out of the final two years of his contract and should 
get a substantial raise over his $3 million salary last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabonis' agent, Herb Rudoy, said Sabonis might not take part in  
workouts today if a deal isn't done.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower Vs. Euro, Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro and other major  
currencies Thursday amid volatile trading in Brazilian markets, 
which investors feared would spread to U.S. exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen on rumors China was going to  
devalue its currency, which would further harm the struggling 
Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1595 in late New York trading, rising  
from $1.1555 late Wednesday. The dollar rose to 113.68 yen, up from 
112.85 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold off their dollars and bought euros, Swiss francs  
and British pounds as Brazil's Bovespa stock index, Latin America's 
largest, fell 4.6 percent and the Brazilian currency fell to 1.71 
reals to the dollar from 1.58 reals the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	One dollar bought 1.21 reals on Jan. 12, the day before a  
limited devaluation roiled markets worldwide. Brazil has since 
allowed its currency to float freely in currency markets. But the 
falling value of Brazilian stocks and currency Thursday scared 
investors, who reacted to rumors that Brazil was propping up the 
real by selling dollars and that China might devalue its currency, 
the yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is extremely nervous, and any negative comment on  
the market at all creates panic,'' one Rio de Janeiro dealer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That put downward pressure on the dollar, particularly against  
the European currencies, which was evident in the euro/dollar rate 
and the dollar/Swiss rate,'' said Robert Lynch, a currency 
strategist at Banque Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and the United States have close ties, with 2,000 U.S.  
corporations active in Latin America's largest economy and U.S. 
banks having $27 billion invested in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, that same rumor about the Chinese currency affected  
the value of the yen, which fell because a devalued yuan would 
create even more problems in economically troubled Asia. Japan is 
fighting its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's understandable the market is a little more sensitive to  
devaluation rumors, given what's happening in Brazil,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, the dollar was quoted at 1.3839 Swiss francs,  
down from 1.3883 Wednesday, and 1.5187 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.5210. The British pound rose to $1.6534 from $1.6453. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6869 German 
marks, down from 1.6926; 5.6561 French francs, down from 5.6754; 
and 1,669.45 Italian lire, down from 1,675.04.

<HEADLINE> ITC Rules on Canada Cattle Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American ranchers have won a round in their  
trade fight over imported cattle with a ruling by the International 
Trade Commission that they might have been hurt by imports of live 
Canadian cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on Wednesday means the case now moves to the  
Commerce Department, which will investigate whether Canadian cattle 
have been dumped or exported to this country at subsidies that 
reduced their cost to less than fair value. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis in the cattle industry is real and imports are part  
of the problem,'' said Leo McDonnell, president of the 
Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Foundation, which brought the trade 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	In its petitions filed late last year, the foundation charged  
Canada and Mexico with unfair policies in live cattle trade with 
United States. The commission's ruling found no indication of 
injury from imports from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition process, though over a significant hurdle, is far  
from over. A decision from Commerce is not expected until early 
May. Once the Commerce Department finishes its investigation, the 
case could go back to the ITC. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the legal foundation's action could require  
foreign producers to sell their products at a fair price or 
importers to pay the difference to the U.S. government as an 
additional duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the foundation blame the North American Free Trade  
Agreement approved by Congress in 1993 for opening the gates to 
Canadian and Mexican imports -- many of which are believed to be 
subsidized by their governments -- without providing U.S. producers 
equal benefits for their exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ranchers believe the imported cattle have driven down  
market prices in the United States and increased the financial 
pressures that can force cattle producers out of business.

<HEADLINE> Novartis Sales Down in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Pharmaceutical giant Novartis' sales  
slumped 3 percent in the fourth quarter but were up 2 percent for 
all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's third biggest drug company expects that despite the  
sales performance, its profit for the year will show a marked 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales were reported Thursday but the earnings report is due  
March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Novartis shares slumped 4.7 percent by midday.  
</P>
<P>
	The company statement said Novartis is ``reaping the major cost  
savings from merger synergies.'' Novartis was created by the 1996 
merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in its biggest division, pharmaceuticals, were off 1  
percent in the fourth quarter but rose 3 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total sales rose to 31.7 billion Swiss francs, or $22.8 billion,  
for 1998 comoared with 31.18 billion Swiss francs a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis earned 5.21 billion francs, then worth $3.6 billion,

<HEADLINE> Rodman Changes His Mind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman decided he wasn't naked enough to  
quit playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who for years has been said he'll strip off his clothes  
before leaving the court in his last NBA game, said Wednesday he is 
not planning to sit out a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's most outrageous player posted a message on his  
Internet site announcing he has had enough of limbo. His agent, 
Dwight Manley, confirmed that the seven-time rebounding champion 
wants to return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been reviewing my options,'' Rodman wrote, ``and those  
options still include playing in the NBA this season with a 
contender. Chicago, New York and L.A. are all cities I'd like to 
play in. Playing overseas could be pretty cool, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman announced Tuesday he would sit out a year as rumors  
spread that he was about to be traded to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he would elaborate on his change of heart Friday  
night on ``The Tonight Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, so here's the deal,'' Rodman's Web site message began.  
``I've had some long discussions with the people I love, the ones 
whose opinions matter most to me, and I've decided not to retire 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know yesterday I said I was history, and with the NBA  
lockout and everything going on, I really thought I should stop 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going on about his supposed options in Chicago, New York  
and Los Angeles, Rodman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``There's one thing I have always told my fans I would do in my  
last game that I still haven't done. I'm sure you know what it is, 
but I still have to come back for at least one more game so that I 
can get buck naked on the court,'' Rodman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley, who had said he would no longer represent Rodman, said  
he spoke on the telephone with the player for 10-15 minutes 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true,'' Manley said of Rodman's change of heart.  
``Technically, I'm still his agent. There's nothing else I'm 
willing to say at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bulls plan to resuscitate a sign-and-trade deal for  
Rodman, they'll have to do so by 2 p.m. EST today, when teams can 
start making deals. Chicago is expected to renounce its rights to 
Michael Jordan and execute sign-and-trade deals for Scottie Pippen 
(to Houston), Luc Longley (to Phoenix) and Steve Kerr (to San 
Antonio). 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, anyone remotely familiar with Rodman's ways could have  
seen this un-retirement coming. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, hours after Manley said Rodman is finished with the  
game because he wants to go to Hollywood, Rodman backed off and 
said he was in a state of ``limbo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is whether anyone is willing to bend  
over backwards to take another chance on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said Tuesday there were several teams still interested in  
signing the wacky, 37-year-old Rodman, known for his ferocious 
workouts, frequent forays to Las Vegas and an ability to hit the 
boards that led to seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley refused to elaborate on those possibilities Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing else to say on the subject,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman won championships with Chicago in 1996, 1997 and 1998,  
and titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990.

<HEADLINE> Limited Too Recalls Robes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Limited Too Inc. of Columbus, Ohio is  
recalling 17,600 girls' fleece robes because they do not meet 
federal flammability standards for children's sleepwear, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has not received any reports of injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the federal standards, sleepwear, including robes, must be  
flame resistant. If the garment ignites, the flames must 
self-extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
	The robes, girls sizes 7 to 14, are 100 percent polyester  
fleece. They come in violet, teal and plaid. The front wrap robes 
have shawl collars and a tie belt. Some of the robes have matching 
satin trim around the front opening and collar. They have a ``Made 
in Sri Lanka'' label. 
</P>
<P>
	Robes in blue and ivory and robes above size 14 are not subject  
to this recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The robes were sold nationwide from September through December  
1998 for between $60 and $64. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents should immediately stop their children from wearing the  
robes. They can bring the robes into any Limited Too store for a 
full refund or exchange. Consumers can call Limited Too at 
800-934-4497 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EDT Monday through 
Friday or write the company at 3885 Morse Road, Columbus, OH 43219.

<HEADLINE> McDyess Chooses Nuggets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The NBA's new labor agreement already has one big  
winner, the Denver Nuggets, and a big loser, the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio McDyess, traded from the Nuggets to the Suns 15 months  
ago, has decided to return to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real close call,'' McDyess' agent James Bryant said  
Wednesday night ``It came down to a question of do you want to 
inherit a contender or do you want to build one? Phoenix is a great 
franchise, but Denver is doing a lot of exciting things that 
haven't come out yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns could have given McDyess more money than the Nuggets  
can, but not a whole lot more because of limits imposed by the new 
collective bargaining agreement and nothing near the megamillions 
he would have gotten under the old labor deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Suns owner Jerry Colangelo helped negotiate the new  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like taking one for the Gipper, because for the league  
it's a great deal in terms of adding stability to the NBA,'' 
Colangelo said. ``Did we suffer? Absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets got three first-round draft picks as part of the  
three-team trade that sent McDyess to Phoenix. The Nuggets had no 
comment on McDyess' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, who sent Wesley Person and Tony Dumas to Cleveland and  
gave Denver two first-round picks and two second-round picks in the 
McDyess trade, were left scrambling in hopes they could help fill 
the void by luring Tom Gugliotta. Phoenix also is considering Vlade 
Divac and Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be specific about any names, but we expect  
to have some people on the horn, possibly in town, over the next 
day or two,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Phoenix would have given McDyess a seven-year, $86.5  
million contract, Denver could offer a maximum of $67 million over 
six years. However, he will get an opt-out clause that would allow 
him to sign a bigger deal after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio has a chance to be the main guy there,'' Bryant said.  
``And as you know, he played about 24 minutes per game in Phoenix 
last year and will play more than 40 a game in Denver. This is a 
player they will build a franchise around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, McDyess averaged 30 minutes per game, and Suns coach  
Danny Ainge said McDyess never complained about playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``All he ever said to me was `I wish I was playing better,''  
Ainge said. ``We never had any inkling he was dissatisfied with his 
role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said he spoke with McDyess at length Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had a very in-depth conversation with him and was told by  
him that he would get back to me,'' Colangelo said. ``That did not 
happen. I'm personally disappointed that it turned out the way it 
did. He's a good young man. I think he's a guy of high character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo has said he and McDyess' agent at the time, Arn  
Tellem, were in agreement that the young forward would get a big 
contract when his existing deal expired at the end of the 1997-98 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of you who know me would understand we wouldn't go into  
that blindly,'' Colangelo said. ``We had some kind of understanding 
that he was interested in coming and there would not be a problem 
in him remaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA lockout ruined that plan, and the new rules limit how  
much the Suns could give. Meanwhile, McDyess fired Tellem and 
replaced him with Bryant and Tony Dutt. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess was considering Denver because he likes Dan Issel, the  
former Nuggets coach hired as general manager last March, and his 
entourage is made up of people from that city. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess also has become good friends with Denver guard Nick Van  
Exel, who also is represented by Dutt and has been at McDyess' 
Houston home in recent days trying to persuade him to sign with the 
Nuggets. John Lucas, who has been hired as a Nuggets' assistant 
coach, worked with McDyess in Houston last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, 24, was the No. 2 pick in the 1995 draft. After a slow  
start, he averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds in 81 games for the 
Suns last season, and was especially strong down the stretch, 
scoring a career-high 37 against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, who have just five players under contract and plan to  
trade three of them to Chicago for Luc Longley, aren't planning to 
open training camp until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Suns officials were careful not to make any tampering  
accusations, they obviously felt McDyess was unduly influenced by 
those around him.

<HEADLINE> Paula Zahn Leaving CBS for Fox News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paula Zahn is leaving CBS News to anchor a  
one-hour nightly newscast on Fox News Channel, beginning March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahn, 42, has most recently anchored the ``CBS Evening News''  
Saturday edition and filled in for Dan Rather during the week. She 
was co-host of ``CBS This Morning'' for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fox Report,'' the network's evening newscast, was anchored  
by Catherine Crier and Jon Scott until they left to host a 
newsmagazine for the Fox network. Zahn will take over, and she also 
will anchor another hour of Fox News Channel programming on 
weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahn was underutilized at CBS and attracted by the prospect of  
being involved in breaking news, said Roger Ailes, chairman and 
chief executive of Fox News. She also has young children and wanted 
to get off weekend work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahn worked for local news broadcasts in Chicago, Houston,  
Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego and Boston before joining ABC News 
in 1987. She jumped to CBS in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Meat Inspectors Find Safety Lapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new food inspection program implemented last  
year was supposed to bring additional safety checks to the nation's 
meat supply. But a group of federal inspectors says loose 
regulations are putting American consumers at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, the union  
representing inspectors, said Wednesday that the government's new 
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point program too often lets the 
meat industry regulate itself and forces inspectors to sit on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers ought to be outraged,'' said Bobby Harnage, national  
president of the American Federation of Government Employees, 
AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Riley, spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, said  
laws still allow inspectors to take action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel like there's lots of inspector presence and lots  
of involvement and enforcement going on in our plants,'' Riley 
said. ``There is no incentive for us to do anything but make the 
safest meat possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection  
Service, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inspectors have the same authority under HACCP as under past  
inspection methods,'' Gaston said. But she said the agency was 
taking the allegations seriously. ``Our policy is very clear. 
Unsafe or unwholesome meat or poultry should not be passed and 
should not receive the marks of inspection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency began implementing its new program in the country's  
300 largest processing plants last year. On Monday, nearly 3,000 
smaller plants are scheduled to begin the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency says the program, which involves checking meat  
throughout the food production system for such things as fecal 
contamination and proper temperature, has been successful in its 
first year. Before the program was implemented, plant workers only 
poked at carcasses to search visually for signs of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said that early figures show the HACCP  
program is making headway. They say that during the first six 
months after the law took effect, the incidence of salmonella in 
chickens dropped by almost half to 10.4 percent. Salmonella 
prevalence in swine carcasses dropped from 8.7 percent to 5.5 
percent, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	But inspectors alleged Wednesday that some plants do not have  
enough checkpoints to ensure safe meat. They also allege that the 
government is not allowing them to enforce the law and pull problem 
meat from the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors said they fear the government eventually will  
phase out their role, opting instead for a system where monitors 
make infrequent visits to check on plants. They hope to persuade 
Congress to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Sewell, an inspector from Camilla, Ga., said during  
inspections at a poultry plant in Georgia, she found evidence of 
diesel fuel from processing equipment on meat as well as shards of 
metal. She said when she tried to pull the problem meat, her 
supervisors told her to let the company handle it.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Reports Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Food maker Sara Lee Corp. reported Thursday that  
its second-quarter profits after charges rose despite weaker sales 
in its processed meats and coffee divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Dec. 26, net income was $322 million,  
or 34 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $1.3 billion, or 
$1.36 a share, the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Both periods included charges. The current quarter included a  
charge of $50 million, or 5 cents a share, to recall hot dogs and 
other meat produced at its Bil Mar Foods plant in Michigan after 
reports they might be contaminated with listeria, a type of 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, Sara Lee took a $1.6 billion charge, or  
$1.69 a share, to restructure and write down assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those charges, net income rose to $371 million, or 39  
cents a share, from $346 million, or 34 cents a share, the year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. The company's stock fell 
$1.06 1/4 a share to $24.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue inched higher, to $5.29 billion from $5.28 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based maker of Coach leather goods, Jimmy Dean  
sausages and Hanes underwear reported strong gains in its intimate 
apparel, household and body care businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in its coffee and tea division fell 4.4 percent, while  
sales in the food division fell 1.3 percent, which the company 
blamed on lower commodity prices that were passed on to the 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee has been selling it manufacturing assets, allowing  
others to make its goods and marketing the brand names.

<HEADLINE> Reeves Still Hurt by Denver Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- So much for trying to forget the past.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Reeves, giving an extraordinary discourse on his rise and  
fall in Denver, made it clear Wednesday that his wounds haven't 
healed completely -- more than six years after he was fired by the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, the NFL's coach of the year with the Atlanta Falcons,  
faces his former team in the Jan. 31 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with inevitable questions about his falling out with Mike  
Shanahan and John Elway, Reeves transformed a news conference into 
a personal catharsis, exposing his heart and soul to a hushed room 
of reporters as he recounted the painful chain of events for almost 
a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Football is a team sport, but there's a riveting personal  
element to this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of hurt that won't ever go away,''  
admitted Reeves, who took the Broncos to three Super Bowls before 
he was fired after the 1992 season. ``You never forget those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' ouster in Denver followed his well-chronicled firing of  
Shanahan as quarterback coach for alleged insubordination. Shanahan 
was extremely close to Elway, the quarterback who would say later 
that playing for Reeves was ``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the firing of Shanahan, Reeves lasted only one more season  
in Denver. He was dismissed by owner Pat Bowlen despite a 110-73-1 
record and five AFC West titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan returned in 1995 as Denver's coach with Elway's  
enthusiastic blessing. Last year, they teamed up to capture the 
Super Bowl victory that has eluded Reeves during his head coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that I will ever get over the full situation,''  
Reeves said. ``That changed a lot of people's lives. I don't know 
that Mike will ever get over that, what it caused his wife and 
children. Same thing with me. It caused a lot of pain for my wife 
and children. It's something that won't ever go away. 
</P>
<P>
	``But am I a person that's not going to speak to Pat Bowlen or  
Mike Shanahan or John Elway? I don't live my life like that. I had 
a lot of great times with those guys. I can be cordial to them. I 
can play golf with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves added, ``I won't go out to eat with them or go socially  
to a function with them. But if I was sitting next to them at a 
function, I would have no problem carrying on a conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He painstakingly recounted his version of events, beginning with  
his hiring of Shanahan in 1984 as Denver's receivers coach. A year 
later, he promoted Shanahan to offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really and truly, I couldn't have been closer to someone than  
I was to him,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	He recommended Shanahan as coach of the Raiders in 1988, then  
hired him back as quarterback coach when Shanahan was fired by Al 
Davis four games into the '89 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relationship began to deteriorate when Elway was  
critical of Reeves in a 1990 newspaper column, saying there was 
poor communication between coach and quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``If John Elway had a problem with me and you're coaching a  
position (such as Shanahan), why did I not know about that prior to 
reading it in the paper?'' Reeves said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also believes Shanahan revealed things to the quarterback  
that were discussed in private meetings among the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say things in a coaches meeting as far as critiquing a  
player that you would never say to a player,'' Reeves said. ``If 
John ever got any bad feelings about something I said, it was never 
done publicly. It had to be something coming from a staff meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, does that mean Mike did it? You have a lot of people on  
your staff. I have no proof of it. Nothing. But I did what I felt 
was best for our football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, in comments in the Denver Post, said he was surprised  
Reeves brought up the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he's going into past scenarios,'' Shanahan  
said. ``If he wants to bring up dirty laundry, there's nothing I 
can do about it. I thought we both were going to take the high road 
going into this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1990 Post column, Elway said that he and Reeves had quit  
communicating and that their relationship was ``the worst.'' Reeves 
was so angered by the column that he went to Shanahan's office and 
threw the newspaper at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said Wednesday, when asked about the situation: ``How  
am I supposed to know how John felt about Dan? I thought I did a 
great job of keeping that relationship intact for seven years. He 
came to me and was very upset about it. I said, `What are you 
talking to me for? John said it. Go talk to John.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down to the weight room and got John and brought him up  
to Dan's office. I said, `John, you tell Dan why you don't like 
him, and Dan, you tell John why you don't like him. I'm tired of 
being in the middle of this stuff.'' So they both did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan denied telling Elway about any private conversations  
during coaches' meetings and also said he didn't script plays 
behind Reeves' back, which prompted Reeves to use the word 
``insubordination'' after Shanahan's firing in January 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan on Wednesday, when told of Reeves' admission that he  
couldn't prove any of his allegations, said, ``For a guy who 
doesn't have proof of something, he sure didn't help my reputation. 
To not have any proof, but to say somebody is insubordinate, that's 
one of the reasons why I've had such a tough time with this. That's 
a strong word not to have any proof. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole scripting thing is totally ludicrous. Dan never  
said one word to me about any of this. I didn't hear one word about 
it until I left. If he thought this was happening, whey didn't he 
say anything to me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said the bottom line was that ``Dan wanted to run the  
offense, and he wanted complete control. He really didn't want 
somebody with my type of personality around.''

	Ex-Arkansas Senator Defends Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Sen. Dale Bumpers urged senators today  
to resist a House effort to remove President Clinton from office. 
In closing remarks in the president's opening defense argument, 
Bumpers denounced Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky 
controversy as ``a breach of his marriage vows'' and a ``terrible 
moral lapse'' -- but not a crime that was impeachable. He argued 
that the Founding Fathers had put impeachment in the Constitution 
``to protect the public, not punish the president.'' Bumpers also 
chided House prosecutors for a lack of compassion as he told of the 
human toll the president's mistake had on Clinton's family.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government announced it  
was ``freezing'' the expulsion order against the American head of 
the peace monitors in Kosovo -- backing down after the envoy 
declared he would ignore the order to leave. The government said 
the expulsion order against William Walker would remain ``frozen'' 
until ``the consequences of his behavior are fully clarified.'' 
Walker had been ordered to leave Yugoslavia by 5 p.m. today after 
he accused Serb police of massacring 45 ethnic Albanians last week.

	Raul Salinas Found Guilty of Murder  
</P>
<P>
	TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) -- A judge convicted the elder brother of  
Mexico's former president of ordering the murder of a top 
politician and sentenced him to 50 years in prison today. Raul 
Salinas de Gortari, brother of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was 
convicted and sentenced for the 1994 murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu, a leader of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
and his former brother-in-law. Prosecutors have suggested that 
Salinas saw Ruiz Massieu as a threat to the Salinas family's 
political power.

personnel to become teachers. In addition to initiatives designed 
to reduce class sizes and improve the quality of teaching, Clinton 
presented increased support for the Troops to Teachers program as a 
key element of his plan to direct qualified instructors to 
impoverished rural and inner-city communities. Clinton said those 
who have completed their military careers ``understand how to 
manage people and resources, and limited resources, to do a job of 
limitless importance.''

	Tobacco Cos. OK Farmers Trust Fund

	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's four largest cigarette  
companies agreed today to establish a $5.15 billion trust fund to 
help tobacco farmers who face a shrinking market because of the 
industry's settlement with states. Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co., Lorillard and Brown &AMP; Williamson will finance the fund 
over 12 years, industry lawyer Phil Carlton said. The tobacco 
companies' payments into the trust fund will depend on their market 
share.

	Study: Unplanned Pregnancies Common  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than a fifth of all pregnancies around the  
world end in abortion and unplanned pregnancy remains common, 
according to a report released today. Thirty-eight percent of the 
estimated 210 million pregnancies that occur each year are 
unintentional and 22 percent of all pregnancies end in abortion, 
said a study by The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research 
organization that receives some funding from Planned Parenthood. 
The rates are similar in the developed and developing countries. 
Researchers attributed the high rates of unplanned pregnancy and 
abortion to inadequate availability and use of contraception.

	Ex-Arkansas Senator Defends Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Sen. Dale Bumpers urged senators today  
to resist a House effort to remove President Clinton from office. 
In closing remarks in the president's opening defense argument, 
Bumpers denounced Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky 
controversy as ``a breach of his marriage vows'' and a ``terrible 
moral lapse'' -- but not a crime that was impeachable. He argued 
that the Founding Fathers had put impeachment in the Constitution 
``to protect the public, not punish the president.'' Bumpers also 
chided House prosecutors for a lack of compassion as he told of the 
human toll the president's mistake had on Clinton's family.

	Senate Prepares To Ask Questions

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate opens a 16-hour question-and-answer  
period tomorrow in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
Dozens of questions have been received by the leaders of both 
parties, who are culling them to avoid repetition. They range from 
factual questions on the differences between testimony to 
constitutional queries, officials said.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government froze an  
expulsion order against the American head of the peace monitors in 
Kosovo on Friday. The government said William Walker could remain 
until ``the consequences of his behavior are fully clarified.'' 
Walker had defied the order, announcing that he would not leave. 
The reversal came hours after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
warned that the entire 750-person monitoring team would be pulled 
out of Kosovo unless President Slobodan Milosevic allowed Walker to 
remain.

<HEADLINE> Daly Takes Himself Off Medication  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- John Daly, whose personal life and golf  
career have taken many careening turns, is trying a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly has taken himself off antidepressant medication that he  
believes has affected his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain times in my life, I think I needed it, but right now I  
just think antidepressants have made me very lazy, taken a lot of 
energy out of me. Everyone says, `Well, that's just part of it,''' 
Daly said Thursday after he shot his best round in nearly a year, a 
6-under-par 66, to move within two strokes of leader Fred Funk in 
the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who has fully tapped his considerable golf talent for only  
scattered moments in his career, has had problems with alcohol 
abuse and with mood swings in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he quit taking antidepressants about three weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel like I've got a lot more energy and working out  
has helped an awful lot,'' Daly said. ``So I am going to see what 
happens. It could be a bad move on my part, but it also could make 
a world of difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It apparently made a difference last time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I took myself off medication three weeks before the British  
Open in 1995,'' said Daly, whose last win came in that tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor here told me I needed to be back on it, and I've  
never really done anything since then. I had a pretty good West 
Coast last year, but when you're playing golf and you don't have 
energy because of something you take ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got tired of it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Daly's play through two rounds of the five-day Hope tournament  
indicate his game is sharp. Although he's one of the tour's biggest 
hitters and doesn't necessarily fare well on narrow courses like 
the ones used for the Hope, he was very consistent during the 
second round despite gusting winds that made play difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played very well,'' he said. ``I only missed one green, and  
for me to do that when the wind is blowing that hard on pretty much 
a tight golf course, that gives me confidence to say, `Hey, I can 
play some tight golf courses every now and then,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when winds of up to 45 mph delayed the start of the  
round by an hour and turned club selection into a guessing game, 
Funk also was steady as he shot a 68 to go to 11-under. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really blowing. There were holes that were really,  
really difficult because the wind was blowing the wrong way,'' Funk 
said. ``On No. 13, the par-3, we had a four-group backup because 
nobody knew what to hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was stuff all over the greens from the wind, so it was  
very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bo Van Pelt shot 70 and Tom Pernice, who shared the first-round  
lead, had a 72 to join Daly at 9-under. 
</P>
<P>
	John Huston and Ben Bates, who began the second day of the  
90-hole tournament tied with Pernice at the top, struggled, but 
remained in contention. Huston had a 73 that left him tied for 
fifth, and Bates had a 74 that dropped him into a tie for eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who had problems in the swirling winds was defending  
champion Fred Couples, who had a 75 to go to 3-over for the 
tournament. Jonathan Kaye, who had an opening 64 that was one shot 
off the lead, ballooned to a second-round 83. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jeff Sluman, last week's winner in Hawaii, shot his  
second 68 and was tied with Huston and Steve Pate, who had a 70, at 
8-under after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval shot a 71 and was 3-under, leaving him eight shots  
off the pace, but he has 54 holes left to try to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 *NOTES:* Daly's amateur partners were Michael Jordan, Charles  
Barkley and former NFL wide receiver Roy Green. Jordan, hitting off 
the men's tees in front of the pro's tees, hit a few drives almost 
as far as Daly. ```Mike was playing exceptionally well, Roy hit it 
OK, and we're trying to straighten Charles out with that breakdance 
move on his backswing,'' Daly said. ``I hadn't seen Mike hit in 
about five years, and the thing that impressed me was how well he 
is putting the ball.'' ... Daly has not had a bogey in either of 
his first two rounds, the only player in the field to accomplish 
that. He has nine birdies and 27 pars. .... Paul Azinger also had a 
66 to move from 104th place to a tie for 18th. ... Funk's 68 was 
his seventh score in the 60s in 10 rounds this year.

<HEADLINE> Activists Seek Snowmobile Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmentalists want the government to ban  
snowmobiles from national parks and consider new safety and 
pollution restrictions for them everywhere else, saying the 
increasingly popular machines are a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our national parks were not created in order to serve as  
national playgrounds, available for any and all uses,'' a coalition 
of groups known as the Bluewater Network says in a petition being 
filed today with the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of places outside the national parks where  
snowmobilers can ``pollute the air, disturb the flora and fauna, 
and disrupt peaceful contemplation'' of nature, the petition says. 
Snowmobiles are permitted in 28 park units, but the heaviest use is 
in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in Wyoming, and in 
Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the groups are asking the Environmental Protection  
Agency, Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration to consider new emission and 
safety standards for the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobiles use the same two-stroke engines as personal  
watercraft such as Jet Skis and many boats, making them one of the 
nation's largest sources of ``unchecked pollution,'' the groups say 
in a letter to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists recently lost a bid to ban Jet Skis from the  
park system. The park service decided last fall to allow their 
continued use at 25 recreation and seashore areas. The complaints 
about Jet Skis are similar to those for snowmobiles and all-terrain 
vehicles, which are permitted on some national seashores and 
recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of snowmobiles have doubled since 1992 to more than  
160,000 units a year, according to the International Snowmobile 
Manufacturers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Mausolf, a former president of the Minnesota United  
Snowmobilers Association, said snowmobiles unfairly are accused of 
being dangerous and polluting. ``More often than not the facts and 
figures are twisted. They paint the worst-case scenario whenever 
possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 120,000 snowmobiles go into Yellowstone each year, and the  
air around the park's west entrance, where they congregate, is 
sometimes thick with their blue smoke. At Old Faithful geyser 
alone, snowmobiles create more pollution in one weekend than a 
year's worth of automobile traffic, the petition claims. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to working with manufacturers on developing cleaner  
burning models, park officials are considering new regulations on 
their use, including reduced use in some areas, said park 
spokeswoman Cheryl Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups making up the Bluewater Network include the Natural  
Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, American Lands and 
numerous regional organizations.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes in Arkansas Kill Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tornadoes and funnel clouds tore across  
Arkansas on Thursday, collapsing the front of a downtown grocery 
store and knocking over trees at the governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four people were killed -- including a baby in the small  
town of Beebe northeast of Little Rock. More than a dozen were 
injured statewide and tens of thousands were without power. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were hurt at the Harvest Foods store that was  
imploded in a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lights flickered a couple times, then it went black,''  
said Derrick Stallworth, who was on the soda pop and bottled water 
aisle when the storm hit. ``I decided to hit the floor, then I saw 
the roof coming down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he freed some of the 10 to 20 shoppers who were in the  
storm when the tornado hit. Firefighters searched for those he 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The store pharmacist was among the injured. Witnesses who were  
outside the store said it was hit by a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real one, in the sky and coming down. Black and  
white. So many different colors,'' said Michelle Johnson, who 
watched the storm roll in. 
</P>
<P>
	Trees were damaged at the Arkansas Governor's Mansion just south  
of downtown but the house was spared and Gov. Mike Huckabee and his 
family were not hurt, said Huckabee's spokesman Jim Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornado warnings were issued for more than half of the state's  
75 counties in an outbreak that forecasters had been talking about 
since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Searcy Schools Superintendent Tony Wood said a member of the  
school board was killed in the tornado at Center Hill, 45 miles 
northeast of Little Rock, when a twister struck the victim's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person was killed in a building at North Little Rock and  
a woman was killed when a tree fell on her car in the neighborhood 
south of the Harvest Foods, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries were reported from many of the 38 counties for where  
warnings were posted. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the storms followed the same path as a March 1, 1997,  
outbreak that killed 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail the size of grapefruits was reported at Sardis, south of  
Little Rock, and the size of baseballs at Maumelle, northwest of 
Little Rock. Smaller hail was reported in Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60,000 people were without power between Little Rock and  
the Missouri state line, Entergy Arkansas spokesman Dan Daugherty 
said.

<HEADLINE> Suns Close to Gugliotta Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Antonio McDyess' last-minute reluctance to sign  
with the Denver Nuggets left the Phoenix Suns in a curious 
situation late Thursday night, just as Tom Gugliotta was about to 
arrive in town to work out the details of a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, a source close to the situation said  
Gugliotta was close to an agreement with the Suns, even though he 
could much more money if he re-signed with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing was final, but a source said ``there is a substantial  
chance'' that Gugliotta would sign with Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	But that comment came before word spread that McDyess, who had  
announced on Wednesday night that he was going to sign with Denver 
instead of re-signing with Phoenix, apparently was having second 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns said Thursday afternoon that they had renounced 10 free  
agents, including McDyess, to create some of the salary cap room 
that would be needed to sign Gugliotta. But later, they said that 
McDyess' name was included erroneously and that he had not been 
renounced. 
</P>
<P>
	That raised speculation that he still was considering re-signing  
with Phoenix. McDyess showed up at McNichols Arena in Denver, where 
a news conference was planned to announce the signing, but the 
announcement was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiatons continued in the Nuggets' locker room, and  
eventually all parties retreated to a luxury box to watch the 
Colorado-Calgary hockey game with no contract signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns owner Jerry Colangelo declined to say whether his team  
still would consider re-signing McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really can't make any comment about what's going on, but  
it's interesting to say the least,'' Colangelo said. ``We'll just 
have to see what transpires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns scheduled their first workout for Friday morning,  
although it was uncertain how many players would be there. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix has five players under contract, but three of them are  
set to go to Chicago in a sign-and-trade deal that would bring Luc 
Longley to the Suns. Longley was in Phoenix this week and one of 
the three players to be traded to Chicago, Mark Bryant, was at the 
Bulls' workout on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells also are to go to Chicago in  
that trade, which is expected to be completed on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns general manager Bryan Colangelo said Wednesday night that  
the team would be able to clear a maximum of about $8 million to 
offer a free agent. That's short of the $9 million maximum allowed 
under the new collective bargaining agreement, but the figures were 
close enough that it wouldn't be a problem, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year contract worth about $60 million would contain a  
clause allowing Gugliotta out of the deal after five years, when he 
would be eligible for a much bigger raise as a 10-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta averaged 20.1 points per game for the Timberwolves  
last season but missed 41 games after undergoing foot surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have made $86 million over seven years by re-signing  
with Minnesota but has indicated all along that the money would not 
prevent him from signing with a team that he felt was the right fit 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Colangelo identified the 6-foot-10 forward as one of the  
``big three'' free agents up for grabs this season. The others were 
Scottie Pippen, expected to be signed by Chicago and traded to 
Houston, and McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, 29, played four seasons in Minnesota after two  
seasons with the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns did not renounce Clifford Robinson or Rex Chapman.  
Robinson's agent Brad Marshall told Phoenix radio station KATR 
Thursday afternoon that Robinson had reached a five-year, $30 
million contract agreement, but wouldn't confirm that when the 
McDyess situation developed later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman's agent David Falk, who represents nine other free  
agents, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns renounced the rights to Kevin Johnson, George McCloud,  
Mike Brown, Horacio Llamas, Loren Meyer, Marko Milic, Dennis Scott, 
Wayman Tisdale and Hot Rod Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is gone for sure and Tisdale is retired from the NBA but  
still has money charged to Phoenix's salary cap. The NBA has 
eliminated the 56-day waiting period to re-sign renounced free 
agents, meaning the Suns might be able to able to re-sign some of 
its renounced players later.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Resign Stoudamire for $81M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For the first time, Damon Stoudamire  
walked into a Trail Blazers practice knowing the team was truly his 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire agreed Wednesday night to re-sign with the Blazers  
for $81 million over seven years, making him the highest-paid point 
guard in the NBA. Stoudamire's deal surpassed that of Seattle's 
Gary Payton, who has a seven-year, $79.9 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I ever truly thought about leaving,'' said  
Stoudamire, who was born in Portland and returned last February as 
part of a six-player trade with the Toronto Raptors. ``I feel like 
the city has embraced me. I want to do everything to give back to 
the community, not only off the court, but to help this team get 
back to where it should be on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's other top free agent, center Arvydas Sabonis, has  
reportedly agreed to a two-year contract worth between $10 million 
and $12 million. He opted out of his five-year contract after last 
season and became a free agent, giving up a guaranteed $7.5 million 
over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers didn't give the 34-year-old Lithuanian the  
longer-term deal he wanted, but he'll get a substantial raise over 
his $3 million salary last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got paid. Now it's time for them to get busy,'' guard  
Isaiah Rider said during a morning shootaround. 
</P>
<P>
	That Rider, who has had a stormy relationship with team  
executives and fans, smiled and joked with reporters showed the 
optimism on the Blazers, who think they can finally break through 
into the second round of the playoffs after six straight years of 
first-round exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have what it takes,'' forward Rasheed Wallace said.  
``We've got a good point guard, a good two guard (Rider). 
Everywhere down the line you've got to respect us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make the playoffs, whether we play mediocre or  
not. We just have that much talent,'' Rider said. ``The thing is to 
play well when we get in the playoffs and beat somebody, not just 
be satisfied with being there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire, in his fourth season after being rookie of the year  
with Toronto in 1995, averaged 17.3 points and 8.2 assists last 
season, but only 12.4 points in 22 games with the Blazers. The team 
was often lethargic on offense, a weakness that reached its height 
with a 65-point loss to the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said Stoudamire's teammates may not  
have put their full trust in him on the court, knowing he could 
leave the team after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Dunleavy said, ``He just has more credibility with the  
fellows. He's going to be running the show, and that's great for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire and his agent, Aaron Goodwin, were after a seven-year  
deal worth $86.2 million, the maximum allowed under the new NBA 
labor agreement. But Stoudamire signed for less after finding there 
were no teams that could have come close to that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Portland came in with definitely a substantial offer,  
something that I don't think anybody could pass up,'' Stoudamire 
said. ``For me to say I didn't try to get more money, I'd probably 
be lying. But in the end, I think we got something done that worked 
out for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every point guard that thinks they're good thinks they deserve  
the most. I'm just happy that Portland was willing to give me 
that,'' he added. ``They didn't have to. I'm thankful for that, and 
I'm going to do everything I can to show why they thought I was 
worth that money.''

<HEADLINE> Fund To Help Tobacco Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's four largest cigarette  
companies agreed today to set up a $5.15 billion trust fund to help 
tobacco growers who face a shrinking market due to settlements of 
lawsuits that have sharply raised the price of smoking and stepped 
up anti-smoking initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement climaxed two days of private meetings between  
company officials and representatives from 11 tobacco states. For a 
time, it appeared the trust fund was in jeopardy because R.J. 
Reynolds balked at participating. The company said a better way to 
help the farmers would be to buy more of their tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	But during negotiations today, R.J. Reynolds relented and signed  
onto the trust fund, which was restructured. Previously, the four 
companies -- R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Brown &AMP; Williamson and 
Lorillard -- would have paid into the fund over 10 years; the 
agreement extends that to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many, many details yet to be worked out,'' said Phil  
Carlton, the lawyer representing the tobacco companies. ``One of 
the concerns was one of the companies in particular had a problem 
with paying the money out that would have been its share in the 
first couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco farmers have been worried about their future as the  
drive against smoking intensified. 
</P>
<P>
	Costly settlements of state claims against tobacco companies  
seeking reimbursement for the cost of treating sick smokers have 
sharply raised the price of cigarettes and that is expected to 
reduce demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund initially was proposed by Philip Morris after the  
major cigarette makers agreed to a $206 billion settlement with 46 
states over health care costs last November. Part of that agreement 
required the companies to meet with state officials to discuss the 
trust fund for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris announced last week it would deposit $300 million  
into the fund this year, even if other companies chose not to 
participate. But the No. 1 tobacco company said its future 
participation hinged on the other companies joining the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	During the fund's first year, the companies would put in $380  
million, with Philip Morris' $300 million contribution making up 
the bulk of the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The second year, the companies would deposit $280 million; the  
third year, $400 million; years four-10, $500 million a year; the 
11th year, $440 million; and the 12th year, $150 million, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said each state will receive a  
share of the fund equal to the amount of tobacco it grows. 
</P>
<P>
	States participating in the discussions are North Carolina,  
Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, 
Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said the directors of the trust will determine the amount  
of the payments and when they are disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all leave here today winners with a positive outlook for a  
measure of financial assistance for our tobacco farmers,'' Hunt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During discussions Wednesday, R.J. Reynolds' senior vice  
president, Tommy Payne, said his company had concerns about how the 
trust fund money would be spent and whether it might raise 
antitrust issues. He said Reynolds' plan to buy more tobacco would 
not pose such problems because antitrust laws ``do not preclude 
companies from coming to independent decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, dismissed Reynolds' concerns and questioned  
whether they were the real reason for the company's reluctance to 
sign onto the fund.

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Three men in the Australian Open  
field were playing in their 33rd consecutive Grand Slam tournament, 
the second-longest streak in the three-decade-old Open Era. But 
they have a long way to go to beat the longest. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan Edberg played in 54 straight Grand Slam tournaments  
before retiring in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching 33 here were Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, Guillaume  
Raoux of France and Australian Mark Woodforde, who is best known as 
a doubles player. Paul Haarhuis, a 32-year-old Dutch player, played 
in 33 straight before skipping the 1998 Australian Open for the 
birth of his son. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANDRE AGHAST:* Andre Agassi says he's worried about the  
popularity of big-time tennis in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pat Rafter's triumphs at the past two U.S. Opens have  
boosted the sport in Australia, the United States is still years 
away from accepting tennis as a major sport, Agassi says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a lot of interest down here with Pat's success at the  
U.S. Open. I love the enthusiasm and tennis is a great game,'' 
Agassi said. ``I wish that for our country, but I think we've got a 
decade or so before we see any real success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi knows what it will take to lift the sport stateside.  
</P>
<P>
	``It takes players, it takes winning, it takes personalities, it  
takes marketing,'' Agassi said. ``We are a pretty long way from 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DRESS UP:* Monica Seles, who has more reason than most to fear  
random loonies, says she has to dress up in disguise when she goes 
out in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, whose career was interrupted for more than two years when  
she was stabbed at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany, in 1993, finds 
the public attention a little hard to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really nice, but there are some people who are  
really forward,'' Seles says. ``I'm not the sort of person that can 
just kind of brush them off and sometimes they ask really strange 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go out alone. I tried that once. Boy, oh, boy -- wrong  
idea. That was a really quick turnaround, that's for sure, back to 
the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Seles tries to hide her identity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I put on a hat or glasses,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The very striking Venus Williams couldn't sneak around even if  
she wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	``People know who we are, especially because we're wearing  
beads,'' she said. She waves back and will say hi to fans on the 
street, but not if they're driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is honking their horn. I don't respond to honks,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FOR PETE'S SAKE:* The Williams sisters want to be like Pete.  
Venus Williams says the hard-hitting teen-agers have no time for 
boys outside of tennis, but without hesitation she nominates Pete 
Sampras as their favorite man on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We absolutely love the way he plays,'' she said. Actually,  
they admire him so much they are thinking of changing their names, 
Venus Williams joked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope one day to be Pete also. We might change our name to  
Pete. It's a great name, it really is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she ruled out any chance of a mixed doubles matchup, saying  
she was happy to continue playing with Justin Gimelstob, with whom 
she won the French and Australian Opens last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather just watch him (Sampras),'' Williams said. ``Maybe  
I'll get a lesson.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 33.21 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks were regaining their footing in  
late morning. Broader market indexes were lower but trimming their 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 33.21 at 9,369.12. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 19.31 to close 
at 9,480.09. 
</P>
<P>
	But broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite  
was down a sharp 30.93 at 2,384.56, after climbing to a record high 
of 2,415.49 on Wednesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 6 
points at 1,250.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq stocks were lower as high-flying Internet stocks gave  
back some of their recent gains. Amazon.com was down 7 3/8 at 105 5/8 in 
leading Nasdaq volume. On the Big Board, America Online was down 3 7/8 
t 144 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 316.83 million 
shares, off slightly from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 30 Dow components, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing  
shares were up 3 1/8 at 73, Merck was up 2 7/8 at 151 3/4, Alcoa was up 1 3/8 
at 85 1/4, and AT&AMP;T was down 1 5/16 at 90 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. market was bothered by a steep drop on the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange, where the Bovespa index was down 222 points despite 
congressional approval of an important austerity measure hours 
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Decry Bush, Moderates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Presidential hopefuls courted  
conservative activists Thursday by attacking the early GOP 
front-runner, George W. Bush, and ``mushy moderates'' in the 
establishment wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no  
substitute for a muscular, substantive agenda,'' millionaire 
businessman Steve Forbes told the Conservative Political Action 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he did not mention Bush by name, Forbes clearly was  
referring to the Texas governor and his ``compassionate 
conservative'' ideology. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadening his attack, Forbes reminded the crowd of influential  
conservative activists that Bush's father, former President Bush, 
and Elizabeth Dole's husband, former Senator Bob Dole, lost the 
last two presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mrs. Dole and Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle,  
considering presidential bids of their own, Forbes said the 
fledgling 2000 field includes names that ``sound familiar. But, my 
friends, we have been down that electoral cul-de-sac twice before. 
I suggest we try something new for a change -- like winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was soon joined by other GOP hopefuls, including former  
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and activist Gary Bauer, in drawing 
the battle lines between the party's conservative and establishment 
wings. The strategy is most important to Forbes and Alexander, 
neither of whom is well rooted in social conservative circles. 
</P>
<P>
	The sniping, coming a year before the first primary votes will  
be cast, was part of a busy day in GOP politics. Among the other 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
	--Quayle said Thursday night he will file a formal statement of  
candidacy next week, the first step in his bid for the presidency. 
``I've thought about this for a long time. I've wanted to be 
president for a long time, and the year 2000 is looking like my 
opportunity,'' he said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' ``When you say 
compassionate conservatism, you are basically attacking 
conservatism because you are saying conservatives aren't 
compassionate,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Republican National Committee, opened its three-day winter  
meeting in Washington. The highlight will be the vote Friday to 
determine whether to oust Chairman Jim Nicholson for the party's 
poor showing in 1998 elections. Supporters of Florida party 
Chairman Tom Slade, the only challenger, gained some momentum 
Thursday but needs several Nicholson backers to switch their 
allegiance in secret balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	--A controversial resolution that would have forbidden the RNC  
from taking money from the gambling industry was rejected by an RNC 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who received three standing ovations  
at CPAC, warned against playing politics with religion. ``If we are 
going to try to use God as a wedge issue, I think it's wrong and 
it's dumb,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said he doesn't believe  
New York Gov. George Pataki has any plans to enter the presidential 
primaries, but, D'Amato told an Albany radio station, ``if the 
leaders stumble along the way, he could then move to run for 
president or certainly be selected as the vice presidential 
nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki announced Wednesday he has formed a political action  
committee to finance his stepped-up travel across the country for a 
series of speeches and to make donations to other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Dole did not attend CPAC, but the governor's office  
quickly responded to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is somewhat perplexing that fellow Republicans would attack  
a popular conservative governor of a very conservative state whose 
overwhelming re-election proved a conservative philosophy can erase 
the gender gap and attract a record number of minority voters while 
remaining true to conservative principles,'' said Bush spokeswoman 
Karen Hughes in a telephone interview from Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, Bauer and Forbes compared Bush's ``compassionate  
conservative'' slogan to his father's promise to be a ``kinder and 
gentler'' Republican. They want the conservative activists, many of 
whom are still angry at President Bush for raising taxes, to punish 
the son for the father's missteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not long after we qualified our language, we were qualifying  
our principles,'' Alexander said, referring to the elder Bush. ``We 
accepted a tax increase ... and soon found ourselves vacating the 
White House for the first time in 12 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer didn't criticize Bush in his speech, but told reporters  
that conservatives ``need to know that the last Bush talked about 
kinder and gentler, and that resulted in an election loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' rhetoric was the toughest.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the siren song of these  
mushy moderates, make no mistake: They will take us down to defeat 
once again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes confirmed later that he had Bush and his ``compassionate  
conservative'' slogan in mind when he gave the speech. ``The phrase 
itself is fine. The key is whether it will be followed by 
substantive issues the public wants,'' he said. ``They've had 
enough sizzle. They want steak.''

<HEADLINE>  NBA Officially Reopens for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA officially reopened for business today,  
and it was certain to be the busiest day in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	A legion of lawyers were at the ready in the league's  
headquarters today, and they began clearing deals at 2 p.m. Dozens, 
if not hundreds, of trades and free agent signings were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be fun,'' NBA chief legal counsel Jeffrey  
Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Practically all of the league's 29 teams were ready to make  
trades, sign nearly 200 free agents and open training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``will be the craziest day in the history of the league,''  
agent Keith Glass said, ``and I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one.  
</P>
<P>
	After 204 days, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and  
countless fits, starts, fights and snags, the NBA lockout finally 
came to an official end Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six and a half months of pent-up business was to begin being  
conducted today, with the floodgates opening on what should be well 
over 100 transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The first reported transactions involved the Phoenix Suns  
renouncing their rights to 10 of their 12 free agents -- Mike Brown, 
Kevin Johnson, Horacio Llamas, George McCloud, Antonio McDyess, 
Loren Meyer, Marko Milic, Dennis Scott, Wayman Tisdale and John 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	A league source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
Suns were close to an agreement with free agent Tom Gugliotta on a 
six-year deal. They needed to renounce almost all their unsigned 
players in order to clear enough cap space to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns retained their rights to free agents Rex Chapman and  
Cliff Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' commissioner David Stern said after he  
and union president Patrick Ewing signed the nearly 300-page 
collective bargaining agreement. ``It was an incredible relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with the biggest unanswered free agent question  
being the future of Gugliotta. After learning that he was close to 
a deal with Phoenix, the Timberwolves turned their attention to 
forward Joe Smith. KFAN radio in Minneapolis said the Wolves would 
sign Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns made a last-ditch effort to Gugliotta to the desert  
after their own prized free agent, McDyess, decided to take less 
money to play for the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix's moves put the Suns about $8 million under the salary  
cap. That would mean the Suns could not offer Gugliotta the maximum 
$9 million. The Timberwolves, by comparison, could have offered him 
the maximum with 12 1/2 percent raises -- a total of $86.2 million over 
seven years -- and then possibly trade him to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess decided Wednesday night to return to the Nuggets, the  
team he played for in his first two NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real close call,'' said McDyess' agent, James Bryant.  
``It came down to a question of do you want to inherit a contender 
or do you want to build one? Phoenix is a great franchise, but 
Denver is doing a lot of exciting things that haven't come out 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland was wondering whether the Washington Wizards  
would improve their offer of $30 million guaranteed for three 
years, with two additional non-guaranteed years. The Wizards issued 
a take-it or leave-it deadline of midnight Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's agent, David Falk, was trying to engineer a  
sign-and-trade deal, while also contemplating whether to advise 
Strickland to sign a one-year deal with another team and then 
re-enter the free-agent market next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman, meanwhile, said he will not retire.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK, so here's the deal,'' Rodman wrote in a message posted on  
his Web site. ``I've had some long discussions with the people I 
love, the ones whose opinions matter most to me, and I've decided 
not to retire after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he has would like to play in Chicago, Los Angeles, New  
York or overseas, Rodman also wrote: ``There's one thing I have 
always told my fans I would do in my last game that I still haven't 
done. I'm sure you know what it is, but I still have to come back 
for at least one more game so that I can get buck naked on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other players and their agents worked feverishly to finalize  
deals. Among the tentative agreements: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Christian Laettner heading to the Detroit Pistons in a  
sign-and-trade deal sending Charles O'Bannon and Scot Pollard to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Damon Stoudamire agreed to re-sign with Portland for $81  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dell Curry, the last of the original Hornets, was considering  
Portland or Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta and its free-agent forward, Alan Henderson, were far  
apart on money. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rick Fox agreed to take the $1.75 million exception from the  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Knicks reportedly reached agreements with their two free  
agents, Charlie Ward and Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Olden Polynice was deciding between the SuperSonics and  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Derek Harper was joining the Los Angeles Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Billy Owens was signing with Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jud Buechler was set to sign with Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Michael Stewart was close to signing with Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerome Kersey was headed to San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sam Perkins was ready to sign with Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric Murdock was joining New Jersey.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Rap impresario Master P, recently of the CBA's Fort Wayne  
Fury, was reportedly reporting to Hornets training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other unresolved questions was where Charlotte  
free-agent center Vlade Divac would sign. The Suns were interested 
if they lost both McDyess and Gugliotta, and the Sacramento Kings 
were weighing whether they should renounce the rights to free-agent 
Corliss Williamson in order to clear enough salary cap room to meet 
Divac's asking price. Several league sources insisted the 
SuperSonics were making a late push for Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	Other free agents, including Hot Rod Williams and Brent Barry,  
still were not sure where they would be signing. 
</P>
<P>

``We're ready to get back to work.''

first Sunday night at the United Center, with the Indiana Pacers

<HEADLINE> Marlins Set With Floyd in Left </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The worst team in baseball found a cornerstone for  
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins left fielder Cliff Floyd, scheduled for  
arbitration next month, instead signed a four-year, $19 million 
contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a chance to be one of the best players in the game,''  
general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ``There are not a lot of 
players who can hit the ball farther than Cliff. Plus he can run, 
and he's a great athlete. He'll be a very important part of our 
lineup for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was completed less than 48 hours after John Henry  
officially became the Marlins' owner, succeeding Wayne Huizenga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're in a position where we can show a total commitment  
and go forward,'' Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergence of Floyd, 26, was one of the few positive  
developments last season for a team that lost 108 games. He hit 
.282 and led the Marlins with 22 home runs, 90 RBIs and a 
team-record 45 doubles. He also stole 27 bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to fold now, just because I got what I want,''  
Floyd said. ``I'm going to do everything I can to live up to this 
deal. I hope I finish my career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd made $500,000 last year. He'll earn $2.5 million this  
season, $4.5 million in 2000, $5.5 million in 2001 and $6.5 million 
in 2002. He ranks second on the Marlins' payroll, behind only 
pitcher Alex Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was married in November, and he plans to relocate his  
offseason home from Chicago to South Florida. He pledged to remain 
active in charity, especially children's causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was considered a top prospect when he turned professional  
in 1991, but he has been plagued by injuries, spending three stints 
on the disabled list. Last year, however, he played in all but nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Superstar players stay healthy,'' Floyd said. ``They're out  
there every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd decided against signing a shorter contract and becoming a  
free agent in two years. His agent, Seth Levinson, estimated that 
Floyd could command $8 million a year as a free agent today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will end up being a huge bargain for the Marlins,''  
Levinson said. ``Cliff is driven by loyalty, and this organization 
gave him an opportunity to play every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was the only Florida player with arbitration pending, and  
Dombrowski said he was glad to avoid the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the way you build relationships with your players,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Charles Johnson remains the only Florida player to go  
through arbitration. He won a $3.3 million contract last year, then 
was traded three months later.

<HEADLINE> Ford Doesn't Like Brazil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. plans to restart a  
Brazilian assembly plant that workers had recently occupied, but 
the automaker's chief financial officer was doubtful about a 
turnaround in that nation's economy any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had announced the dismissal of 2,800 workers on Dec. 18,  
citing the severe drop in demand that has affected all automakers 
in Brazil. Many of the workers ignored their pink slips and showed 
up for work in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	John M. Devine, speaking at a news conference Thursday on Ford's  
earnings, said the company does not plan to take any extraordinary 
actions next month to reopen the plant if the dismissed workers 
return and again refuse to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a peaceful -- and I would stress peaceful -- sit-in  
in the plant in the last few weeks,'' Devine said. ``Our people are 
working it very carefully. Obviously, we don't want to get into a 
confrontation with our people. They've been very loyal, they've 
been supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to call out the National Guard.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ford workers last occupied the plant Jan. 15. They staged a  
peaceful three-hour rally at the plant Thursday to protest the 
dismissals. Hours later, Ford announced it was willing to negotiate 
the layoffs, apparently backing down from its previous 
no-negotiation stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine said Ford had little choice but to reduce its staff to  
deal with Brazil's financial turmoil. ``We feel badly about the 
situation, but it's a step we had to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devine predicted the recent devaluation of the Brazilian  
currency will have a further negative effect on the nation's 
economy through 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one we're watching very carefully,'' he said. ``I don't  
think we've found bottom in Brazil yet as an industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's South American automotive operations lost $70 million in  
the fourth quarter and $145 million for all of 1998. That compares 
with a $71 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1997 and a $40 
million profit in 1997, excluding one-time charges.

<HEADLINE> IBM Posts 12 Percent Rise in Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM reported a 12 percent rise in quarterly  
profits Thursday, crediting strong demand for its computer services 
and software products. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, which were slightly better than Wall Street  
predictions, came despite weakness from the economic slump in Asia 
and parts of Latin America and sagging computer-chip prices. The 
company also overcame a decline in revenue from computers, IBM's 
biggest business, which slipped in part due to price reductions on 
new mainframe machines and slower sales of other business 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said it earned $2.35 billion, or $2.47 a share, in the three  
months ended Dec. 31. That was up from a profit of $2.09 billion, 
or $2.11 a diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 6 percent to $25.13 billion from $23.72 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The report, for the fourth quarter, beat the $2.45 per share  
forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. The results were 
released after the close of financial markets. Ahead of the report, 
IBM shares gained $2.50 to $197 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM benefited from a sharp drop in the dollar against the  
Japanese yen during the period, which made IBM computer products 
cheaper to buy in Japan compared to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Gerstner, IBM's chief executive, said the results  
underscored the importance of the company's broad range of computer 
products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was hit by a 22 percent drop in revenues from its Latin  
America business and by a 3 percent drop in revenues from Asia. But 
revenues grew 8 percent in North America and 13 percent in Europe 
and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly important for IBM was a 20 percent revenue jump in  
its services business, a fast-growing operation that helps other 
companies set up and run their computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Software revenue grew 9.4 percent in the quarter. But hardware  
sales slipped 1.5 percent despite strong acceptance for IBM's new 
mainframe computer, introduced in last year's third quarter, which 
was priced lower than the product it replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM officials said the company has taken steps to reduce the  
impact of Brazil's sagging economy, where IBM gets 40 percent of 
its Latin America revenue. IBM has cut its staff there and combined 
its Latin America operation with the one in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last year, IBM earned $6.33 billion, or $6.57 a  
share. That was up from a profit of $6.09 billion, or $6.01 a 
diluted share, in 1997. Revenue grew to $81.67 billion from $78.51 
billion.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Officially Reopens for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA officially reopened for business today,  
and it was certain to be the busiest day in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	A legion of lawyers were at the ready in the league's  
headquarters today, and they began clearing deals at 2 p.m. Dozens, 
if not hundreds, of trades and free agent signings were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be fun,'' NBA chief legal counsel Jeffrey  
Mishkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Practically all of the league's 29 teams were ready to make  
trades, sign nearly 200 free agents and open training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``will be the craziest day in the history of the league,''  
agent Keith Glass said, ``and I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one.  
</P>
<P>
	After 204 days, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and  
countless fits, starts, fights and snags, the NBA lockout finally 
came to an official end Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six and a half months of pent-up business was to begin being  
conducted today, with the floodgates opening on what should be well 
over 100 transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The first reported transactions involved the Phoenix Suns  
renouncing their rights to 10 of their 12 free agents -- Mike Brown, 
Kevin Johnson, Horacio Llamas, George McCloud, Antonio McDyess, 
Loren Meyer, Marko Milic, Dennis Scott, Wayman Tisdale and John 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	A league source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
Suns were close to an agreement with free agent Tom Gugliotta on a 
six-year deal. They needed to renounce almost all their unsigned 
players in order to clear enough cap space to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns retained their rights to free agents Rex Chapman and  
Cliff Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' commissioner David Stern said after he  
and union president Patrick Ewing signed the nearly 300-page 
collective bargaining agreement. ``It was an incredible relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with the biggest unanswered free agent question  
being the future of Gugliotta. After learning that he was close to 
a deal with Phoenix, the Timberwolves turned their attention to 
forward Joe Smith. KFAN radio in Minneapolis said the Wolves would 
sign Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns made a last-ditch effort to Gugliotta to the desert  
after their own prized free agent, McDyess, decided to take less 
money to play for the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix's moves put the Suns about $8 million under the salary  
cap. That would mean the Suns could not offer Gugliotta the maximum 
$9 million. The Timberwolves, by comparison, could have offered him 
the maximum with 12 1/2 percent raises -- a total of $86.2 million over 
seven years -- and then possibly trade him to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess decided Wednesday night to return to the Nuggets, the  
team he played for in his first two NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real close call,'' said McDyess' agent, James Bryant.  
``It came down to a question of do you want to inherit a contender 
or do you want to build one? Phoenix is a great franchise, but 
Denver is doing a lot of exciting things that haven't come out 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland was wondering whether the Washington Wizards  
would improve their offer of $30 million guaranteed for three 
years, with two additional non-guaranteed years. The Wizards issued 
a take-it or leave-it deadline of midnight Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's agent, David Falk, was trying to engineer a  
sign-and-trade deal, while also contemplating whether to advise 
Strickland to sign a one-year deal with another team and then 
re-enter the free-agent market next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman, meanwhile, said he will not retire.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK, so here's the deal,'' Rodman wrote in a message posted on  
his Web site. ``I've had some long discussions with the people I 
love, the ones whose opinions matter most to me, and I've decided 
not to retire after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he has would like to play in Chicago, Los Angeles, New  
York or overseas, Rodman also wrote: ``There's one thing I have 
always told my fans I would do in my last game that I still haven't 
done. I'm sure you know what it is, but I still have to come back 
for at least one more game so that I can get buck naked on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other players and their agents worked feverishly to finalize  
deals. Among the tentative agreements: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Christian Laettner heading to the Detroit Pistons in a  
sign-and-trade deal sending Charles O'Bannon and Scot Pollard to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Damon Stoudamire agreed to re-sign with Portland for $81  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dell Curry, the last of the original Hornets, was considering  
Portland or Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta and its free-agent forward, Alan Henderson, were far  
apart on money. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rick Fox agreed to take the $1.75 million exception from the  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Knicks reportedly reached agreements with their two free  
agents, Charlie Ward and Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Olden Polynice was deciding between the SuperSonics and  
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Derek Harper was joining the Los Angeles Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Billy Owens was signing with Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jud Buechler was set to sign with Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Michael Stewart was close to signing with Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerome Kersey was headed to San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sam Perkins was ready to sign with Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric Murdock was joining New Jersey.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Rap impresario Master P, recently of the CBA's Fort Wayne  
Fury, was reportedly reporting to Hornets training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other unresolved questions was where Charlotte  
free-agent center Vlade Divac would sign. The Suns were interested 
if they lost both McDyess and Gugliotta, and the Sacramento Kings 
were weighing whether they should renounce the rights to free-agent 
Corliss Williamson in order to clear enough salary cap room to meet 
Divac's asking price. Several league sources insisted the 
SuperSonics were making a late push for Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	Other free agents, including Hot Rod Williams and Brent Barry,  
still were not sure where they would be signing. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were a slew of unconfirmed trade rumors involving  
Donyell Marshall, Bob Sura and John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a pent-up demand for information about players and  
playing, not about negotiators and negotiating,'' Stern said. 
``We're ready to get back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league released the schedule of exhibition games, with the  
first Sunday night at the United Center, with the Indiana Pacers 
taking on a team no one will recognize -- the Chicago Bulls.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Stocks, Currency Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stock and currency values  
dropped sharply today, despite approval by Congress of a pivotal 
austerity measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin  
America's largest, was down 5.2 percent at midday. The real, 
trading freely against the dollar since Friday, slipped to 1.69 
against the U.S. currency from the previous day's close of 1.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said shares slipped because investors were taking  
profits after several sessions of rising prices. The real's decline 
was blamed on market jitters about everything from high local 
interest rates to speculation about a possible devaluation of the 
Chinese yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is extremely nervous, and any negative comment on  
the market at all creates panic,'' said one Rio de Janeiro dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders had expected a calmer scenario today after Brazil's  
lower house of Congress passed a bill cutting federal pensions, 
boosting the government's chances of trimming the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must also vote on the measure, which the Chamber of  
Deputies approved 335-147 on Wednesday. Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes said preparations for a vote will begin 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial cuts, which the Chamber had previously  
rejected four times, affect about 300,000 retirees. The move will 
save the government an estimated $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, however, was the message that the bill's  
approval sends to international investors -- that Congress is 
willing to embrace the measures deemed essential to reinvigorating 
Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote demonstrates Congress's understanding of Brazil's  
deepest problems,'' President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said after 
the vote. ``The deputies demonstrated the necessary firmness and 
feeling of urgency regarding the measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage also gives the government a much-needed  
boost, showing investors that it can spur Congress into action on 
crucial economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressman and former Finance Minister Antonio Delfim Netto had  
said that although he didn't agree with the measure, he would vote 
for it ``to stop the dollar going through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition party deputies took a different view.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking money from the elderly just to show foreign  
investors we're working on the crisis,'' said Paulo Paim of the 
Worker's Party in Rio Grande do Sul. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis engulfed Brazil in August, when  
investors withdrew funds for fear the government would not be able 
to cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms  
helped rekindle investor fears. After spending billions of dollars 
in foreign reserves trying to prop up its overvalued currency, the 
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	As of midday trading, the real had lost about 28 percent of its  
value since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, it could undermine other countries in 
the region -- and that would likely hurt the U.S. economy, which 
depends on Latin America as a major market for exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William  
McDonough, played down those fears Wednesday, saying that Brazil's 
economic crisis was not a threat to the U.S. financial system. He 
spoke after meeting in New York with Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan.

<HEADLINE> USDA Defends New Food Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The incidence of salmonella is decreasing in  
the nation's chicken, beef and pork supplies, the Agriculture 
Department says, despite criticism from government inspectors that 
the food inspection system is not working. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nine-month progress report on the Hazard Analysis and  
Critical Control Point program, the department said salmonella had 
decreased by 50 percent in chicken. The report, released Thursday, 
found that 20 percent of chicken carcasses tested positive for the 
bacteria before the program, known as HACCP, compared with 10.7 
percent under HACCP. 
</P>
<P>
	For pork, there was a drop of more than 25 percent with 8.7  
percent of swine testing positive before the new system and 6.2 
percent afterwards. With ground beef, 7.5 percent tested positive 
before and 4.3 percent afterwards -- a decline of more than 40 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system really does improve food safety,'' said Catherine  
Woteki, USDA's undersecretary for food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The hazard analysis program was put into use last year by 300 of  
the largest processing plants. Nearly 3,000 smaller plants begin 
implementing it on Monday. The smallest plants will join the system 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	With institution of HACCP, plants replaced the longtime system  
of poking carcasses for visual signs of disease with a method that 
involves checking meat throughout the food production system for 
such things as fecal contamination and proper temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``For almost 100 years neither law nor regulation required meat  
and poultry companies to produce clean, safe products. We've come a 
long way,'' said Carol Tucker Foreman, coordinator for the Safe 
Food Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	But government inspectors say problems remain. They say the  
agency wants to phase out inspectors and allow the industry mostly 
to regulate itself. At a news conference Wednesday, they complained 
of being powerless to stop problems with meat, including an 
instance of meat tainted with diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection  
Service, said there are no plans to eliminate the inspectors. But 
the agency is seeking ways to move some inspectors from the plant 
and into other areas of the food chain such as distribution 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy said the goal is to make ``a net improvement in food  
safety while at the same time maintaining the other consumer 
protections.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sen. Bumpers Defends Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defending a longtime friend, former Sen. Dale  
Bumpers told the Senate impeachment trial of Bill Clinton on 
Thursday that the president was guilty of a ``terrible moral 
lapse'' with Monica Lewinsky but not of conduct warranting or even 
permitting his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can censure Bill Clinton. You can hand him over to  
prosecutors. But you cannot convict,'' Bumpers said in an hour's 
defense summation concluding six days of opening presentations by 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are none of us perfect,'' said Bumpers, alternately the  
constitutional scholar and the bantering Southerner, as he 
addressed a hushed Senate where he served until last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president should have thought of the consequences of his  
marital infidelity beforehand, ``just as Adam and Eve should have, 
just as you and you and you and you and millions of other people 
who have been caught in similar circumstances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With each utterance of the word ``you,'' Bumpers nodded in the  
direction of senators listening carefully to his remarks -- men and 
women he knows well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colleagues, this is easily the most important vote you will  
ever cast,'' he said. ``If you have difficulty because of an 
intense dislike of the president -- and that's understandable -- 
rise above it. He is not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be gone. You won't. So don't leave a precedent from  
which we may never recover and almost surely will regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers' remarks, coming on the one-year anniversary of the  
disclosure of Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, marked the 
end of the first phase of the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Friday, senators will be permitted to ask questions of  
House prosecutors and Clinton's legal team -- through Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist who is presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Clinton's allies are expected to seek a dismissal of  
the charges, and Republicans are expected to seek permission to 
question witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by the three-day defense presentation by the president's  
team, some Democrats said they were increasingly optimistic the 
trial could be brought to an end in the next several days, without 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuation after this excellent summation ... would be an  
embarrassment to the U.S. Senate,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of 
Massachusetts told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Majority Leader Trent Lott said he doubted any senator would  
want to vote to ``dismiss the case before they have had a chance to 
at least consider a subpoena and see what witnesses would say in a 
deposition, where there are conflicts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, said after  
Bumpers' oration that the defenders had ``created reasonable doubt 
for me and many of my colleagues'' on a majority of the contested 
issues. He said the trial may prove Clinton is ``a philanderer but 
you don't remove him for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the lead prosecutor, said, ``I  
think a lot of people wish we would just go away. But we can't. 
We're going to see this thing through until they shut the door on 
us.'' He held a news conference to renew the House call for 
witnesses, Ms. Lewinsky among them. 
</P>
<P>
	After days of closely reasoned legal arguments and charts  
depicting evidence in the case -- and lawyers speaking to 
respectfully to ``senators'' -- Bumpers addressed his remarks to 
``colleagues.'' He was a Democratic senator for 24 years and 
recalled that he and Clinton ``fought so many battles back home in 
our beloved Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he and Clinton had once gotten into a plane crash  
together on the way to a coon supper. To laughter, he added that 
they walked away unscathed ``to the dismay of every budding 
politician in Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers spoke from notes handwritten on yellow sheets torn from  
a legal pad. He was folksy, humorous and serious by turns, 
concentrating on the constitutional instructions for impeachment 
and insisting that Clinton's conduct didn't meet them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are saying 'please don't protect us from this  
man,''' he added in a reference to Clinton's high public approval 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton had been subjected to a relentless, endless  
series of investigations over the past several years. ``After all 
those years, $50 million, Whitewater, travelgate, filegate, you 
name it ... nothing. Nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is guilty, Bumpers said, of a ``terrible moral lapse of  
marital infidelity, not of breaches of public trust, not a crime 
against society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers stepped to the speaker's lectern in the well of the  
Senate after David Kendall, Clinton's private attorney, had 
methodically attacked allegations of obstruction of justice lodged 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall cited direct testimony from Ms. Lewinsky and the  
president saying that he had never asked her to lie in a legal 
affidavit. And the lawyer ridiculed claims that Clinton and his 
allies had arranged a job for the former intern in order to buy her 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall recited Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that ``no one ever  
asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pausing a second for effect, he asked senators in their seats:  
``Is there something difficult to understand here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the job search, Kendall said, ``Quid pro quo? No.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been extremely easy for the president to arrange  
for her to be hired at the White House if there was some corrupt 
intent to silence her,'' Kendall told senators. While Ms. Lewinsky 
was interviewed a couple of times in the summer of 1997, the 
interviews never resulted in a job offer. ``The fix was not in,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said sarcastically that the only person who ever suggested  
that Ms. Lewinsky use her affidavit as leverage for a job was 
``Linda Tripp, that paragon of faithful friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp surreptitiously tape-recorded numerous conversations  
with Ms. Lewinsky, then provided them to Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the chamber, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said he and  
other House prosecutors had presented much more direct evidence 
than Kendall indicated. And in addition, he said, ``any jury is 
instructed not to set aside their common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other prosecutors said they regretted they were to be  
given no time to rebut the Clinton defense. Several said they would 
try to use some of the questions for that purpose.

<HEADLINE> Feminine Styles Mark Summer Fashion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Feminine, fluid styles, appealing fabrics and care  
for detail were hallmarks of this year's summer haute couture 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Classic tailoring is still in. Skirt lengths vary, but hover  
mostly around the kneecap or fall to ankle-length for evening. And 
top designers once again love women's favorite gear: elegant 
trousers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether by French designers or creators from abroad, haute  
couture is still considered the pinnacle of Paris fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional sewers and embroiderers are on hand, at least for  
the handful of elite who will wear the stuff, and for the ambitious 
dressers looking for ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides extravagant evening wear, it was refreshing to see more  
day suits and so many pants in these offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also some way-out madness. John Galliano's largely  
sober but beautiful offering for Dior contrasted with English 
compatriot Alexander McQueen's wild costumes for Givenchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Day clothes at Dior were beautifully tailored, black, navy or  
white suits. Galliano called his clothes surrealistic and details 
like an eye-shaped brooch or black hands embroidered on a 
mermaid-flared dress were key touches. 
</P>
<P>
	While Galliano reined in his fantasies, McQueen at Givenchy let  
his hang out. He showed a whole village of costumed people -- from 
the black-taffeta-gowned choir mistress to the town clown in a 
sequined harlequin suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The intricate detail, occasional fitted tailoring -- even in  
too-tight short suits -- were considerable, but often overwhelmed by 
the bombastic effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The reality-vs-fantasy struggle played out all over town.  
Updated classics at houses like Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino and 
Ungaro were up against futuristic oddities at houses like Thierry 
Mugler, which featured a Star Wars of cutouts and leggy Amazonian 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Paco Rabanne's millennial approach of sensational chain-mail  
dresses simply extended his metallurgic past, and could be 
eye-poppers for turn-of-the-century parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Paul Gaultier was hailed for his creative collection that  
mixed classic ideas like safari suits and beautifully draped silk 
jersey clothes with wild fan-and-feather gowns. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld's fluid, easy clothes were pleasing  
adaptations of familiar tunes, like the varied jackets and 
cardigans, fitted for wear with knee-length skirts or full-pleated 
crepe pants. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouser suits were in abundance, and looked wearable to the year  
2000 and afterwards at the top houses. At Saint Laurent, they're 
worn with one-button jackets, cuffed straight trousers and dotted 
chiffon blouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot for summer evening wear are asymmetrical silk jersey or  
crepe dresses, stunningly handsome when draped under the bold, 
sculptured jewelry at Gaultier, whose designs sometimes emulated 
the ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Lacroix offered festive looks throughout a truly haute  
collection. His hitched-up bright taffeta skirts puffing over 
frills of tulle and lace, the intricate georgette silks and pleated 
looks were worthy of gala opera openings and grand ballrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	His color range was explosive and eye-catching. He played  
fancifully with pistachio green silks to hot flame-colored faille, 
or violet poufs on a red sheath dress with tulle drape. 
</P>
<P>
	Other designers often preferred black and white, or the hazy  
pastel shades, but elaborate fabrics and delicate beading or 
sequined embroidery gave the couture cachet. 
</P>
<P>
	Most wearable daytime clothes in these collections aimed for  
subtlety -- creamy beiges or chamois yellow, greens and blues, 
washed-out pastels and fleshy tones of pink, with the dark contrast 
of navy or gray-blues. 
</P>
<P>
	And feathers were all over for the Paris night scene. Gaultier's  
multi-feathered dress covered in fans and young designer Ocimar 
Versolato's showy, modern girls in mini-skirted plumage brought 
back images of the Belle Epoque.

<HEADLINE> Low Oil Prices Shrink Exxon Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil  
company, reported a 38 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings 
Wednesday, citing weak prices for crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's earnings for the last three months of 1998 were $1.53  
billion, or 62 cents per diluted share, down from $2.50 billion, or 
$1 a diluted share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the decline, Exxon's profits exceeded analysts'  
expectations of 57 cents per share, as reported by First Call Corp. 
The company's stock rose 37 1/2 cents a share to $71.37 1/2 in midday 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenues fell 15 percent to $29.66 billion from  
$35.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A sharp decline in crude oil prices has forced a wave of  
cost-cutting and consolidation in the global oil industry. Exxon 
announced last month that it planned to acquire Mobil Corp., one of 
the biggest mergers of all time, in hopes of trimming costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon chairman Lee R. Raymond attributed the decline in  
fourth-quarter earnings to ``weaker crude oil prices which on 
average were over $6 per barrel or 33 percent lower than last year. 
Average crude oil prices for the year were at their lowest level in 
over 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's other markets also saw weak prices, along with weaker  
chemicals margins which saw earnings decline 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, profits dropped 25 percent to $6.37 billion, or  
$2.58 per diluted share, compared with $8.46 billion, or $3.37 per 
diluted share, in 1997. Full-year revenues were $117.5 billion, 
compared with $136.7 billion for all of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stocks Close Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares ended mostly lower Thursday,  
although the region's biggest market, Tokyo, bucking the trend and 
rallying on speculation of bank mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks dropped on concerns over the health of mainland  
Chinese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares were lifted by recent reports of mergers and  
alliances in Japan's battered financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 217.37  
points, or 1.55 percent, to close at 14,245.42. On Wednesday, the 
average had risen 1.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen amid concerns about  
heightened trade friction between Japan and the United States. In 
late afternoon, the dollar bought 113.12 yen, down 0.28 yen from 
late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its New York level of 112.85 yen 
from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors started buying Tokyo shares following news reports of  
a merger between Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and Daiwa Bank Ltd. 
-- a story that was eventually denied by the banks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, stocks fell 2.6 percent on fears that debt  
problems at mainland Chinese companies may hurt Hong Kong banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index lost 266.34 points to close at  
10,048.57. On Wednesday, the index had risen 0.24 percent to close

or 2.6 percent, to close at 614.52 points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares fell slightly in the absence of market-moving  
news. The PSE index lost 3.59 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 
2,142.80. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares rose as investors figured a Cabinet reshuffle  
would bring no surprises. The Weighted Price Index gained 21.49 
points, or 0.34 percent, to 6,332.20. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares fell 5.1 percent on a rise in local interest rates

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Congress OKs Reform Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's lower house of Congress has  
passed a bill cutting federal pensions, an important austerity 
measure that gives a boost to the government's efforts to right the 
nation's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must also vote on the measure, which the Chamber of  
Deputies approved 335-147 on Wednesday. Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes said preparations for a vote will begin 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial cuts, which the Chamber had previously  
rejected four times, affect about 300,000 retirees. The move will 
save the government an estimated $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, however, was the message that the bill's  
approval sends to international investors -- that Congress is 
willing to embrace the measures deemed essential to reinvigorating 
Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote demonstrates Congress's understanding of Brazil's  
deepest problems,'' President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said after 
the vote. ``The deputies demonstrated the necessary firmness and 
feeling of urgency regarding the measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage also gives the government a much-needed  
boost, showing investors that it can spur Congress into action on 
crucial economic reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressman and former Finance Minister Antonio Delfim Netto had  
said that although he didn't agree with the measure, he would vote 
for it ``to stop the dollar going through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition party deputies took a different view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any economist knows this vote will not resolve the (economic)  
situation,'' said Paulo Paim of the Worker's Party in Rio Grande do 
Sul. ``We're taking money from the elderly just to show foreign 
investors we're working on the crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis engulfed Brazil in August, when  
investors withdrew funds for fear the government would not be able 
to cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms  
helped rekindle investor fears. After spending billions of dollars 
in foreign reserves trying to prop up its overvalued currency, the 
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has lost about 24 percent of its value since then. On  
Wednesday, the real closed at 1.58 to the dollar, slightly weaker 
than Tuesday's close of 1.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange closed up 4 percent Wednesday. The  
smaller Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange was closed due to a state 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, it could undermine other countries in 
the region -- and that would likely hurt the U.S. economy, which 
depends on Latin America as a major market for exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William  
McDonough, played down those fears Wednesday, saying that Brazil's 
economic crisis was not a threat to the U.S. financial system. He 
spoke after meeting in New York with Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan.

<HEADLINE> Two Fortune Tellers Arrested in Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe they should have known trouble was coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Sonya Cruz and Estee Lee were arrested Wednesday and charged  
with bilking clients out of thousands of dollars in a 
fortune-telling scam. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests are part of ``Operation Crystal Ball,'' an ongoing  
crackdown on fortune tellers who advise customers they're cursed 
but can be freed of evil spirits through more visits and fees, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Cruz, also known as Signora Rita, had a  
fortune-telling show on the radio and placed ads in a newspaper to 
attract customers. A sign outside her home in the borough of Queens 
said she was a psychic reader. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee welcomed customers to her $3,000-a-month apartment on  
Manhattan's Upper East Side, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the women charged customers more than $1,000 to  
take away a supposed curse or heal problems, such as a drunken 
husband, said Detective Robert Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``never relieved any of the problems,'' said police Lt.  
Robert Groth. They ``just caused financial problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, 43, and Cruz, 34, were charged with scheme to defraud,  
grand larceny and fortune telling.

	Clinton's Defense Ending 1st Phase  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concluding the first phase of President  
Clinton's impeachment trial, his lawyers are urging senators to 
reject allegations of legal wrongdoing and focus on ``the big 
picture'' -- an attempt by a married man to hide an extramarital 
affair. Once their third and final day of oral presentations to 
rebut perjury and obstruction of justice charges ends, senators 
will submit questions in writing to Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist, who as presiding officer will read them and ask the 
lawyers and House prosecutors to respond. The question period may 
be the phase of the trial conducted in a bipartisan spirit. 
Subsequent motions to dismiss the case and call witnesses such as 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky likely will break down 
largely along party lines. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Seeks To Amend Arms Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants to amend a  
1972 arms control treaty to permit deployment of a national defense 
against long-range missile attack but plans to build it regardless 
of Russia's assent. If Moscow balks, the Clinton administration 
will withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and proceed 
with deployment, Defense Secretary William Cohen said yesterday. 
But that move assumes President Clinton determines that such a 
system is technically feasible. Cohen said he would prefer that the 
ABM treaty be preserved to discourage the spread of offensive 
missiles.

	Buried Construction Worker Freed  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A construction worker buried alive when the  
wall of a trench collapsed yesterday was pulled free after being 
trapped for nearly eight hours, kept alive by an oxygen line. The 
man's condition was not immediately known, but he was conscious and 
clutched one of his rescuer's hands minutes after they pulled him 
out and placed him on a stretcher. He was taken to a hospital. The 
cause of the collapse at the construction site in Pacoima, about 10 
miles north of downtown, wasn't immediately known.

	Fiber Doesn't Reduce Colon Cancer  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A large new study has found no evidence that  
eating lots of high-fiber foods like bran, beans and whole wheat 
bread helps lower the risk of colon cancer, a surprising conclusion 
that contradicts years of dietary advice. The study, published in 
today's New England Journal of Medicine, tracked the colon and 
rectal health of 88,757 women who participated in the Harvard-based 
Nurses Health Study over 16 years. It is one of the biggest cancer 
studies of its kind ever. From 1980 to 1996, 787 developed cancer 
of the colon or the rectum. The risk was the same, regardless of 
how much fiber they ate.

	United May Acquire America West

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- UAL Corp's United Airlines confirmed yesterday  
night it is in talks to acquire America West Airlines, the 
ninth-largest airline in the United States. In a statement, United 
Airlines, the nation's largest air carrier, said ``it has expressed 
to America West Airlines an interest in a possible acquisition of 
America West.'' America West Holdings Corp. issued a statement that 
said it has been contacted by a number of airlines expressing 
interest in a deal.

	Wall Street Surge Worries Greenspan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told  
lawmakers yesterday that he saw three primary threats to the U.S. 
economy -- a mushrooming trade deficit caused by spreading 
recessions overseas, a potentially inflationary shortage of workers 
and an unsustainably high stock market. Wall Street's recent 
performance ``will have difficulty in being sustained'' given a 
slowdown in corporate profit growth, he told the House Ways and 
Means Committee. In fact, the market's quick rebound after a scare 
this fall from the collapse of the Russian economy was of an 
``unusual nature,'' the central bank chairman said.

	Japanese Stocks Finish Higher

	No. 2 Duke Beats Clemson 82-60

	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Elton Brand scored 17 of his 22 points in  
the second half as No. 2 Duke blew past Clemson 82-60 last night. 
Brand had one basket in the first 20 minutes for the Blue Devils 
(18-1, 7-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), who led 32-29 at the break. 
With Brand jamming at will, Duke rolled to its 13th-straight 
victory. William Avery had 18 points, 12 in the first half, and was 
nearly flawless with the basketball as Duke finished with almost as 
many blocks (seven) as turnovers (eight).

	Ex-Senator Bumpers Defends Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a plea to former colleagues, retired Sen.  
Dale Bumpers told senators today they must resist a House effort to 
remove President Clinton from office in a drive that ``is dangerous 
to the unique mix of pure democracy and republican government.'' At 
the Senate impeachment trial, Bumpers denounced Clinton's behavior 
in the Monica Lewinsky controversy as ``a breach of his marriage 
vows'' and a ``terrible moral lapse'' -- but not a crime that was 
impeachable. He spoke eloquently of the human toll the president's 
mistake had on Clinton's family, while chiding House prosecutors 
for a lack of compassion.

	Clinton Pushes Education Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- President Clinton urged Congress today to invest  
more in education and back a plan to train more retiring military 
personnel to become teachers. In addition to initiatives designed 
to reduce class sizes and improve the quality of teaching, Clinton 
presented increased support for the Troops to Teachers program as a 
key element of his plan to direct qualified instructors to 
impoverished rural and inner-city communities. Clinton said those 
who have completed their military careers ``understand how to 
manage people and resources, and limited resources, to do a job of 
limitless importance.''

give gay unions the same recognition as marriages between men and 
women. The Vatican frowns on giving gay couples benefits such as 
pensions or public housing or allowing homosexuals to marry. ``It 
is only in the union between two sexually different persons that 
the perfection of the individual can occur, in a synthesis of unity 
and of mutual psychic-physical completeness,'' the pope told 
officials from the Vatican tribunal that rules on requests for 
marriage annulments.

signings. Practically all of the league's 29 teams were ready to 
make trades, sign nearly 200 free agents and open training camps.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. is quadrupling its planned  
stock buyback to up to $5 billion, reflecting the company's 
stronger performance since acquiring Ted Turner's broadcasting 
empire in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest media conglomerate announced Thursday that  
it will add $4 billion to its current $1 billion buyback plan over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's profits and stock price have been growing since  
the company added Turner Broadcasting System networks such as CNN, 
TBS and TNT to its wealth of properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner shares closed down $3.62 1/2 to 62.37 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, but they have more than doubled since the beginning 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At current prices, the buyback represents about 6 percent of  
Time Warner's outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner also owns the Warner Bros. film and television  
studio, magazines including Sports Illustrated, Time and 
Entertainment Weekly, and a huge collection of cable systems.

<HEADLINE> US Reassures Russia on Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is seeking to  
reassure Russia that the decision to invest $6.6 billion in a 
national system to defend against missile attack is not intended to 
undermine the credibility of Russia's large nuclear force. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Secretary of Defense William Cohen  
was misunderstood when he mentioned to reporters on Wednesday the 
possibility of abandoning the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty which 
prohibits a national defense against missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary did not threaten to withdraw from the treaty,''  
Robert Bell, director of defense programs on the National Security 
Council, said Thursday. Bell said the administration has not 
decided whether to amend the ABM treaty, or if so what changes may 
be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell also stressed that a decision on whether to deploy missile  
defenses will not be made before June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, however, Air Force Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, who  
heads the Pentagon's missile defense programs, told reporters that 
if President Clinton decides to deploy a missile defense system now 
on the drawing board, the treaty would have to be amended. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has balked at changing the ABM treaty to let the  
Americans deploy a national missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will discuss the  
idea with Russian officials when she visits Moscow next week. ``I 
imagine the Russians will have a number of questions of their 
own,'' Bell said, while adding that there have been regular 
contacts on these issues over the past week. Clinton wrote to 
President Boris Yeltsin recently to outline U.S. plans for missile 
defense and to urge Yeltsin not to view them as a strategic threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials discounted Cohen's statements about a growing  
threat of long-range missile attack facing the United States from 
North Korea and other small powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any military expert understands that these states have not,  
and, in the near future, will not have guaranteed means of 
delivering weapons to U.S. territory,'' Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, 
chief of the international cooperation department at the Russian 
Defense Ministry, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore, the Russian Defense Ministry regards the U.S.  
statements on withdrawal from or revision of the ABM treaty as a 
threat to Russian security interests,'' Ivashov was quoted as 
saying by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	China joined in the criticism. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry  
spokesman Sun Yuxi said his government believes a U.S. missile 
defense system ``would only undermine security and stimulate the 
proliferation of missiles.'' China is the only nation other than 
Russia with nuclear missiles capable of reaching U.S. territory, 
though its arsenal is far smaller than Russia's. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Wednesday the administration ``will propose to  
explore with the Russians modifications'' to the treaty that would 
allow Washington to proceed on missile defenses. Cohen was asked 
what the administration would do if Moscow refused to amend the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then,'' Cohen said, ``we have the option ... to simply pull  
out of the treaty,'' as permitted with six months notice. He and 
other administration officials stressed their preference to 
preserve the ABM treaty as a means of constraining the spread of 
offensive missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ABM treaty remains, in the view of this administration, a  
cornerstone of strategic stability,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposed 2000 budget, to be submitted to Congress  
early next month, will include an additional $6.6 billion for 
national missile defense to raise the price tag to $10.5 billion 
through the year 2005 for a network of high-technology radars and 
missile interceptors. 
</P>
<P>
	The driving force behind the administration's increasing  
interest in a national missile defense, Bell said, is not fear of a 
potential Russian missile attack but concern that smaller military 
powers hostile to U.S. interests are developing long-range missile 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has changed over the last six or seven months has been an  
acceleration in the threat with respect to the programs that 
various rogue states, including North Korea and Iran, have in the 
category of long-range missiles,'' Bell said. They are missiles, he 
said, ``have the potential to reach our homeland, if launched.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Seize Nearly 5 Tons of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In one of the biggest cocaine busts in nation's  
history, authorities seized nearly five tons of the drug aboard a 
freighter delivering iron ore from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard found 9,500 pounds of cocaine -- with an  
estimated street value of $186 million -- during an inspection at 
sea last week of the 580-foot Cannes, a Greek-owned, 
Panamanian-registered cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizure was one of the nation's 10 largest, Transportation  
Secretary Rodney Slater said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials boarded the ship and accompanied it to  
Texas, where it arrived Wednesday. Four people, including the 
captain, were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Hebinck, a lawyer representing the ship owner's insurer,  
declined to comment. Jack Holman, the vessel's Houston-based 
shipping agent, said he was working with authorities to find the 
origin of the drugs.

<HEADLINE> Dealing Precedes Senior Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- If ever there was a place for an ``At Your  
Own Risk'' sign it would be the sidelines of a Senior Bowl 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Go ahead and try to squeeze in, just don't block the view of the  
hundreds of agents, coaches and scouts all looking for the next 
superstar. Do it and you can get anything from a nasty scowl to a 
shove out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Senior Bowl week in Mobile, seven days of players  
trying to impress scouts, agents trying to impress players and out 
of work coaches trying to impress anyone with a position to fill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things going on here,'' Minnesota Vikings  
coach Dennis Green said. ``Lots of wheeling and dealing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Senior Bowl record 1,048 coaches, scouts, agents and media  
members registered for game activities this week, said Senior Bowl 
spokesman Vic Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a little bit of everything going on here,'' said  
Knight, who estimated that 75 percent of the registrants were NFL 
personnel types. ``Years ago the NFL came here for the players, now 
the players come here for the NFL. Everyone involved benefits 
tremendously this week, from gaining ground in the draft, to hiring 
a coach to landing a client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game for seniors isn't played until Saturday, but anyone who  
matters in the NFL is gone by then anyway. Most coaches and scouts 
pack up around Thursday, which makes the first four days critical 
for players. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to go out and have some good practices and get  
yourself noticed,'' UCLA quarterback Cade McNown said. ``It's the 
best talent against the best talent with hundreds of eyes 
watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players spend their days trying to find a way to balance a  
hectic mix of interviews, evaluations and social events all while 
trying to prove they can make it in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is always going to have questions about my height and  
weight, but I can't stretch myself anymore than I've already tried 
to do,'' linebacker Dat Nguyen of Texas A&AMP;M said. ``All I can do is 
have a good week here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With just over two months remaining until the April draft, the  
scouts already have an idea of who's good and who isn't. But a 
player can still use the week to change some minds, either on the 
field or in a face-to-face interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah, a guy can really help himself this week,'' said  
Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden, head coach of the North squad. 
``Stocks can rise here because it's good players on good players 
every play every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from keeping tabs on players, coaches are also evaluating  
each other. First-year coaches Andy Reid of the Philadelphia Eagles 
and Brian Billick of the Baltimore Ravens have both talked to 
coaches this week while trying to round out their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Green and Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher went a step  
further by actually hiring coaches. Green promoted Chip Meyers to 
offensive coordinator and hired Ray Sherman as quarterbacks coach, 
while Cowher tabbed Bob Bratkowski as his new receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents are also hard at work, either trying to land a lucrative  
new client, or protect the ones they already have. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to help your guy meet with the best people possible,  
as well as be on the lookout for the player who needs some help,'' 
said Andre Jones, an agent representing Notre Dame running back 
Autry Denson. ``There's not another postseason game with this much 
to offer.''

<HEADLINE> Browns May Name Palmer As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Palmer, who was a longshot last week,  
apparently has won the Cleveland Browns head coaching sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, met  
with Browns executives all day and through part of the night 
Wednesday in his second interview for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the only candidate brought to Cleveland a second time and  
spent more than 10 hours talking with Browns president Carmen 
Policy, football operations director Dwight Clark and team owner Al 
Lerner at Lerner's office in suburban Beachwood. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in the afternoon, the group waved to reporters, but  
gave no indication that a deal had been made. After dinner, Policy 
said that there still were details to complete and the two sides 
would meet again this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm reasonably optimistic that things are rolling in a  
positive direction, and it appears things could turn out very 
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without citing sources, WOIO-TV reported that Palmer would be  
chosen as the Browns coach today and would get a five-year contract 
worth $8 million to $12 million. The Akron Beacon Journal, quoting 
a source who wasn't identified, said Palmer had been offered the 
job and accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Alex Martins said that he didn't know if the  
parties had reached an agreement and that negotiations were 
continuing. The team hadn't announced plans for a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns brought in Palmer for a second interview so he could  
talk with Lerner and Clark, who both were out of town last week 
when Palmer visited Policy at the team's headquarters in Berea. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, 49, is the only coach to get a second formal interview  
with the Browns, who are running out of time and quality coaching 
candidates to choose from with seven months left to build a team 
from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy on Tuesday had said no coach would be hired by the Browns  
``without meeting with and having a pretty good serious sitdown 
with Al Lerner.'' Lerner, a billionaire banker, bought the Browns 
last summer for $530 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With the expansion draft less than three weeks away, the Browns  
realize they need to end their scrambled coaching search. Policy 
had hoped to hire Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick, 
but dropped him as a candidate Monday when Billick decided to 
follow through with a job interview with the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick signed a six-year, $9 million contract with the Ravens  
on Tuesday, leaving the Browns with three coaches they had 
interviewed: Palmer, Atlanta offensive line coach Art Shell and 
Oakland defensive coordinator Willie Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak had removed himself  
from consideration with the Browns on Monday when he said he would 
stay with the Broncos beyond the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	After his interview with Shaw on Tuesday, Policy said the  
Browns' coaching search would ``go off the radar screen'' and could 
include college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little time,'' he said. ``And some of the people  
we'll be talking to may wish to have total anonymity. We'd like to 
keep everything under wraps until we're ready to announce who the 
head coach is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That soon could be Palmer, who in his first interview had  
shocked Policy with his thoroughness and an engaging personality 
Policy said he hadn't expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was in Mobile, Ala., on Tuesday preparing for Saturday's  
Senior Bowl when Policy called. He had been scheduled to interview 
with the Kansas City Chiefs about their coaching vacancy this week, 
but after hearing from Cleveland, Palmer flew back to Jacksonville 
to grab a suit for his interview with the Browns.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 71.83  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell sharply today on a fierce  
sell-off in Internet-related shares and concerns about Brazil. The 
Dow Jones industrial average closed down 71.83 at 9,264.08. The Dow 
got as low as 9,228.55, down nearly 103 points. On a percentage 
basis, broad market indexes were off much more sharply. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 21.37 to 1,235.25, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 70.67 to 2,344.82. 
Internet stocks opened weaker as sellers moved in at the opening 
bell to shed some of these high-flyers and book profits. The 
selling intensified after Barton Biggs, global investment 
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, warned in Tokyo that the 
spectacular rally in Internet stocks, which has helped pull the 
entire market higher in the last several weeks, ``will come to a 
very bad end.''

	Trade Deficit Sets All-Time High

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American manufacturers and farmers continued  
to be battered by the global financial crisis as the trade deficit 
surged to $15.5 billion in November. Exports of everything from 
passenger jets to soybeans declined. With one month still to be 
counted, the Commerce Department reported today that the deficit 
for 1998 has already hit an all-time high of $153.9 billion, 
surpassing the previous mark of $153.4 billion set in 1987.

	IBM Posts 12 Percent Rise in Profit  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- International Business Machines Corp. reported  
today that quarterly profits rose 12 percent, edging Wall Street 
expectations, amid strong demand for its computer services and 
software products. IBM said it managed the profit despite weakness 
from the economic slump in Asia and parts of Latin America and 
sagging computer-chip prices. The company also overcame a decline 
in revenue from computers, IBM's biggest business, which slipped in 
part due to price reductions on new mainframe machines and slower 
sales of other business computers. IBM shares were up 2 1/2 at 197.

	Microsoft: Prices Deny Monopoly

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An economist testifying today for Microsoft  
Corp. at its antitrust trial said that if the company were a 
genuine monopolist, it would charge $900 to $2,000 for its popular 
operating system -- roughly the cost of an entire computer. The 
government's lead lawyer later dismissed it as ``a silly 
conclusion.'' At the end of its first week defending itself, 
Microsoft returned to an important theme asserted by its witness -- 
that despite the dominance of Windows, the company doesn't wield 
monopoly power in the nation's high-tech industry. ``What I find 
nonsensical is that a firm with an ironclad lockup ... only takes 
$50 on a computer system that costs thousands of dollars,'' said 
economist Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications Corp.,  
Baby Bells that will unite this year, reported strong earnings 
growth for 1998 today. Lucent Technologies Corp.'s earnings also 
rose. Ameritech earnings rose 24.9 percent in the fourth quarter, 
due to strong sales overseas and a one-time gain on the sale of 
some local phone exchanges. Ameritech shares were down 1 7/8 at 67 1/8. 
SBC Communications reported an 18-percent increase in 
fourth-quarter profits, driven by growth in data and vertical 
services. Telecommunications equipment maker Lucent said earnings 
in its fiscal first quarter nearly doubled, largely due to a 
one-time gain that reflected a change in the way the company 
accounts for pensions and post-retirement benefits Operating income 
increased by a more modest 16 percent. Net income for the 
October-December quarter was $2.7 billion, or $2 a share on a

Continental Airlines' quarterly earnings dropped by 9.6 percent, 
with a rise in passenger traffic offset by a decline in the average 
fare paid by passengers. Southwest Airlines Co. reported a 36 
percent rise in its fourth-quarter earnings, with its results 
boosted by cheaper jet fuel. UAL earned $189 million for the 
quarter, or $1.52 a share. Continental Airlines reported 
fourth-quarter earnings of $66 million, or 91 cents per diluted 
share. Southwest Airlines Co. earned $100.4 million, or 29 cents a

	States Say Tobacco Money Is Theirs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers and state attorneys general said

federal government any part of the billions of dollars states won 
from the tobacco industry. ``We worked long and hard to get this 
money for our respective states. Fair is fair,'' Ohio's attorney 
general, Betty Montgomery, said at a Capitol Hill news conference. 
The administration said in 1997 it was entitled to part of any 
settlement the states reach with tobacco companies because the 
states were trying to recover Medicaid money spent on 
smoking-related illnesses. The federal government pays the states 
for at least half of Medicaid in every state.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Frustrated With GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frustrated that neither election nor scandal  
have dethroned President Clinton, some conservatives are beginning 
to turn their wrath inward at their party. Some do so eyeing higher 
office, others because of unease about the party's direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton isn't some invincible political wonder boy with a  
gift for stealing ideas,'' presidential hopeful Steve Forbes said 
Thursday at a gathering of conservative Republicans. ``He is a 
walking, talking monument to the failures of the Republican 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twice the Republican establishment has faced Bill Clinton,  
twice they have abandoned conservative ideas and twice they have 
lost,'' said the publishing millionaire, who is ardently wooing 
conservative voters crucial in primary voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he still believes the offenses Clinton committed are  
impeachable and that he should be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments, coupled with those made by television evangelist  
Pat Robertson a day earlier, suggest some Republicans are worried 
that the public is defining the GOP more for its opposition to 
Clinton than for its own ideas and agenda as the 2000 election 
campaign nears. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer, like Forbes a likely  
presidential hopeful, sounded a similar note at the Conservative 
Political Action Committee gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was Bill Clinton twice elected president? It is not  
because the American people have failed in their moral standards. 
Ultimately it is because the Republican Party has twice failed to 
give the American people a good enough alternative,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, who built the Christian Coalition into a GOP force in  
the 1980s, said Wednesday on his ``The 700 Club'' show that 
Republicans ``might as well dismiss the impeachment hearing and get 
on with something else, because it's over as far as I'm 
concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, who ran for president in 1988, placed blame squarely  
on the shoulders of Republican congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans don't know how to be a majority,'' he said on  
the show. ``They think of themselves as the minority, so they don't 
play the game the way the Democrats do, and so that's too bad for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, who led the House impeachment inquiry, scoffed  
at the criticism from Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, see, it shows that we're not tools of the Christian  
right,'' Hyde said. ``We don't -- we don't necessarily always agree 
with everything that Pat Robertson says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are trying to capitalize on the turmoil and  
uncertainty among Republicans on how to handle the impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., suggested that Robertson's comments  
might signal to hard-line conservatives that they don't have to 
vote to hear witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a significant statement for a respected person  
who sort of speaks for a large group of strong conservative folks 
in the country as well as in the Congress,'' Breaux said. ``I think 
that's sort of an indication from him that it's all right to vote 
against witnesses and get it over with, because it's not going to 
pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And at the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart quipped he,  
for once, agrees with Robertson, a sharp Clinton critic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rev. Robertson reflects the views of the vast majority of  
Americans,'' Lockhart said, tongue in cheek. When reporters 
inquired more, Lockhart deadpanned: ``Please don't push me any 
further on this. That was hard enough.''

<HEADLINE> Klinsmann Might Get Farewell Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Former German captain Juergen  
Klinsmann may get his farewell game after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Klinsmann's former clubs, VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga  
and Tottenham Hotspur in England's Premier League, have offered to 
stage games for the 34-year-old retired forward. The German Soccer 
Federation declined to offer Klinsmann such a game, saying it 
stopped staging such games in principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Their purpose in the past was to give long-serving  
internationals a chance to help their retirement plan by giving 
them the proceeds of a farewell game. With top professionals now 
earning millions, the federation sees no need for such games. 
</P>
<P>
	Klinsmann, who scored 47 goals in 108 international games,  
wanted to turn the proceeds over to charity. Since retiring after 
the World Cup, Klinsmann has lived in the Los Angeles area.

<HEADLINE> Fehr: Forget About Salary Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A salary cap in baseball? Union head Donald Fehr  
says no chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball players have historically behaved in very different  
ways than basketball players,'' Fehr said Thursday at the Sports 
Summit, an annual meeting of sports marketing and advertising 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBA labor deal earlier this month, players agreed to a  
maximum salary of $14 million, the first time a union for a major 
U.S. league agreed to an individual salary limit. They also 
eliminated some exceptions to teams' salary caps. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there was any way baseball players would agree to  
similar provisions, Fehr responded: ``We haven't seen anything so 
far that suggests we're going to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a meeting last week in Carlsbad, Calif., several baseball  
owners said they would seek massive change during the next round of 
labor talks in their sport, which probably will be after the 2001 
season. Many want a salary cap or maximum, saying it is the only 
way small-market teams can survive against big spenders such as the 
New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Without saying so directly, Fehr made clear players would  
vigorously resist changes to the system of free agency and salary 
arbitration, referring to the 232-day strike in 1994-95 that wiped 
out the World Series for the first time in 90 years. It was 
baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least through today, the memories of what we went through  
four years ago remain reasonably vivid,'' he said. ``If that 
remains when we get to bargaining, that should have a beneficial 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Brian Giles suggested Thursday  
that players should worry as much as the owners about competitive 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gotten worse each year,'' he said Thursday in Pittsburgh.  
``The players have to be willing to sit down and work out something 
that will work for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you're on a winning team, you don't think about those  
things,'' Giles said. ``But reality hits (when a player comes to a 
smaller market). ... The players have to sit down with the owners 
so we don't have a mess like we did four years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver Canucks president Brian Burke, who was on the panel  
with Fehr, said it was his impression the NBA deal has too many 
loopholes and that owners should have held out for more rather than 
settle their lockout after 204 days. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing about the settlement, Burke asked an official of  
the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies if the deal was ``idiot proof,'' 
meaning could it be ineffective in restraining a smart and wealthy 
team intending to spend more than the limit? 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said the response was, ``I don't think so.'' He told his  
NBA counterpart: ``Then you've just wasted a perfectly good 
lockout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke, the most outspoken person on a panel that included former  
NFL lawyer Jay Moyer and agent Craig Fenech, said the NHL is giving 
70 percent of its revenue to players, more than baseball, the NFL 
and the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have obviously not learned our lesson well watching the  
other sports,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Heroin Deaths Hit Record in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Heroin is a stigma Seattle hasn't been able to  
shake, say health workers who want the state Legislature to drop 
limits on getting addicts into methadone treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Heroin-related deaths reached a record 138 last year in Seattle  
and King County, a disappointment to officials who hoped a dip in 
the number of deaths in 1997 was the start of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing it come back up this year says to me that we still have  
a lot of work to be doing,'' said Dr. Alonzo Plough, county public 
health director. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle got a reputation as a heroin center in the early 1990s  
with the attention focused on the city's grunge music scene. 
</P>
<P>
	It was magnified by the 1994 suicide of Kurt Cobain, the lead  
singer for the group Nirvana who had struggled with heroin 
addiction before he shot himself. Three months later, Kristen 
Pfaff, the bassist in the band of Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, 
was found dead of an overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's musical heyday has passed, and any glamour heroin may  
have gleaned from it is now just one small aspect of the problem, 
said Ron Jackson, director of Evergreen Treatment Services, which 
provides methadone treatment to 700 addicts here. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people associated with the music scene. And there  
are office workers, construction workers, computer workers,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heroin is relatively cheap here, at about $80-100 a gram, and  
fairly easy for those in West Coast cities to obtain from Mexico 
and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest problem, Jackson said, is there are a lot of  
addicts who want to quit, but can't get help. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, Plough and other health officials are backing a bill  
that would end the state's cap of 350 patients for each methadone 
clinic, and would allow family physicians to give methadone 
treatment in their offices. A state Senate committee has scheduled 
a hearing on the bill Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cap law was designed to avoid concentrating addicts in a  
neighborhood. Instead, Jackson said it's meant long waiting lists 
for treatment, with about 110 people waiting to get in Evergreen's 
programs alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Heroin-related deaths in King County had reached 134 in 1996,  
roughly triple the levels of the mid-1980s. Plough said health 
officials had hoped the 1997 dip -- to 111 deaths -- was a sign that 
education programs were working. But Jackson said a one-year change 
statistically isn't significant.

<HEADLINE> US: Caspian Oil Pipeline Deal Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Negotiations involving Azerbaijan, Turkey and  
major oil companies on building a pipeline to carry Caspian Sea oil 
to the West are progressing and may soon bear fruit, a senior U.S. 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Morningstar, the Clinton administration's special  
adviser on Caspian Basin Energy Diplomacy, also said that despite a 
growing number of dry wells drilled in the Caspian, he believed 
there was sufficient oil to make it a productive region. 
</P>
<P>
	He said at a briefing he expected that in the next 12 months  
companies and governments involved in the pipeline negotiations 
``will reach some kind of agreement on guidelines that will set out 
a clear roadmap'' for building the 1,400 mile line that the 
administration favors. 
</P>
<P>
	It would run from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan on Turkey's  
Mediterranean coast. Administration officials say a pipeline along 
this route would help stabilize the region and serve long-term U.S. 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningstar said realistic estimates put the cost of the  
pipeline at $2.3 billion to $3 billion, or more than $1 billion 
less than previous estimates. The United States is giving NATO ally 
Turkey $823,000 to plan its part of the line. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of large amounts of gas and oil under and around  
the Caspian has attracted dozens of energy companies in search of a 
new bonanza. Because the nations in the region are unstable and 
wedged between Russia and Iran, they also have become an arena for 
big power competition. A decision on where to build the pipeline 
thus has geopolitical as well as economic effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has pressed the oil companies, among  
them Exxon Corp., BP Amoco PLC and Unocal Corp. to support the 
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. But the companies have been reluctant to 
proceed, given the low oil prices that are forcing them to scale 
back activity in the Caspian. 
</P>
<P>
	Azerbaijan President Geidar Aliev was supposed to have announced  
a decision on the pipeline route in December, based on 
recommendations from the 11 oil companies involved in a consortium. 
But the announcement was postponed for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternative routes would go from Baku through Iran, which  
Washington opposes, or to the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa, 
which Turkey opposes for environmental and safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have welcomed past delays in announcing a  
decision, saying it was a good sign for the route through Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningstar said he realized economics would be the main factor  
in any decision ``but I believe there will be an agreement on 
costs'' and design and engineering projects will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about 25 dry holes that have been drilled in the south  
Caspian in recent months, Morningstar said the oil companies did 
not seem concerned because they had similar experiences when North 
Sea fields off Scotland were being developed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the original predictions the Caspian being a new  
Middle East may have been overstated but the companies are moving 
forward with exploration, not backing away, Morningstar said. 
``There is sufficient oil in the Caspian to make it a productive 
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a report last year the State Department estimated that the  
Caspian region's possible reserves could reach 178 billion barrels. 
But several independent consulting firms now place total probable 
reserves in the region at about one-tenth the original U.S. 
government estimate, or 17.8 billion barrels.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Rapist Appeals Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Defense lawyers asked the Supreme  
Court today to reconsider a ruling clearing the way for a convicted 
child rapist to be put to death in the Philippines' first judicial 
execution in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Leo Echegaray, a house painter convicted of raping  
his 10-year-old stepdaughter, asked for a delay, saying a repeal of 
the death penalty law is still possible despite an overwhelming 
vote by the House of Representatives earlier this week not to 
review it. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray originally had been scheduled to die on Jan. 4, but  
the Supreme Court ordered a delay just three hours before the 
planned execution to give Congress time to review the law that 
restored capital punishment in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court withdrew its order on Tuesday after the House  
voted against reconsidering the law, and on Wednesday a lower court 
ordered prison officials to proceed with plans for Echegaray's 
execution by lethal injection. The date has not yet been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the execution might occur  
next month at the earliest, considering the time needed by the 
Supreme Court to discuss the appeal by Echegaray's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the appeal did not raise any strong new arguments and  
would probably be rejected by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of the road for him,'' Cuevas said.  
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to  
be scheduled for execution, and the delay in carrying out his 
sentence has set off an uproar among many Filipinos exasperated by 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-death penalty demonstrators held noisy rallies and the  
Supreme Court received bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, including Catholic Church officials, have argued against  
the death penalty, saying there is no proof it reduces crime. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada has said he will not pardon Echegaray.  
He also has turned down appeals from the Vatican, the European 
Union and Canada to abolish capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people. In  
1987, a new constitution written after the ouster of dictator 
Ferdinand Marcos abolished the death penalty, but gave Congress the 
option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such rape and 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers, alarmed by a rise in crime, brought back capital  
punishment in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Reeves Still Hurt by Denver Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- So much for trying to forget the past.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Reeves, giving an extraordinary discourse on his rise and  
fall in Denver, made it clear Wednesday that his wounds haven't 
healed completely -- more than six years after he was fired by the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, the NFL's coach of the year with the Atlanta Falcons,  
faces his former team in the Jan. 31 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with inevitable questions about his falling out with Mike  
Shanahan and John Elway, Reeves transformed a news conference into 
a personal catharsis, exposing his heart and soul to a hushed room 
of reporters as he recounted the painful chain of events for almost 
a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Football is a team sport, but there's a riveting personal  
element to this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of hurt that won't ever go away,''  
admitted Reeves, who took the Broncos to three Super Bowls before 
he was fired after the 1992 season. ``You never forget those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' ouster in Denver followed his well-chronicled firing of  
Shanahan as quarterback coach for alleged insubordination. Shanahan 
was extremely close to Elway, the quarterback who would say later 
that playing for Reeves was ``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the firing of Shanahan, Reeves lasted only one more season  
in Denver. He was dismissed by owner Pat Bowlen despite a 110-73-1 
record and five AFC West titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan returned in 1995 as Denver's coach with Elway's  
enthusiastic blessing. Last year, they teamed up to capture the 
Super Bowl victory that has eluded Reeves during his head coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that I will ever get over the full situation,''  
Reeves said. ``That changed a lot of people's lives. I don't know 
that Mike will ever get over that, what it caused his wife and 
children. Same thing with me. It caused a lot of pain for my wife 
and children. It's something that won't ever go away. 
</P>
<P>
	``But am I a person that's not going to speak to Pat Bowlen or  
Mike Shanahan or John Elway? I don't live my life like that. I had 
a lot of great times with those guys. I can be cordial to them. I 
can play golf with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves added, ``I won't go out to eat with them or go socially  
to a function with them. But if I was sitting next to them at a 
function, I would have no problem carrying on a conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He painstakingly recounted his version of events, beginning with  
his hiring of Shanahan in 1984 as Denver's receivers coach. A year 
later, he promoted Shanahan to offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really and truly, I couldn't have been closer to someone than  
I was to him,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	He recommended Shanahan as coach of the Raiders in 1988, then  
hired him back as quarterback coach when Shanahan was fired by Al 
Davis four games into the '89 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relationship began to deteriorate when Elway was  
critical of Reeves in a 1990 newspaper column, saying there was 
poor communication between coach and quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``If John Elway had a problem with me and you're coaching a  
position (such as Shanahan), why did I not know about that prior to 
reading it in the paper?'' Reeves said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also believes Shanahan revealed things to the quarterback  
that were discussed in private meetings among the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say things in a coaches meeting as far as critiquing a  
player that you would never say to a player,'' Reeves said. ``If 
John ever got any bad feelings about something I said, it was never 
done publicly. It had to be something coming from a staff meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, does that mean Mike did it? You have a lot of people on  
your staff. I have no proof of it. Nothing. But I did what I felt 
was best for our football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, in comments in the Denver Post, said he was surprised  
Reeves brought up the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe he's going into past scenarios,'' Shanahan  
said. ``If he wants to bring up dirty laundry, there's nothing I 
can do about it. I thought we both were going to take the high road 
going into this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1990 Post column, Elway said that he and Reeves had quit  
communicating and that their relationship was ``the worst.'' Reeves 
was so angered by the column that he went to Shanahan's office and 
threw the newspaper at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said Wednesday, when asked about the situation: ``How  
am I supposed to know how John felt about Dan? I thought I did a 
great job of keeping that relationship intact for seven years. He 
came to me and was very upset about it. I said, `What are you 
talking to me for? John said it. Go talk to John.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down to the weight room and got John and brought him up  
to Dan's office. I said, `John, you tell Dan why you don't like 
him, and Dan, you tell John why you don't like him. I'm tired of 
being in the middle of this stuff.'' So they both did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan denied telling Elway about any private conversations  
during coaches' meetings and also said he didn't script plays 
behind Reeves' back, which prompted Reeves to use the word 
``insubordination'' after Shanahan's firing in January 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan on Wednesday, when told of Reeves' admission that he  
couldn't prove any of his allegations, said, ``For a guy who 
doesn't have proof of something, he sure didn't help my reputation. 
To not have any proof, but to say somebody is insubordinate, that's 
one of the reasons why I've had such a tough time with this. That's 
a strong word not to have any proof. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole scripting thing is totally ludicrous. Dan never  
said one word to me about any of this. I didn't hear one word about 
it until I left. If he thought this was happening, whey didn't he 
say anything to me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said the bottom line was that ``Dan wanted to run the  
offense, and he wanted complete control. He really didn't want 
somebody with my type of personality around.''

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Trial Includes Mob </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four reputed mobsters pleaded guilty Thursday to  
using muscle and extortion to drive up the price of an Arizona 
company's stock by forcing young Wall Street brokers to push the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the four men admitted a role in a 1997 conspiracy that  
made the participants more than $1.3 million in illicit profits. 
The case was the largest prosecution ever to involve members of 
organized crime muscling in on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of HealthTech International Inc., a Mesa, Ariz., owner  
of health and fitness centers, rose after the participants made a 
deal with the company's chairman and then brokers subsequently 
convinced unwitting buyers the company's stock was worth eight 
times more than it was. The chairman, Gordon Hall, was also 
arrested in the scheme; he has denied the charges and is still 
awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario Gangi, 59, an alleged Genovese captain and Frank Lino,  
61, an alleged Bonanno captain, were among those who arranged 
secret payments to brokers and principals at two branch offices of 
Meyers Pollock &AMP; Robbins Inc., a brokerage firm, to promote 
HealthTech to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entering pleas were alleged Bonanno soldier John ``Boobie''  
Cerasani, 60, of Brooklyn, and Eugene Lombardo, 47, a reputed 
associate of the Bonanno family who admitted using threats to get 
what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two brokers at the now-defunct firm, which had an office at 100  
Wall Street, and a third employee there pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to commit securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardo indicated during his plea that the mob was looking to  
extend its influence over Wall Street by inserting its own people 
as brokers at Meyers Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the judge that he had threatened to use force to remove  
a Meyers Pollock employee who was preventing people backed by the 
mob from being hired. 
</P>
<P>
	At sentencing on different dates in May, the reputed mobsters  
all face less than a decade in prison under federal sentencing 
guidelines, although the maximum sentences for the charges to which 
Gangi and Lombardo entered pleas add up to 85 years for each. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangi appeared in court in prison clothing and will serve his  
sentence at the same time he completes a six-year prison term in an 
unrelated racketeering case. 
</P>
<P>
	The others left court appearing relaxed. Cerasani, wearing a  
gray turtleneck sweater, smiled when he was asked if he ever made 
money on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tons,'' he answered.

<HEADLINE> Dan Quayle May Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After sitting out the 1996 presidential  
campaign, former Vice President Dan Quayle is taking the first step 
toward seeking the top spot on the Republican ticket in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this for a long time. I've wanted to be  
president for a long time, and the year 2000 is looking like my 
opportunity,'' Quayle said Thursday night on CNN's ``Larry King 
Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He intends to file a formal statement of candidacy next week,  
the first step in his bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the GOP nomination is drawing a number of  
contenders besides Quayle, vice president under George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The early front-runner seems to be George W. Bush, the Texas  
governor who is son of the former president. Other possible 
candidates are millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, former Cabinet 
secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and 
activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls are quite frankly irrelevant. You don't make decisions  
on whether you are running for president on a poll, on your poll or 
someone else's poll. You consult yourself; you talk with your 
family; and if you are convinced that you are the best person to 
lead the country, then you make a go of it; and that's what I have 
done,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he believe it will take $20 million to run a  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced I can raise it. I know I can raise it,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Mulls Dollar As Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The government is talking with  
U.S. officials on the possibility of making the dollar Argentina's 
official currency, the central bank president said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Pou said talks have been going on since July as the  
government seeks ways to protect the economy from future financial 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Pou has publicly referred to the talks,  
and his comments appeared aimed at quieting rumors that Brazil's 
troubles were prompting Argentina to consider ``dollarizing'' its 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pou said a monetary treaty with the United States could serve as  
a first step toward a hemispheric monetary union similar to that in 
European Union nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about any abrupt change,'' he said, adding  
the talks alone would likely take up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina pegged the value of its peso to the dollar in 1991, a  
move that helped it cut inflation and reduce the budget deficit, 
but it has not allayed fears of a devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pou said substituting the dollar for the peso would end those  
fears and stabilize interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine officials and their counterparts at the U.S. Federal  
Reserve and the U.S. Treasury will prepare proposals for such a 
treaty and meet again, Pou said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Argentine Economy  
Minister Roque Fernandez, Deputy Economy Minister Pablo Guidotti, 
and Pou participated in a round of the monetary talks in September, 
Pou said.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Flu Season Mild So Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- New York is the only state reporting a widespread  
flu outbreak in what so far has been a relatively mild flu season 
across the country, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Since October, 40 other states have reported some flu cases, the  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Influenza is unpredictable. We can't predict whether it will  
be a mild flu season for the entire year or if it's going to peak 
later than usual,'' said Dr. Tim Uyeki of the CDC's Center for 
Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The season's peak usually runs from December to early March.  
</P>
<P>
	Flu usually kills about 20,000 Americans a year.

<HEADLINE> Buried Construction Worker Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cold and dirty, a construction worker who had  
been buried for nearly eight hours smiled broadly as he was pulled 
from a deep trench to the cheers of 175 rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
	He talked to rescue crews and clutched the hands of others as he  
was strapped to a stretcher and taken to a hospital just before 
midnight Wednesday. His condition early today was not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing he said was `I feel fine, thank you,''' said  
Mark Eckstein, medical director of the Los Angeles City Fire 
Department. ``He was awake and alert and said he was cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The worker, who was not identified by authorities, was helping  
place a 54-inch pipeline for Mladen-Buntich, a company under 
contract for the Department of Water and Power, said utility 
spokesman Walter Zeisl. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction crew was placing the last 200 yards of a  
13-mile project when the trench collapsed about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers had to shore up walls of the trench to prevent a  
further collapse while crews used a machine called an ``air 
knife,'' which works like a big vacuum, to suck dirt out. Others 
carried dirt out with buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	The worker had been buried over his head several times during  
the rescue, and crews feared they had lost him, said city fire 
Capt. Steve Resnick. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when we uncovered his head, he began moving and the crews  
were re-energized,'' Resnick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not immediately know what caused the walls to  
collapse at the construction site in Pacoima, about 10 miles north 
of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Pacific railroad and Metrolink trains that run on  
tracks near the construction site were stopped out of fear that 
vibration could cause further collapse of the trench.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Congress OKs Reform Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's lower house of Congress has  
passed a bill cutting federal pensions, an important austerity 
measure that gives a boost to the government's efforts to right the 
nation's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must also vote on the measure, which the Chamber of  
Deputies approved 335-147 on Wednesday. Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes said preparations for a vote will begin 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial cuts, which the Chamber had previously  
rejected four times, affect about 300,000 retirees. The move will 
save the government an estimated $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, however, was the message that the bill's  
approval sends to international investors -- that Congress is 
willing to embrace the measures deemed essential to reinvigorating 
Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote demonstrates Congress's understanding of Brazil's  
deepest problems,'' President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said after 
the vote. ``The deputies demonstrated the necessary firmness and 
feeling of urgency regarding the measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage also gives the government a much-needed  
boost, showing investors that it can spur Congress into action on 
crucial economic reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressman and former Finance Minister Antonio Delfim Netto had  
said that although he didn't agree with the measure, he would vote 
for it ``to stop the dollar going through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition party deputies took a different view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any economist knows this vote will not resolve the (economic)  
situation,'' said Paulo Paim of the Worker's Party in Rio Grande do 
Sul. ``We're taking money from the elderly just to show foreign 
investors we're working on the crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis engulfed Brazil in August, when  
investors withdrew funds for fear the government would not be able 
to cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms  
helped rekindle investor fears. After spending billions of dollars 
in foreign reserves trying to prop up its overvalued currency, the 
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has lost about 24 percent of its value since then. On  
Wednesday, the real closed at 1.58 to the dollar, slightly weaker 
than Tuesday's close of 1.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange closed up 4 percent Wednesday. The  
smaller Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange was closed due to a state 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, it could undermine other countries in 
the region -- and that would likely hurt the U.S. economy, which 
depends on Latin America as a major market for exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William  
McDonough, played down those fears Wednesday, saying that Brazil's 
economic crisis was not a threat to the U.S. financial system. He 
spoke after meeting in New York with Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan.

<HEADLINE> NJ Cops Oppose Concert for Convict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey State Police are outraged over  
having to provide security at a benefit concert for Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop killer on death row in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the troopers will be on hand for next Thursday's  
sold-out show at the Meadowlands, near New York City, because 
officials concluded they had no legal way to cancel the rock 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine, and Bad Religion  
will be the headliners at the $30-a-ticket concert. A portion of 
the $480,000 in proceeds will go to the defense fund of Abu-Jamal, 
a black former radio reporter on death row for the 1981 killing of 
a white Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	State police routinely back up private security at the  
Meadowlands, but Col. Carl Williams, superintendent of the State 
Police, said Wednesday he would write a letter to protest the use 
of troopers at the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting our troopers in with a hostile crowd and my  
people are going to be there trying to maintain law and order,'' 
Williams told The Record of Hackensack. ``This is amazing. I'm 
dumbfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams released a more subdued statement Thursday, supporting  
the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority ``and the quandary 
they face in scheduling events that swirl with controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers scheduled to work the concert will not be able to  
request a change in assignment. ``State police put their emotions 
aside every single day,'' spokesman John Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Sports and Exposition Authority, Dennis  
Robinson, said the show's promoter, DelsenerSlater in New York, 
told him about the concert's purpose only a week before tickets 
went on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he didn't support the cause, but ``we were forced  
to make a very pragmatic, legal decision.'' The promoter had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman urged patrons Thursday to ``exercise their  
discretion and not go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Peter Verniero said the show must go on because  
of a 1997 federal judge's decision that went against the state when 
it tried to block a Marilyn Manson concert. The judge said the 
state-run arena was a public venue. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I deplore this concert and its cause, legally our  
hands are tied,'' Verniero said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings, including the 1995 book ``Live  
from Death Row,'' have made him a celebrity around the world, 
attracting the support of death penalty opponents and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal was convicted in the shooting of Daniel Faulkner, 26,  
who had stopped Abu-Jamal's brother for a traffic violation. Police 
found the dying officer and a wounded Abu-Jamal lying near his own 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has said police coerced an eyewitness to testify  
against him and stacked a jury with whites. Police and prosecutors 
have said he was fairly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Graffin, lead singer of Bad Religion, said the bands  
organized the concert to raise awareness about the racial 
inequities in the use of the death penalty. ``We also believe that 
Mumia should be given a fair trial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rage Against the Machine publicist Lisa Markowitz said the band  
strongly supports Abu-Jamal and raised $8,000 for him at a 1995 
concert in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys declined comment through a publicist.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Presidential Contenders Argue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamar Alexander says George W. Bush is a man  
of many ``weasel words,'' and Gary Bauer says the Texas governor is 
something less than a Reagan Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The two likely GOP presidential candidates are courting  
conservatives by contrasting themselves to Bush at a three-day 
Conservative Political Action Conference that opened today. Though 
he has not decided whether to seek the GOP nomination, the son of 
former President George Bush is likely to do so and would be the 
early favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes Bush, who is not attending the conference in suburban  
Washington, an inviting target. 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning Bush by name, another likely candidate,  
millionaire businessman Steve Forbes denounced ``mushy moderates'' 
who will ``take us down to defeat once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You must give people compelling reasons to vote for you.  
Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no substitute 
for substantive agendas. A party that loses sight of its values and 
principles loses elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Potomac River, the Republican National Committee is  
holding its winter meeting to decide whether disappointing 1998 
election results are reason enough to oust chairman Jim Nicholson. 
Florida GOP chairman Tom Slade, trying to prevent a second 
Nicholson term, has reported some momentum in recent days but still 
is in an uphill battle, GOP officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting begins today. The election is Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	At the CPAC meeting, a gathering of the party's most active  
conservatives, Alexander is saying Bush should stop describing 
himself as a ``compassionate conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is Mr. Bush trying to tell us that he's not like the rest of  
us conservatives? That conservatism, as a political philosophy, is 
... without compassion?'' Alexander said in a text prepared for 
delivery today. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to the slogan dismissively as ``weasel words'' --  
designed to ``confuse people by meaning nothing.'' Alexander warned 
his audience about politicians like Bush who qualify conservatism 
with poll-tested modifiers. 
</P>
<P>
	He singled out Bush's father, for example, who called himself a  
``kinder and gentler'' Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not long after we qualified our language, we were qualifying  
our principles. We accepted a tax increase -- violating the bedrock 
conservative principle of lower taxes and smaller government -- and 
soon found ourselves vacating the White House for the first time in 
12 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander knows that the younger Bush is viewed skeptically by  
many conservatives who feel his father was never committed to their 
cause. Alexander hopes the criticism earns him support from 
conservative activists, many of whom consider the former Tennessee 
governor too moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush shrugged off Alexander's criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people choose to campaign based on what they believe and  
some people choose to campaign on talking about the other person,'' 
he said at an Austin, Texas, news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that Alexander said Bush should simply call himself a  
conservative, the governor grinned and said, ``I'm a 
conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer is a conservative activist himself, but he is little-known  
and has no campaign experience. Though his chances of winning are 
slim, Bauer hopes to get mileage by portraying himself the 
campaign's only true conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am strongly considering running for president. Where it will  
lead, I do not know,'' Bauer said in a text prepared for his speech 
today. ``But for what it is worth, I do know what I believe. If I 
run, I will know why I am running, what I stand for, what my party 
stands for and where I would seek to lead this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed to suggest that his potential rivals could not say the  
same. In a meeting with reporters in Washington on Wednesday, he 
focused on Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think George W. Bush would describe himself as a Bush  
Republican and I think Elizabeth Dole is in many ways a Dole 
Republican. But if I run, I'll run as a Reagan Republican -- and I 
am perfectly happy with those debates,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer planned to focus his speech, however, on legislation he  
would support as president, including outlawing abortions in the 
second and third trimester as a first step toward his goal to 
eventually end all abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle and New Hampshire Sen. Bob  
Smith are among the other GOP hopefuls scheduled to address CPAC 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, is expected to form a presidential exploratory committee  
Jan. 28 and plans to soon unveil a major tax-cut proposal.

<HEADLINE> Why Is Trade Deficit So High? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the U.S. economy sailing through its  
longest peacetime expansion ever, economists are agonizing over a 
rapid growth in the nation's trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans, who last year benefited from the lowest unemployment  
rate since 1969, 4.5 percent, may well wonder what's going on and 
whether it matters. Here, in question-and-answer form, is a look at 
the U.S. trade situation: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How big is the deficit?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Based on the first 11 months of last year, it should total a  
record $168 billion, up from $110 billion in 1997. Economists 
predict it will rise to between $220 billion and $230 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why is the trade deficit so high?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Because, in the words of Commerce Undersecretary David Aaron:  
``The United States economy is very strong in a world which tends 
to be a lot less strong.'' In short, American consumers have money 
to satisfy their appetites for imported goods ranging from cars to 
shoes. Foreign buyers, particularly in Asia and Latin America, 
don't. For example, airlines in Asia have had to cancel orders with 
Boeing Co. because Asians are traveling less. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why else?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The dollar is strong. Other currencies, from Thailand's baht  
to Brazil's real, are not. That means foreigners are selling their 
goods at bargain prices, in dollars. American-made goods, in their 
currencies, are costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What does that mean for the U.S. economy?  
</P>
<P>
	A: In the short run, it helps keep inflation under control, and  
that, in turn, helps keep interest rates low. Rates on home 
mortgages have held under 7 percent for seven months. It also means 
Americans can buy all the goods they want without putting so much 
pressure on labor markets that wage increases accelerate to 
inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Any other benefits?  
</P>
<P>
	A: It's about the only bright spot for many struggling  
economies. Think of it as a way for the United States to keep its 
allies afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens to the dollars Americans spend on imports?  
</P>
<P>
	A: They come back to the United States in the form of  
investment. Foreigners purchase U.S. securities such as corporate 
stocks and Treasury bills. That, too, keeps interest rates low and 
supports stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So what's the problem?  
</P>
<P>
	A: A rapidly growing trade deficit hurts Americans who depend on  
export sales for their livelihood, such as soybean farmers, or who 
compete against foreign imports, such as steelworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a steel producer, of course you're unhappy. You're  
losing your job,'' said economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. ``If you're a steel consumer, you're happy because 
the price is lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 10,000 steelworkers have lost their jobs. Job cuts last  
year totaled more than 200,000 in all manufacturing industries. 
Their loss of income and subsequent drop in spending eventually 
could hurt workers in businesses that have little or nothing to do 
with foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Is that all?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No. Growing foreign ownership of U.S. securities means  
profits on those securities -- interest, dividends, capital gains -- 
benefit foreigners. That means a growing share of the income on 
what Americans produce goes overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, foreigners' appetite for dollars isn't inexhaustible.  
Sooner or later, when the U.S. economy weakens or their economies 
strengthen, or both, they won't be so eager to invest in U.S. 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens then?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The value of the dollar could dip, even plummet. If so, it  
could touch off a vicious cycle: U.S. interest rates would rise 
sharply, slowing or killing the economic expansion, and the 
American stock market could crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short run, there doesn't seem to be a problem. But,  
certainly, in the long run this cannot continue indefinitely,'' 
said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
``At some point it will be a burden on our children and 
grandchildren.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Thursday's impeachment trial in the Senate  
against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	--President Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, finished  
the defense's factual presentation refuting the allegation that 
Clinton obstructed justice. He asked the Senate to ``give this 
case, and give this country, the constitutional stability and the 
political sanity which this country deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a friend of Clinton who  
retired from the Senate just three weeks ago, made the closing 
argument in the president's defense. He told senators they had an 
``awesome responsibility'' and that the American people have been 
``asking for an end to this nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--President Clinton spent much of the day touting the education  
proposals he made in his State of The Union address Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	--House managers and Clinton's lawyers prepared for the beginning  
of Senate questioning Friday at 1 p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Larry Flynt Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt has  
been released from the hospital after a bout with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt is recuperating at his home, spokeswoman Kim Dower said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The publisher, who left the hospital Wednesday, had been  
scheduled for surgery this week for a urological problem but his 
illness has postponed the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt's medical problems also have delayed his Cincinnati  
obscenity trial to April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 55, and his brother, Jimmy, 49, were indicted last year  
on charges of pandering obscenity, disseminating material harmful 
to a juvenile, conspiracy and engaging in a pattern of corrupt 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged after a 14-year-old boy allegedly bought a  
sexually explicit video at the Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store 
managed by Jimmy Flynt.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Trucker-Regulator Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal office that regulates trucking  
violated rules by asking truckers to lobby Congress against a plan 
to appoint another agency to supervise the office, a report 
released Thursday said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders in the Office of Motor Carriers drafted and edited  
letters last year for trucking associations and personally lobbied 
several large companies to combat the change, the report by the 
Transportation Department's inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ultimately defeated the proposal, which would have  
transferred oversight of the OMC from the Federal Highway 
Administration, which primarily builds roads, to the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees automotive 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of the proposal said the highway administration in  
general and the OMC in particular are too cozy with truckers, who 
are major users of the nation's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation shows the incestuous relationship that has  
developed between the trucking industry and the government agency 
charged with enforcing the compliance with the rules and 
regulations and laws governing the industry,'' said Rep. Frank 
Wolf, R-Va. He proposed the change in oversight and requested an 
investigation after it was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	In his report, Inspector General Kenneth C. Mead said the OMC  
lobbying violated Transportation Department policy and its 
anti-lobbying rules. He urged the highway administration ``to field 
new leadership,'' take disciplinary action and reinforce its 
lobbying provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of OMC's senior management foster, at a minimum  
..., an appearance that OMC does not have the `arm's length' 
relationship called for between safety regulators and the 
industry,'' Mead wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	For privacy reasons, names of officials involved were blacked  
out from a copy of the report Wolf released to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press learned they include George Reagle, who  
until Tuesday headed the Office of Motor Carriers. He was replaced 
by Julie Anna Cirillo, a 21-year agency veteran, and assigned to 
new duties within the highway administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The others named in the report are Jill Hochman, director of the  
Office of Motor Carrier planning and customer liaison; Clinton 
Magby, director of motor carrier field operations; and Cynthia 
Elliot, chief of the Policy Planning and Customer Liaison division. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Federal Highway Administrator Kenneth Wykle said  
the report ``indicates a serious breach of departmental policy and 
congressional prohibition against lobbying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wykle said he was replacing Reagle ``consistent with the  
recommendation of the report and following through on an earlier 
personnel agreement'' with Ms. Cirillo. He also said he was 
launching an internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Motor Carriers is a 700-person agency with a $150  
million annual budget. It is supposed to supervise truck safety and 
promote trucking. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics complain that it has spent more than a decade updating  
regulations aimed at preventing trucker fatigue and has not 
mobilized in the face of 5,000 deaths annually from truck crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying began in July 1998 and continued until October  
1998, when Wolf's proposal was removed from a massive spending 
bill, Mead said. Among other things, OMC leaders instructed field 
managers to solicit trucking organizations in their state to oppose 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was an attempt to have a United Parcel Service  
employee who is a cousin of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott try 
to lobby the senator. UPS spokesman Tad Segal said, ``If there was 
an attempt to lobby Senator Lott, we did not do so, nor would we do 
so.''

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Boosts Stock Buyback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. is quadrupling its planned  
stock buyback to up to $5 billion, reflecting the company's 
stronger performance since acquiring Ted Turner's broadcasting 
empire in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest media conglomerate announced Thursday that  
it will add $4 billion to its current $1 billion buyback plan over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's profits and stock price have been growing since  
the company added Turner Broadcasting System networks such as CNN, 
TBS and TNT to its wealth of properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner shares were down 25 cents at $65.75 in late morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but they have more than 
doubled since the beginning of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At current prices, the buyback represents about 6 percent of  
Time Warner's outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner also owns the Warner Bros. film and television  
studio, magazines including Sports Illustrated, Time and 
Entertainment Weekly, and a huge collection of cable systems.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Start With Large Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The good news for the Dallas Mavericks is that,  
unlike many NBA teams, they had a full roster to start training for 
the truncated season. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news: Their roster is full of young, inexperienced  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach-general manager Don Nelson held his first practice  
Thursday and pronounced the Mavericks ``absolutely in great 
shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said the quick start for the lockout-shortened  
season would make it hard for new players to get up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to the young guys,'' Nelson said. ``I can't  
prepare like I normally do ... I'd say that the rookies are a 
little confused. We're going to go real fast so they'll just have 
to hang on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mavericks open their season Feb. 5 at Seattle. It's the  
first of five games in seven days. Their home opener is Feb. 9 
against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nelson said the schedule will be hard on all teams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to complain at all about that,'' he said.  
``We'll go through it, play it, see how we do. It's kind of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the fun Thursday was translating an NBA contract into  
German so it could be understood by Dallas' first-round draft pick 
Dirk Nowitzki. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a little late because we had to sign all of our  
players before they could practice ... and we had a German guy 
trying to read a contract,'' Nelson said. ``Translate it from 
English back to German. That was funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowitzki, 20, the ninth overall pick in last summer's NBA draft,  
was signed to a three-year contract with a team option for a fourth 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The forward played this season for DJK Wurzberg and led  
Germany's Bundesliga with 21.4 points per game. He was third in 
rebounds with 8.3 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowitzki said he looks forward to playing in the NBA. But he  
acknowledged being stressed by the rushing around caused by the 
lockout's abrupt end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the lockout's over, everything's so fast,'' he said,  
``You have to do this, you have to do that, then I have my 
apartment, you know I have to buy furniture, so everything's 
stressed out right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mavs also signed two second-round draft choices, 6-9 forward  
Ansu Sesay of Mississippi and 6-3 guard Greg Buckner of Clemson, 
and 6-9 forward Ace Custis, who spent the 1997-98 season on the 
team's injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the rookies on his roster, Nelson hopes veterans such  
as forward Michael Finley and point guard Steve Nash, obtained in a 
draft day trade with Phoenix, will take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we might have a little bit of a more advantage being  
that we have more players in camp where some teams may have four or 
five guys in camp,'' he said. ``We have the majority of our team in 
camp and we can have that time to learn, to get to know each other, 
to gel, and hopefully I can be a positive force when the game 
starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nash, who played with Finley at Phoenix, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're really fortunate that we have so many guys,'' Nash said.  
``There's a lot of teams right now really don't have the rosters. 
So they're doing two-on-two drills and we're out here playing 
five-on-five. So we're lucky in that respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nash added that one of the things the team needs to do is settle  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all excited to be back out there and it's like 10 guys  
with their heads cut off running around,'' he said. ``But once we 
just calm down and get a little bit of rhythm and patience, you 
know we'll look a lot cleaner.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan, DaimlerChrysler May Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,  
will ask DaimlerChrysler AG for an infusion of capital amounting to 
up to a 30 percent equity stake, a major Japanese newspaper 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp, who arrived in  
Japan on Thursday, is to hold talks with Nissan President Yoshikazu 
Hanawa as early as Friday to discuss a possible deal, the Asahi 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan already has expressed an interest in forming an alliance  
with an overseas partner in a step to restructure its troubled 
business. In addition to DaimlerChrysler, Renault SA of France and 
Ford Motor Co. of the United States also have been reported to be 
potential suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Nissan will solicit a capital investment of  
$1.7 billion to $2.7 billion from DaimlerChrysler, roughly 
equivalent to a 20 percent to 30 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nissan spokesman contacted early Friday was unable to confirm  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been in talks with Daimler-Benz AG, the German  
automaker which aquired Chrysler Corp. in 1998, over the sale of an 
equity stake in the Nissan Motor's truck-making subsidiary, Nissan 
Diesel, for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan is struggling to survive under a debt load totaling an  
estimated $22.2 billion. The company has lost money in five of the 
past six years, and saw its U.S. sales decline 14 percent last year 
-- the largest drop of any automaker.

<HEADLINE> Harper, Knight To Be at Lakers Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Travis Knight and Derek Harper, the  
newest members of the Los Angeles Lakers, were expected to be on 
hand when the team opened its abbreviated training camp at UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black confirmed after the NBA lockout  
finally ended Wednesday what was speculated previously -- that 
Knight will return to the team in a trade with the Boston Celtics, 
and Harper will sign a free-agent contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pending the passing of their physicals, they will be members  
of the team,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said some players were receiving physical examinations  
Wednesday, and the remainder planned their physicals before the 
team headed to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, a 24-year-old 7-footer, played with the Lakers as a  
rookie two years ago, mostly as a reserve, and then signed a 
seven-year, $22 million free-agent contract with the Celtics. He 
was to be acquired by the Lakers in exchange for Tony Battie. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, a 15-year veteran who played for Orlando last season,  
has reportedly agreed to sign with the Lakers at the veteran 
minimum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have nine players under contract -- Battie, who will  
be replaced by Knight assuming both pass physicals; Corie Blount; 
Kobe Bryant; Elden Campbell; Derek Fisher; Robert Horry; Eddie 
Jones; Shaquille O'Neal; and Sean Rooks. Harper will make 10 when 
he passes his physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Others expected at the team's first practice session today were  
unsigned rookies Tyronn Lue; Ruben Patterson and Sam Jacobsen. Lue, 
a first-round pick of the Denver Nuggets, was traded to the Lakers 
on draft day along with Battie for Nick Van Exel.

<HEADLINE> Driver Cited in Fatal Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAYREVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- The driver of a casino-bound bus that  
crashed on Christmas Eve, killing eight passengers, has been cited 
for reckless driving, possession of a radar detector and possession 
on a false log book. 
</P>
<P>
	The summonses against Valerie Viner, 52, of New York were issued  
Jan. 14, State Police spokesman John Hagerty said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Viner's bus plunged down a Garden State Parkway embankment on  
Dec. 24. He has said the bus hit a patch of ice and slid off the 
road. Besides the deaths, 15 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers told police Viner regularly sped and used a radar  
detector. 
</P>
<P>
	Reckless driving is punishable by a fine to be set by a judge.  
The radar and log book violations carry fines of at least $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was the first of several involving buses shuttling  
passengers to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of a bus that lost control Dec. 27 and struck a tree,  
injuring 31, has been cited for careless driving, as was the driver 
of a bus that lost control and struck a median on the New Jersey 
Turnpike, injuring six, on Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dec. 28 crash in which a bus struck a bridge abutment on the  
Garden State Parkway, injuring 11, remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Texas Blames Escapes on Jail Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Seven killers were able to escape from death row  
on Thanksgiving night by taking advantage of design flaws in the 
prison and poor supervision by guards, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and other  
law enforcement officers found that the Ellis Unit near Huntsville 
has inadequate lighting and fences and other problems that may 
require death row inmates to be transferred to a newer prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates escaped on the night of Nov. 26. Six were stopped by  
gunfire from guards in two security towers. Martin Gurule, 29, 
managed to climb over two 10-foot fences and became the first 
inmate to escape from Texas' death row in 64 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurule's body was found a week later in a creek a couple of  
miles from the prison. An autopsy determined that although he had 
been shot once, he drowned shortly after fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the inmates were able to hide on the prison roof  
because officers did not follow procedure during their regular 
count of prisoners. Some inspections were conducted via TV monitors 
only. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also determined that one of the guards who fired  
at the inmates flushed a cigarette down a toilet before grabbing 
his rifle. Smoking is forbidden in the prison.

<HEADLINE> A la Namath, a Buchanan Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan, doing his  
best impression of Joe Namath, guaranteed the Falcons will beat the 
Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Namath made a similar guarantee prior to the 1969 title game,  
then backed it up by leading the New York Jets to a 16-7 victory 
over the Baltimore Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to be content with just beating Minnesota  
(for the NFC championship),'' Buchanan told HBO's ``Inside the 
NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal, and I think every NFL team's main goal, is to  
go out there and win the game,'' he said. ``I want to give a 
guarantee. ... What the heck, it's not going to hurt me: I 
guarantee a win.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower, Tokyo Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen today amid  
concern over renewed trade friction between Japan and the United 
States. Tokyo stock prices rose for the second consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 217.37 points,  
or 1.55 percent, closing the session at 14,245.42. On Wednesday, 
the average surged 257.61 points, or 1.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 113.12 yen, down 0.28 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
112.85 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Japan  
Wednesday that its December steel exports to America must show 
``substantial'' reduction or the United States will take 
retaliatory action. Threats of such action often help boost the 
Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing on the dollar was yen-buying by Japanese  
companies, which often repatriate yen from overseas ahead of the 
end of their fiscal year on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other factors helping to undermine the U.S. currency were  
Brazil's financial woes and U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
impeachment trial, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 112.77 yen and 113.40 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.92 yen, down from 131.26  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks opened lower as buy orders from  
foreign investors were offset by profit-taking in the wake of the 
market's recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
	But buying of bank issues reversed the course as players  
welcomed reported merger talks between a major Japanese trust bank 
and a major commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Kogyo Shimbun, an industrial newspaper, said today  
that Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and Daiwa Bank have started 
negotiations for a merger around April of next year. The banks 
later denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange temporarily suspended trading in shares  
of the two banks as officials worked to verify the report. Trading 
of their shares resumed in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger report comes amid a major reconsolidation of Japan's  
financial industry, in particular the bad-loan plagued banking 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 539  
million shares, up from Wednesday's 452 million shares. Advances 
outnumbered declines 702 to 423, with 175 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section added 14.85 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,104.92. The 
TOPIX rose 5.27 points, or 1.42 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.780 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.770 
percent, driving its price down to 100.16 yen from 100.24 yen.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lose Ground; Dow Down 80.84 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower in late afternoon after an  
influential Wall Street analyst warned that the ``bubble'' in 
Internet stocks might be ready to burst. The market was also 
dragged down by a big drop in the Brazilian stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 80.84 at 9,255.07, expanding Wednesday's drop 19.31 points to 
close at 9,480.09. The Dow fell as low as 9,377.11, down nearly 103 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m., the Nasdaq composite was down 62.75 at 2,352.74,  
after climbing to a record high of 2,415.49 on Wednesday. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 18.79 at 1,237.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were lower, with Amazon.com down 6 1/16 at 106  
15/16 in heavy Nasdaq volume. On the Big Board, America Online was 
down 6 at 142 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	One exception was Lycos, up 7 3/16 at 112. The Financial Times  
reported the company was seeking a strategic partner. The Internet 
portal company had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 2 to 1 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 707.9 million shares, 
off from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks opened lower and blue chips meandered this  
morning until Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cautioned 
that the spectacular rally in Internet stocks, which has pulled the 
market higher in the last several weeks, ``will come to a very bad 
end.'' Biggs' comments, made in Tokyo, intensified the sell-off in 
technology shares, which spread to the blue chips in early 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said Biggs' comments were neither surprising nor new,  
but that Internet stock prices had gone so high, they were viewed 
as an excuse to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get something this frothy, people definitely look for  
a reason to sell,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jeffries &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The sell-off wasn't helped by news from Brazil, where the main  
Bovespa stock index was down 350 points as the Brazilian real 
plunged, even after Brazil's legislature approved key measures to 
reform Brazil's indebted pension system. 
</P>
<P>
	The real was trading at 1.685 to the U.S. dollar, down from 1.59  
at Thursday's opening.

<HEADLINE> Blues Honor Wickenheiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues hung a banner in honor of  
1986 playoff hero Doug Wickenheiser, who died of cancer last week, 
in an emotional tribute before Thursday night's game against the 
Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser's dramatic overtime goal in 1986 against the  
Calgary Flames is remembered as the ``Monday Night Miracle.'' He 
died Jan. 12, at age 37, after a long battle with cancer and was 
buried Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of a 15-minute ceremony at center ice was a video  
marking his accomplishments and his family. Fans responded with a 
huge cheer when a replay of Wickenheiser's goal was shown. 
</P>
<P>
	The banner depicted his number, 14, atop a candle signifying  
hope, and was hung between the American and Canadian flags. In the 
future it will be hung outside the Blues' alumni box on the 
penthouse level. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser's goal completed a rally from a 5-2 deficit to beat  
the Flames 6-5 in Game 6 of the Campbell Conference finals on May 
12, 1986. The Blues trailed by three goals with 11:52 to go but 
scored three goals to force overtime, and Wickenheiser got the 
game-winner at 7:30 of the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues, only three games above .500 in the regular season,  
forced Game 7 before losing 2-1 two nights later as the Flames 
advanced to the Stanley Cup finals. The Blues fans have not made it 
past the second round of the playoffs since. 
</P>
<P>
	Wickenheiser, a former No. 1 draft pick of the Montreal  
Canadians, had 51 goals and 67 assists in 230 games with the Blues. 
In a 10-season career that also included stops at Montreal, 
Vancouver, the New York Rangers and Washington from 1980-90, he 
totaled 111 goals and 156 assists in 556 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was delayed by the Blues' five-game road trip. This  
was the team's first home game since his death.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Clinton's Defense-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from President Clinton's defense team's presentation to  
the Senate Thursday, as transcribed by the Federal Document 
Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Manager Sensenbrenner remarked that no prior article  
alleging obstruction of justice has ever been -- has ever reached 
this chamber. So this is a case of first impression. Deputy Counsel 
Cheryl Mills yesterday addressed the parts of Article II pertaining 
to gifts and the president's conversations with Ms. Currie, and I 
will cover this afternoon the remaining five subparts of Article 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence plainly shows that the president did not obstruct  
justice in any way and there is nothing in this article which would 
warrant his removal from office.'' -- David Kendall, President 
Clinton's personal attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As I begin I want to thank you for your open minds, for your  
attention, for your withholding judgment until you've heard all of 
our evidentiary presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of myths about what the evidence is in this  
case. Some of them are misunderstandings based upon erroneous media 
reports. Some spring from confusion in the evidence itself, and 
some are the result of concerted partisan distortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to talk to you this afternoon about what the record is  
and what the evidence actually shows. And I apologize to you in 
advance if the process is tedious. What I think I've got to request 
from you is your common sense and some uncommon patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the evidence, those stubborn facts, are critically  
important to inform your ultimate vote on these articles.'' -- 
Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll do my best to avoid repetition and lawyer talk, although  
I am a lawyer.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, a few words about evidence. We've heard a great  
deal about the rule of law in the various presentations of the 
House managers. But what's at issue here, and I think Mr. Manager 
Graham made this point very well, is a solemn obligation which is 
constitutionally committed to this body. Your decision, whatever it 
is, is not going to have some kind of domino effect that 
ineluctably leads to that midnight knock at the door. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule of law is more than rhetoric. It means that in  
proceedings like these, where important rights are being 
adjudicated, that evidence matters. Fairness matters. Rules of 
procedural regularity matter. The presumption of innocence matters. 
And proportionality matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule of law is not the monopoly of the House managers, and  
it ought to be practiced in these proceedings as well as talked 
about in speeches.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not legal hairsplitting to raise available defenses or to  
point out gaps in the evidence or to make legal arguments based 
upon precedent, however technical and politically unpopular some of 
those arguments may be.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If a criminal charge is to be based on conclusions drawn from  
circumstantial evidence rather than on direct evidence, those 
conclusions have got to be virtually unavoidable. Most of the 
obstruction case presented -- and they have recognized this. And Mr. 
Manager Hutchinson recognized it on Sunday -- is based on 
circumstantial evidence. And that evidence is as at best profoundly 
ambiguous.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In Miss Lewinsky's Aug. 20 grand jury testimony, she stated --  
and she had to volunteer to do it -- 'no one ever asked me to lie, 
and I was never promised a job for my silence.' 
</P>
<P>
	No one ever asked me to lie, and I was never promised a job for  
my silence. Is there something difficult to understand here?'' -- 
Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Ms. Lewinsky and the president have testified repeatedly  
that given the particular claims being made in the Jones' case, 
they both honestly believed that a truthful, albeit limited, 
affidavit might, might establish that Ms. Lewinsky had nothing 
relevant to offer in the way of testimony in the Jones case.'' -- 
Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not disputed that the president showed no interest in  
viewing a draft of Miss Lewinsky's affidavit, did not review it and 
according to Miss Lewinsky, said he did not need to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fact is obviously exculpatory. If the president were  
truly concerned about what was going into Miss Lewinsky's 
affidavit, surely he would have wanted to review it prior to its 
summation.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president knew and had told Ms. Lewinsky that a great many  
other women he knew who had been subpoenaed by the Paula Jones 
lawyers had tried to avoid -- had to tried to avoid the burden, the 
expense, and the humiliation of a deposition by filing an affidavit 
in support of a motion to quash the deposition subpoena and by 
arguing in the affidavit that the subpoenaed woman had no relevant 
evidence for the Jones case.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There's another thing which I think is relevant here, and that  
is that Ms. Lewinsky has stated several times that while these were 
cover stories, they were not untrue. In her handwritten proffer, as 
you've seen, she stated that she asked the president what to say if 
anyone asked her about her visits, and he said, you could mention 
Betty Currie or bringing me letters. And she added that there was 
truth to both of these statements, and that neither of those 
statements was untrue.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The videotape does not, fairly considered, indicate that the  
president was in fact focusing on the lengthy colloquy among his 
lawyers or that he knowingly made a decision not to correct his own 
lawyer.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever else may be said about it, there can be no doubt that  
the Jones case itself was a vehicle for partisan attack on the 
president and that he was going to be facing a series of hostile 
and difficult questions at the deposition.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Wright ultimately ruled that giving Ms. Jones every  
benefit of the doubt, she'd failed both legally and factually to 
present allegations that merited going to trial. But while it was 
legally meritless, while it was going on the case did impose a 
significant toll on the president both personally and 
politically.'' -- Kendall.

<HEADLINE> Skipper at Cape Fear Hearing Speaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARTMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- It ended with the death of one man,  
another lost at sea and a U.S. Coast Guard inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Wednesday's hearing into the sinking of the Cape Fear,  
Skipper Steven Novack started at the beginning -- a relaxed, 
bantering crew cruising home amid sputtering rain and snow. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck was the second of four serious accidents in the past  
two weeks, killing as many as 10 clam fishermen off the East Coast. 
Four crew members are presumed dead in the latest -- Monday's 
sinking of the Adriatic as it headed to Atlantic City, N.J., for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather caused two accidents, and a third boat rammed a  
jetty. But the Cape Fear sinking, in relatively mild weather, is so 
far a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Novack said all seemed normal at about 8 p.m. on Jan. 8, as he  
sat in the wheel house ``laughing and carrying on'' with mates 
Steve Reeves, Joseph Lemieux and Paul Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	James ``Jimbo'' Haley, who was to testify today, was asleep  
below deck. 
</P>
<P>
	They were headed home toward Buzzard's Bay after a day hauling  
clams off the coast of New Bedford. There were 6-foot waves, Novack 
said, a ``wind sea,'' with crests pushed up by a strong breeze from 
the southeast, but no noticeably threatening swells. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a wave came across and didn't recede.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like the stern was starting to sink, that's what it  
felt like. And the water just kept coming,'' Novack told Coast 
Guard investigators. ``Something just wasn't right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He glanced at the television monitor showing the engine and  
hydraulic rooms. Nothing wrong there. 
</P>
<P>
	But water was covering 25 percent of the 115-foot vessel.  
</P>
<P>
	``I actually thought -- I think everybody thought -- that it was  
just going to roll off,'' Novack said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stern kept sinking, the water rising.  
</P>
<P>
	Haley, Novack's boyhood fishing buddy, bounded up the steps from  
his bunk. Martin grabbed a survival suit. Novack called a buddy on 
the Misty Dawn two miles ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to call the Coast Guard,'' he radioed. ``You need to  
call `May Day!' We're going down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novack said he threw the microphone on the floor and got out of  
the wheel house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still can't believe it. All this occurred within five  
minutes or less,'' he said. ``It was unreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no time to grab the lifeboat. Hoping the crew was with  
him, knowing at least two men were, Novack jumped into the 
37-degree water, his survival suit only partially zipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Disoriented and aching from the cold, Novack lost Reeves in the  
moonless dark. He heard Haley and swam toward him with one hand, 
clutching the hood of his survival suit with the other. Martin was 
nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, Haley and Lemieux hollered at each other all at once.  
</P>
<P>
	``We heard Stevie one more time. ... You could faintly hear him,  
faintly hear him hollering for help ... We couldn't get to him in 
time,'' Novack testified, breaking down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	After about 30 minutes, the Misty Dawn arrived and plucked the  
three from the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's body was found a day later. Reeves is still missing.  
The Coast Guard has called off its search, but as of Wednesday 
evening had not declared him dead.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jordan Lookalike Fools Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Lee Kealon's Jordanesque looks has  
fooled basketball fans, a friend's sick son and even a local 
television station that mistakenly used a photograph of him in a 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hardest person to convince that Kealon is not basketball  
superstar Michael Jordan is Kealon's own son, Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the Space Jam bedspread, Jordan figurines and Jordan  
posters that plaster his bedroom walls, the 7-year-old has a 
picture of Jordan going up for a dunk in casual shorts and a 
T-shirt. He is convinced it's his father, and proudly shows it off 
to friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell him it's not me,'' said Kealon, 33. ``But he swears it  
is. He won't believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to being like Mike, few can score on Kealon.  
</P>
<P>
	The bald, 6-foot-6-inch Wilmington resident turns heads on city  
streets, draws autograph-seekers on the golf course and, when 
spotted in his BMW, has to speed away from duped fans.

<P>
	The similarities between the two Wilmington natives don't stop  
at their hometown. They were both born in Brooklyn, N.Y., before 
moving here as toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	They're the same height, have the same prodigious hands, wear  
size 14 shoes. They even honed their basketball skills on the same 
courts at Empie Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Called ``baby Jordan'' or simply ``Jordan'' by all who know him,  
Kealon tells fans immediately they have the wrong man, but they 
don't always give up. People ask him to pose for photos and, at the 
basketball court, for a videotape of what they can later pass off 
as an explosive move past Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, he posed as Jordan for a friend's ailing son. ``He was  
blown away,'' Kealon said. ``The kid really enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But discerning basketball fans can easily tell they're not  
looking at the real deal when they see Kealon up close. He has 
lighter skin, a narrower nose and fuller cheeks than Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kealon, who owns a construction company, admits taking on  
aspects of Jordan's persona to enhance the match. He wears No. 23 
when playing hoops, and he didn't shave his head until Jordan did. 
He even sticks out his tongue when playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Kealon even created a stir in 1995 when he appeared before the  
real Jordan at the opening of the Michael Jordan Discovery Gallery 
at the Cape Fear Museum.

<HEADLINE> Lost da Vinci Manuscript Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- A leading Leonardo da Vinci scholar has raised the  
tantalizing possibility of a lost manuscript on sculpture, painting 
and architecture by the Renaissance master. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholar Carlo Pedretti says he has found references to the codex  
in the papers and writings of Renaissance goldsmith, sculptor and 
author Benvenuto Cellini. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be anywhere in the world,'' Pedretti was quoted as  
saying Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedretti advance his theory Wednesday at a scholarly conference  
on Leonardo in Florence. Italian newspapers reported on it 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Leonardo probably wrote the manuscript during a  
1516-1519 stay in France. Cellini bought it in 1542, Pedretti said, 
and refers to it in his 1568 book on sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellini's 1568 book is the last reference Pedretti has found to  
the manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Cellini says Leonardo believed ``painting must  
always be based on sculpture,'' which contradicts a widely held 
scholarly belief that the artist saw a conflict between the two 
disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Cellini, Leonardo made clay figures to use as  
models for many of his paintings, including ``The Last Supper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few of Leonardo's paintings survive and his manuscripts are one  
of his great legacies. 
</P>
<P>
	His ``Leicester Codex,'' which contain musings on astronomy and  
the mysteries of water, sold for $30.8 million in 1994 to Microsoft 
magnate Bill Gates. The ``Leicester Codex'' is the only known 
Leonardo notebook in private hands.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Decry Bush, Moderates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Presidential hopefuls courted  
conservative activists Thursday by attacking the early GOP 
front-runner, George W. Bush, and establishment Republicans as 
guilty of being ``mushy moderates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no  
substitute for a muscular, substantive agenda,'' millionaire 
businessman Steve Forbes told the Conservative Political Action 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he did not mention Bush by name, Forbes clearly was  
referring to the Texas governor and his ``compassionate 
conservative'' ideology. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadening his attack, Forbes reminded the crowd of influential  
conservative activists that Bush's father, former President Bush, 
and Elizabeth Dole's husband, former Senator Bob Dole, lost the 
last two presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mrs. Dole and Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle,  
considering presidential bids of their own, Forbes said the 
fledgling 2000 field includes names that ``sound familiar. But, my 
friends, we have been down that electoral cul-de-sac twice before. 
I suggest we try something new for a change -- like winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was soon joined by other GOP hopefuls, including former  
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and activist Gary Bauer, in drawing 
the battle lines between the party's conservative and establishment 
wings. The strategy is most important to Forbes and Alexander, 
neither of whom is well rooted in social conservative circles. 
</P>
<P>
	The sniping, coming a year before the first primary votes will  
be cast, was part of a busy day in GOP politics. Among the other 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
	--Party sources said Quayle will form a presidential exploratory  
committee late next week. Quayle will soon unveil a major tax cut 
plan that would reduce income tax rates, the inheritance tax and 
the penalty on married couples. Quayle addresses the conference 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Republican National Committee, opened its three-day winter  
meeting in Washington. The highlight will be the vote Friday to 
determine whether to oust Chairman Jim Nicholson for the party's 
poor showing in 1998 elections. Supporters of Florida party 
Chairman Tom Slade, Nicholson's only opponent, gained some momentum 
Thursday but his campaign is still an uphill affair. 
</P>
<P>
	--A controversial resolution that would have forbidden the RNC  
from taking money from the gambling industry was rejected by an RNC 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said he doesn't believe  
New York Gov. George Pataki has any plans to enter the presidential 
primaries, but, D'Amato told an Albany radio station, ``if the 
leaders stumble along the way, he could then move to run for 
president or certainly be selected as the vice presidential 
nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki announced Wednesday he has formed a political action  
committee to finance his stepped-up travel across the country for a 
series of speeches and to make donations to other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Dole did not attend CPAC, but the governor's office  
quickly responded to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is somewhat perplexing that fellow Republicans would attack  
a popular conservative governor of a very conservative state whose 
overwhelming re-election proved a conservative philosophy can erase 
the gender gap and attract a record number of minority voters while 
remaining true to conservative principles,'' said Bush spokeswoman 
Karen Hughes in a telephone interview from Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, Bauer and Forbes compared Bush's ``compassionate  
conservative'' slogan to his father's promise to be a ``kinder and 
gentler'' Republican. They want the conservative activists, many of 
whom are still angry at President Bush for raising taxes, to punish 
the son for the father's missteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not long after we qualified our language, we were qualifying  
our principles,'' Alexander said, referring to the elder Bush. ``We 
accepted a tax increase ... and soon found ourselves vacating the 
White House for the first time in 12 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer didn't criticize Bush in his speech, but told reporters  
that conservatives ``need to know that the last Bush talked about 
kinder and gentler, and that resulted in an election loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' rhetoric was the toughest.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the siren song of these  
mushy moderates, make no mistake: They will take us down to defeat 
once again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes confirmed later that he had Bush and his ``compassionate  
conservative'' slogan in mind when he gave the speech. ``The phrase 
itself is fine. The key is whether it will be followed by 
substantive issues the public wants,'' he said. ``They've had 
enough sizzle. They want steak.''

<HEADLINE> Woman, Three Children Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- A girl seeking a cup of sugar from her  
neighbor found the pregnant woman dead, bound with an extension 
cord. Inside the home were the bodies of three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in this southwestern Missouri city called the four  
killings their worst homicide case in at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sure didn't deserve this,'' said a sobbing Vanessa  
Woodruff, 16, who found the mother on the living-room floor of the 
home Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was bound with an extension cord and white scarf around  
her neck. Police who searched the rest of the house found the three 
children, said officer Mike Green. Their identities were withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very small mountain of leads they are working on at  
this point,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said the woman was pregnant and had two boys and a  
girl, ages around 8 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just scary. It's going to make me sick,'' said Nel  
Thompson, who lives across the street from the victims. ``You 
wonder why -- who would be that sick? Who would hurt a woman who was 
pregnant?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to say how the four died, but said the case was  
being investigated as a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Darrell Crick said it matched the most fatalities in a  
single homicide case that he could remember in his 23 years with 
the Springfield Police Department. The city of about 150,000 
normally has fewer than 10 murders a year. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the slayings hit the neighborhood hard.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was one of the nicest people in the world,'' said Vanessa  
Woodruff's brother, Charles Woodruff. ``We were broke, out of money 
one time, and she raked up 30 bucks in change and gave it to us. 
And she didn't have any money herself. That's the kind of person 
she was.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Floats Abortion Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House plans to propose a $4.5  
million initiative Friday to counter violence at abortion clinics 
with added security, such as alarm systems, bulletproof windows and 
closed-circuit camera systems. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was expected to make the  
announcement in a speech to the National Abortion Rights Action 
League on the 26th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark Roe 
vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, to be included in the president's budget proposal for  
fiscal 2000, would will help clinics purchase motion detectors and 
improved lighting, according to a senior administration official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. It will also pay for security 
assessments to determine which clinics are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with the escalation of violence waged against abortion  
provider clinics, this is good news,'' said Belle Taylor-McGhee, 
spokeswoman for NARAL. She stressed the need for doctors, abortion 
providers and women to all have safe access to clinics, which 
provide a variety of health services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good first step, and it's important that the  
administration is taking domestic terrorism seriously,'' said 
Jacquelyn Lendsey, vice president of public policy for Planned 
Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time as the announcement, thousands of abortion  
opponents were expected to march to the Capitol and Supreme Court 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Attorney General Janet Reno set up a national task  
force to prosecute and prevent attacks and threats against abortion 
providers. The announcement was made a month after abortion Dr. 
Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider, was killed by a rifle shot 
fired into his suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force plans to train local law enforcement and abortion  
providers in how to respond to and prevent such attacks and 
establish a national database with all information on clinic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Thursday by the Feminist Majority Foundation  
showed that in the first seven months of 1998, 22 percent of 
clinics experienced one or more forms of violence. These included 
blockades, invasions, bomb threats and bombings, arson threats and 
arsons, chemical attacks, death threats and stalking. This was a 
slight decrease from 25 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that clinics that reported law enforcement  
response as ``excellent'' experienced lower levels of violence than 
those that characterized local law enforcement as ``poor.''

<HEADLINE> Steel Quota Bill Readied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from steel-producing states are  
readying a bill to impose quotas on foreign steel blamed for 
thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Steelworkers of America, a big contributor to  
congressional campaigns, has been demanding quotas. Rep. Peter J. 
Visclosky, D-Ind., promised Thursday to introduce a bill on its 
behalf. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., also has one in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such legislation stands little chance of becoming law  
and is likely to run afoul of international trade agreements, 
supporters of quotas believe that dire circumstances call for 
extreme measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are political uses'' for such measures, said Greg  
Mastel, an economist with the Economic Strategy Institute in 
Washington. ``Even if they don't pass, and I don't think they will, 
there's a good chance they will have the desired political 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports reached record levels in 1998 in the wake of the  
Asian economic crisis and have been blamed for at least 10,000 
layoffs and some U.S. company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has filed formal trade complaints seeking to impose  
tariffs on steel from Japan, Russia and Brazil, but those cases 
will not be resolved for several more months. 
</P>
<P>
	In addressing a few thousand steelworkers outside the Capitol on  
Wednesday, Rockefeller pledged to introduce within weeks a bill 
that would set monthly limits on imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Visclosky acknowledged Thursday that his bill, which would limit  
monthly imports to the pre-crisis level of July 1997, would be 
``very, very difficult'' to pass and would likely violate trade 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	But he told reporters that the mere act of proposing a quota  
would signal the administration and the world that ``the numerous 
members who get on this bill are serious about it, and we're not 
going away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many trade experts believe that imposing a quota amounts to  
declaring an international trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other countries will follow our bad example,'' said Brink  
Lindsey, director of the Center for Trade Policies Studies at the 
libertarian Cato Institute. ``Most economists reserve special 
condemnation for quotas as opposed to other trade barriers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Clinton vetoes such a bill, Lindsey said passage sends a  
dangerous message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is telling the world that it's OK to cave in to  
special-interest pressure when you have any kind of political 
sentiment for protectionism,'' Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, the steelworkers union president, has been vocal  
about demanding quotas, saying they are needed to ``stop the 
bleeding'' of U.S. jobs. Domestic steel producers largely have been 
silent on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes in New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A single-engine plane lost a wing and  
crashed in the rugged Sandia Mountains, killing three men who were 
returning from a golfing trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowfall this morning hampered efforts to recover the remains of  
the men in the Sandia Mountains, according to Rick Goodman, state 
search and rescue resource officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cessna 210 lost a wing over wintry Sandia Peak and went down  
at the 7,500-foot level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were watching him do a loop. All of a sudden, the wing came  
off and he just spiraled straight into the ground,'' said Ken Bray, 
who was mountain biking when the crash happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Michaels, another mountain biker, said he thought the  
airplane was doing aerobatics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts a real pit in your stomach,'' said Michaels, who has  
been a pilot for 40 years. ``He went straight down. He was going so 
fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airplane's pilot earlier reported to Albuquerque air traffic  
controllers that the craft's vacuum pumps had failed. The pumps 
provide power to flight instruments on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was en route Wednesday from Scottsdale, Ariz., to  
Wichita, Kan., where the victims lived. The trio were good friends 
who apparently made regular golf trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand they were at a golf tournament and were flying  
back to Wichita,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris from the crash was strewn over an area of between 300  
yards and 500 yards, said Darren White, state public safety 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandia Peak soars to 10,600 feet on the outskirts of  
Albuquerque.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Rocked by Bulls Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Trading Scottie Pippen to Houston for Roy Rogers  
and a second-round pick didn't really shake up this town until 
people found out who wasn't part of the deal: 
</P>
<P>
	Trigger.  
</P>
<P>
	``Good deal for Scottie,'' said Bob, calling a local sports-talk  
show from his car Thursday. ``Bad deal for the rest of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything else you want to get off your chest?'' the show's  
host asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Bob said, warming to the task, ``I'd like to see Jerry  
Krause ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decorum prevents us from repeating his plans for the Bulls'  
general manager. Suffice it to say, though, that if Krause were 
stuck somewhere in a snowbank, instead of reaching for a shovel, 
most Chicagoans would drop to their knees and pray for freezing 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``running off the Bulls'' is almost complete. Michael  
Jordan's departure last week set the process in motion, but the 
breakup of one of the NBA's greatest dynasties didn't become 
official until Thursday. And the moment it did, Bulls fans resigned 
themselves to the same fate as those of the NBA's last great 
dynasty, the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, after Bill Russell retired as player-coach and Sam  
Jones followed him to the sideline, the Celtics became the first 
defending champions to finish under .500 the next season and fail 
to make the playoffs. The only way the Bulls won't claim the same 
distinction is if commissioner David Stern takes pity on the 
franchise and drops it down into the CBA. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, Trigger might not have been such a bad  
acquisition. On Day 1 of the post-Jordan era, only six of the 15 
two-legged athletes who turned up on the practice court had signed 
contracts. That left new coach Tim Floyd with a lose-lose 
proposition: Either watch a few hours of 3-on-3 pickup basketball 
from the sideline with the rest of his unsigned crew, or cancel 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose the latter, then practiced putting the best face on  
things, a skill that will come in handy as the season goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get anybody hurt,'' Floyd said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, serious contenders for the Bulls' throne, such as the  
Pacers and Knicks, were making smooth segues from informal, but 
well-attended workouts to real practices, or else bringing impact 
players on board. Granted, Latrell Sprewell's impact on the Knicks 
may not be entirely positive. But right about now, Dennis Rodman in 
a dress would be a welcome sight in Chicago -- not to mention a 
familiar one. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, before who-was-headed-where was speculation and not  
accounting, Floyd could afford to joke about what the Bulls lineup 
would look like and how he would coach during the team's opening 
exhibition game against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody can envision the days of playing sandlot  
football and drawing plays in the dirt,'' he said. ``We could 
actually be moving Gatorade bottles around the sideline for the 
game Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, Floyd has more immediate concerns than drawing up  
plays for Sunday. He's got to find stand-ins for the sports drinks 
in time for a Friday night scrimmage at the United Center that the 
Bulls promised to open to the public. Fans, even those who didn't 
shell out a dime, won't be any more thrilled by a 3-on-3 than Floyd 
will. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be ready to go,'' Floyd vowed, throwing a scare into  
assistant coach Bill Cartwright, who is 40-something and hasn't 
seen action in three years. ``Even if Cartwright has to, we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This thing could turn out to be even worse than it looks at the  
moment. The year the Celtics made their precipitous drop, they 
returned seven players, including stars John Havlicek and Bailey 
Howell. The Bulls now have five players from last season's team 
under contract for this one -- Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy Brown, 
Bill Wennington and Keith Booth -- and they added Curtis Staples 
from Virginia on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	One big indicator of how little confidence everybody else has in  
the Bulls came from NBC. The network said that the Bulls, mainstays 
of its televised diet of NBA games when Jordan was around, would 
not be appearing on even one national telecast. Ditto for cable 
partners TNT and TBS. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of his first day, Floyd returned to his office and  
probably should have turned out the lights and pressed a cold 
compress to his forehead. Instead, he picked up the telephone and 
agreed to take one more question on what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to limit it to one word,'' Floyd said, ``that would  
be patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be lucky if that's the word Bulls fans use.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Trial Sticks to Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment trial of President Clinton is  
casting doubt, at least for the time-being, on the long-held notion 
that whatever the issue, the Senate will spend a long, long time 
addressing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber famous for it's deliberative nature is actually  
moving along on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time in history that anyone has accused the  
Senate of speeding,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Punctuality is not normally associated with the scholarly  
Senate, which the nation's founders established to cool the 
passions of the raucous House. 
</P>
<P>
	But ever since the 100 members were sworn by the chief justice  
of the United States u to maintain silence ``under pain of 
imprisonment,'' the Senate has begun and finished trial proceedings 
each day at something close to the time Republican and Democratic 
leaders said it would. 
</P>
<P>
	This from a chamber that took four days to rename Washington  
National Airport after President Ronald Reagan, and four weeks to 
kill a tobacco bill nearly everyone conceded was fatally flawed at 
the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate rules provide for lengthy debate, permit members to add  
unrelated amendments to bills and anonymously stall legislation -- 
all ingredients for delay. For example, hours of debate on the 
tobacco bill were spent on whether to repeal the marriage tax 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, the Senate is a shrine to unlimited talk, called a  
filibuster. The chamber's senior member, Sen. Strom Thurmond, 
R-S.C., once talked for more than 24 hours without stopping, a 
record revered by many of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	But under pain of imprisonment -- and perhaps no desire to be  
seen on television talking about unseemly sexual details in the 
case -- Thurmond and his 99 colleagues have sat silent through the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The only exception was an objection from Sen. Tom Harkin,  
D-Iowa, last week to the characterization of senators as jurors. 
But even that interruption lasted only a few minutes, a nanosecond 
in Senate time.

<HEADLINE> Asia Crisis Said Worst on Females </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Women and girls in Southeast Asia have  
been the hardest hit by regional recession, losing jobs, health 
care and school opportunities, the U.N. Population Fund said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many women have turned to prostitution to feed their families as  
factory jobs have become scarce, the U.N. agency said, but they 
earn less since their clients are also feeling the economic pinch 
and have little money to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a recent report carried out with the Australian National  
University, the Population Fund examined the effects of the 
18-month crisis on reproductive health, education and employment of 
women in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass unemployment has created a ``new poor,'' the Population  
Fund said. Unemployment is up and so is the number of school 
dropouts, with girls the most disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The recession has been especially hard on single mothers or  
women with heavy financial commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Women turning to prostitution, meanwhile, are likely to have  
limited education and resources and fail to protect themselves from 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yogyakarta, Indonesia, a clinic treating sexually transmitted  
diseases and AIDS reported that the number of patients had doubled 
in the nine-month period surveyed, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such health services are under pressure from government  
cutbacks. The Thai health ministry cut its AIDS budget by 24.7 
percent in 1998 compared to 5.5 percent in non-AIDS allocations, 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reduced access to reproductive health care appears to be leading  
to back-alley abortions to end unwanted pregnancy, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Publisher Pulliam Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eugene S. Pulliam, who started out  
delivering newspapers as a school boy and rose to be publisher of 
The Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News, has died. He was 
84. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam died Wednesday night, said Cynthia Whisler, funeral  
director at Crown Hill Funeral Home in Indianapolis. He had been 
ill for most of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, his nephew, said Thursday that  
Pulliam's ``sense of fairness and integrity were unmatched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam was a staunch defender of press freedom during a  
six-decade news career. In the early 1950s, he assailed the smear 
tactics of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a person deeply committed to making his newspapers good  
citizens of their communities,'' Quayle said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star won the Pulitzer Prize twice during his tenure as  
publisher, for investigations on police corruption and medical 
malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1991 interview, Pulliam said: ``I think newspapers will  
continue to be the only sizable check on government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Frank O'Bannon said Pulliam ``has been a towering figure in  
Indiana journalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam, while he had not been to the newspaper offices in  
several months, remained active in their operations by telephone, 
said Frank Caperton, executive editor of both papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive officer of The  
Associated Press, praised Pulliam's approach and dedication to 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over his long career, Gene Pulliam demonstrated a great  
understanding of the importance of both a free and a fair press,'' 
Boccardi said. ``It was fundamental to his approach to 
newspapering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam could be critical of the news media.  
</P>
<P>
	When he believed the press unfairly attacked Quayle during the  
1988 presidential campaign, Pulliam defended him in a post-election 
signed editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam was born Sept. 7, 1914, in Atchison, Kan., where his  
father, Eugene C. Pulliam, owned the Atchison Champion newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The family moved to Indiana after his father purchased the  
Franklin Evening Star, and the younger Pulliam got his first 
newspaper job as a grade school boy delivering papers for the 
Lebanon Reporter, which his father also purchased, and The News. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during summer vacation from study at DePauw University,  
he earned 5 cents an item writing news briefs for The Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene C. Pulliam by that time had began buying and selling  
newspapers all over the country and would own at least 50 during 
his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	At DePauw, the younger Pulliam became president of the Society  
of Professional Journalists, then known by the Greek letters Sigma 
Delta Chi, which was co-founded at DePauw by his father 25 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating in 1935, Pulliam joined United Press, which  
later became United Press International, working in the news 
service's bureaus in Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Indianapolis in 1936 to become news director at  
radio station WIRE, then also owned by his father, and became a 
familiar voice to central Indiana listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, he served four years in the Navy and later  
rose to the rank of lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he joined the Star, which his father had  
purchased in 1944, working as aviation editor, assistant city 
editor and city editor. When the elder Pulliam bought the afternoon 
News in 1948, Pulliam became the paper's managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, he served on a special committee of the American  
Society of Newspaper Editors formed to investigate McCarthy's 
attack on New York Post editor James Wechsler. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam concluded that the tactics of McCarthy, a central figure  
in the Communist scare of the 1950s, were ``not only a threat to 
the freedom of the press, but also a peril to America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, Pulliam became assistant publisher of The Star and The  
News, taking over as publisher of the papers when his father died 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years earlier, Pulliam was appointed executive vice  
president of Central Newspapers, the parent company of the Pulliam 
newspaper group and publisher of the Indianapolis newspapers, The 
Muncie Star and The Muncie Press -- later combined as the Star Press 
-- The Vincennes Sun-Commercial, the Topics Newspapers of suburban 
Indianapolis, the Alexandria (La.) Daily Town Talk, and in Arizona, 
The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, which ceased 
publication in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He was active in professional news organizations, serving on the  
board of The Associated Press Managing Editors and as president of 
the American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation. He also 
served on the advisory board of the American Press Institute and 
was a member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Jane, Pulliam is survived by daughters  
Myrta J. Pulliam, director of electronic news and information for 
Indianapolis Newspapers Inc., and Deborah S. Pulliam, a free-lance 
writer; son Russell B. Pulliam, editor of the News; half-sisters 
Corrine P. Quayle and Suzanne P. Murphy; and six grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Sets All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American manufacturers and farmers continued  
to be battered by the global financial crisis as the trade deficit 
surged to $15.5 billion in November. Exports of everything from 
passenger jets to soybeans declined. 
</P>
<P>
	With one month still to be counted, the Commerce Department  
reported Thursday that the deficit for 1998 has already hit an 
all-time high of $153.9 billion, surpassing the previous mark of 
$153.4 billion set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	When December's figures are in, economists are predicting the  
deficit will rise to around $168 billion, far exceeding 1997's 
deficit of $110 billion with further deterioration expected in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trade numbers are bad and getting worse. We are on track  
for another $50 billion to $60 billion increase in the deficit for 
this year,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist at the 
Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring deficit reflects the 18-month global currency crisis  
which has pushed more than one-third of the world into recession, 
cutting into American export sales. In addition, falling overseas 
currencies have made imports cheaper and resulted in a flood of 
steel, cars and other foreign products attracted into the United 
States by a strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand is sluggish in every region,'' said Jerry Jasinwoski,  
head of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``Asia and 
Russia remain in deep recession. Latin America is struggling to 
avoid an Asia-type collapse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, hoping to counteract growing protectionist  
pressures, announced in his State of the Union address that the 
United States would take the lead in pushing for a new global round 
of trade liberalization talks. 
</P>
<P>
	But to achieve that goal he will need Congress to authorize the  
negotiations under a process known as fast track, something 
Congress has refused to grant in the past two years because of 
heavy opposition from labor unions and environmental groups who 
argue that Clinton's free trade policies have failed to protect 
workers' jobs in the United States or the environment of developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Free trade supporters only want more of a bad thing,'' said  
Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. ``Fast track will mean higher deficits, 
higher unemployment and a weaker economy in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists estimate that the trade deficit subtracted  
1.5 percentage points from economic growth last year. But even with 
the drag from the rising deficit, the U.S. economy still expanded 
at a healthy annual rate of around 4 percent as strong consumer 
demand, aided by falling interest rates, offset lost export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the rising deficit, the administration itself has  
taken a tougher line regarding one key industry, steel, threatening 
to file a government case against Japan unless steel imports from 
that country show ``substantial declines'' in December. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior administration official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said Thursday that preliminary figures indicated there 
was a significant drop in hot-rolled steel imports from Japan in 
December, reflecting in part the fact that Japan, Russia and Brazil 
all rushed to get that product into the country in November ahead 
of a deadline for imposing higher tariffs if the U.S. steel 
industry prevails in a dumping case it has brought. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first 11 months of this year, steel imports from Japan  
are up 78 percent, a surge that has contributed to a 15 percent 
widening of America's trade gap with Japan, which totaled $58.2 
billion through the first 11 months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the entire Pacific Rim region, epicenter of the crisis that  
began in Thailand in July 1997, the U.S. trade deficit is up a 
sharp 34 percent to $148.7 billion through November. But in a 
glimmer of hope, U.S. exports to South Korea rose to $1.6 billion, 
the best showing since December 1997, when that country was plunged 
into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports overall in November rose 0.4 percent to an all-time high  
of $94.1 billion. This reflected big increases in imports of 
computer chips, telecommunications equipment, autos and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports fell 1.9 percent to $78.7 billion as sales of farm  
products such as soybeans, rice and wheat declined. Sales of 
manufactured goods including commercial aircraft, computer 
equipment, computer chips and telecommunications products were down 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	While bad, America's trade performance would have looked much  
worse in 1998 if it had not been for a big drop in the world price 
of crude oil, which is down 34 percent from 1997 levels. First 
Union economist David Orr estimated that without the drop in price 
and a smaller 8 percent fall in U.S. demand, America's trade 
deficit would have been $19 billion higher through November.

<HEADLINE> Annual Sundance Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's a documentary about a gritty subject and  
almost no one has seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a showing at this week's Sundance Film Festival,  
``American Pimp'' could capture a distribution deal worth big bucks 
-- and its creators are hoping to milk the opportunity for every 
potential penny. 
</P>
<P>
	``We held out showing it to any distributors to put it in a  
friendly situation for us as far as getting the best price,'' said 
Allen Hughes, who has teamed with his brother to make the film as 
well as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Dead Presidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we've gotten great offers, you don't know how  
great they are until you get them all in one room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sundance, held each year in Utah, is the nation's top showcase  
for independent films. Overrun by Hollywood players, entertainment 
reporters and publicists, it's a festival where buzz leads to more 
buzz, which leads to more hype, which leads to film studios paying 
millions of dollars for films -- something they may or may not 
regret in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, for instance, Miramax spent a staggering $6 million  
for ``Next Stop, Wonderland,'' which grossed only $3.4 million in 
North American theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	But for every bust, there are deals like the reported $1 million  
spent last year by Artisan Entertainment for ``Pi,'' which grossed 
$3.2 million, making it one of the year's most profitable indie 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	With such potential for success, it's no wonder the festival was  
inundated with entries. A record 840 feature films were submitted 
for the 16 slots in the highly coveted dramatic competition. Others 
were chosen for exhibition outside the competition. The festival 
also includes documentaries, foreign films and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	At this movie marketplace, films that have no business going for  
so much money end up going for big bucks, all in the frenzied hope 
of finding that next ``Shine'' or ``sex, lies &AMP; videotape'' or 
striking a multi-picture deal with the next Quentin Tarantino. 
</P>
<P>
	While the festival provides a major boost to fledgling film  
producers, it can also mark the birth -- or rebirth -- of a 
performer's career. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Ally Sheedy was considered by many to be a has-been  
actress of the '80s ``Brat Pack.'' But after Sundance critics 
heaped praise on her daring performance as a drug addict in ``High 
Art,'' her star was back on the rise. Now she's a contender for an 
Oscar nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say that Sundance has played a major role in my  
life,'' Miss Sheedy said. ``What's the last year been like? 
Dumbfounded, blindsided and flabbergasted are words that seem 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sundance was essentially born in 1985 when Robert Redford's  
Sundance Institute, which fosters independent filmmaking, took the 
reins of what was then called the U.S. Film Festival. It adopted 
the Sundance name in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	It has gotten so big that one festival isn't enough anymore. The  
alternative Slamdance, now in its fifth year, selected 14 features 
out of 1,716 entries. When it started, only 43 films were entered. 
There are still other alternative film festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the centerpiece is Sundance. It starts today Salt Lake City  
with the premiere of Robert Altman's ``Cookie's Fortune,'' then 
moves to the nearby ski resort of Park City through Jan. 31. It 
will feature 114 films, including 69 premieres. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone expects film producers to have their checkbooks ready.  
Although ``Wonderland'' fizzled, Miramax has scored with numerous 
independent films picked up at Sundance and other festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miramax is the kind of company, when we see something we love,  
we will probably be the most aggressive and passionate company on 
the block,'' said acquisitions executive Amy Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sheedy will be in Park City to help promote another movie  
generating early excitement, ``Sugar Town,'' a story of Hollywood 
hustling and double-dealing, with Miss Sheedy as a production 
designer and Rosanna Arquette as an actress. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Sugar Town'' and many other films tantalizingly unknown,  
the anticipation is building. So is the stress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not allowed anybody to see the film,'' said Tim Roth,  
who directed the family drama ``The War Zone,'' which acquisitions 
people are watching carefully. ``I see (the screening) as very 
nerve-racking. A lot of the crew is coming out. Financiers will be 
there. If it goes wrong, I can just sort of go and hide.''

<HEADLINE> Brack Opens Defense of IRL Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Kenny Brack isn't bothered by the  
fact that he's little known outside the auto racing community. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion of the Indy Racing League just wants to  
pick up where he left off last year when he won three races and 
gave team owner A.J. Foyt his second IRL title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his success last year, little has changed for the Swede.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like my normal self,'' Brack said. ``I don't feel I'm  
going to change, no matter what happens. I don't look at myself as 
a star, so I'm not concerned that people aren't treating me like 
one. I don't expect I'm going to suddenly change personality and 
become a spoiled guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brack and teammate Billy Boat head the entry list for the  
season-opening Indy 200 Sunday at Walt Disney World Speedway.

	``At Disney, the key is staying out of trouble,'' Brack said of  
the one-mile, nearly-flat oval. ``Normally, at the first race of 
the year, guys come back and tend to get a little excited and 
things happen. And the traffic at this place is unforgiving, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brack, whose background is mostly European road racing,  
including a turn in Formula 3000 -- just a step below Formula One -- 
is just as low key about his quick success on the IRL ovals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I would win races when I went with A.J.,'' he said.  
``To predict in the beginning of the season that you'll win a 
championship is hard, but I have always said that if you win races, 
you'll have a shot at the championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Brack and his team head into the 11-race season with  
confidence, there is one big change. Crew chief John King, a 
longtime Foyt employee, has left the team. He has been replaced by 
Billy Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``John decided he wanted to take it easy, but Billy's been with  
the team a long time,'' Brack said. ``I'm not worried about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people find Brack and Foyt to be an odd pairing.  
</P>
<P>
	Brack is quiet, slow to anger and sophisticated in manner. Foyt  
-- once the most famous driver in the world -- at 63 is still fiery, 
brash and sporting a Texas twang. 
</P>
<P>
	``People that don't know A.J. think he's got a reputation of  
being difficult,'' Brack said. ``If he takes a liking to you, he 
treats you very well. And, really, our backgrounds are somewhat 
similar. We both started with zero -- no family money -- and we both 
made it on our own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first priority for both of us is we want to win. The will  
to win is everything. It helps us communicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boat also won his first IRL race last year, and he is expected  
to be a contender for the title currently held by his teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among others who could be contenders this season are Scott  
Sharp, who gave Foyt a share (with Buzz Calkins) of the first IRL 
title in 1996, Scott Goodyear, Buddy Lazier, Jeff Ward, Mark 
Dismore, Davey Hamilton, Robbie Buhl and Greg Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray and Sam Schmidt will both be in the spotlight beginning with  
Friday's opening practice as they move into seats left vacant by 
key veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is replacing former IRL champion Tony Stewart at Team  
Menard. Stewart has moved to NASCAR's Winston Cup series, although 
he might run in the IRL's Indianapolis 500 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt is replacing two-time Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk at  
Treadway Racing. Luyendyk, the IRL's first big name, will run only 
at Indianapolis this year before retiring from open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Among others present this week will be 1998 Indy winner Eddie  
Cheever, as well as veterans Calkins, John Paul Jr., Stephan 
Gregoire, Eliseo Salazar, Raul Boesel and Robert Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Auto Club short track star Jason Leffler is scheduled to  
make his IRL debut here.

<HEADLINE> Seedling Shortage Hits Landowners / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, S.C. (AP) -- Steve Cantrell's minivan idles along row  
after row of raised topsoil beds containing millions of tree 
seedlings, each poking about a foot high to make the beds stretch 
like strips of plush green carpet to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	As he drives along, however, the supervisor of the state-run  
Taylor Forest Tree Nursery near Trenton notes where the beds are 
marred by splotches of brown dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter it was floods. This summer and fall it was drought.  
The result is dead pine seedlings, just as a strong economy and 
soaring timber prices have landowners demanding more young trees to 
plant on cleared land. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantrell says he gets calls daily from landowners wanting  
seedlings. Spindly loblolly pine seedlings cost $36 per thousand; 
hardy white and longleaf pine seedlings cost twice that much. Most 
years he can fill orders, even from those who wait until the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he said, ``landowners may have to wait,  
unfortunately, until next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are landowners like J.M. Pendarvis, who spent more than  
$50,000 to prepare about 220 acres near Edgefield for planting this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not holding out too much hope,'' he says. ``If we don't  
get the seedlings, we'll lose all these acres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pendarvis owns about 2,500 acres around Edgefield and Estill.  
After calling state nurseries and timber companies across the 
Southeast for more than a month, he finally found seedlings this 
week. He had to travel to Statesboro, Ga., to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get some rain, and we get them in the ground pretty soon,  
we should just squeak by,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearing each acre costs about $200. Pendarvis says that if he  
did not find the seedlings, he would have lost about $55 an acre, 
$12,000 overall, by fertilizing land that would have gone unused. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department says about 5,000 acres of  
nonindustrial private forest land in South Carolina need replanting 
at a cost of about $625,000. Those who own such land can sell the 
timber but cannot make forest-related products, like furniture or 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a loblolly pine about 35 years to mature fully, while  
white and longleaf pines take a few years longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The seedling supply has been tight for the past few years as a  
strong economy has increased demand for timber, said Guy 
SanFratello, who retired in December as head of the Forestry 
Commission division that includes its tree nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices of timber also surprises Ray Moody, SanFratello's  
replacement. The cost of 1,000 board feet of timber, an industry 
standard, averaged $291 this past year, down from $337 the year 
before but still up from $274 five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, SanFratello cannot remember the combination of demand and  
weather creating a seedling shortage this severe in his 30 years in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortage also will keep some landowners from getting state  
and federal subsidies that can run to 40 percent of the cost of 
planting. Almost 300 South Carolina landowners get the subsidies 
covering about 16,000 acres, said Pete Bischoff, a senior staff 
forester at the Forestry Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Forestry consultant Kent Parris said he approached timber  
companies like Bowater, International Paper and Union Camp for 
about 500 acres of seedlings for his clients, but those companies 
were struggling to plant their own lands.

<HEADLINE> Stakes Rise Over Budget Surpluses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's call to divide federal  
budget surpluses among Social Security, Medicare and other programs 
is emboldening Republicans itching to use some of it for big tax 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did last year, Clinton still is insisting that surpluses  
be reserved until Social Security is revamped so it can provide 
baby boomers' benefits when they retire beginning in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But his acknowledgment that surpluses over the next 15 years --  
projected at a gigantic $4.4 trillion by the White House -- will be 
big enough to also beef up other programs has changed the political 
dynamic. Many Republicans said Wednesday that portions of the 
surpluses should be used for cutting taxes, or else Clinton will 
simply spend them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not for freezing all of the surplus for Social  
Security,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., among several 
conservatives who unsuccessfully pressed Senate GOP leaders last 
year to offer large tax reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight over federal surpluses, perhaps this year's most  
overarching legislative issue, was altered last week when Senate 
Republican budget analysts estimated that federal surpluses over 
the next decade could be $600 billion larger than was expected just 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's comments again have reshaped the debate. It has  
changed from whether to use hundreds of billions of dollars for 
programs other than Social Security to a struggle over which ones 
will benefit -- tax cuts Republicans want or domestic spending 
Democrats prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton declared, ``Save Social Security first.''  
That became code for leaving surpluses untouched until Democrats 
and Republicans agree on girding Social Security for the impending 
retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the political popularity of the pension program for  
the elderly, the line effectively blocked Republicans from winning 
tax cuts. It did not, however, prevent Clinton and Republicans from 
pushing a huge spending package through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton  
repeated his plea to fix Social Security before anything else. But 
he added a new twist, saying only 62 percent of the $4.4 trillion 
in surpluses expected over the next 15 years is needed to bolster 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest -- about $1.7 trillion -- should be spent on Medicare,  
new retirement accounts, and defense and domestic programs, Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials emphasize that the president would still  
oppose using any of the surplus for anything until a Social 
Security cure is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's words gave many Republicans political cover for  
proposing to use the remaining $1.7 trillion mostly for tax cuts, 
and perhaps for other purposes like defense and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference'' between last year and this, said  
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a moderate who has moved from opposing 
tax cuts last year to favoring them now. ``We'd be in an untenable 
position if we didn't save some of it (the surplus) for taxpayers, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such comments are crucial because skepticism among moderate  
Republican senators helped kill last year's GOP tax reduction 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Other moderates, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said  
Wednesday that they still prefer narrow tax cuts to broad ones. But 
GOP leaders, united behind an across-the-board 10 percent income 
tax cut, believe they will have more Republican support for cutting 
taxes than they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, particularly liberals, might also be more  
inclined this year to insist on using surpluses to increase 
spending on domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Democrats questioned Wednesday said they still wanted  
to heed Clinton's call to leave surpluses alone until Social 
Security's problems are solved. They realize their party's claim to 
protect the program is a valuable political tool to use against 
Republicans, especially looking ahead to a 2000 election in which 
they have a chance to recapture control of the House.

<HEADLINE>  Crash May End Ortlieb's Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- A terrifying crash Thursday on the  
dangerous Streif course might have ended the career of Patrick 
Ortlieb of Austria, the former Olympic and world downhill champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb fractured his right thigh, dislocated his right hip and  
sustained neck bruises in a practice run for a downhill 
doubleheader Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian, who won the Kitzbuehel downhill in 1994, lost his  
balance in the final corner of one of the most treacherous courses 
on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the Hausbergkante corner at a speed of about 60 mph,  
Ortlieb cartwheeled and smashed into the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated on the scene before being taken by helicopter to  
a hospital. Later, Ortlieb was flown to a hospital in Innsbruck for 
emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb won the Olympic downhill at the 1992 Games and the world  
title in 1996. He was fourth at the 1994 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The severity of the injuries appeared likely to end the career  
of Ortlieb, who had been thinking of retiring after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb also crashed badly at Wengen, Switzerland, last weekend,  
injuring his back and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ortlieb's accident, Frederic Marin-Cudraz of France also  
crashed at the same spot and was hospitalized with torn ligaments 
in his left knee. He will miss the rest of the season. He is the 
fourth French downhiller to be injured this season, including 
Olympic champion Jean-Luc Cretier. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's crashes came at the same spot where Brian Stemmle of  
Canada tore shoulder ligaments in a spill Wednesday, ending his 
season. Stemmle was nearly killed on the Streif 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus of Norway, winner of three downhill races this  
season, posted the fastest time in practice for downhills Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, the 1996 overall World Cup champion who is recovering from  
a lung infection, won the longest downhill on the circuit in 
Wengen, then took third in a slalom to win the season's first 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	A repeat of last weekend's performance could vault Kjus past  
overall World Cup leader Hermann Maier in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, bothered by a sore back and racing the Streif for the  
first time, will carry the added burden of thousands of demanding 
home fans, who will descend on the tiny village for the weekend 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the defending overall world champion who has made the  
World Cup downhill title a goal this season, leads the overrall 
with 1,021 points, 169 ahead of Kjus. The roles are reversed in the 
downhill standings, where Kjus leads with 380, with Maier 120 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier was 10th in Thursday's final practice.

<HEADLINE> End of Lockout Means New Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- When Tim Floyd conducts his first  
practice as coach of the Chicago Bulls, most of the players 
responsible for the last three NBA titles will be miles away from 
the Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	They've retired, gone to the golf course and to the training  
camps of new teams. Those left behind are still adjusting and might 
be doing so all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a weird, weird feeling,'' guard Randy Brown said  
Wednesday when the NBA lockout was officially settled, paving the 
way for training camps to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team we had the last three years is no longer here. You  
don't want to think it's true, but obviously it's going to come to 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan has retired, and Dennis Rodman said Wednesday he  
plans to play elsewhere this year, one day after saying he would 
take a year off. Scottie Pippen is headed to Houston after he signs 
with the Bulls and is then dealt to the Rockets. Steve Kerr is off 
to San Antonio, Luc Longley to Phoenix and Jud Buechler to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler, a reserve on three straight title teams, will sign a  
two-year, $1.7 million deal with the Pistons, his agent, Mark 
Bartelstein, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's left? Toni Kukoc, Brown, Ron Harper and Keith Booth, four  
Bulls who were under contract. And veteran Bill Wennington who is 
also expected to sign and return. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper would like to leave, as well. But at 35 and with a $5.2  
million payment coming to him this season in the final year of a 
contract, there won't be many takers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron's contract makes it difficult for him to be traded,'' his  
agent, Mark Termini, said Wednesday. ``He's prepared to go to camp. 
We anticipate him being a Bull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one is more ready to go to camp and conduct a practice than  
Floyd, who's been waiting since last summer to coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will be in a hurry-up mode. They have four practices  
and a Friday scrimmage before opening their limited exhbition 
season Sunday against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was just happy to finally converse with his players for  
the first time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a relief to know it's behind us. We have an  
opportunity to sit down and visit with players and talk to players, 
which is what this is all about,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	His first roster will be a mix of veterans, relative unknowns  
and a few familiar faces. Some will know the triangle offense that 
Floyd is expected to continue; others will be lost. Victories will 
be rare in a shortened season, where the purpose is apparently to 
prepare for next summer when the team goes free-agent hunting with 
salary cap room. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown played his first four seasons with the Sacramento Kings,  
who were chronic losers, but said this situation is entirely 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacramento was not used to winning. They were complacent.  
We're the Chicago Bulls, and everybody is being shipped out,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to see them go. We're coming in with a bunch of  
young guys who have to learn our system two weeks before our first 
game. It's going to be unusual, it's definitely going to be 
something new to me. It's hard, looking at all these different 
faces. But it's my job.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Worker Pulled From Trench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cold and dirty, a construction worker who had  
been buried for nearly eight hours smiled broadly as he was pulled 
from a deep trench to the cheers of 175 rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The worker, identified by friends as Arturo Garcia, talked to  
rescue crews and clutched the hands of others as he was strapped to 
a stretcher and taken to a hospital just before midnight Wednesday. 
He suffered cuts and bruises and was in good condition today at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing he said was, `I feel fine, thank you,''' said  
Mark Eckstein, medical director of the Los Angeles City Fire 
Department. ``He was awake and alert and said he was cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was helping place a 54-inch pipeline for Mladen-Buntich,  
a company under contract for the Department of Water and Power, 
said utility spokesman Walter Zeisl. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction crew was placing the last 200 yards of a  
13-mile project when the trench collapsed about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers had to shore up walls of the trench to prevent a  
further collapse while crews used a machine called an ``air 
knife,'' which works like a big vacuum, to suck dirt out. Others 
carried dirt out with buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia had been buried over his head several times during the  
rescue, and crews feared they had lost him, said city fire Capt. 
Steve Resnick. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when we uncovered his head, he began moving and the crews  
were re-energized,'' Resnick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not immediately know what caused the walls to  
collapse at the construction site in Pacoima, about 10 miles north 
of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Pacific railroad and Metrolink trains that run on  
tracks near the construction site were stopped out of fear that 
vibration could cause further collapse of the trench. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar accident last month in Tennessee severely injured  
construction worker Darby Wayne Patrick. He was rescued after being 
buried for 15 hours in a sewer trench. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick, 26, remains in critical condition today in Erlanger  
Medical Center in Chattanooga. He suffered damage to his pelvis and 
legs and his lungs filled with fluid, and it's too soon to say 
whether he'll make a full recovery, his physicians have said.

<HEADLINE> Survivor To Testify in Gun Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Fox remembers warning his friend never to  
point his new pistol at him again. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, the teen-ager pulled out the weapon he bought  
from an illegal gun peddler and it went off, firing a bullet into 
Fox's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is the sole survivor among seven shooting victims named as  
plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to hold gun manufacturers -- not 
the shooters -- responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the massive tobacco litigation, which pressured cigarette  
companies to pay for some costs of treating sick smokers, 
plaintiffs in this case want to force gun makers pay the costs of 
treating gunshot victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is an important test for the firearms industry. The  
cities of Chicago and New Orleans already have filed suits seeking 
millions for responding to gun-related crimes, and other 
municipalities are thinking of filing similar claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began earlier this month in Brooklyn federal  
court, lawyers for the plaintiffs have argued that gunmakers should 
be liable because they negligently marketed their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Fox testified how he had observed a man lure his  
friend over to a blue Oldsmobile. The man said he had just returned 
from ``down south'' and had something to show him, Fox said. Out of 
the trunk, he said, came a small black pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony was meant to bolster plaintiffs' central theory --  
that the firearms industry is ``collectively liable'' for shootings 
by oversupplying southern states, which have lenient gun laws, 
knowing the excess will end up in the hands of criminals in states 
with stricter gun laws -- like New York -- via gunrunners. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs contend that nearly half the guns used in crimes  
in New York in recent years have came from Georgia, Florida, 
Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein cautioned jurors that Fox's  
version of what the gun peddler said about the weapon -- which was 
not recovered -- was not evidence that it came from the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing more than three dozen defendants,  
including Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Colt's Manufacturing Co. and Sturm, 
Ruger &AMP; Co., argue that blaming the industry for the illegal use of 
a legal product is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry executives, they add, comply with federal and local gun  
regulations, contract only with reputable distributors and supply 
markets based on legitimate demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-spoken Fox, 19, described how on Nov. 14, 1994, as he  
gathered with neighborhood kids after school, his friend raised ``a 
black object.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the gun went off, Fox said he remembers falling to the  
ground, blacking out, then waking up in his mother's arms. After 
surgery, Fox said he had to relearn how to walk, feed himself, even 
read and write. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like I just forgot everything,'' he said. ``It's like it  
just spilled out of my head.''

<HEADLINE> Churchill Downs To Buy Calder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Although attendance at Calder Race Course has  
declined for each of the past nine years, the track nonetheless has 
plenty of fans -- including Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisville-based company strengthened its simulcasting  
network Thursday by signing an agreement to purchase Calder for $86 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is part of Churchill Downs' effort to expand its live  
thoroughbred racing operations. Along with the company's flagship 
track in Louisville, Churchill Downs also operates tracks in 
Henderson, Ky., and Anderson, Ind., and holds a minority interest 
in a track in Franklin, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Calder is another step toward developing a  
comprehensive international simulcasting wagering network, said 
Thomas H. Meeker, president and chief executive officer of 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The simulcasting customer will see an entirely different  
product -- a continuity that doesn't currently exist in the 
industry,'' Meeker said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquiring a Florida-based track, Meeker said, also strengthens  
Churchill Downs' ability to ``build competitive race fields 
throughout our racing operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeker declined to address rumors that Churchill Downs may also  
buy South Florida's premier thoroughbred track, Gulfstream Park . 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of Calder was unanimously approved by Churchill  
Downs' board of directors. The deal is subject to approval by the 
Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, and 
Churchill Downs expects to close toward the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
	Calder's seven-month meet runs from the end of May to the first  
of the year. The track opened in 1971 and has been owned since 1992 
by Kawasaki Steel of Japan through the company's subsidiary, K 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a dozen companies recently made offers to buy the  
track from Kawasaki, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeker said no major changes are planned at Calder. The decline  
in attendance mirrors a nationwide trend in the sport, and the 
track nonetheless made a $10 million profit in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Calder is a well-managed track, but we believe we have the  
capability to make it better,'' said Robert L. Decker, executive 
vice president and chief financial officer of Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Calder faces competition from two other South Florida tracks and  
four major professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a much more difficult job than we enjoyed in, say,  
Louisville, Ky.,'' Meeker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, Churchill Downs purchased Ellis Park in Henderson,  
Ky., for $22 million. Meeker defended the strategy of expansion by 
Churchill Downs, a public company. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not convinced the thoroughbred industry is on the  
uptake, you ought to step off the bus right now,'' he said. 
``There's a new sense of energy in every corner of racing. Instead 
of doomsday talk, there's a lot of excitement in the industry and 
in our customer base.''

<P>
	``Churchill Downs is the leader in the thoroughbred industry,''  
Calder president Ken Dunn said. ``They clearly have an excellent 
plan, and I'm glad Calder can be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calder opened in 1971 and has been owned since 1992 by Kawasaki  
Steel of Japan through the company's subsidiary, K Corp. Kawasaki 
took over from Kentucky horse breeder Bertram Firestone, who faced 
foreclosure on loans secured by the track. Kawasaki was the 
creditor.

</P>
<P>
	The sale of Calder is the third involving a thoroughbred track  
in the past two months. Santa Anita was purchased by Canadian 
industrialist Frank Stronach, and Keeneland formed an alliance with 
two companies that specialize in lotteries and gambling casinos to 
buy Turfway Park in Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics Trade McIlvaine to Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics traded center Jim  
McIlvaine to the New Jersey Nets on Thursday for center-forward 
Michael Cage and forward Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	Cage, 36, played for the Sonics from 1988 to 1994. The 14-year  
NBA veteran led the league in rebounding in 1987-88, averaging 13 
rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLean, 29, is a six-year NBA veteran and averaged a  
career-high 18.2 points for the Washington Bullets in 1993-94 when 
he was voted the league's Most Improved Player. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, 26, signed with the Sonics as a free agent in 1996.  
He averaged 3.2 points and 3.3 rebounds per game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade had been rumored for days and was finally completed  
after the NBA lockout settlement was finalized.

<HEADLINE> $6M in Funding for Coffee Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Millions of Americans know the therapy a  
cup of coffee can deliver early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Vanderbilt University say it's possible coffee  
could do more, perhaps even help people who suffer from depression 
and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	``People drink coffee because they like it or they like the way  
it makes them feel,'' Peter Martin, director of Vanderbilt 
University's Addiction Center, said Wednesday. ``My suggestion is 
that we really don't know what causes those effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt is scheduled to open its Institute for Coffee Studies  
within the next six months, thanks to $6 million in funding from 
trade groups in leading coffee-producing nations in Latin America, 
including Brazil and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have suggested coffee can help relieve depression,  
treat alcoholism and prevent colorectal cancer. The institute's 
mission is to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to help people get over the idea that coffee is  
caffeine,'' said Martin, who will head the institute. ``Caffeine 
actually is a very small component of coffee. There are a lot of 
other components in coffee that are not very well understood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have suggested that caffeine might slightly boost  
blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edward Giovannucci, an assistant professor of medicine at  
the Harvard Medical School, said most Americans have nothing to 
worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent a year reviewing medical literature on the health  
benefits of coffee drinking and found the risk of colorectal cancer 
drops 24 percent among those who drink four or more cups of coffee 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't tell people to go out and start drinking coffee,''  
Giovannucci said. ``But there isn't much harm in drinking coffee.''

<HEADLINE> End of Lockout Means New Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- When Tim Floyd conducts his first  
practice as coach of the Chicago Bulls, most of the players 
responsible for the last three NBA titles will be miles away from 
the Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	They've retired, gone to the golf course and to the training  
camps of new teams. Those left behind are still adjusting and might 
be doing so all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a weird, weird feeling,'' guard Randy Brown said  
Wednesday when the NBA lockout was officially settled, paving the 
way for training camps to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team we had the last three years is no longer here. You  
don't want to think it's true, but obviously it's going to come to 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan has retired, and Dennis Rodman said Wednesday he  
plans to play elsewhere this year, one day after saying he would 
take a year off. Scottie Pippen is headed to Houston after he signs 
with the Bulls and is then dealt to the Rockets. Steve Kerr is off 
to San Antonio, Luc Longley to Phoenix and Jud Buechler to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler, a reserve on three straight title teams, will sign a  
two-year, $1.7 million deal with the Pistons, his agent, Mark 
Bartelstein, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's left? Toni Kukoc, Brown, Ron Harper and Keith Booth, four  
Bulls who were under contract. And veteran Bill Wennington who is 
also expected to sign and return. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper would like to leave, as well. But at 35 and with a $5.2  
million payment coming to him this season in the final year of a 
contract, there won't be many takers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron's contract makes it difficult for him to be traded,'' his  
agent, Mark Termini, said Wednesday. ``He's prepared to go to camp. 
We anticipate him being a Bull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one is more ready to go to camp and conduct a practice than  
Floyd, who's been waiting since last summer to coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will be in a hurry-up mode. They have four practices  
and a Friday scrimmage before opening their limited exhbition 
season Sunday against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was just happy to finally converse with his players for  
the first time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a relief to know it's behind us. We have an  
opportunity to sit down and visit with players and talk to players, 
which is what this is all about,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	His first roster will be a mix of veterans, relative unknowns  
and a few familiar faces. Some will know the triangle offense that 
Floyd is expected to continue; others will be lost. Victories will 
be rare in a shortened season, where the purpose is apparently to 
prepare for next summer when the team goes free-agent hunting with 
salary cap room. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown played his first four seasons with the Sacramento Kings,  
who were chronic losers, but said this situation is entirely 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacramento was not used to winning. They were complacent.  
We're the Chicago Bulls, and everybody is being shipped out,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to see them go. We're coming in with a bunch of  
young guys who have to learn our system two weeks before our first 
game. It's going to be unusual, it's definitely going to be 
something new to me. It's hard, looking at all these different 
faces. But it's my job.''

	White House Sums Up Defense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. Dale Bumpers defended his longtime  
friend today, telling the Senate that President Clinton was guilty 
of a ``terrible moral lapse'' with Monica Lewinsky but not of 
conduct warranting or even permitting his removal from office. 
``You can censure Bill Clinton. You can hand him over to 
prosecutors. But you cannot convict,'' Bumpers said in an hour's 
defense summation concluding six days of opening trial 
presentations by both sides. Beginning tomorrow, senators will be 
permitted to ask questions of House prosecutors and Clinton's legal

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government backed down  
and froze an expulsion order against the American head of the peace 
monitors in Kosovo. The reversal came hours after Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright warned that the entire 750-person 
monitoring team would be pulled out of Kosovo unless President 
Slobodan Milosevic allowed William Walker to remain. The removal of 
the monitors would probably have meant the end of the tottering 
cease-fire between Milosevic's forces and ethnic Albanian 
separatists and could have paved the way for NATO airstrikes 
against Yugoslavia.

oppression and fraud,'' and contributed to the shortening of 
Goodrich's life. Aetna said it would appeal.

	Nearly 5 Tons of Cocaine Seized  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In one of the biggest cocaine busts in U.S.  
history, authorities seized nearly five tons of the drug aboard a 
freighter delivering iron ore from Brazil. The Coast Guard found 
9,500 pounds of cocaine -- an estimated street value of $186 million 
-- during an inspection at sea last week of the 580-foot Cannes, a 
Greek-owned, Panamanian-registered cargo ship. The cocaine seizure 
was one of the nation's 10 largest, Transportation Secretary Rodney 
Slater said today.

	TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) -- A judge convicted the elder brother of  
Mexico's former president of ordering the murder of a top 
politician and sentenced him to 50 years in prison today. Raul

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The government is talking with  
U.S. officials on the possibility of making the dollar Argentina's 
official currency, the central bank president said today. Pedro Pou 
said talks have been going on since July as the government seeks 
ways to protect the economy from future financial turmoil. It was 
the first time Pou has publicly referred to the talks, and his 
comments appeared aimed at quieting rumors that Brazil's troubles 
were prompting Argentina to consider ``dollarizing'' its economy.

rose 106.65 points to 14,352.07 points in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. In New York, stock prices fell sharply as investors raced 
to take profits in Internet shares and concerns mounted about 
Brazil. The Dow fell 71.83 to close at 9,264.08. On the NYSE, 
decliners led advancers 1,938-1,130. The Nasdaq was down 70.67 at

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Knicks officially announced today they  
traded John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings to the Golden 
State Warriors for three-time All-Star Latrell Sprewell. Sprewell 
was expected to join the team tomorrow. He was not at a practice 
tonight at which 13 players showed up. Sprewell will be paid $17.3 
million for the two years left on his contract.

<HEADLINE> Enemies Are Civil at Abortion Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For the past two weeks, bitter enemies who  
are normally divided by barricades have sat side by side in court, 
separated only by a $200 million lawsuit and a tense and awkward 
civility. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed by Planned Parenthood and several abortion  
doctors, who contend that posters and a Web site listing the 
doctors' home addresses and branding them ``Guilty of Crimes 
Against Humanity'' are a veiled invitation to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Web site, called The Nuremberg Files, readers are asked  
to send in names, addresses, photos and personal details about 
abortion doctors, whose names are crossed off when they are killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than a dozen defendants contend the posters and the  
site are constitutionally protected political speech. 
</P>
<P>
	In the courtroom, people with blue blazers and Bibles share  
benches with those wearing ponytails and nose rings. When their 
paths cross, they avert their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	During a break last week, the elevator going down from the  
15th-floor courtroom quickly filled with anti-abortion activists. A 
lawyer for the abortion doctors got on, then thought better of it 
and backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could put a pointy hat and shoes on that woman and she'd  
look more natural,'' one man drawled after the doors closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, now. Be nice,'' another replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite two weeks of close proximity, the two sides have, in  
fact, been nice. Tight security and a no-nonsense judge have kept 
it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking is prohibited within a block of the downtown courthouse.  
A pair of police officers on horseback circle the block for any 
hint of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a couple of sign-carrying anti-abortion protesters have  
appeared, although there were rumblings of a larger protest Friday, 
the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the courthouse, rich with black marble, wood paneling and  
chrome, there is no sign of discord. Supporters of each side are 
forced to sit together because the courtroom has only four rows of 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand, defendant Joseph Foreman denied he has ever  
advocated violence. And although he testified he had nothing to do 
with the creation of the poster or the Web site, he said neither 
constitutes a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is America,'' Foreman said. ``Does the First Amendment  
apply or not? I say it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense attorneys have tried to show that the Web site had  
no connection to the defendants, calling to stand Otis O'Neal 
Horsley Jr., a 54-year-old computer programmer from Carrollton, 
Ga., who claimed he alone has control over its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is between me and God,'' Horsley testified, then turned  
toward the defendants and said: ``I don't know these people!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, however, one of the defendants, Michael Dodds,  
acknowledged his role in creating The Nuremberg Files, saying he 
was collecting evidence against abortion doctors so they can one 
day be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the trial, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones has  
presided sternly. When a defense witness last week responded to a 
question by asking: ``What do you mean by `truthful'?'' Jones 
erupted in anger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truthful means truthful!'' he yelled. ``This is not a Clinton  
deposition!''

<HEADLINE> Feds Seize Nearly 5 Tons of Cocaine </HEADLINE>

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In one of the biggest cocaine busts in U.S.  
history, authorities seized nearly five tons of the drug aboard a 
freighter delivering iron ore from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard found 9,500 pounds of cocaine -- an estimated

</P>
<P>
	``This amount of cocaine could put at least one dose of the drug

	Coast Guard officials boarded the ship and accompanied it to  
Texas, where it arrived Wednesday.

<P>
	Marilyn Hebinck, a lawyer representing the ship owner's insurer,  
declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco States Heap Scorn on Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco company executives and officials in  
states dependent on the crop had nothing but scorn for President 
Clinton's threatened lawsuit against cigarette makers and an 
increased tobacco tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is under siege,'' Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton said  
Wednesday. ``There's a limit to what this product can bear, and 
we're coming close to that limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton was among representatives from 11 tobacco states and four  
companies who discussed Clinton's speech as they met in Durham to 
work out plans for a $5.15 billion trust fund to assist farmers 
hurt by the settlement of state lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, Clinton said the  
federal government would follow the lead of states and sue tobacco 
companies to recover health care costs of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	States won $246 billion, mostly through lawsuit settlements,  
plus new restrictions on tobacco ads and other industry practices. 
Federal attorneys have studied the states' strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials insisted Wednesday that the decision  
was made after they determined the government has legal grounds to 
make its case. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Payne, senior vice president of R.J. Reynolds, said  
Clinton apparently wants ``more money from the industry and some 
political gain from the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government already makes more money per pack on  
cigarettes than the companies make,'' he said. ``The federal 
government makes 24 cents per pack, and R.J. Reynolds makes 9 or 10 
cents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Carlton, a tobacco industry lawyer, said the companies  
would fight any federal suit ``to the last day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's any federal lawsuit, if new taxes are added by  
Congress, it will have a terrible impact on the industry,'' he 
said. Cigarette makers called the potential federal suit 
``political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the lawsuit is independent from  
Clinton's push to pass tobacco legislation in Congress, but they 
acknowledge a pending suit could put increased pressure on the 
industry to cut a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The government released few details about the upcoming lawsuit,  
which is meant to recover tax dollars spent treating sick smokers 
in Medicare, the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs, federal 
employee health benefits and other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's expected to be months before a suit is filed.  
</P>
<P>
	A task force within the Justice Department, yet to be appointed,  
will soon begin work to develop the precise legal strategy. 
Officials would not say where the suit might be filed or how much 
money it might seek. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the administration will try again to persuade  
Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration the power to 
regulate tobacco and adopt other policies meant to cut youth 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also has proposed an additional 55-cents-per-pack  
tax on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how the administration and its allies will fare on  
their second try in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there was considerably more momentum for tobacco  
legislation, in part because state lawsuits had not yet been 
settled. But the deal died. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials argue they have a better chance this  
time because the legislation is less ambitious and doesn't directly 
tie tobacco penalties to domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans fiercely oppose hiking the cigarette tax, and  
the industry is sure to renew its fight against new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton said the settlement with the states doesn't set any  
legal precedent and that ``unfortunately, the polls apparently show 
that suing tobacco is popular.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman Changes His Mind; He'll Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's agent said today that the  
flamboyant seven-time rebounding champion won't be making his next 
move until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman announced Wednesday on his website that he had changed  
his mind and decided not to retire. His agent, Dwight Manley, 
confirmed that Rodman wants to play in the NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
	During a press conference today agent for Karl Malone, another  
of Manley's clients, the agent's cellular phone rang repeatedly. 
Manley said the calls were from teams interested in Rodman, 
although he refused to name them. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said there will be no deal for Rodman's services before  
next week. After flying to Toronto today, Manley plans to return to 
Los Angeles on Friday and speak to Rodman after his appearance on 
the ``Tonight Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been reviewing my options,'' Rodman wrote in his website  
message, ``and those options still include playing in the NBA this 
season with a contender. Chicago, New York and L.A. are all cities 
I'd like to play in. Playing overseas could be pretty cool, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman announced Tuesday he would sit out a year as rumors  
spread that he was about to be traded to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, so here's the deal,'' Rodman's Web site message began.  
``I've had some long discussions with the people I love, the ones 
whose opinions matter most to me, and I've decided not to retire 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know yesterday I said I was history, and with the NBA  
lockout and everything going on, I really thought I should stop 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going on about his supposed options in Chicago, New York  
and Los Angeles, Rodman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``There's one thing I have always told my fans I would do in my  
last game that I still haven't done. I'm sure you know what it is, 
but I still have to come back for at least one more game so that I 
can get buck naked on the court,'' Rodman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bulls plan to resuscitate a sign-and-trade deal for  
Rodman, they'll have to do so by 2 p.m. EST today, when teams can 
start making deals. Chicago is expected to renounce its rights to 
Michael Jordan and execute sign-and-trade deals for Scottie Pippen 
(to Houston), Luc Longley (to Phoenix) and Steve Kerr (to San 
Antonio). 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, anyone remotely familiar with Rodman's ways could have  
seen this un-retirement coming. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, hours after Manley said Rodman is finished with the  
game because he wants to go to Hollywood, Rodman backed off and 
said he was in a state of ``limbo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is whether anyone is willing to bend  
over backwards to take another chance on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said Tuesday there were several teams still interested in  
signing the wacky, 37-year-old Rodman, known for his ferocious 
workouts, frequent forays to Las Vegas and an ability to hit the 
boards that led to seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley refused to elaborate on those possibilities Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing else to say on the subject,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman won championships with Chicago in 1996, 1997 and 1998,  
and titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990.

<HEADLINE>  Crash May End Ortlieb's Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- A terrifying crash Thursday on the  
dangerous Streif course might have ended the career of Patrick 
Ortlieb of Austria, the former Olympic and world downhill champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb fractured his right thigh, dislocated his right hip and  
sustained neck bruises in a practice run for a downhill 
doubleheader Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian, who won the Kitzbuehel downhill in 1994, lost his  
balance in the final corner of one of the most treacherous courses 
on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the Hausbergkante corner at a speed of about 60 mph,  
Ortlieb cartwheeled and smashed into the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated on the scene before being taken by helicopter to  
a hospital. Later, Ortlieb was flown to a hospital in Innsbruck for 
emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb won the Olympic downhill at the 1992 Games and the world  
title in 1996. He was fourth at the 1994 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The severity of the injuries appeared likely to end the career  
of Ortlieb, who had been thinking of retiring after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb also crashed badly at Wengen, Switzerland, last weekend,  
injuring his back and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ortlieb's accident, Frederic Marin-Cudraz of France also  
crashed at the same spot and was hospitalized with torn ligaments 
in his left knee. He will miss the rest of the season. He is the 
fourth French downhiller to be injured this season, including 
Olympic champion Jean-Luc Cretier. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's crashes came at the same spot where Brian Stemmle of  
Canada tore shoulder ligaments in a spill Wednesday, ending his 
season. Stemmle was nearly killed on the Streif 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus of Norway, winner of three downhill races this  
season, posted the fastest time in practice for downhills Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, the 1996 overall World Cup champion who is recovering from  
a lung infection, won the longest downhill on the circuit in 
Wengen, then took third in a slalom to win the season's first 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	A repeat of last weekend's performance could vault Kjus past  
overall World Cup leader Hermann Maier in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, bothered by a sore back and racing the Streif for the  
first time, will carry the added burden of thousands of demanding 
home fans, who will descend on the tiny village for the weekend 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the defending overall world champion who has made the  
World Cup downhill title a goal this season, leads the overrall 
with 1,021 points, 169 ahead of Kjus. The roles are reversed in the 
downhill standings, where Kjus leads with 380, with Maier 120 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier was 10th in Thursday's final practice.

<HEADLINE>  Pope To Return to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The pope travels to Mexico on Friday to sign  
a document outlining church strategy for the Americas in the coming 
decades, and, just as importantly, to return to a country close to 
his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in 1979, during his first foreign trip as pope, that John  
Paul II referred to this country as ``Mexico, always faithful.'' 
Mexicans loved the label, and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country where 87 percent of people identify themselves as  
Roman Catholic, the pope was a major hit -- donning a sombrero at a 
bullfighting ring and strumming a guitar along with a mariachi 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexicans also feel a special closeness to the pope -- and the  
pope to Mexico -- because of his devotion to the Virgin of 
Guadalupe, whose image adorns everything from construction sites to 
government offices. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul was the first pontiff to visit her Mexico City shrine  
in 1979, and in 1992 he dedicated a chapel in St. Peter's Basilica 
to her, placing her image next to the tomb of the first pope. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mexican church officials, it was at the Basilica of  
Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1979 that the pope got the inspiration 
that has marked his papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was while praying here that he realized that he must be a  
traveling pope, going about the world spreading the gospel,'' said 
Hector Fernandez, spokesman for the organizing committee of the 
Pope's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul went on to make 84 more foreign trips over the past 20  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope will return to the basilica on Saturday to announce the  
document on church strategy, and to pray again in front of the 
image of the Virgin Mary which the church says appeared before a 
Mexican Indian in 1531, called him ``son'' and left her image on 
his cloak. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the pope will hold the largest gathering of his trip,  
celebrating Mass with 800,000 people packed into a racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, in the last public act of the trip, he will meet  
with Mexican families and groups from other countries of the 
Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a fitting goodbye for a pope that has stressed family  
values throughout his papacy and placed special emphasis on the 
importance of Latin America for the future of the Roman Catholic 
Church. Half the world's Catholics live in the Americas.

<HEADLINE>  Crash May End Ortlieb's Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- A terrifying crash Thursday on the  
dangerous Streif course might have ended the career of Patrick 
Ortlieb of Austria, the former Olympic and world downhill champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb fractured his right thigh, dislocated his right hip and  
sustained neck bruises in a practice run for a downhill 
doubleheader Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian, who won the Kitzbuehel downhill in 1994, lost his  
balance in the final corner of one of the most treacherous courses 
on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the Hausbergkante corner at a speed of about 60 mph,  
Ortlieb cartwheeled and smashed into the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated on the scene before being taken by helicopter to  
a hospital. Later, Ortlieb was flown to a hospital in Innsbruck for 
emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb won the Olympic downhill at the 1992 Games and the world  
title in 1996. He was fourth at the 1994 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The severity of the injuries appeared likely to end the career  
of Ortlieb, who had been thinking of retiring after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb also crashed badly at Wengen, Switzerland, last weekend,  
injuring his back and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ortlieb's accident, Frederic Marin-Cudraz of France also  
crashed at the same spot and was hospitalized with torn ligaments 
in his left knee. He will miss the rest of the season. He is the 
fourth French downhiller to be injured this season, including 
Olympic champion Jean-Luc Cretier. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's crashes came at the same spot where Brian Stemmle of  
Canada tore shoulder ligaments in a spill Wednesday, ending his 
season. Stemmle was nearly killed on the Streif 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus of Norway, winner of three downhill races this  
season, posted the fastest time in practice for downhills Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, the 1996 overall World Cup champion who is recovering from  
a lung infection, won the longest downhill on the circuit in 
Wengen, then took third in a slalom to win the season's first 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	A repeat of last weekend's performance could vault Kjus past  
overall World Cup leader Hermann Maier in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, bothered by a sore back and racing the Streif for the  
first time, will carry the added burden of thousands of demanding 
home fans, who will descend on the tiny village for the weekend 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the defending overall world champion who has made the  
World Cup downhill title a goal this season, leads the overrall 
with 1,021 points, 169 ahead of Kjus. The roles are reversed in the 
downhill standings, where Kjus leads with 380, with Maier 120 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier was 10th in Thursday's final practice.

<HEADLINE>  Pope To Return to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The pope travels to Mexico on Friday to sign  
a document outlining church strategy for the Americas in the coming 
decades, and, just as importantly, to return to a country close to 
his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in 1979, during his first foreign trip as pope, that John  
Paul II referred to this country as ``Mexico, always faithful.'' 
Mexicans loved the label, and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country where 87 percent of people identify themselves as  
Roman Catholic, the pope was a major hit -- donning a sombrero at a 
bullfighting ring and strumming a guitar along with a mariachi 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexicans also feel a special closeness to the pope -- and the  
pope to Mexico -- because of his devotion to the Virgin of 
Guadalupe, whose image adorns everything from construction sites to 
government offices. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul was the first pontiff to visit her Mexico City shrine  
in 1979, and in 1992 he dedicated a chapel in St. Peter's Basilica 
to her, placing her image next to the tomb of the first pope. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mexican church officials, it was at the Basilica of  
Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1979 that the pope got the inspiration 
that has marked his papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was while praying here that he realized that he must be a  
traveling pope, going about the world spreading the gospel,'' said 
Hector Fernandez, spokesman for the organizing committee of the 
Pope's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul went on to make 84 more foreign trips over the past 20  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope will return to the basilica on Saturday to announce the  
document on church strategy, and to pray again in front of the 
image of the Virgin Mary which the church says appeared before a 
Mexican Indian in 1531, called him ``son'' and left her image on 
his cloak. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the pope will hold the largest gathering of his trip,  
celebrating Mass with 800,000 people packed into a racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, in the last public act of the trip, he will meet  
with Mexican families and groups from other countries of the 
Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a fitting goodbye for a pope that has stressed family  
values throughout his papacy and placed special emphasis on the 
importance of Latin America for the future of the Roman Catholic 
Church. Half the world's Catholics live in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will have a special message of hope for Latin America,''  
said Francisco Gonzalez Garza, organizer of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups in seven other cities -- Tegucigalpa, Honduras; Panama  
City; Los Angeles; Caracas, Venezuela; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Buenos 
Aires, Argentina and Lima, Peru -- will be able to participate in 
the event via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the transcontinental span of the mission, the focus  
is clearly on Mexico. 
</P>

ambassador to the Vatican: ``I recall with fondness my pastoral 
visits to your beloved country, in which I could perceive ... the 
warmth of the welcome and hospitality and so many demonstrations of 
affection.''

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Surge Worries Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Let Brazil go bump in the night or Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan fret anew about irrational 
exuberance. American investors will just keep pushing the 
high-flying stock market higher. At least, that is the way it 
seems. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's sudden devaluation of its currency did cause a brief  
swoon in stock prices last week. But the market soon shook off 
worries that the global currency crisis was being re-ignited and 
made up the lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Greenspan's most explicit comments in some time about  
the unsustainability of current high stock prices, given slumping 
corporate profits, caused barely a hiccup in the market on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average actually rose by nearly 125  
points after Greenspan appeared before a House committee, although 
it did end the day off by a slight 19 points. In early trading 
today, the Dow was up slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	That reaction was a far cry from two years ago, when Greenspan's  
musing about ``irrational exuberance'' at a time when the Dow was 
nearly 3,000 points lower than today caused a big selloff not only 
in the United States but around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists, however, do not think the nation's most influential  
money man is losing his clout or that Greenspan's worries about the 
stock market are any less sound now than then. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, they say, is that back in December of 1996,  
before the global currency crisis struck, the worry among investors 
was that the Fed soon would start raising interest rates to cool 
off an overheated market. Greenspan's comments at that time were 
viewed as a clear warning of that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	But everything in Greenspan's testimony Wednesday before the  
House Ways and Means Committee was seen as a confirmation of the 
current consensus view of analysts that the central bank is not 
contemplating any rate increases because of worries about the 
global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is on hold for a while,'' said Martin Regalia, chief  
economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``If the U.S. economy 
slows this year the way they expect it to, they may not do anything 
until 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted the fragile nature of the current world  
situation on Wednesday, commenting specifically about Brazil's 
forced devaluation of its currency last week. He cited the 
potential that Brazil's troubles could drag down other countries in 
Latin America, a region that buys 20 percent of U.S. exports, as a 
``potential downside risk for demand in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Primark Decision  
Economics in New York, said Greenspan was acknowledging the 
considerable risks that still exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mines are exploding all around the United States and the  
jury is still out on whether the U.S. economy can continue to make 
its way through the mine fields,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike last fall, when Greenspan saw the foreign threat as a  
big enough danger to engineer three interest rate cuts, the central 
bank now will be content to remain on the sidelines unless actual 
U.S. growth starts to slow too much, Sinai predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of Greenspan's comments on Wednesday pointed to a  
steady-as-she-goes policy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed believes that a big rise in America's trade  
deficit will eventually slow U.S. growth, that slowdown has yet to 
occur. Instead, the economy grew at a sizzling pace in the final 
three months of the year, powered by robust consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan warned that consumer spending has been supported  
by the big rise in stock prices and ``a decline in equity (stock) 
values, especially a severe one, could lead to a considerable 
weakening of consumer demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economy's strength, which pushed unemployment down to a  
three-decade low in 1998, would normally be causing the central 
bank to worry about possibly raising interest rates to make sure 
tight labor markets do not ignite inflationary pressures. But 
Greenspan said policy-makers continued to see no evidence that wage 
pressures were triggering price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting the view that interest rate policy is likely to  
remain on hold, the Fed released its latest nationwide survey of 
the economy on Wednesday, noting that most regions were reporting 
solid economic growth. That review will be used by Fed 
policy-makers when they next meet to consider changing interest 
rates on Feb. 2-3.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushing Air Competition Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a March 31 deadline, Congress is  
pushing for early action on major legislation to improve airports 
and ensure aviation competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying more and more for less and less real  
service,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	He is sponsoring legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation  
Administration and help some of the smaller aviation markets hit by 
deregulation of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate last year failed to reconcile differences  
on competing bills, forcing lawmakers to pass a temporary six-month 
measure to keep the FAA operating. That extension March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and  
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., have 
promised to move quickly to pass their respective bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bills are similar in many respects, but differ in key  
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster wants to make sure that all future airline ticket tax  
revenues go to aviation improvements and not the general federal 
budget. McCain is committed to increasing flights, particularly to 
underserved smaller markets, from four large airports -- O'Hare in 
Chicago, LaGuardia and JFK in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington 
National. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill, nearly identical to legislation that passed the  
Senate 92-1 last year, would reauthorize the FAA for two years and 
provide about $2.4 billion each year for the Airport Improvement 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	It would create 30 new slots -- each equivalent to a takeoff and  
landing -- at O'Hare, with 18 to go to underserved communities. 
</P>
<P>
	National would add 12 round-trip flights, six of which would go  
beyond 1,250 miles. That is the limit set by the 1986 ``perimeter 
rule'' to protect the economic viability of Dulles and 
Baltimore-Washington, the region's two long-haul airports. Only 
aircraft with the lowest noise levels could be added. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for aviation at the  
Transportation Department, agreed with McCain that perimeters and 
slots hurt consumers and ``are no longer required for safety and 
operational control.'' But he said noise and local development 
remain issues in expanding flights out of busy airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died last year in part because House Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., resisted the addition of 
flights at O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also would set up a four-year pilot program to expand  
service to smaller markets; require the Transportation Department 
to look into marketing and other aviation industry practices that 
may inhibit competition; and put regulations on commercial air tour 
flights over national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said last week that his committee would pass a sweeping  
aviation bill by the end of February that reauthorizes the FAA for 
five years and ensures that all the money in the Airport and Airway 
Trust Fund goes to airport programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport taxes this year will generate some $10 billion in  
revenues, but less than $6 billion will be used on airport 
construction. The rest remains in the general budget, to be used to 
balance the budget or on other programs.

<HEADLINE> Md. Banquet Honors Abortion Foes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Abortion foes held a banquet Thursday  
to honor their militant peers and auction off a few keepsakes, 
including a pair of camouflage booties knitted by a woman jailed 
for maiming a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 50 people attending had themselves been convicted of  
abortion-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prison is hard,'' said John Brockhoeft, decked out in black  
military fatigues and a black beret. ``The price might be high, but 
I was sure I was doing the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prison sweatshirt that Brockhoeft wore during seven years in a  
federal lockup for firebombing two Cincinnati abortion clinics was 
the top seller of the 12 items up for bid. It fetched $125. 
</P>
<P>
	The two booties were knitted by Rachelle Shannon, who is  
imprisoned for shooting and injuring a Wichita, Kan., doctor in 
1993. That lot went for $40. 
</P>
<P>
	A scarf and a hat, also rendered in camouflage by Shannon, went  
for $70 after auctioneer Don Spitz said wearing them would make a 
strong ``pro-life fashion statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one will recognize you. The feds will walk right by you,''  
Spitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Bray helped organize the banquet, similar to  
previous ones which critics say introduced posters featured a 
``dirty dozen'' list of physicians who provided abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood and four doctors say the posters amounted to  
a hit list, and are seeking $200 million in an Oregon lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Bray is a danger to society,'' said Margie Kelly,  
spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New 
York. ``It's uncivilized what he's doing and what his organization 
hopes to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bray defends the banquet, as well as bombing abortion clinics  
and killing doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would call it the use of force to defend the innocent in the  
womb,'' said Bray, jailed for nearly four years for bombing and 
setting fire to seven abortion clinics in the 1980s. ``It's 
defensive force, not retributive force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction, which netted $700 for families with relatives in  
prison, was ``really just a sideline,'' Bray said. ``The real 
purpose is just to bring everybody together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Graff recently finished a probation in Houston after  
spending nearly three years in prison for setting fire to an 
abortion clinic. He said he came to Maryland to be with other 
people who shared his views. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only regret is that I got caught,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 30-Yr Fixed-Rate Mortgage Rates Off / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages was 6.78 percent this week, down from 6.83 
percent last week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average, a four-week low, has remained below 7 percent for  
seven months. It reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early 
October. Its peak for 1998 was 7.22 percent in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mortgage rates are down a little this week, mostly on news of  
Brazil's financial problems,'' said Freddie Mac economist Robert 
Van Order. ``We expect, though, that rates will remainb at or near 
this level well into 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.42 percent this week, down from 6.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.57 percent, down from 5.61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged around 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of 
mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Teen Arrested in Miami Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A teen-ager was arrested and charged with shooting  
a Panamanian businesswoman in a mall parking garage -- one of two 
attacks last weekend that revived worries that the tourist attacks 
of the early '90s were making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous tips led investigators to 17-year-old Rancifer Lynn  
Brown, who was arrested at a house and charged with one count each 
of armed robbery and attempted murder, Miami-Dade police Sgt. Pete 
Andreu said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He attempted to exit out the back door to the waiting arms of  
detectives,'' Andreu said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tips that led investigators to the arrest late Wednesday  
flowed in from people in the community who are tired of dealing 
with violent crime, Andreu said. ``People are just fed up with it. 
It's affecting everybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Motta, 50, was in critical but stable condition today at  
Jackson Memorial Hospital, where she was airlifted after being shot 
in the chest and arm Saturday afternoon. Mrs. Motta's husband and 
two grown children joined other relatives who flew to Miami to be 
by her side. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's fighting for her life,'' said Analisa Fidanque, her  
sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Mrs. Motta was shot, a 69-year-old retired truck  
driver from Quebec was shot to death by a gunman who may have 
followed him home from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism officials said the victims' backgrounds had nothing to  
do with the attacks, even though the shootings brought back 
memories of killings that panicked many European vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County's crime rate has dropped significantly since  
1993, the year three German tourists were killed in robberies that 
made headlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings were among 10 tourist-related slayings in Florida  
during 1992 and 1993. Six of the slayings happened in the Miami 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist robberies investigated by the Miami-Dade Police  
Department fell 86 percent from 1992 to 1997.

<HEADLINE> United Technologies Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Machinery maker United Technologies Corp.  
reported fourth-quarter profits Thursday of $287 million, an 18 
percent increase above the same quarter a year ago, thanks in part 
to strong showings in its aircraft and refrigeration businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings, were equivalent to $1.16 per diluted share, beat  
analysts' expectations of $1.11 a share, as reported by First Call 
Corp. The company's stock closed up $1.93 3/4, or 2 percent, to 
$113.93 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, UTC earned $244 million, or 97 cents per  
diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the fourth quarter rose 10 percent to $6.80 billion,  
up from $6.20 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	At UTC's Carrier heating and air-conditioning business,  
operating profit increased 45 percent in the quarter on 20 percent 
higher revenues. Pratt &AMP; Whitney, UTC's jet-engine business, 
boosted profit 16 percent on 4 percent revenue growth mainly due to 
improved performance in Pratt &AMP; Whitney Canada and the large 
military engine business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said profits at its automotive business fell 43  
percent during the quarter due to customer pricing pressures, 
higher spending on future programs and a write-off at an interior 
trim plant. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC also said it has hired an investment firm to explore a  
possible sale of its automotive operations. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC Chairman George David said consolidations within the  
automotive components industry prompted the company to retain 
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. to look at alternatives for UTC Automotive. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, earnings rose 17 percent to $1.26 billion, or  
$5.05 per diluted share, compared with $1.07 billion, or $4.21 per 
share, in 1997. Annual revenues climbed 6 percent to $25.72 
billion, up from $24.22 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of United Technologies rose $1.93 3/4 to $117.93 3/4 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Cuts Begin at Universal Music Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Seagram Co. fired 500 Universal Music Group  
employees, part of a planned cost-cutting campaign resulting from 
its $10.2 billion acquisition of PolyGram NV. 
</P>
<P>
	Many more jobs may be lost. Over the next nine months, 1,200 of  
the 15,500 employees in the United States will be fired, a 
Universal Music Group source told The Associated Press, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. Other reports have said as many as 3,000 
workers will be dismissed throughout the company, which also has 
overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the layoffs, as many as 200 artists could be cut  
from a diverse roster that includes Sheryl Crow, Boyz II Men, Nine 
Inch Nails, Luciano Pavarotti, Melissa Etheridge, Vince Gill, 
George Strait and Shania Twain, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, workers in Universal City here and in New York were  
notified by Seagram they had lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning the number of employees involved, Seagram  
said in a statement that restructuring had begun ``to create the 
industry's leanest and most cost-effective firm by eliminating 
broad duplication of activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bernstein, spokesman for Universal Music Group, declined to  
comment beyond the corporate statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said previously that consolidation would include  
merging a number of record labels. Island Records and Mercury 
Records will become a single label. PolyGram's Verve and 
Universal's GRP jazz labels also will combine. Motown and Universal 
will merge and Interscope, Geffen and A&AMP;M will become units of 
Universal's West Coast music group. 
</P>
<P>
	``While change is always difficult, the restructuring of the  
labels is necessary for us to be more competitive, develop artists' 
careers and pave the way for meaningful growth in the future,'' 
Seagram said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram said when it acquired PolyGram it would fire workers and  
artists as part of a plan to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram also has movie interests and it was hurt in 1998 by box  
office disappointments and an exodus of key film executives. Two of 
its big fall releases, ``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Meet Joe 
Black,'' were flops that led to the departure of Universal Pictures 
chairman Casey Silver and Universal's chief executive, Frank Biondi 
Jr. Other disappointments included the political satire ``Primary 
Colors'' and the comedy ``BASEketball.''

<HEADLINE> Palmer Is Browns' Newest Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Midway through his second interview with the  
Cleveland Browns, Chris Palmer forced the team's brain trust to 
call a timeout and switch to their hurry-up offense. 
</P>
<P>
	They hadn't planned to hire Palmer on the spot, but Palmer made  
them do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had heard all we needed to,'' Cleveland owner Al Lerner  
recalled Thursday. ``We knew we had found our man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars the  
past two seasons and considered a longshot for the Cleveland job 
just a week ago, was named the Browns' head coach Thursday before a 
packed news conference that included more than a dozen Browns 
alumni. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, 49, is the ninth full-time coach of the Browns, who are  
returning to the NFL next season as an expansion team following a 
three-year absence. Former owner Art Modell took the old Browns to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cleveland Browns have always been my first choice,''  
Palmer said at the team's Berea headquarters as Browns Hall of 
Famer Dante Lavelli and former All-Pros Gene Hickerson, Doug Dieken 
and Hanford Dixon looked on. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was brought back to Cleveland on Wednesday for a second  
look by the Browns, who needed to put a coach in place quickly with 
the expansion draft less than three weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy, impressed with Palmer's preparation and personality  
during his first interview, was eager for Palmer to meet with 
Lerner and football operations director Dwight Clark, both of whom 
were out of town for Palmer's initial visit. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 12-hour interview proceeded in Lerner's office in  
suburban Beachwood, the Browns received two dozen phone calls from 
around the league from players, coaches, agents and owners, all 
wanting to put in a good word for Palmer. Patriots quarterback Drew 
Bledsoe, Buffalo QB Doug Flutie and Jacksonville QB Mark Brunell 
and wideout Jimmy Smith were among the callers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Policy made a call himself, to Jets coach Bill Parcells,  
who coached with Palmer for three years in New England. Parcells 
echoed the sentiments of the others -- that Palmer was a great coach 
and a great guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a man of substance,'' Policy said. ``He's a real person.  
You don't feel he's playing games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy, Lerner and Clark excused themselves from the room, and  
as Palmer waited inside, the three decided the search was over and 
that Palmer would coach the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said details of Palmer's contract still needed to be  
finalized, but that it was for five years and would be worth 
approximately $5 million plus incentives. A Super Bowl trip could 
earn Palmer an extra $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the only candidate who we got to the point that we were  
ready to offer a job to,'' Lerner said. ``I think we're making 
exactly the right decision, and I think he's making just the right 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer previously interviewed with Baltimore, but after his  
first meeting with Policy, knew that although he was a longshot, 
Cleveland was where he wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I looked at it, the more I thought, that's the job I  
want,'' he said. ``I may have been in the outside lane, but I made 
the turn well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer will be responsible for ushering Cleveland into a new  
football era, much like Paul Brown did in 1950 when the Browns 
joined the NFL after dominating the All-American Football 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	And although he grew up in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., rooting for the New  
York Giants, Palmer understands what tradition, history and 
football mean here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a passion,'' he said. ``Ohio is football. My favorite  
book is one about Paul Brown and how he developed the Cleveland 
Browns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he talked about his plans for building the new Browns, Palmer  
stopped to address the former Cleveland players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tradition and pride that you guys have built with the  
Browns is something we'll cherish and build our program on,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said his first priority would be to assemble a coaching  
staff, and that he expected plenty of ``16- to 18-hour days'' as he 
and Cleveland's front office build the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained non-committal on who the Browns might take with the  
No. 1 pick in April's college draft -- Kentucky quarterback Tim 
Couch and Texas running back Ricky Williams are the frontrunners -- 
and said he hoped the team could find a few ``diamonds in the 
rough'' in next month's expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he plans to hire an offensive coordinator, but  
expects to call the plays. He knows time is running short with the 
Browns first exhibition game just 200 days away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's difficult,'' he said. ``It's challenging,  
and as a coach you look for challenges. Everything will work out.''

<HEADLINE> Nuggets' Van Exel Recruited McDyess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Nick Van Exel has been accused of many things in a  
stormy five-year career. But a recruiter for the Denver Nuggets? 
</P>
<P>
	According to the veteran point guard who spent the past five  
seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, his past month wasn't wasted. 
Instead of time on the court, he was an active participant in the 
recruitment of Antonio McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't slept in about a week,'' Van Exel said Thursday  
before he and the Nuggets departed for five days of training camp 
at the Air Force Academy. ``I spent a lot of time negotiating and 
recruiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel, who came to Denver in a June 24 deal that sent Tony  
Battie and first-round draft pick Tyronn Lue to the Lakers, said he 
spent time with McDyess in Houston over the last three weeks. He 
had planned to be in Denver a week earlier, but opted to wait until 
McDyess, one of the most sought-after free agents in the days 
leading to the end of the lockout, made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to do anything until Antonio decided,'' Van  
Exel said. ``We talked, but I just hung around and didn't press the 
issue with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between pick-up games and one-on-one video battles between  
the two, Van Exel was aware McDyess' primary suitors were his 
former team, Phoenix, and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio liked the city,'' Van Exel said. ``He reminded me that  
there wasn't much to do in Denver and he told me not to bring my 
car because he said it would always stay dirty, but he liked the 
city and its fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel picked it up from there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to tell him he could uplift this whole city to a  
basketball community like it was before,'' Van Exel said. ``The 
fans of Denver want an organization that really wants to win. You 
can be a part of something special being with a team that hasn't 
made the playoffs since 1995. There are the Broncos, Avalanche and 
Rockies, but it is always good to start up your own thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he sold him on playing time. ``Basically, you can come to  
Denver and play a lot more than 26 minutes a game and start some 
more here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel was convinced the final selling point was the Nuggets  
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't give him $15 million under the table,'' Van Exel  
said. ``Antonio pretty much knew what he wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess was given a six-year, $67.5 million deal Wednesday to  
return to a team that dealt him to Phoenix in 1997 for four draft 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good fit; one that will make the Nuggets a better  
team,'' Van Exel said.

<HEADLINE> Perelman Testifies in Child Support Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The multibillionaire head of Revlon cosmetics  
testified in a child support battle that his young daughter eats 
``about $3 a day'' in food when she is with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Perelman, one of the wealthiest men in the country,  
reluctantly described his lifestyle and financial worth Wednesday 
when questioned by a lawyer for his third ex-wife. Patricia Duff is 
seeking almost $100,000 a month to support their 4-year-old 
daughter, Caleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was held over child support; the question of  
permanent custody is to be settled in another court. 
</P>
<P>
	Duff, 44, who was married to Perelman, 55, for about 18 months  
and whose financial settlement was determined by a prenuptial 
agreement, has temporary custody of Caleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Perelman, questioned by Duff's lawyer William Beslow, described  
his financial worth as ``approximately $6 billion'' and described a 
life with private jets, yachts, deluxe vacations and lavish homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Beslow said he wanted to show the court the standard of living  
Caleigh had enjoyed, saying she should be allowed to continue that 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	He mentioned $50,000 a month for child support, $40,000 a month  
for an apartment, salaries for nannies and a chef, and money for 
vacations, visits with relatives and a second car. 
</P>
<P>
	When Beslow asked how much he believed Caleigh needed for food,  
Perelman replied, ``When she's with me she eats about $3 a day 
worth of food'' including cereal, hamburgers and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
	Weissberg cut short inquiries about Perelman's money, saying  
there was little disagreement on ``85 percent'' of the issues, 
including what Perelman would pay for, and that he had wide 
discretion on what to award the child.

<HEADLINE> Ford Earnings on Three-Year Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. reported a nearly 7  
percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings on robust sales in the 
United States, a strong lineup of pickups and sport utility 
vehicles and continued cost-cutting in its automotive operations 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker reported its 11th consecutive  
quarter of improved operating earnings Thursday and beat Wall 
Street's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford has the right products for the direction that the  
business in the United States is going right now, with a very 
strong position in light trucks,'' said analyst David Healy of 
Burnham Securities Inc. ``And despite very competitive pricing, 
their cost-cutting has enabled them to widen their profit 
margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer John M. Devine said the pressure to keep  
prices down was forcing automakers to be more creative in 
extracting savings in production and other areas of the business to 
boost profits. Ford reduced its costs by $2.2 billion last year -- 
more than double its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot harder to make money in this business,'' Devine  
said. ``Inflation's low. Consumers don't want to pay more; they 
want to pay less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding several one-time charges, Ford's operating profit for  
the quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.35 a fully diluted share. That 
was up from $1.6 billion, or $1.27 a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	With the $631 million in charges after taxes, Ford earned $1  
billion, or 84 cents a share. That was down 42 percent from the 
comparable $1.8 billion, or $1.45 a share, it earned a year 
earlier. The 1997 figure includes income from The Associates, a 
finance unit that was spun off last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $37.9 billion, down 5 percent  
from $40 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford shares closed down $2.62 1/2 to $62.06 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where stocks were down in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's operating profit for the year was up 10 percent, which  
means about 160,000 U.S. employees will receive annual 
profit-sharing checks averaging $6,100 on March 3. That's a record 
since Ford began profit sharing in 1984; the previous high was 
$4,400 for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case with General Motors Corp., which reported a  
record fourth-quarter profit of $1.8 billion Wednesday, Ford's 
strong showing in its home market easily offset losses in South 
America. In Brazil, Ford recently idled its assembly plant due to 
slumping demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also had a modest gain in Asia and smaller markets. But in  
Europe, where GM posted a healthy gain, Ford's operating profit was 
off 60 percent -- in large part because of lower export sales and 
the launch of the subcompact Focus, a replacement for the 
high-volume Escort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe was a bit weaker than people had been anticipating and  
South America was a little bit better,'' said analyst Gary Lapidus 
of Sanford C. Bernstein. ``The disconcerting piece is it's easy to 
see how South America can get a whole lot worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both automakers have achieved gains in the United States through  
rigorous cost-cutting and new products, especially trucks. This 
year, Ford is planning to introduce the hulking Excursion, expected 
to be another high-profit SUV that will rank as the biggest 
passenger vehicle on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was impressed by the list of new products that they have in  
the pipeline, which I think will not only help the margins but help 
their market share in '99,'' Healy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford ended the year with a cash reserve of $23.8 billion, which  
was sure to feed more speculation that the automaker will spend 
part of that hoard to buy an interest in a smaller automaker. Healy 
said that amount is ``more than they have any reasonable need 
for.'' He expects Ford to boost its dividend in April. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Ford earned $22 billion, more than triple the $6.9  
billion it earned in all of 1997, but that included a $16 billion 
gain from the spin-off of The Associates, a financial subsidiary. 
Excluding that and other one-time factors, Ford's operating profit 
was $6.6 billion, or $5.30 a diluted share, up 10 percent from the 
$6 billion, or $4.86 a share, Ford earned in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's revenue last year totaled $144.4 billion, down 6 percent  
from $153.6 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The $631 million in fourth-quarter charges equaled 51 cents a  
share and included $472 million for an aggressive early retirement 
and employee buyout program that reduced the company's work force 
by nearly 9,000 people. Other charges included $86 million to write 
off the loss related to Ford's investment in Korea's bankrupt Kia 
Motors Corp., and $73 million for the transfer of its Batavia, 
Ohio, transmission plant to a new joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford earned $1.4 billion in North America during the quarter, up  
4 percent from $1.35 billion a year ago, excluding the one-time 
charges. Ford also earned $63 million in Europe but lost $70 
million in South America. In Asia and smaller markets, Ford earned 
$42 million, compared with a $99 million loss in the 
October-December period of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Fiber Doesn't Reduce Colon Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A large new study has found no evidence that eating lots of  
high-fiber foods like bran, beans and whole wheat bread helps lower 
the risk of colon cancer, a surprising conclusion that contradicts 
years of dietary advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,  
tracked the colon and rectal health of 88,757 women who 
participated in the Harvard-based Nurses Health Study over 16 
years. It is one of the biggest cancer studies of its kind ever. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1980 to 1996, 787 of the women developed cancer of the  
colon or the rectum. The risk was the same, regardless of how much 
fiber they ate. The researchers said they believe the findings 
apply to men as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles S. Fuchs and his colleagues at the Dana-Farber  
Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical 
School said they were astounded to find that women who ate 
low-fiber foods were no more likely to develop colon cancer than 
those who stuck to bran muffins and broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a practicing physician and as a researcher, this is a  
hypothesis that has stood the test of time,'' Fuchs said. ``There 
has been such an abundant enthusiasm for this hypothesis, so the 
important message here is that fiber, overall, has no protective 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, previous studies have found that a diet rich in fruits,  
vegetables and whole grains has other health benefits, including 
reducing the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and certain 
types of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	And Fuchs said the benefits of fiber in protecting against other  
problems like high blood pressure and heart disease -- the No. 1 
killer in the country -- are undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people are taking fiber for any of those reasons, then keep  
doing it. If the primary concern is to prevent colon cancer, then I 
wouldn't try fiber. I'm not sure that's going to work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study participants were healthy women, 34 to 59, who had no  
history of cancer. They filled out dietary questionnaires in 1980, 
1984 and 1986, and researchers followed up with the women until 
mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Thun, who heads epidemiological research for the  
American Cancer Society, said he was surprised by the findings but 
doubts his organization will change its nutritional guidelines 
because people who eat more fruits and vegetables generally suffer 
fewer cases of cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, 
stomach, and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should base their behavior on all of the evidence  
rather than on one study,'' Thun said. ``One shouldn't either 
zigzag erratically with each new study or lapse into cynicism. The 
fact is that the main components of a healthy lifestyle have been 
clear and steady for some years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that there may be other properties of vegetables,  
including the vitamin folate, that could lower the risk of cancer 
and that people who eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
also tend to be less obese and suffer fewer health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. John Potter of the Fred  
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle wondered whether 
questionnaires about a person's past eating habits can be accurate 
and if nurses, who are generally more health-conscious than other 
people, are a representative sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter said there is evidence to suggest that high sugar and  
calorie consumption and a lack of exercise may be to blame for 
colon cancer, but more research is necessary. ``We have barely 
begun,'' he said.

	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco farmers struggling to survive in a  
shrinking market would be able to tap into a $5.15 billion trust 
fund approved by the nation's largest cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco  
Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. agreed Thursday to pay 
into the fund for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for tobacco is expected to be reduced by recent  
settlements of claims by states that sued tobacco companies to 
recover the costs of treating sick smokers. The settlements, which 
totaled $246 billion, are being financed by higher prices for 
cigarettes and include provisions to limit promotion of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlements also included a provision in which the companies  
agreed to help farmers hurt by lessened demand for their crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will enable a grower to go to a lender and show cash  
flow,'' Graham Boyd, executive vice president of the Tobacco 
Growers Association of North Carolina, said of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said farmers who qualify under yet-to-be-determined rules  
may use the money for operations or to make debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't find any growers taking this and buying beachfront  
condos,'' he said. ``Most of them owe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers would apply for assistance to independent boards of  
trustees, but North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who hosted the 
negotiations, said many details remain to be worked out before the 
pact is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said he hoped that farmers in North Carolina, the largest  
tobacco producer, could get payments from the fund in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies reached the agreement after two days of tense  
negotiations with five tobacco-state governors. R.J. Reynolds had 
been reluctant to pay into the trust and had instead proposed 
buying more American-grown tobacco to provide a stable market for 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said last month it will lay off 3,900 employees  
worldwide and is restructuring operations because of lower sales in 
the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Major tobacco states in the talks were Virginia, North Carolina,  
South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Others involved 
were Maryland, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Alabama and Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Genentech Profit Down 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (AP) -- Genentech Inc. reported TODAY  
its fourth-quarter profits fell 12 percent from the same period of 
1997, when the biotechnology company had substantial one-time 
revenues from one customer. 
</P>
<P>
	The biotechnology company earned $37 million, or 28 cents per  
diluted share, from $41.5 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter rose to $304.3 million from $277.1  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech's fourth-quarter 1997 results reflected substantial  
revenues from a deal with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. It did not 
have a similar deal in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did report good sales of two new drugs, including  
Herceptin, used by patients with metastatic breast cancer, and 
Rituxan, used to fight non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Herceptin won FDA 
approval in late September. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech reported a 41 percent increase in yearly profits, to  
$182 million or $1.40 per share from $129 million, or $1.02 per 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for 1998 were $1.15 billion, up from $1.02  
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Research and development expenses dropped to 34 percent of  
revenues, compared to 46 percent in 1997. But other costs 
increased, such as marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech has sold $30 million worth of Herceptin since  
launching the therapy on Oct. 5, and Rituxan sales totaled $163 
million in its first full year on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Activase decreased to $213 million from $261 million in  
1997 as doctors turned to other therapies for heart patients, and 
sales of growth hormone products decreased to $214 million from 
$227 million in 1997 due to increased competition.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Flu Season Mild So Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The nation's flu season has been relatively mild  
so far, with New York the only state reporting a widespread 
outbreak, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since October, 40 other states have reported some flu cases, the  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Influenza is unpredictable. We can't predict whether it will  
be a mild flu season for the entire year or if it's going to peak 
later than usual,'' said Dr. Tim Uyeki of the CDC's Center for 
Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The season's peak usually runs from December to early March.  
</P>
<P>
	Flu usually kills about 20,000 Americans a year.

<HEADLINE> Ameritech, SBC, Lucent Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications Corp., Baby Bells that  
will unite this year, reported strong earnings growth for 1998 
Thursday. Lucent Technologies Corp.'s earnings rose, but its 
revenue growth failed to impress analysts. 

</P>
<P>
 *Ameritech Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech Corp. said earnings rose 24.9 percent in the fourth  
quarter, due to strong sales overseas and a one-time gain on the 
sale of some local phone exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter, Ameritech reported profits of $762 million, or  
68 cents a diluted share, compared with $610 million, or 55 cents a 
diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $4.44 billion, up 7 percent from  
$4.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings include two one-time items: an after-tax gain of  
$102 million, or 9 cents a share, from the sale of 19 local phone 
exchanges in Wisconsin, and an after-tax charge of $24 million, or 
2 cents a share, for charges associated with the early redemption 
of $1.3 billion in long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the one-time items, earnings for the quarter would have  
risen 12.1 percent from a year ago, to $684 million, or 61 cents a 
diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected Ameritech to  
earn 61 cents a share. Shares of Ameritech slipped $1.87 1/2 to 
$67.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Ameritech earned $3.61 billion, or $3.25 a  
share, up 57 percent from $2.3 billion, or $2.08 a share, in 1997. 
Without the one-time items, earnings for 1998 grew 11.4 percent to 
$2.61 billion, or $2.35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Ameritech Chairman Richard Notebaert said the  
company's revenue growth has been fueled by its data communications 
business, European partnerships and U.S. wireless business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech provides local phone service in Illinois, Wisconsin,  
Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. It is expected to complete its $78.2 
billion merger with SBC by the middle of this year. 

</P>
<P>
 *SBC Communications Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	SBC reported an 18-percent increase in fourth-quarter profits,  
driven by growth in data and vertical services. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter earnings were $756 million, or 38 cents per  
diluted share, up from $642 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, 
in the same period last year. SBC had revenues of $7.7 billion, 
compared with $7.1 billion in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth quarter included a one-time loss of $60 million for  
the early retirement of debt and costs related to a merger with 
Southern New England Telecommunications. Without extraordinary 
charges, SBC would have earned $1.1 billion, or 55 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected SBC to earn  
54 cents per share. Shares of SBC fell $1.31 1/4, or 2 percent, to 
$57.18 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-year profits for 1998 were $4 billion, or $2.03 per diluted  
share, on revenues of $28.8 billion. That compares with $1.67 
billion, or 85 cents per diluted share, on revenues of $26.7 
billion for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, SBC earned $4.1 billion, or $2.08 per diluted  
share, up from $3.5 billion, or $1.76 per diluted share, the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said data services revenues increased 32 percent in 1998 
and vertical services revenues increased nearly 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Vertical services include special features such as caller  
identification and voice-messaging. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC's telephone companies added 308,000 access lines during the  
quarter, and wireless operations added 384,000 net subscribers in 
the quarter. 

</P>
<P>
 *Lucent Technologies    	
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications equipment maker Lucent said earnings in its  
fiscal first quarter nearly doubled, largely due to a one-time gain 
that reflected a change in the way the company accounts for 
pensions and post-retirement benefits 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income increased by a more modest 16 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the October-December quarter was $2.7 billion, or  
$2 a share on a diluted basis, compared with 61 cents in the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results included a one-time gain of $1.3 billion due to the  
accounting change, and a one-time after-tax charge of $14 million 
associated with the acquisition of Quadritek Systems Inc., a maker 
of Internet-related software 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time items, earnings would have risen 26  
percent to $1.4 billion, or $1.05 per share. Analysts surveyed by 
First Call Corp. expected Lucent to earn $1 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up 16 percent  
from $1.8 billion a year ago, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's revenues were up 5.5 percent to $9.2 billion, from $8.7  
billion in the year-ago quarter, fueled by sales of Definity 
enterprise communication servers and chips for high-speed 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected steeper revenue growth, although they said  
Lucent's accounting methods were responsible for part of the 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently seized on the revenue figures, sending  
shares of Lucent down $8.56 1/4, or 7 percent, to $106.93 3/4 on the 
NYSE. Lucent was the most active stock on the NYSE, with more than 
20 million shares trading hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent announced last week that it will buy Ascend  
Communications Inc. in an $18.7 billion stock deal, as well as 
Kenan Systems Corp., a maker of software for billing and customer 
service, for $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., includes the Bell  
Laboratories research and development operation.

<HEADLINE> Public Gets Wild West Nobody Wanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- The federal government has taken  
title to 10,000 acres of sagebrush and solitude, the first 
installment in a deal aimed at preserving a California desert from 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Rising, president of Catellus Development Corp., helped  
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt paste a ``SOLD'' sign on one of 
his company's ``For Sale'' billboards Wednesday. Catellus, a 
remnant of Southern Pacific Railroad, has wanted to sell its land 
along Interstate 40 for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising thanked David Myers, executive director of the Wildlands  
Conservancy, for brokering the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This project literally prevents the California desert from  
being sliced in half'' by development along the interstate, Myers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservancy helped raise $25.5 million in cash and land for  
the deal. Congress must approve another $36 million for its share 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the federal government gets 487,000 acres to  
manage; 437,000 from Catellus and the rest from smaller 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt doubted Congress would pass up such a public-private  
partnership, part of a conservation initiative touted Tuesday by 
President Clinton in his State of the Union Address. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot where the first 10,000 acres was transferred overlooks  
Joshua Tree National Park. It marks the boundary between the golf 
greens of Palm Springs and arid mountains where bighorn sheep are 
fast disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	As a whole, the deal would complete a network of private and  
public nature preserves stretching from the fringes of Los Angeles, 
120 miles west of here, to the Colorado River, and from Death 
Valley southward almost to Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Gets Super Bowl Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Inc., which purchased more than 5  
minutes worth of advertising for this year's Super Bowl, will 
remain the lone beer advertiser for the National Football League 
championship through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest brewer has been the lone beer advertiser on  
the past 10 Super Bowls. Bob Lachky, vice president of brand 
management for Anheuser-Busch, said Wednesday that the St. 
Louis-based brewer has also secured the exclusive rights in the 
beer category to the Super Bowl telecasts that will be carried on 
ABC in the year 2000, CBS in 2001 and Fox in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deals were not disclosed, but Fox has been getting  
an average of $1.6 million for each 30-second slot on this year's 
broadcast, which will feature the Denver Broncos against the 
Atlanta Falcons for the NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	At that rate, the 5 minutes and 15 seconds purchased by the St.  
Louis-based brewer would be valued at $16.8 million. There have 
been reports it paid as much as $2 million for each 30 second slot 
on the game to get exclusivity in the beer category. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl telecasts regularly attract the biggest audience  
of the television season, with upwards of 120 million people 
expected to tune in for at least part of this year's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch intends to feature its Budweiser, Bud Light and  
Michelob Light brands on this year's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Anheuser-Busch disclosed Wednesday that its  
top-selling Budweiser brand has become the official beer sponsor of 
the National Basketball Association. It has similar agreements with 
the NFL, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Brewing Co., the nation's second biggest brewer, had been  
the official beer sponsor of the NBA for 17 years but its contract 
expired in June 1998 and it chose not to renew. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA is expected to begin an abbreviated regular season next  
month after ending a player lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal with Budweiser were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Details Education Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- President Clinton urged Congress on Thursday to  
invest more in education and back a plan to train more retiring 
military personnel to become teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you visit with the people in the military, that make the  
military their career, you just can't fail to be impressed with the 
accumulated weight of experience,'' he said. ``They understand 
...the importance of balancing discipline and creativity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to initiatives designed to reduce class sizes and  
improve the quality of teaching, Clinton presented increased 
support for the Troops to Teachers program as a key element of his 
plan to direct qualified instructors to impoverished rural and 
inner-city communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said those who have completed their military careers  
``understand how to manage people and resources, and limited 
resources, to do a job of limitless importance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president highlighted his education proposals for fiscal  
2000 during a White House ceremony with Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
Education Secretary Richard Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that education is not only the key to our children's  
future, but also the key that will unlock the future for our 
nation,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Quality teachers make the difference 
between a child reaching his or her dreams, or reaching a dead 
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton called  
on all states to require new teachers to pass performance exams, 
and said instructors should have at least minored in the area they 
teach. Right now, 38 states require teachers to take tests to 
measure their knowledge before they can receive a teaching 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement included:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $200 million increase over this year's spending on Clinton's  
initiative to fund the hiring of 100,000 new teachers to reduce 
class size in grades one to three. 
</P>
<P>
	--$35 million for scholarships for outstanding students who  
pledge to become teachers in impoverished school districts -- up 
from $7.5 million in fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	--A new $10-million program to recruit and train 1,000 American  
Indian teachers who commit to teach in areas heavily populated by 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Many states already are spending millions on their own plans to  
achieve similar results, and it's unclear how the federal effort, 
if approved by Congress, would fit into that. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight states test their students, but only 19 link  
graduation from high school with test scores. Also, 36 states issue 
report cards on schools, but just 16 give themselves the power to 
close, take over or even rectify the failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department officials said Wednesday they were busy  
preparing proposals that would tie the $15 billion that states get 
from the federal education budget to Clinton's accountability 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress want to ensure that states and local  
school districts still maintain adequate control over schools free 
of federal interference, said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., 
chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans want those common sense education ideas -- not more  
regulations, nor federal tests, nor unfunded mandates, nor 
duplicative programs,'' Goodling said in a written response.

<HEADLINE> R.I. Women's Hoop Coach Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Linda Ziemke, coach of the Rhode  
Island women's basketball team, was suspended for two games 
Thursday and the school said her future with the team was in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Mike Ballweg said that one factor in the  
suspension was the fact that six players quit the team last year 
and two more have quit this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziemke, the coach since 1989, will miss games against Xavier on  
Friday or Dayton on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if the won-loss record is a factor,'' he said.  
``Certainly eight players leaving her is a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the situation ``sensitive,'' and said both sides are  
represented by lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziemke could be fired. Alternatively, her suspension could be  
continued or she could return to the team, Ballweg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will be coached for the next two games by assistant  
Dayna Smith, a former Rhode Island player.

<HEADLINE> USDA Redefines `Organic' Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- In a reversal, the government is  
planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any 
food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with 
antibiotics, a top agriculture official told farmers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new labeling plan responds to an outcry from farmers last  
year against an earlier set of rules the farmers considered too 
permissive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to  
protect the integrity of your industry,'' said Keith Jones of the 
Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is developing the first national standards on  
organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and 
industry guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually  
for the last seven years. In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms  
trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming 
Research Foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call  
organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides,  
herbicides or preservatives. Livestock should be raised in open-air 
environments, without antibiotics or hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the USDA proposed allowing food to be labeled  
``organic'' even if it was irradiated to kill germs, genetically 
engineered, or subjected to sewage sludge. The rules also would 
have permitted applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited 
by industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000  
protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to 
withdraw the proposal and try again. Jones shared key details of 
the department's latest proposals Thursday with the nation's 
largest gathering of organic farmers at the Ecological Farming 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding a hand-drawn paper target to his chest, he conceded that  
the federal agency has failed the organic farmers in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that in the current environment the USDA can't do  
anything right,'' he said. ``But I can tell you today we have a 
commitment to get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a generally sympathetic reception.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob  
Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is on the 
National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers. 
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, some farmers were skeptical that his verbal assurances  
may not hold once rules are published again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but  
we still believe in it. That's kind of where we are in this 
process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for 
Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,''  
said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a 
Santa Fe, N.M. company. ``For many of us, this is a continuation of 
a lifetime of work. First it was civil rights. Then it was 
anti-war. Now it's food security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules will probably be published this summer in the  
Federal Register and could take effect in the fall, said Jones.

<HEADLINE> Karl Malone, Jazz Agree on New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone and teary-eyed Utah Jazz owner  
Larry Miller said today they have agreed to agree on a new contract 
that would be signed when the NBA All-Star forward becomes a free 
agent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner and player, who had been at odds during the off-season  
and NBA lockout, said they had resolved their differences in a 
marathon meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I listened to him express concerns, excitement and dreams  
about the future,'' said the emotional Miller, who fought tears 
through a 90-minute press conference. ``The Karl Malone I know is 
still alive and well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post, citing unnamed sources, and The Salt Lake  
Tribune, which did not cite a source, said the prospective 
four-year contract would pay Malone an average of $16.5 million per 
season. The Post said the contract includes an option year. The 
Tribune said it would take effect in 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, Malone and Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, all denied  
today that any such deal had even been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have an agreement, but we can't right now,''  
Miller said, referring to a clause in the league's new collective 
bargaining agreement that forbids a veteran from signing a new 
contract until his existing one has expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was among several owners who fought unsuccessfully to  
delete that clause from the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential deal cited by the newspapers would represent the  
maximum the Jazz can offer their franchise player under the new 
collective bargaining agreement. Malone, who never has been an 
unrestricted free agent, is in the final year of a four-year, $20.2 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said Miller, Malone and Manley met Wednesday night  
at the Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is a very important person to this franchise, and I've  
always tried to do whatever we could to accommodate him,'' Miller 
said last week. ``I want him back (in Utah), and I expect he will 
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone is the only one of 10 Jazz players under contract who  
hasn't attended the team's workouts at its new practice facility in 
West Valley City during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If Malone and Miller have a deal in place, it would be another  
twist in Malone's strange odyssey since the Jazz lost their second 
straight NBA Finals in June to Michael Jordan and the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	While the lockout dragged on, Malone took up professional  
wrestling and started a sports talk show. On Nov. 11, he said he 
would demand a trade when the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he retracted the comment days later, the father-son  
relationship between Malone and Miller appeared strained. But Jazz 
executives remained confident that Malone, who never has played for 
another team, would be back for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had too many great years with Karl Malone. That type of  
commitment is something you don't take lightly and you don't 
forget,'' Jazz general manager Tim Howells said this month. ``We 
want Karl back. We want Karl to finish his career here.''

<HEADLINE> Bumpers Delivers Personal Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He retired three weeks ago after being one of  
them for 24 years. Now, former Sen. Dale Bumpers was back in the 
Senate, using humor, shrewdness and emotion to urge old comrades to 
preserve an embattled presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	As only a fellow member of the club could do, the 73-year-old  
Arkansas Democrat joked with his former colleagues. He flattered 
them. He described the goose bumps he felt whenever he walked onto 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	He even appealed to their instincts as politicians by reminding  
them that polls show an overwhelming public disposition to leave 
the impeached President Clinton in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are now and for some time have been asking  
to be allowed a good night's sleep,'' Bumpers said Thursday. ``They 
are asking for an end to this nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 53 minutes, one of the foremost orators in recent Senate  
history used his preacher's cadence and a mix of sentiment, history 
and plain language to hold the Senate spellbound for an 
extraordinarily personal plea. 
</P>
<P>
	His message: Do not remove Clinton, despite his ``indefensible,  
outrageous, unforgivable, shameless'' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he spoke, Democrats hoped Bumpers would deliver a  
passionate stem-winder of a speech that would achieve three things. 
They wanted him to solidify Democratic support for acquitting the 
impeached Clinton, tempt wavering Republicans to oppose Clinton's 
removal and provide catchy television sound bites that could appeal 
to a public that polls show already overwhelmingly supports the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was finished, dozens of senators from both parties  
crowded him to congratulate their old comrade. ``They made a good 
choice,'' Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not without irony that Bumpers found himself capping the  
argument by Clinton's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he and Clinton are both former Arkansas governors who  
have known each other a quarter century, the two men were never 
considered extremely close. In his first presidential term Clinton 
asked Sen. David Pryor, another now-retired Arkansas Democrat, when 
he wanted advice on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers, in his first Senate primary in 1974, defeated incumbent  
Sen. William Fulbright, D-Ark., a Clinton mentor. When Bumpers was 
re-elected to a third Senate term in 1986, the defeated challenger 
was federal prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, now one of 13 House 
Republicans prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial lawyer for 18 years in tiny Charleston, Ark., before  
entering politics, Bumpers was no stranger to juries. But the jury 
he addressed Thursday was one he knew intimately as an insider, and 
that was the hand he played. 
</P>
<P>
	As if he had never left, Bumpers roamed the chamber before he  
spoke, trading affectionate slaps on the shoulder and warmly 
grabbing elbows in those trademark gestures of friendship senators 
do so well. 
</P>
<P>
	When he began, he poked fun at his own career-long penchant for  
arguing in an empty chamber for lost causes. Scanning the packed 
chamber, he said, ``I'm especially pleased to see an audience that 
represents about the size of the cumulative audience I had over the 
past 24 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He named many of his one-time colleagues who had served in  
action in World War II and Vietnam, some of whom were wounded, to 
emphasize how lawmakers of all stripes had fought heroically for 
freedom. It was a clear attempt to answer remarks last week by Rep. 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chief of the House prosecution team, about 
Americans who died over the years defending the Constitution that 
Republicans accuse Clinton of violating. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kendall, the president's personal attorney, preceded  
Bumpers with a three-hour, legalistic defense of Clinton in an even 
voice. The contrast could not have been much greater. 
</P>
<P>
	Relying on handwritten notes scrawled on yellow legal paper,  
Bumpers was back in his senatorial mode. His voice rose and fell to 
fit the point he was making. Hands in pockets, he strolled away 
from the lectern in the front of the Senate chamber, his microphone 
dropping twice off his lapel and onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone Thursday was the occasional outraged tone that some  
colleagues in private said could seem preachy and annoying. He 
never yelled. He reserved most of his criticism for the idea of 
impeaching Clinton, though he did say the Republicans pressing for 
impeachment seemed to lack ``compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the four years Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has  
spent investigating Clinton, Bumpers eyed the senators and said, 
``There are few people, maybe nobody in this body, who could stand 
such scrutiny.''

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The trade deficit shot up to $15.5 billion in  
November as American exports of aircraft, computer equipment and 
farm products fell sharply while imports climbed to an all-time 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	The November deficit was up 14 percent from a revised October  
figure of $13.6 billion, the Commerce Department reported today. 
U.S. manufacturers continued to be battered by the global financial 
crisis, which has cut deeply into their export sales while 
triggering a flood of cheaper imports into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, with one month still to be counted, the U.S. trade  
deficit in goods and services has already hit an all-time high of 
$153.9 billion, surpassing the old mark of $153.4 billion set back 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	After December is counted, the deficit for the year is likely to  
climb to around $164 billion, far above last year's $110 billion. 
And economists are predicting even worse news for 1999 as 
recessions over more than one-third of the globe cut into U.S. 
exports and beleaguered Asian countries try to export their way 
back to prosperity by shipping goods to America. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said today that the  
number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits 
fell by 14,000 last week to 346,000. The decline was in line with 
expectations and left the four-week moving average for claims at 
358,500. While that was the highest level since mid-July, analysts 
say labor conditions still remain good, reflecting the robust 
overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has taken to insisting that the  
United States cannot be the ``importer of only resort'' and has 
called on Europe, the other region of the world still prospering in 
the face of global adversity, to take more goods as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on today's figures, Commerce Undersecretary Robert  
Shapiro said: ``The basic dynamic behind these data remains the 
strength of our economy and the weakness of many of our trading 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street had little reaction to the widening trade deficit.  
In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his State of the Union address this week,  
also announced the United States will push for launching a new 
global round of trade liberalization talks aimed at countering 
rising protectionist forces. 
</P>
<P>
	However, domestic political pressures are forcing Clinton to  
take a tougher protectionist line when it comes to one key 
industry, steel. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday  
that if December trade figures do not show ``substantial declines'' 
in imports of Japanese steel, the government will begin proceedings 
to slap penalty tariffs on Japanese steel imports into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade figures released today indicate that the surge in  
steel imports had begun to abate in November although steel imports 
for all of 1998 are still far ahead of the 1997 pace. Steel imports 
from Japan were down $47.3 million to $306 million in November. But 
for the first 11 months of the year, steel imports from Japan were 
up $1.27 billion to $2.88 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today for the next year it will do a special  
report three weeks ahead of the normal monthly trade figures 
covering just steel imports to better monitor developments. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in Japanese steel has contributed to a sharp widening  
in the trade gap between the world's two largest economies and led 
to growing trade frictions in a number of areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration continues to insist that until the Japanese  
government deals more forcefully with its worst recession in a half 
century, the rest of its troubled Asian nations have little hope 
from emerging from their own deep downturns. 
</P>
<P>
	While America's deficits with both Japan and China were down  
slightly in November, for the year they were running well ahead of 
the 1997 pace. For Japan, the deficit totaled $58.2 billion through 
November, up 14 percent from a year ago, and for China, the 
11-month total was $52.9 billion, an increase of 15.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the entire Pacific Rim region, epicenter of the crisis that  
began in Thailand in July 1997, the U.S. trade deficit is up a 
sharp 34 percent to $148.7 billion through November. 
</P>
<P>
	For November, imports rose 0.4 percent to an all-time high of  
$94.1 billion. This reflected big increases in imports of computer 
chips, telecommunications equipment, autos and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports fell 1.9 percent to $78.7 billion as sales of farm  
products such as soybeans, rice and wheat declined. Sales of 
manufactured goods including commercial aircraft, computer 
equipment, computer chips and telecommunications products were down 
as well.

<HEADLINE> Lobbyists Welcome Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like the wedding party in a receiving line,  
U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyists greeted their 600 guests as they 
filed into a restaurant within clear view of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the packed place, far from the chicken wings and the  
make-your-own nachos, Lonnie Taylor, the chamber's senior vice 
president for congressional and public affairs, chatted up Rep. 
John Sununu, R-N.H. As he waded through the crowd, he encountered 
freshman Rep. Gary Miller, R-Calif., then sat down for a few 
minutes at a table occupied by another first-term member of 
Congress, Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, and her chief of 
staff, Marcia Fudge. 
</P>
<P>
	It was casual -- but with a purpose.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you have people in an informal setting, you're likely to  
have a greater interaction,'' Jones said. ``Any opportunity to get 
to know a person is a great opportunity to build relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The annual event allows chamber officials to schmooze with the  
lawmakers and staffers with whom they will be working later on to 
either pass or defeat legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is just one of a number of receptions that members of the  
106th Congress and their aides are being invited to at the start of 
the new session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a staff of 10 lobbyists and we want members to know  
who they are and get to know them,'' said Angela Jones, a 
spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business, 
which has its own reception scheduled next month. ``Whenever you 
can put a face with a name and you are opening the doors for future 
working relationships, that's the whole purpose of it. It's a good 
opportunity for them to get to know us and for us to tell them what 
NFIB is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a town where the currency is a personal relationship, such  
events are investments that can pay off down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's based on a very simple fact of human life: You're more  
likely to help people that you know,'' said William T. Murphy Jr., 
a professor of government at American University and academic 
director of the school's Lobbying Institute. ``Lobbying is very 
much marketing. Most people don't make sales in marketing walking 
in cold on people they haven't met before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's event was co-sponsored by the Fluor Corp., the  
American Hotel and Motel Association and Microsoft Corp. All have 
lobbyists on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just part of our ongoing efforts in Washington,'' said  
Jack Krumholtz, director of federal government affairs for 
Microsoft, which now is defending itself in U.S. district against 
an antitrust suit brought by the Justice Department and 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Little business is discussed at these events. Rather, the  
lobbyists get to meet the members and aides, exchanging handshakes 
and small talk, and making it easier to arrange a meeting later on 
when there are issues to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	There are critics of the process.  
</P>
<P>
	``Washington is made up of personal contacts like this and the  
ability to call in chits in cases where they want to,'' said Bill 
Hogan, director of investigative projects for the Center for Public 
Integrity, a Washington watchdog group. ``They probably made 
campaign contributions to help get some of these folks elected and 
they're at the beginning stages of claiming their face time.''

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The chances are slimmer that Pete  
Sampras will lose his No. 1 ranking while sitting out the 
Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Open Champion Patrick Rafter, currently No. 4, is the only  
player who can overtake Sampras in the rankings that will come out 
after the tournament. He can do so by reaching the final. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start, five players were in the race for No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Marcelo Rios withdrew from the Australian Open because of  
a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Alex Corretja could have gained the top spot by reaching  
the semifinals. But Norway's Christian Ruud knocked him out in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 5 Carlos Moya also had a chance, but was ousted in the first  
round by Germany's Nicolas Kiefer. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya's departure ruined the chances of No. 6 Andre Agassi to  
reach the top spot. Agassi is still in the tournament, but to reach 
No. 1 he would have needed not only the points from winning the 
title, but also the bonus points he would have gained for beating 
Moya along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next rankings, Sampras is assured of being no lower than  
No. 2. Rios will be no better than No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sampras became the first player in the history of the  
ATP Tour rankings to finish at No. 1 for six consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rafter reaches the top, he would be the first Australian at  
No. 1 since John Newcombe, who was there for eight weeks in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the second round, seven of the seeds are gone,  
either beaten or, in the case of Rios and Goran Ivanisevic, 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WINNING STREAK:* Monica Seles, who never has lost a match in  
Australia, extended her winning streak at the Australian Open to 
30-0 by beating France's Alexia Dechaume-Balleret 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the only player in the 30-year Open Era with an  
undefeated record at a Grand Slam event. In her four previous 
appearances at the Australian Open, she won the title in 1991, 
1992, 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	WTA records show only four women -- including Seles -- who have  
never lost a match at a Grand Slam event in which they have 
appeared at least three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte ``Lottie'' Dod of Britain had a perfect record in five  
Wimbledon appearances in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	Molla Bjurstedt-Mallory of Norway won four consecutive U.S. Open  
titles before losing in the 1919 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Lenglen of France was unbeaten in six appearances at  
Wimbledon, the last in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ARMADA SUNK:* Spain had 14 men -- including three seeds -- in the  
Australian Open's 128-man starting field, but all were gone before 
the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	The last, 104th-ranked Julian Alonso, lost 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 to  
defending champion Petr Korda. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the seeds, No. 2 Alex Corretja lost in the second round to  
Norway's Christian Ruud, No. 4 Carlos Moya lost in the first to 
Germany's Nicolas Kiefer, and No. 12 Albert Costa lost in the first 
to Czech player Martin Damm. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain gained its 14th spot when Oscar Serrano replaced injured  
No. 1 seed Marcelo Rios in the draw. 
</P>
<P>
	But by Wednesday, he was gone, along with Albert Portas, Galo  
Blanco (who also lost to Korda), Carlos Costa, Felix Mantilla, 
Javier Sanchez, Alberto Martin, Francisco Clavet, Fernando Vicente 
and Alberto Berasategui. 
</P>
<P>
	Berasategui was the best of Spain's men at last year's  
Australian Open, reaching the quarterfinals, with victories over 
Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi along the way. He lost to Rios, the 
eventual runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MOUTH vs. MOUTH:* Jeff Tarango, a loquacious left-hander who  
went to Stanford, has challenged John McEnroe, who has those three 
things in common, to a winner-take-all match. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarango is one of several players miffed that McEnroe, now a  
fixture of the seniors tour, is saying he can beat most of the men 
on the ATP Tour. Tarango, aged 30 and ranked 72nd, says he's 
prepared to put up $200,000 if McEnroe will match it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be something that would be good for tennis  
and get a lot of people interested in it,'' Tarango said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarango said family commitments made it tough for him to put up  
any more cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, my wife spends money like it's going out of  
style, so I rummaged up 200 grand for the event because if I put 
any more up, I'm risking going into debt for the rest of my life.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Criticizes Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's private lawyer charged  
today that House impeachment prosecutors had ignored evidence that 
would exonerate the president in an ``attempt to fit some of the 
facts into a sinister pattern'' of obstruction of justice. ``The 
direct evidence disproves the charges,'' he argued as the Clinton 
team completed its opening presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodical, unrelenting and sparing no words for the president's  
critics, attorney David Kendall denounced the Whitewater 
investigation that led to the Lewinsky impeachment inquiry as 
``tortuous and meandering'' and said he was before the trial to 
rebut the ``rhetoric'' of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	His presentation came one year to the day after the Monica  
Lewinsky allegations became public and thrust the presidency into 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is more than rhetoric. It means that in  
proceedings like these, where important rights are being 
adjudicated, that evidence matters. Fairness matters. ... The 
presumption of innocence matters,'' argued Kendall, who has 
represented the president through a variety of legal controversies 
dating to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is not the monopoly of the House managers, and  
it ought to be practiced in these proceedings as well as talked 
about in speeches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closing statement invoking Thomas Jefferson and George  
Washington, Kendall pleaded with senators to ``cool the passions of 
the moment'' and cast aside the ``poisonous partisanship'' of the 
House impeachment vote. ``We ask only that you give this case and 
give this country the constitutional stability and the political 
sanity which this country deserves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, a high-powered Washington trial lawyer, was to be  
followed by one of the Senate's best orators of recent years, 
just-retired Democrat Dale Bumpers of Arkansas. Bumpers was to make 
an appeal to his former colleagues to reject the House work as a 
rush to judgment and to spare the country an unworthy conviction of 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's criminal lawyer focused his attack on the  
impeachment article accusing Clinton of obstruction, saying it was 
``based on circumstantial evidence, and that evidence is at best 
profoundly ambiguous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His assessment of the House prosecutors' case was harsh. At one  
point, he ridiculed as ``entirely untanable '' Rep. Bob Barr's 
assertion last week that Clinton tried to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in 
New York to avoid a subpoena in the Paula Jones sexual harassment. 
``She was just as vulnerable to subpoena in New York as 
Washington,'' Kendall retorted. 
</P>
<P>
	He dissected in great detail the allegation that Clinton had  
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	With a touch of sarcasm, Kendall read Ms. Lewinsky's testimony  
that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job 
for my silence.'' And then he asked, ``Is there something difficult 
to understand here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall noted that Ms. Lewinsky had testified she believed she  
was filing a true affidavit when she denied having ``sexual 
relations'' with the president and that Clinton ``showed no 
interest in viewing'' the affidavit before it was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	He charged that those were ``obviously exculpatory'' facts that  
``the House managers simply ignored in their attempt to fit some of 
the facts into a sinister pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators will soon get their first chance to ask questions of  
the two sides, submitting those queries through Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist. That questioning is expected to begin Friday and 
continue Saturday. Some 70 questions have been submitted by 
Republicans so far, a GOP spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said they oppose dismissal of the charges and  
support the need for limited live testimony from key witnesses such 
as Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and presidential 
secretary Betty Currie -- and they should get their way with a 55-45 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with a two-thirds majority needed to make Clinton the  
first president evicted from his job, Democrats hold the votes for 
acquittal and show no signs of backing a move to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.  
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union 
address Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to 72 
percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One well-known conservative Republican, evangelist and  
broadcaster Pat Robertson, said Clinton pulled off such a public 
relations coup in the address that there is no chance he will be 
convicted. ``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing 
and get on with something else,'' he said on ``The 700 Club'' 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, in town to attend a Senate  
lecture series sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., declined a chance to discuss the impeachment trial. But 
speaking in the Old Senate Chamber Wednesday evening, the former 
Republican president lamented that today in Washington, ``we are 
confronted with a deficit of decency -- one that deepens by the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's defense before senators Wednesday, Deputy White  
House Counsel Cheryl Mills argued that House managers ignored 
testimony from Mrs. Currie in order to falsely accuse the president 
of trying to obstruct the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those facts, those stubborn facts that just don't fit,''  
Ms. Mills said.

<HEADLINE> Author's Brother Seeks New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- They are two men united by blood and separated  
by circumstance: John Edgar Wideman, a distinguished author, and 
his younger brother, Robert, who is serving a life sentence for a 
1975 murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than two decades after the crime, the brothers could  
be reunited outside prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Robert won a new trial based on the novel legal  
argument that the shooting victim might have lived if not for 
shoddy medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an argument culled from a $100,000 malpractice settlement  
the victim's family reached eight years after the slaying. And for 
Robert Wideman, now 48, it represents his first real hope of 
freedom in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegheny County Judge James McGregor ruled in November that the  
jurors might have convicted him of a lesser charge had they known 
Nickie Morena's death was partially caused by substandard medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are appealing the ruling. If the decision is upheld,  
Wideman's lawyer, Mark Schwartz, said his client would consider 
pleading guilty to third-degree murder, provided he is sentenced to 
time served. Third-degree murder carries 20 to 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is arguing that Wideman is innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be simpler if it were a matter of, `Is he guilty or  
not guilty?''' said John Edgar Wideman, an award-winning author who 
wrote the 1984 book ``Brothers and Keepers'' about the case and 
teaches at the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're saying is the new evidence should have been heard  
by a jury. How the jury would react to that evidence, how they 
would treat it, is not something we can argue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Brothers and Keepers,'' Wideman wonders how he and his  
brother took such different paths, one leading to literary 
celebrity, the other to the state prison in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	John Edgar Wideman was Ivy League-educated, attending the  
University of Pennsylvania, and was only the second black ever to 
be named a Rhodes Scholar. His brother earned his college degree 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``However numerous and comforting the similarities, we were  
different,'' the author wrote. ``The world had seized on the 
difference, allowed me room to thrive, while he'd been forced into 
a cage. Why did it work that way? What was the nature of the 
difference? Why did it haunt me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to say: ``The intertwining strands of DNA that  
determine a creature's genetic predispositions might serve as a 
model for this complexity, but the double helix, bristling with 
possibilities, is not mysterious enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers' different paths also are echoed in the family's  
next generation. John's daughter, Jamila, led Stanford University 
to three consecutive NCAA Final Four basketball appearances, then 
joined the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA. But one of his sons, 
Jake, is serving a life term for killing a teen-ager. And Robert's 
son, Omar, was shot to death at 21. 
</P>
<P>
	After the murder that landed Robert Wideman in prison, John was  
almost thrown in jail himself as an accomplice because he gave 
Robert and his cohorts a night of shelter in Wyoming while they 
were on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter that I lived 400 miles from the scene of the crime.  
No matter that I wrote books and taught literature and creative 
writing at the university. I was black. Robby was my brother,'' 
Wideman wrote. ``Those unalterable facts would always incriminate 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Morena's family is unhappy with the prospect  
of a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like reliving it all over again. It's like I just buried  
him,'' said the victim's 68-year-old mother, Clara Morena. The 
Widemans are ``trying to say the doctor killed him. Not them, not 
the gun. I can't blame the family. But in my heart, I can't forgive 
nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morena, a used-car salesman, was killed in what John Edgar  
Wideman described in his book as a case of dishonor among thieves. 
A group of men -- Robert among them -- offered to sell Morena stolen 
TV sets from the back of a truck, then tried to rob him at 
gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	When Morena ran, Robert yelled for someone to shoot him -- and  
Michael Dukes obliged. (Dukes is now serving a life sentence.) 
Morena died several hours later when emergency room doctors failed 
to use a chest tube to drain blood from his wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If proper treatment had been rendered in timely fashion, he  
would have survived,'' said Dr. Cyril Wecht, Allegheny County's 
coroner in 1975 and today. ``I really don't think it's a close 
call, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Hirsch, who teaches criminal law at Duquesne University  
and has followed the case, predicted the ruling granting Wideman a 
new trial will be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the case law around the country has generally said is, if  
you injure someone so that death is likely, and death results, we 
don't care if the doctors are also a contributing factor,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Religious Riots Kill 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Religious violence spread in eastern  
Indonesia today when rioting among Christians and Muslims flared 
for a third straight day. At least 24 people have been killed in 
clashes on two islands and fighting erupted on a third, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of police and troops were flown in to restore order  
after mosques, churches and houses were set on fire. Almost 3,000 
residents were sheltered at military camps and police stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all are frightened now,'' said one woman who identified  
herself by the single name of Rosdiana. ``We are getting out with 
our children. The men will stay behind to guard our houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The worst carnage occurred on Ambon Island, 1,400 miles  
northeast of Jakarta, where 22 people have been killed since 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	People were stabbed, beaten or trapped in burning buildings, an  
officer at Ambon's main hospital said. Some were attacked with 
rocks, machetes, clubs and bows and arrows. Police said 134 people 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people burned to death during a riot Wednesday night on  
Sanana Island, about 185 miles northwest of Ambon. Police imposed a 
nighttime curfew after Muslim mobs burned two churches and many 
houses owned by Christians, said Sanana police Sgt. Parno. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,  
making it the world's most populous Islamic country. However, 
Ambon, Sanana and Seram Island, where two churches were burned, 
have large Christian populations. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is grappling with its worst  
economic crisis in three decades. Soaring inflation, unemployment 
and poverty rates have increased social tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Outbreaks of rioting and looting, along with clashes among rival  
followers of rival faiths, have escalated in Indonesia since 
student protests and unrest forced President Suharto to step down 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
	During his authoritarian 32-year rule, Suharto used the military  
to crack down on lawlessness and dissent. But since his departure, 
the armed forces has found it increasingly difficult to control 
disorder while it fends off allegations of past human rights 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The rioting started on Ambon Tuesday night after Muslims  
attacked a man from a neighboring Christian-dominated village. They 
accused him of being drunk and of insulting their Islamic beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic fighting continued after 3,000 riot police and troops  
were deployed, including many who were flown in from other islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The violence is as bad as it was on the first day,'' one  
police officer said today on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The riots started during one of the holiest feasts on the  
Islamic calendar, Eid al-Fitr, which comes at the end of the holy 
month of Ramadan and is supposed to be a time of peace and 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate fighting involving rival ethnic groups, four men  
were killed Monday and Wednesday in clashes at Parit Setia village 
in Borneo, about 560 miles north of Jakarta, the official Antara 
news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Star Publisher Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eugene S. Pulliam, publisher of The  
Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News and a staunch defender 
of press freedom during a 64-year news career, has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam died Wednesday night, said Cynthia Whisler, funeral  
director at Crown Hill Funeral Home in Indianapolis. She didn't 
know the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam became publisher after his father, Eugene C. Pulliam,  
died in 1975. The Star won the Pulitzer Prize that same year for an 
investigation of police corruption and in 1991 for a series on 
medical malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, Pulliam assailed the smear tactics of Sen.  
Joseph McCarthy and throughout his career defended the free speech 
protections of the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	He served on a special committee of the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors formed to investigate McCarthy's attack on New 
York Post editor James Wechsler. Pulliam concluded that the tactics 
of McCarthy were ``not only a threat to the freedom of the press, 
but also a peril to America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1991 interview he said, ``I think newspapers will continue  
to be the only sizable check on government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He could be critical as well of the news media. When he believed  
the press unfairly attacked vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, 
his nephew and at the time a Republican senator from Indiana, 
Pulliam defended him in a signed editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``During a political campaign that abounded with attacks on his  
career, he kept his head high,'' Pulliam wrote after the 
Bush-Quayle ticket was elected in 1988. ``He refused to be upset by 
unfair and inaccurate reporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle once described him as ``a man of independence and honor,  
and a leader who views life in terms of serving others and 
improving our city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam was born Sept. 7, 1914, in Atchison, Kan., and got his  
first newspaper job after his family moved to Indiana, delivering 
papers as a grade school boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during summer vacation from study at DePauw University,  
he earned 5 cents an item writing news briefs for the Lebanon 
Reporter. He also was active in Sigma Delta Chi, now known as the 
Society of Professional Journalists. It was co-founded at DePauw by 
his father 25 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating in 1935, Pulliam joined United Press, which  
later became United Press International, working in the news 
service's bureaus in Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Indianapolis in 1936 to become news director at  
radio station WIRE, then owned by his father, and became a familiar 
voice to central Indiana listeners of the era. 
</P>
<P>
	After Navy service during World War II, he joined the Star,  
which his father had purchased in 1944. He worked as aviation 
editor, assistant city editor and city editor. When the elder 
Pulliam bought the afternoon News in 1948, Pulliam became the 
paper's managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, Pulliam became assistant publisher of the Star and the  
News. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Pulliam was appointed executive vice president of  
Central Newspapers Inc., parent company of the Pulliam newspaper 
group, which included The Muncie Star and The Muncie Press -- later 
combined as the Star Press -- The Vincennes Sun-Commercial, the 
Alexandria (La.) Daily Town Talk, and in Arizona, The Arizona 
Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, which ceased publication in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as publisher of the two Indianapolis papers at his  
father's death. 
</P>
<P>
	He was active in professional news organizations, serving on the  
board of The Associated Press Managing Editors and as president of 
the American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Jane, whom he married in 1943, Pulliam  
is survived by daughters Myrta J. Pulliam, director of electronic 
news and information for Indianapolis Newspapers Inc., and Deborah 
S. Pulliam of Castine, Maine, a free-lance writer; son Russell B. 
Pulliam, editor of the News; and grandchildren Christine Ruth, 
Daniel Eugene, John Russell, Sarah Louise, David Wilson and Anna 
Jane Pulliam.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Criticize Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of Democratic lawmakers denounced the  
Clinton administration's proposal to spend more than $100 billion 
on increased defense spending over the next six years, suggesting 
it reflects an unwillingness on his part to confront the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could go back in history and change one thing, I would  
probably give President Clinton two years of military service so 
that he would not be so easily intimidated by military opposition 
to his policies,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to concerns about military readiness by Pentagon  
leaders and many in Congress, Clinton is expected to propose the 
first increase in defense spending in more than a decade when he 
presents his budget to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing that in his State of the Union address on Tuesday,  
Clinton said he would ask Congress for $12 billion more in defense 
spending for fiscal 2000, which begins next Oct. 1, as the first 
installment in a six-year plan to spend an additional $110 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the congressional reaction to the plan so far has come  
from Republicans and moderate Democrats who have welcomed the 
proposed increase -- or suggested that it was too small. 
</P>
<P>
	But presenting a contrary view, Frank and a dozen other  
politically liberal lawmakers told a news conference that the 
increase was unwarranted -- given lessened world tensions in the 
post-Cold War era -- and that the money should be spent on domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the tricks of being a Democratic congressman is that  
you support the president, but you try to make him stronger on the 
places that he's weak,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich, the senior 
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee who was a staunch Clinton 
defender in the impeachment vote. ``Nobody's perfect. He needs help 
on the military system, and we're here to provide it for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's really a debate about priorities, and I think  
this represents on the part of the president a set of distorted 
priorities, which I think reflect distorted power relationships 
here in Washington,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the president's announcement is a misguided one,''  
said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ``The Cold War has ended. Why are 
we doing this?''

<HEADLINE> NBA Player Transactions Get Started </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Everyone was calling it the busiest day in NBA  
history, and yet it still could have been busier. 
</P>
<P>
	The official opening of league business Thursday had something  
missing -- the signings of many of the biggest free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen's deal didn't immediately go through, something  
strange was holding up the Antonio McDyess signing, and the other 
dominoes couldn't fall until those two did. 
</P>
<P>
	The job of processing each and every new contract and trade was  
a slow one on the first full non-lockout day since June 30, and the 
expected signings of McDyess, Vlade Divac, Jerry Stackhouse, Hot 
Rod Williams, Christian Laettner and Joe Smith were delayed for one 
reason or another. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago general manager Jerry Krause said the new player  
contracts were so different from past ones that there was a backlog 
in the league office. 
</P>
<P>
	Several deals went through, including Latrell Sprewell being  
traded from Golden State to New York, and most of the teams opened 
training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so unorganized, it was incredible,'' Miami coach Pat  
Riley said. ``You have to deal with a chaotic, 
fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants routine. We had guys with physicals, 
getting contracts signed. We have to move guys in and out of 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it doesn't look like the chaos will end anytime soon.  
</P>
<P>
	Teams will have only a few days to practice before beginning  
exhibition games, and the regular season will begin Feb. 5. Each 
team will play 50 games in 90 nights. 
</P>
<P>
	For some of the players, the small amount of preparation time  
will make it difficult to get back into game shape quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Kemp of the Cleveland Cavaliers had been carrying around  
at least 20 extra pounds during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my 10th season. My condition is not too bad,'' Kemp  
said before going through practice with the Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Shawn Kemp gave every ounce he could out there  
today,'' Cleveland coach Mike Fratello said. ``He understands we 
all have some work to do. He worked hard. I don't know how much 
more he could have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams were finally allowed to start signing contracts and  
finalizing transactions at 2 p.m. EDT. The league had a full staff 
of attorneys on hand to process each of the deals, and a few 
complications arose to slow the process down. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no apparent hitches in clearing the first deal, a  
trade sending Sprewell to the New York Knicks for John Starks, 
Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell brings a tarnished reputation to a team anxious over  
the public relations risk. He was suspended for 68 games last 
season and had his contract terminated after he choked and 
threatened to kill coach P.J. Carlesimo at a Warriors practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three years ago, when the Knicks traded Anthony Mason to  
Charlotte, team president Checketts made an issue of saying the 
team would only bring in solid citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell hasn't exactly fit that description.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot has happened in my thinking over past 48 hours or so,''  
Checketts said. ``For me to make the statement I made about not 
wanting certain players on our team, I guess I would have to say 
it's pretty judgmental and self-righteous, and I regret having said 
those things because it's not fair for me to judge people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks reiterated that they were not interested in signing  
free agent forward Dennis Rodman, who retired earlier this week and 
then changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to elaborate on his plans Friday night on the ``Tonight  
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley, was in Salt Lake City to announce  
that another of his clients, Karl Malone, would be staying with the 
Utah Jazz for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always been committed to keeping Karl in a Jazz uniform  
for the rest of his career ... and I am sure that we're going to be 
able to do that,'' teary-eyed Jazz owner Larry Miller said. ``I'd 
like to have an agreement right now, but that's not possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Miller hadn't spoken for weeks before an intense,  
lengthy conversation on Wednesday night. They said they emerged 
from the meeting with a verbal agreement to work out a lucrative, 
long-term deal as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to playing my career out here in Utah,''  
said the 35-year-old Malone.

	``You say things sometimes that you wish you wouldn't have said.

<P>
	McDyess' return to Denver hit a roadblock when he and the  
Nuggets could not reach a contract agreement that appeared to be a 
done deal only 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, traded from Denver to Phoenix 15 months ago, flew to  
Denver on Thursday and was in the halls of McNichols Arena for a 
scheduled 3 p.m. news conference. His introduction was put off 
until 5:30 and ultimately postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't ready to do anything yet,'' Nuggets general manager  
Dan Issel said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked when a deal might be reached, Issel said, ``I have no  
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel, McDyess and his agents were holed up Thursday night in  
the Nuggets' locker room, apparently trying to resolve their 
differences.

<HEADLINE> Williams Closes Career at Hula Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- Ricky Williams played his first game as a  
freshman for Texas in 1995 against the University of Hawaii, an 
easy Longhorns victory thanks in part to his 95 yards rushing and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years, 6,279 yards and a Heisman Trophy later, the career  
NCAA rushing leader is back in Hawaii to close his college career 
at the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering that first game, Williams said he had no idea he would  
rewrite 20 NCAA records and 44 Texas records, help revive the 
Longhorns program and put himself in position to be one of the 
first players chosen in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, I was playing fullback; I think I got 10  
carries that game,'' Williams said Thursday after his first 
practice with the South team. ``I never thought I'd be here today. 
It's just been a great ride for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams decided before the season that he wanted to end his  
career on Maui at the Hula Bowl, admitting part of the reason he 
came back for his senior year was to play in an All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you grow up you watch all the All-Star games,'' he said.  
``I was kind of upset last year because juniors couldn't play. I 
really wanted to be a part of something like this my whole 
career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, though, had to find time for the game in between  
accepting awards and attending banquets that will keep him 
traveling for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams flew to Hawaii on Wednesday from Dallas, where on  
Tuesday he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best 
running back. After the Hula Bowl, it's back to Austin for a parade 
with the football team, then off to the Super Bowl, then to his 
hometown of San Diego for another awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just the start of it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then the ESPY (Awards) in New York on the 15th and then the  
Maxwell Award on the 23rd and the Touchdown Club in Columbus (Ohio) 
on the 20th, then I go to Walter Camp on the 25th of February,'' 
Williams said. ``I think then I go to baseball,'' spring training 
with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams admits he's a bit out of shape for playing football,  
but said he told South coach Mike Price he wants to play as much of 
the game as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a healthy guy so I'm not going to get too out of shape,''  
he said. ``Coach, I think he figured I didn't want to play much, 
but he asked me and I said I want to play the whole game if 
possible. I came here to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scout Tom Braatz of the Miami Dolphins said Williams' condition  
will be factored in by scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been on airplanes and receiving a lot of awards, so we  
know he's not going to be in peak shape,'' Braatz said. ``He's not 
going to be like he was when he finished that last game.''

<HEADLINE> Heroin-Related Deaths Rise in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The number of heroin deaths in the Seattle area  
reached a record last year, frustrating city officials trying to 
shed the city's image as a center for heroin abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we thought we might be getting a handle on this,''  
said Dr. Henry Ziegler, head of the prevention division for the 
Seattle-King County Department of Public Health. ``We aren't 
getting a handle on it. This has been going up dramatically as a 
cause of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's image as a magnet for heroin problems was magnified by  
the 1994 suicide of Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for the group 
Nirvana who had struggled with heroin addiction before he shot 
himself. Since then, the problem has only gotten worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 138 people died from heroin, surpassing the record of  
134 in 1996 and much higher than the 111 deaths in 1997, county 
health officials reported this week. Heroin deaths were roughly at 
triple the levels of the mid-1980s, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Seattle is not alone. A federal study in 1997 identified  
Seattle, Baltimore, Newark, N.J., and San Francisco as the top 
cities in the nation for per capita heroin-related problems, based 
on emergency room admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	And last July, a double-suicide in Portland, Ore., by two  
addicts who hanged themselves from a bridge above the Willamette 
River focused attention on that city and state's growing heroin 
problem. In 1997, there were 161 heroin-related deaths in Oregon, 
more than any other drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study released last year by the Office of National Drug  
Control Policy, nearly 14 percent of the men arrested in Portland 
and 27 percent of the women tested positive for heroin or related 
opiates. The rate among women was the highest of all 23 major U.S. 
cities studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Why Seattle has such a severe heroin-abuse problem is a matter  
of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziegler said one possible reason for the increased deaths might  
be the availability of purer forms of heroin that can be smoked. 
``A lot of kids think, `I'm not shooting it so I'll be OK,''' he 
said. ``That's one of those suicidal misconceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another explanation might be inadequate access to treatment. A  
study a few years ago found that the county had at least 20,000 
opiate addicts with only 1,750 treatment slots available. 
</P>
<P>
	State law limits each clinic to 350 patients -- a restriction the  
Legislature in Olympia is considering changing. The Senate is 
holding a hearing Friday on a bill that would lift the cap and 
allow for the training of family physicians to treat addicts in 
their offices.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The president and chief executive of the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange is resigning after two years in the position. 
</P>
<P>
	T. Eric Kilcollin said today his resignation will be effective  
in 60 days, but he has agreed to stay longer if needed until a 
successor is found. 
</P>
<P>
	``My challenge was to help position the CME for continued growth  
in the extremely dynamic risk management business,'' Kilcollin said 
in a statement. ``With a strong strategic plan, excellent 
financials and an exceptional staff now in place, my job is 
completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kilcollin first joined the exchange in 1981, serving as chief  
economist from 1982 until 1990 and chief operating officer from 
1990 to 1994. He left in 1994 to become chief executive officer of 
the Investment Services Group at Wells Fargo Nikko Investment 
Advisors, then returned to the exchange in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He took office as president in February 1997.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. OK Farmers Trust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's four largest cigarette  
companies agreed Thursday to establish a $5.15 billion trust fund 
to help tobacco farmers who face a shrinking market because of the 
industry's settlement with states. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund will be financed by contributions over 12 years  
by Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco 
Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., said industry lawyer Phil 
Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies reached the agreement after two days of tense  
negotiations with five governors. Reynolds was reluctant to pay 
into the fund and instead wanted to promise to buy more 
American-grown tobacco to provide a stable market for growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many details need to be worked out, the trust fund can  
be tapped by farmers and tobacco quota owners by applying to 
independent trustees, yet to be named, North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said he hoped that farmers in his state, the largest  
tobacco producer, could get payments in a few months from the fund 
to make up for lost income because of declining cigarettes sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, which already had reached settlements totaling  
$40 billion with four states, agreed last year to a $206 billion 
settlement with the remaining 46 states that had sued to recover 
health care costs. Part of that agreement was to meet and devise a 
way to help farmers who would be hurt by lessened demand for their 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco companies' payments into the trust fund will depend  
on their market share. Philip Morris has committed to pay $300 
million into the fund this year, while the other companies will pay 
a total of $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The second year, the companies would deposit a total of $280  
million; the third year, $400 million; years four-10, $500 million 
a year; the 11th year, $440 million; and the 12th year, $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Major tobacco states in the talks were Virginia, North Carolina,  
South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Others involved 
were Maryland, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Alabama and Ohio 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes said the agreement will ``give some  
certainty to our farmers and some comfort to their bankers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all leave here today winners,'' Hunt said, ``with a  
positive outlook for a measure of financial assistance for our 
tobacco farmers.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Quayle To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle reportedly  
will go on cable television tonight to outline his plan to seek the 
Republican nomination for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am uniquely positioned and prepared to be president. I can  
assure you I am serious. I am committed,'' Quayle said in today's 
Indianapolis Star and News. He is to discuss his plans tonight on 
CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, who moved from Indiana to Arizona in 1996, said his  
campaign headquarters will be in Phoenix, but major campaign 
announcements will come in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to announce the formation of an exploratory  
committee in Indianapolis early next month and will formally 
announce his candidacy in April in Huntington, where he was raised, 
The Star and News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, George Bush's vice president and running mate in 1988  
and 1992, calls himself a credible candidate whom the public will 
take seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be different for me this time around, running  
for president,'' he said. ``I will be in control. My agenda. My 
campaign. My staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 51, said he will push for a 30 percent across-the-board  
tax rate reduction and emphasize foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has a wide fund-raising base and is well established in  
the early primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential GOP candidates include Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Ohio Rep. John Kasich, 
Elizabeth Dole, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, broadcaster Pat 
Buchanan, millionaire Steve Forbes and religious activist Gary 
Bauer.

<HEADLINE> Segregated Cemetery Fence Torn Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- For more than 160 years, an iron fence ran  
through the cemetery here, making sure that blacks and whites, who 
lived apart in life, also rested apart in death. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, with the help of 75 blacks and whites, the rusting  
fence was removed, piece by piece, once and for all. The gesture 
toward racial harmony came just days before the scheduled trial of 
one of three white men charged in last year's dragging death of a 
black man. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many of us, this fence has been a symbol of segregation in  
our community,'' Father Ron Forsage said in prayer as work went on 
around him. ``Give us the power and strength through this rotten 
and broken fence to repair the fences in our own lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fence had been in the cemetery since it opened in 1836. Some  
of those on hand for the removal cried when it was finally torn 
down by volunteers and city employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish my mother was here to see this,'' said Faye White, a  
black Jasper resident, as she hugged several friends after the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper, an east Texas town with a population of 7,500, was  
thrust into the national spotlight last June by the killing of 
James Byrd Jr., who was chained to the back of a pickup and dragged 
to his death along backwoods roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men -- John King, 24, and Shawn Berry, 23, both of Jasper,  
and Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur Springs -- have been charged with 
capital murder in what prosecutors say was a racially motivated 
crime. King goes on trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
	After Byrd's death, city leaders and clergy formed the Mayor's  
Task Force 2000 to help bridge racial divides. The cemetery fence, 
they decided, was a highly visible symbol and should come down. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladora Coleman, a black teacher at Jasper Middle School, said  
her college friends were amazed when they learned of the divided 
cemetery several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never really dwelled on it,'' Ms. Coleman said. But after  
Byrd's death, she said, ``You just started noticing these little 
things, little divisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Coleman went to the cemetery Wednesday, camera in hand,  
planning to discuss the fence with her students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go back and say, `We made history today. Our town is  
coming together,''' she said.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A Nicaraguan military plane delivering  
supplies to bases on the Atlantic coast crashed Thursday, killing 
all 28 people aboard, the military reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Antonov AN-26 plane was heading from Managua, the capital,  
to the port city of Bluefields 180 miles to the east. Nine 
soldiers, 15 civilians and four crew members were on the flight, 
the Army reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The civilians were relatives of soldiers stationed at the bases.  
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash was not known. The plane was found 10  
miles south of Bluefields, said army spokesman Captain Milton 
Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was still burning when rescue crews arrived and there  
were no survivors, he said. Air Force helicopters and Navy boats 
were sent to the area to recover the bodies. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae, NAACP Form Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to help more black families become  
homeowners, mortgage giant Fannie Mae and the NAACP have formed a 
partnership that will provide up to $110 million in financing for 
families that can't afford big down payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the partnership announced Thursday, Fannie Mae will  
provide financing for qualified black borrowers who will be able to 
put down as little as 3 percent to 5 percent of a home's value. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program also is designed to help at least 20,000 black  
families get information on home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials noted that while 73 percent of white families own  
their own home, only about 45 percent of black and Hispanic 
families are homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae also committed to finance an unlimited amount of  
mortgages for qualified families recommended by the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's 
oldest civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional credit requirements will be eased for black families  
whose credit histories were marred by burdensome medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came a week after Fannie Mae offered new options making  
mortgage insurance cheaper for all homebuyers who cannot afford big 
down payments -- a change that will substantially benefit minority 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put all of our will and wallet behind it,'' Franklin  
Raines, Fannie Mae's new chairman and chief executive officer, told 
a news conference. He said the goal is to allow blacks to become 
homeowners ``without discrimination, without exclusion and without 
needless barriers and burdens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae has helped the NAACP generate more than $120 million  
of mortgage financing for its clients over the past five years, and 
the new program should help double or triple that amount, Raines 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kweisi Mfume, NAACP president and chief executive officer, said  
the partnership is intended to help families that are ``looking for 
a way up and a way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae is a congressionally chartered, publicly traded  
company that buys mortgages from original lenders such as banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal lender in the new program is BankAmerica Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	Raines said the changes will make conventional home mortgages  
more competitive with those insured by the Federal Housing 
Administration, part of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, another 
government-chartered mortgage market company, compete with the FHA. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year nationwide program will begin in Atlanta; Austin,  
Texas; Baltimore; Charlotte, N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla.; Gary, Ind.; and Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, Fannie Mae also will:  
</P>
<P>
	--Help the NAACP establish new Community Development Resource  
Centers, which provide information and counseling on home 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	--Examine ways to help the NAACP attract money for down payments  
for eligible borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae, which describes itself as the world's biggest  
financial services company that is not a bank, retains some of the 
mortgages in its portfolio and packages others into securities for 
resale to investors. The company reported last week that its 
profits rose to a record $3.4 billion last year from $3.05 billion 
in 1997, boosted by continued growth in its mortgage business.

                        *Roderick M. Chisholm    	
</P>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Roderick M. Chisholm, an influential  
figure in contemporary philosophy, died Tuesday at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Chisholm, who taught for four decades in the philosophy  
department at Brown University, was a leading thinker in the branch 
of philosophy known as epistemology, or theory of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1957 book, titled ``Perceiving: A Philosophical Study,''  
tackled a metaphysical issue that has been debated by philosophers 
for centuries -- whether you can trust your senses to give you 
reliable knowledge of the outside world. A realist, Chisholm 
concluded that you can. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he was selected to be the subject of a volume in the  
``Library of Living Philosophers,'' a collection that examines the 
views of the world's great thinkers. In that series, Chisholm's 
thoughts joined those of 24 other 20th century intellectual giants, 
including Bertrand Russell, John Paul Sartre and Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Chisholm's many publications are ``Realism and the  
Background of Phenomenology'' and ``The Princeton Studies: 
Humanistic Scholarship in America.'' 

</P>
<P>
                          *Lucille Kallen    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucille Kallen, the only woman on the team of  
comedy writers behind Sid Caesar's ``Your Show of Shows,'' died 
Monday of cancer. She was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, which starred Caesar and Imogene Coca, was  
broadcast live on Saturday nights from 1950 to 1954 and is 
considered a classic of television's golden age. Kallen was among a 
handful of female television comedy writers working at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The writers who put together ``Your Show of Shows'' were so

</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eugene S. Pulliam, who started out  
delivering newspapers as a school boy and rose to be publisher of 
The Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News, died Wednesday. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star won the Pulitzer Prize twice during his tenure for  
investigations on police corruption and medical malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam got his first newspaper job as a grade school boy  
delivering papers for the Lebanon Reporter, which his father, 
Eugene C. Pulliam, had purchased, and The News. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam joined United Press in 1935, which later became United  
Press International, working in the news service's bureaus in 
Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo, N.Y. He became news director at radio 
station WIRE in Indianapolis in 1936, then also owned by his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, he joined the Star, which his father bought  
in 1944, working as aviation editor, assistant city editor and city 
editor. When the elder Pulliam bought the afternoon News in 1948, 
Pulliam became the paper's managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, he served on a special committee formed to investigate  
Sen. Joseph McCarthy's attack on New York Post editor James 
Wechsler. Pulliam concluded McCarthy was ``not only a threat to the 
freedom of the press, but also a peril to America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, Pulliam became assistant publisher of The Star and The  
News, taking over as publisher of the papers when his father died 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years earlier, Pulliam was appointed executive vice  
president of Central Newspapers, the parent company of the Pulliam 
newspaper group and publisher of the Indianapolis newspapers, The 
Muncie Star and The Muncie Press -- later combined as the Star Press 
-- The Vincennes Sun-Commercial, the Topics Newspapers of suburban 
Indianapolis, the Alexandria (La.) Daily Town Talk, and in Arizona, 
The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, which ceased 
publication in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He was active in professional news organizations, serving on the  
board of The Associated Press Managing Editors and as president of 
the American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Jane, Pulliam is survived by daughters  
Myrta J. Pulliam, director of electronic news and information for 
Indianapolis Newspapers Inc., and Deborah S. Pulliam, a free-lance 
writer; son Russell B. Pulliam, editor of the News; two 
half-sisters and six grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toichi Shito, the farmer who for more than 30 years  
stood in the way of plans to expand Japan's main international 
airport, died Thursday of heart failure. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Shito, who owned land that the government wants to turn into a  
second runway for the busy Narita airport outside Tokyo, lived on 
the site with his wife. He was one of the most stubborn of a 
handful of farmers who blocked airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown turned violent during the 1970s when the farmers  
used pointed sticks and crude barriers to defend themselves against 
the bulldozers and riot police sent to evict them. 
</P>
<P>
	Shito's oldest son, Takao, 48, who will inherit the land,  
pledged to continue farming the plot, according to Kyodo news 
service.

                          *Susan Strasberg    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Strasberg, the actress daughter of acting  
coach Lee Strasberg and a close friend of Marilyn Monroe, died 
Thursday of cancer. She was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg made her Broadway debut playing Anne Frank in  
1955. She starred in ``Time Remembered,'' with Richard Burton and 
Helen Hayes in 1957. She had roles in films like ``Picnic'' in 
1954, and ``Stage Struck'' in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress appeared in at least 23 films and television  
productions, including ``Frankenstein,'' a 1973 television version 
of the horror classic, and in the 1988 ``Prime Suspect'' with Frank 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg and her family were close confidantes of Monroe.  
Her father, who coached the ``method'' approach to acting, coached 
the star through movies including ``Bus Stop'' and ``Some Like it 
Hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg's memoir, ``Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and  
Friends,'' recalled her close relationship with Monroe. She also 
wrote about the troubled actress in an earlier autobiography, 
``Bitter Sweet.''

<HEADLINE> Ameritech, SBC, Lucent Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications Corp., Baby Bells that  
will unite this year, reported strong earnings growth for 1998 
Thursday. Lucent Technologies Corp.'s earnings rose, but its 
revenue growth failed to impress analysts. 

</P>
<P>
 *Ameritech Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech Corp. said earnings rose 24.9 percent in the fourth  
quarter, due to strong sales overseas and a one-time gain on the 
sale of some local phone exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter, Ameritech reported profits of $762 million, or  
68 cents a diluted share, compared with $610 million, or 55 cents a 
diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $4.44 billion, up 7 percent from  
$4.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings include two one-time items: an after-tax gain of  
$102 million, or 9 cents a share, from the sale of 19 local phone 
exchanges in Wisconsin, and an after-tax charge of $24 million, or 
2 cents a share, for charges associated with the early redemption 
of $1.3 billion in long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the one-time items, earnings for the quarter would have  
risen 12.1 percent from a year ago, to $684 million, or 61 cents a 
diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected Ameritech to  
earn 61 cents a share. Shares of Ameritech slipped $1.87 1/2 to 
$67.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Ameritech earned $3.61 billion, or $3.25 a  
share, up 57 percent from $2.3 billion, or $2.08 a share, in 1997. 
Without the one-time items, earnings for 1998 grew 11.4 percent to 
$2.61 billion, or $2.35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Ameritech Chairman Richard Notebaert said the  
company's revenue growth has been fueled by its data communications 
business, European partnerships and U.S. wireless business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech provides local phone service in Illinois, Wisconsin,  
Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. It is expected to complete its $78.2 
billion merger with SBC by the middle of this year. 

</P>
<P>
 *SBC Communications Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	SBC reported an 18-percent increase in fourth-quarter profits,  
driven by growth in data and vertical services. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter earnings were $756 million, or 38 cents per  
diluted share, up from $642 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, 
in the same period last year. SBC had revenues of $7.7 billion, 
compared with $7.1 billion in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth quarter included a one-time loss of $60 million for  
the early retirement of debt and costs related to a merger with 
Southern New England Telecommunications. Without extraordinary 
charges, SBC would have earned $1.1 billion, or 55 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected SBC to earn  
54 cents per share. Shares of SBC fell $1.31 1/4, or 2 percent, to 
$57.18 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for 1998 was $4 billion, or $2.03 per diluted share,  
on revenues of $28.8 billion. That compares with $1.67 billion, or 
85 cents per diluted share, on revenues of $26.7 billion for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding an 'extraordinary loss', one-time charges and an  
accounting change, SBC earned $4.1 billion, or $2.08 per diluted 
share, up from $3.5 billion, or $1.76 per diluted share, the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said data services revenues increased 32 percent in 1998 
and vertical services revenues increased nearly 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Vertical services include special features such as caller  
identification and voice-messaging. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC's telephone companies added 308,000 access lines during the  
quarter, and wireless operations added 384,000 net subscribers in 
the quarter. 

</P>
<P>
 *Lucent Technologies    	
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications equipment maker Lucent said earnings in its  
fiscal first quarter nearly doubled, largely due to a one-time gain 
that reflected a change in the way the company accounts for 
pensions and post-retirement benefits 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income increased by a more modest 16 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the October-December quarter was $2.7 billion, or  
$2 a share on a diluted basis, compared with 61 cents in the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results included a one-time gain of $1.3 billion due to the  
accounting change, and a one-time after-tax charge of $14 million 
associated with the acquisition of Quadritek Systems Inc., a maker 
of Internet-related software 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time items, earnings would have risen 26  
percent to $1.4 billion, or $1.05 per share. Analysts surveyed by 
First Call Corp. expected Lucent to earn $1 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up 16 percent  
from $1.8 billion a year ago, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's revenues were up 5.5 percent to $9.2 billion, from $8.7  
billion in the year-ago quarter, fueled by sales of Definity 
enterprise communication servers and chips for high-speed 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected steeper revenue growth, although they said  
Lucent's accounting methods were responsible for part of the 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently seized on the revenue figures, sending  
shares of Lucent down $8.56 1/4, or 7 percent, to $106.93 3/4 on the 
NYSE. Lucent was the most active stock on the NYSE, with more than 
20 million shares trading hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent announced last week that it will buy Ascend  
Communications Inc. in an $18.7 billion stock deal, as well as 
Kenan Systems Corp., a maker of software for billing and customer 
service, for $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., includes the Bell  
Laboratories research and development operation.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm X Stamp Goes on Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A commemorative postal stamp honoring Malcolm X  
goes on sale today, honoring the man who once was shadowed by the 
FBI because of his activism. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm X, who was assassinated in a Harlem ballroom in 1965,  
``was a visionary, a man who dreamed of a better world and dared to 
do something about it,'' Postal Service Governor S. David Fineman 
said in unveiling the 33-cent stamp Wednesday at Harlem's Apollo 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm X joined the Nation of Islam in 1952 and became a fiery  
orator who advocated black nationalism in the early 1960s. He was 
often followed by government agents suspicious of his motives and 
views toward whites. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1964 falling out with Nation founder Elijah Muhammad led  
Malcolm to start a splinter group, the Organization of 
Afro-American Unity, and to found a mosque in Harlem. Three black 
Muslims were convicted of Malcolm's murder, which was witnessed by 
his family.

<HEADLINE> Sunoco Net Income Up 79 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Despite sagging revenues, Sunoco Inc.'s  
earnings rose 79 percent in the fourth quarter as improved 
efficiency and lower crude oil prices gave the refining company's 
profits a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunoco's earned a net profit of $52 million, or 55 cents a  
share, for the last three months of 1988. A year earlier, quarterly 
profits were $29 million, or 25 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 16 percent to $2.14 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sunoco beat analysts' forecasts of 50 cents a share, as reported  
by First Call Corp. The company's stock rose 43 3/4 cents to close at 
$34.62 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Bud Davis said revenue sagged partly due to  
tighter profit margins on fuels -- including gasoline that routinely 
sold for less than $1 a gallon -- and chemicals, while sales of 
those products remained virtually flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributing to the higher profits was an $18 million increase  
in earnings at the company's Sun Northeast Refining unit due to 
improved efficiency and lower crude oil prices. Income from the 
manufacture of coke used in steelmaking increased $7 million due to 
production from a new coke plant at East Chicago, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Sunoco's net income rose 6 percent to $280  
million, or $2.95 per share, from $263 million, or $2.70 a share, 
for 1997. Revenue for 1998 was $8.58 billion, down from $10.53 
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia-based Sunoco is one of the country's largest  
independent oil companies, operating five U.S. refineries and 
marketing Sunoco gasoline in 17 states from Maine to Virginia and 
west to Indiana. The company sells lubricants and petrochemicals 
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> GOP Delays Spending Part of Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans will accept President  
Clinton's suggestion to avoid spending most of the budget surplus 
while lawmakers work out an agreement on saving Social Security, a 
key committee chairman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can speak for the Republican majority in saying  
that we will accept the president's offer and commit to reserving 
62 percent of the surplus until we save Social Security,'' Ways and 
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said at a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, however, signaled the start of what is sure to be a  
difficult fight over how exactly to use the money to fix Social 
Security -- not to mention how the other 38 percent of the surplus 
should be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we put this money aside, it would give us a great  
opportunity to cut taxes,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, on the other hand, has proposed spending about 26  
percent of the surplus on the military and other domestic programs. 
Among those is Medicare, the health insurance program for the 
elderly and disabled that, like Social Security, is in danger of 
being financially overwhelmed by aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on  
Ways and Means, said the limited agreement with Republicans on 
allotting the surplus ``is one heck of a great beginning.'' In 
turn, Rangel said he is willing to discuss the tax cuts Republicans 
want. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has jurisdiction in the House over both taxes and  
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his State of the Union address Tuesday, suggested  
using 62 percent of government budget surpluses expected over the 
next 15 years to bolster Social Security's cash reserves. Of that 
money, he said about a quarter should be invested by the government 
in the stock market in hopes of increasing its value, which would 
be a first for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest would be kept just as the retirement program has always  
held its extra cash: in Treasury bonds. But in a departure from the 
past, Clinton proposed barring lawmakers from using the proceeds of 
those bonds -- essentially money borrowed from Social Security by 
the rest of the government -- for any purpose other than paying down 
the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republican lawmakers favor using some of the surplus to  
bolster Social Security and to reduce the national debt. After 
Clinton first called a year ago for reserving the surpluses during 
a period of public dialogue, the House voted to cull just 10 
percent for a tax cut, but Senate Republicans blocked that. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican leaders strongly oppose having the  
government invest money in the stock market, fearing political 
interference. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan this week 
added his influential voice to that opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials say they believe the Social  
Security investments could be insulated from politics -- perhaps by 
an independent board that would oversee the work of private 
investment managers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, even some Democrats are skeptical the idea can get  
through Congress. ``That's a serious dispute. I do not think it's 
going to be resolved,'' Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, many Republicans propose having individual Americans do  
the investing, by diverting some of the taxes now deducted from 
their paychecks into new personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's ... allow the American people to be empowered instead of  
empowering the government,'' former GOP vice presidential nominee 
Jack Kemp testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has sided with Democratic congressional leaders and  
civil rights and labor leaders who oppose substituting individual 
investments for Social Security's guaranteed benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security should remain a program of shared security,  
not one of individual risk,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson. However, 
Jackson said he could support the new retirement accounts that 
Clinton has proposed to supplement Social Security, ``as long as 
they remain an additional program to spur saving, not rake off 
Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants 11 percent of the budget surplus over 15 years to  
subsidize working Americans' own contributions to 401(k)-style 
accounts, with more government dollars going to those with lower 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplemental accounts could be a basis for bipartisan  
compromise, since some Republicans have proposed similar plans.

<HEADLINE> Bumpers' Speech Defending Clinton-5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of closing argument before the Senate of former Sen. Dale  
Bumpers, D-Ark., in President Clinton's defense, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	But I came home to a generous government who provided me, under  
the GI Bill, an education in a fairly prestigious law school, which 
my father could never have afforded. And I practiced law in this 
little town for 18 years; loved every minute of it. But I didn't 
practice constitutional law, and I knew very little about the 
Constitution. But when I went into law school, I did study 
constitutional law -- though, Mr. Chief Justice, it was fairly 
arcane to me. 
</P>
<P>
	And tried reading The Federalist Papers and Tocqueville -- all of  
those things law students are expected to do -- that was tough for 
me, I confess. 
</P>
<P>
	So after 18 years in law practice I jumped up and ran for  
governor and I served as governor for four years, and I still -- I 
guess I knew what the rule of law was, but I still didn't really 
have much reverence for the Constitution. I just did not understand 
any of the things I just got through telling you. 
</P>
<P>
	No, my love for that document came day after day and debate  
after debate right here in this chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of you perhaps read an op-ed piece I did a couple of weeks  
ago when I said I was perfectly happy for my legacy of a 24-year 
senator to be I never voted for a constitutional amendment. And it 
isn't that I wouldn't. I think they made a mistake not giving you 
fellows four years. You're about to cause me to rethink that one. 
</P>
<P>
	And the reason I developed this love of it is because I saw  
Madison's magic working time and time again, keeping bullies from 
running over weak people, keeping majorities from running over 
minorities. And I thought about all the unfettered freedoms we had. 
The oldest organic law in existence made us the envy of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Chairman, we've also learned that the rule of law includes  
presidential elections. That's a part of the rule of law in this 
country. We have an event, a quadrennial event in this country, 
which we call ``presidential elections.'' And that's the day when 
we reach across this aisle and hold hands, Democrats and 
Republicans. And we say, ``Win or lose, we will abide by the 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a solemn event, presidential elections, and it should not  
-- they should not be undone lightly. Or just because one side has 
the clout and the other one doesn't. And if you want to know what 
men fought for in World War II, for example, or in Vietnam, ask 
Senator Inouye. 
</P>
<P>
	He left an arm in Italy. He and I were in the presence at  
Normandy on the 50th anniversary. But we started off on Anzio. 
</P>
<P>
	Senator Domenici, were you with us?  
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the most awesome experiences I've ever had in my  
life -- certified war hero. I think his relatives were in an 
internment camp, so ask him what he was fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
	Or ask Bob Kerrey, certified Medal of Honor winner, what was he  
fighting for. You'll probably get a quite different answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Senator Chafee, one of the finest men ever to grace this body  
and certified marine hero of Guadalcanal -- ask him. 
</P>
<P>
	And Senator McCain, a genuine hero -- ask him.  
</P>
<P>
	You don't have to guess. They're with us, and they're living.  
And they can tell you. And one who is not with us here in the 
Senate, Robert Dole. Ask Senator Dole what he was fighting for. 
Senator Dole had what I thought was a very reasonable solution to 
this whole thing that would handle it fairly and expeditiously. 
</P>
<P>
	The American people are now and for some time have been asking  
to be allowed a good night's sleep. They're asking for an end to 
this nightmare. It is a legitimate request. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm not suggesting that you vote for or against the polls. I  
understand that. Nobody should vote against the polls just to show 
their mettle and their courage. I have cast plenty of votes against 
the polls and it's cost me politically a lot of times. This has 
been going on for a year, though. 
</P>
<P>
	And in that same op-ed piece I talked about meeting Harry Truman  
my first year as governor of Arkansas. Spent an hour with him. An 
indelible experience. People at home kid me about this, because I 
very seldom make a speech that I don't mention this meeting. But I 
will never forget what he said, ``Put your faith in the people. 
Trust the people. They can handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have shown conclusively time and time again that they can  
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleagues, this is easily the most important vote you will ever  
cast. If you have difficulty because of an intense dislike of the 
president -- and that's understandable -- rise above it. He is not 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be gone. You won't. So don't leave a precedent from  
which we may never recover and almost surely will regret. 
</P>
<P>
	If you vote to acquit, Mr. Leader, you know exactly what's going  
to happen. You're going back to your committees, you're going to 
get on this legislative agenda, you're going to start dealing with 
Medicare and Social Security and tax cuts and all those things 
which the people of the country have a nonnegotiable demand that 
you do.

	If you vote to acquit, you go immediately to the people's  
agenda. If you vote to acquit, you go immediately to the people's 
agenda. But if you vote to convict, you can't be sure what's going 
to happen. James G. Blaine was a member of the Senate when Andrew 
Johnson was tried in 1868, and 20 years later he recanted. And he 
said: ``I made a bad mistake.'' And he says, ``As I reflect back on 
it, all I can think about is having convicted Andrew Johnson would 
have caused much chaos and confusion in this country than Andrew 
Johnson could ever conceivably have tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so it is with William Jefferson Clinton. If you vote to  
convict, in my opinion you're going to be creating havoc than he 
could ever possibly create. After all, he's only got two years 
left. So don't, for God's sakes, heighten people's alienation that 
is at an all-time high toward their government. 
</P>
<P>
	The people have a right and they are calling on you to rise  
above politics, rise above partisanship. They're calling on you to 
do your solemn duty. And I pray you will. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's one-stop shopping, courtesy of your  
local government. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the Knoxville Center mall can buy a pair of shoes,  
check on their taxes and get a new passport, thanks to an unlikely 
new tenant: a satellite office of the Knox County courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nice and convenient,'' said Matt, who came this week  
with fiance Lynn to get her driver's license renewed. They ended up 
getting a marriage certificate, too, but didn't want their last 
names used. Said Matt: ``Nobody is supposed to know we are going to 
get married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to go downtown, but we saw we could get it right  
here,'' Matt said. The pair got both licenses in about 20 minutes -- 
about as much time as it would have taken to drive to the county's 
19th century courthouse in downtown Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
	It's just the latest example of governments following residents  
to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is challenging,'' said Knox County Clerk Mike Padgett.  
``But I have found that taking government to the people and 
bringing it to their locations has been very successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first glance, the new 6,000-square-foot mini-courthouse near  
JC Penney, appears to be like the other 130 storefronts in the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
	But inside, leading off a small brick courtyard, are essential  
government services -- car titles and license plates, driver's 
licenses, business permits, property tax services and postal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a computer classroom for free access to the  
Internet and community-based World Wide Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Sirvello, president of the 2,200-member International  
Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials and 
Treasurers, said Knox County appears to be riding the crest of a 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirvello, who is administrator of elections for Harris County in  
Houston, Texas, said early voting in non-traditional locations has 
been well-received there. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it would only stand to reason that having these services  
available at a shopping mall ... would definitely be (popular),'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of courthouse customers who linger to shop or eat in  
the food court excites Knoxville Center owner Simon Debartelo Group 
Inc. of Indianapolis, the nation's biggest shopping mall owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have these types of operations in other centers around the  
country, but I don't think any of those are as elaborate as what 
Mike has put together in Knoxville,'' Knoxville Center manager Mark 
Bell said. ``Hopefully this will be a prototype that we can show in 
other markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But downtowns suffered in the 1960s and 1970s when their stores  
fled to suburban shopping malls. If local governments are doing the 
same exodus, what will happen to center-city revitalization 
efforts? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think making government more convenient to constituents  
should always be the goal of government,'' said Tom Ingram, 
president and chief executive of the Knox Area Chamber Partnership. 
``We have to create other reasons for people coming downtown than 
just government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Padgett knows some downtown businesses aren't pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten all kind of flak,'' he said. ``But I'm sorry, I  
don't see any people down there. I don't see any businesses down 
there. I'm going to go where the people are.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Patient on Soc. Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key House committee chairman says  
Republicans are willing to set aside most of the budget surplus 
until lawmakers can agree on a solution to Social Security's 
financial problems, as President Clinton has asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be willing to reserve 62 percent of the surplus until  
Social Security has been saved,'' Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, 
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee said today. He still 
intends, however, to push for tax cuts with the rest of the 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer and many Republicans still do not agree with the details  
of the Social Security rescue plan outlined in the president's 
State of the Union speech Tuesday. GOP lawmakers especially dislike 
Clinton's proposal to have the government invest some Social 
Security money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on  
Ways and Means, said an agreement on allotting the surplus ``is one 
heck of a great beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel said that in turn, he is willing to discuss the tax cuts  
Republicans want. He said the idea of government stock market 
investments do not have to be a sticking point on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can put that on the side. That's a serious dispute. I do  
not think it's going to be resolved,'' Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee has jurisdiction over both taxes  
and Social Security in the House. Today the panel was questioning 
the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr, chairman of the Rainbow/PUSH 
Coalition and former Republican vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp 
about their views on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has suggested using 62 percent of government surpluses  
over the next 15 years to bolster Social Security's cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the president will push for the  
government to invest about a quarter of that money in the stock 
market, despite swift criticism, not only from congressional 
Republicans, but also Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly share the concern that such investment be  
independent and nonpolitical ... but we feel that we are capable of 
doing this wisely and safely,'' said presidential adviser Gene 
Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's opposition, voiced in testimony Wednesday before the  
Ways and Means Committee, did not catch the White House off guard -- 
he has expressed it before. Also, Greenspan offered enthusiastic 
support for Clinton's overarching plan to use budget surpluses for 
Social Security -- especially because it would have the indirect 
effect of reducing the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my judgment, that's all to the good,'' Greenspan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the influential Fed chairman's disdain for  
government investment in the stock market, combined with opposition 
from Republicans who control Congress, could scuttle an important 
part of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on current projections the portion of the surplus Clinton  
wants to invest in stocks would amount to around $40 billion a year 
for the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the surplus Clinton wants for Social Security --  
about another $2 trillion -- would be kept just as Social Security 
has always held its extra cash: in Treasury bonds. But in a 
departure from the past, Clinton proposed barring lawmakers from 
using the proceeds from those bonds -- essentially money borrowed 
from Social Security by the rest of the government -- for any 
purpose other than paying down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposed that another 11 percent of the surplus go  
toward new government-subsidized 401(k)-style retirement accounts 
for most American workers. Many Republicans generally support such 
an idea. 
</P>
<P>
	But without the earnings it assumes would come from the stock  
market, Clinton's plan would fall about five years short of a key 
goal: keeping Social Security from running short of cash for 55 
years. That might mean an increase in pressure for other changes in 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will urge members of Congress to help devise a way the  
Social Security investments could be made with minimal political 
influence -- perhaps by an independent board appointed for long 
terms. Some congressional Democrats are already working on it. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents say political problems are unavoidable. Would the  
government invest in companies it is suing, for example? 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibilities for abuse in that arrangement are  
unlimited,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Vice President Issues Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The IOC vice president apologized Thursday for  
the worst corruption scandal in Olympics history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, a Canadian member of the IOC and the body's top  
investigator, said the affair had left the committee ``profoundly 
disappointed'' and he apologized to fans, athletes and the people 
of Salt Lake City for the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to express our sincere apologies for the actions of  
certain IOC members,'' said Pound, who spoke to an audience of 
sports marketing leaders. ``Their conduct has been completely 
contrary to everything the Olympic movement has worked so hard to 
represent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his six-member investigation panel would release its  
report in Lausanne, Switzerland, this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``These actions are also an affront to the Olympic athletes who  
have inspired us through the years and whose lives so poignantly 
embody the Olympic ideals,'' he said. ``... Moreover, the IOC would 
like to express its deepest regrets to the people and community of 
Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve IOC members are known to be implicated in the scandal but  
Pound would not identify them and would not say what actions would 
be taken against them. Earlier, IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch said that the majority faced expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said his investigation had found no evidence of  
criminal activity, but said the behavior of a few members of the 
115-member committee could not be tolerated. He also said Salt Lake 
City won the 2002 Games ``because it produced the best, most 
comprehensive bid. End of story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are as well prepared as a city can be and they will,  
without a doubt in my mind, produce the greatest Winter Games we 
have seen to date,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, skittish Olympics sponsors called for an end to the  
investigation into the bribery allegations and the improprieties 
dealt with once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, USOC marketing director, said two companies that  
were close to final agreement on Salt Lake sponsorships have 
``asked that the announcement of sponsorship be withheld until the 
results of the investigation are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are ongoing. I believe they are solid,''  
Krimsky said. ``But until there is a signed contract, they could 
back out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky refused to identify the companies, but said their  
involvement would be ``above entry level,'' each worth more than 
$25 million in cash and services. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as one investigating panel prepared to issue its  
report, one more probe was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Attorney General Jan Graham said Wednesday she will begin  
the fifth independent inquiry -- but not until the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee's ethics panel and the IOC release their 
reports. The U.S. Olympic Committee and the Justice Department also 
are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said her office will not duplicate the federal  
investigation, but instead will examine potential violations of 
Utah criminal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound told The Washington Post that there ``is solid,  
irrefutable evidence'' at least a dozen IOC members or their 
relatives received cash, gifts, or donations directly or indirectly 
from the Salt Lake City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games, in 
several cases more than $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see it in black and white, it's pretty blatant stuff,  
so I don't think the people involved are going to be able to 
explain it away. But we'll see,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Peter Tallberg, a Finnish member of the IOC for 23  
years, denied that his three sons working in Olympic bidding cities 
bore any significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to fear, and my conscience is fully clean,''  
Tallberg said. ``There is nothing special in the employment of my 
sons. The IOC has no rules against normal friendly and family 
connections. I have not done anything contrary to the IOC 
regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tallberg's youngest son, Peik, worked at a plumbing company  
owned by Paul Henderson, chairman of Toronto's bid for the 1996 
Summer Games. His middle son, Andreas, worked in Stockholm when the 
Swedish capital was bidding for the 2004 Summer Games, and his 
eldest son, Mathias, worked for an advertising agency in Sydney 
after the Australian city was elected to host the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be wrong to use one's connections,'' Tallberg said.  
``I will do so in the future too. I have arranged for many Finns to 
work in the Olympic movement.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Objects to US Treaty Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- U.S. plans to develop a national system for  
defense against attack by long-range missiles threaten Russia's 
security, a top Defense Ministry official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, fearing a possible attack by a hostile nation  
like North Korea or Iraq, wants to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty so it can start building a missile-defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Thursday that Defense Secretary  
William Cohen was misunderstood when he mentioned to reporters on 
Wednesday the possibility of abandoning the treaty, which prohibits 
a national defense against missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary did not threaten to withdraw from the treaty,''  
said Robert Bell, director of defense programs on the National 
Security Council. He said the administration has not decided 
whether to amend the ABM treaty, or if so what changes may be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Defense Ministry dismissed Cohen's explanation of U.S.  
fears of attack by a rogue state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any military expert understands that these states have not,  
and, in the near future, will not have guaranteed means of 
delivering weapons to U.S. territory,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid 
Ivashov, chief of international cooperation at the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Any changes to the ABM treaty would be regarded ``as a threat to  
Russian security interests,'' Ivashov was quoted as saying by the 
Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, former security chief Alexander Lebed  
also spoke out against Washington, saying that Moscow must not 
ratify the long-delayed START II treaty for the reduction of 
nuclear arms because it would irreparably weaken Russia, according 
to an article published Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebed, a provincial governor and a top presidential aspirant,  
argued that parliament's ratification of the 1993 treaty would 
deprive Russia of its most powerful missiles and force it to build 
expensive new weapons to keep up with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin was still considering the  
American amendments to the ABM treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. missile defense would not be deployed until 2005 --  
assuming that President Clinton determines that such a system is 
technically feasible, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, and before it the Soviet Union, has long opposed a U.S.  
national missile defense. The Cold War-era ABM treaty was meant to 
leave both superpowers vulnerable to attack and thus limit the 
chance that either would attempt a decisive first strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivashov said ``attempts to bypass the ABM treaty would upset  
strategic stability'' in the world and may jeopardize long-delayed 
ratification of the START II arms reduction treaty by the Russian 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebed, for his part, directly condemned START II, saying its  
implementation would be ``an irreparable blow'' to Russia's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its ratification must be put off the agenda,'' said Lebed,  
governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk province in Central Siberia, in an 
article in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta. 
</P>
<P>
	As governor, Lebed also has a seat in the Russian parliament's  
upper house, which would have to approve the START II treaty for it 
to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate approved START II in 1996, but the Russian  
parliament has delayed ratification, citing arguments similar to 
Lebed's. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's cash-strapped government has lately supported  
ratification, saying that by 2007 -- the START II deadline for 
halving Russian and American arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each 
-- Russia will have to scrap its aging nuclear missiles anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebed countered that it would be cheaper to modernize the old  
missiles than to continue producing more modern strategic bombers 
and nuclear submarines. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev rejected Lebed's call and  
reiterated his support for START II on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia needs this treaty and will benefit from it,'' Sergeyev  
said, according to the Interfax news agency. ``It's in line with 
our national interests.''

<HEADLINE> Sears, Roebuck Earnings, Sales Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.'s  
fourth-quarter profits fell after the retailer took a series of 
one-time charges and suffered from declining clothing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Jan. 2, the nation's largest  
department store operator on Thursday reported net income of $535 
million, or $1.39 a diluted share, compared with $536 million, or 
$1.35 a diluted share, the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were affected by charges related to the sale of  
Western Auto and the pending sale of its HomeLife division. A 
change in accounting standards also reduced 1998 fourth-quarter 
earnings by $37 million, or 9 cents a share, and increased 1997 
fourth-quarter earnings by $24 million or 6 cents a share, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those charges, earnings rose 11.7 percent to $572  
million, or $1.48 a diluted share, from $512 million, or $1.29 a 
diluted share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were slightly above Wall Street expectations of  
$1.46 a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call 
Corp. At the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 
Sears' stock fell $1.68 3/4 a share to $40.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues tumbled 7 percent to $12.16 billion from $13.1 billion  
as sales at stores open at least a year, an industry measure of 
performance, fell 0.3 percent in December, 3.6 percent in November 
and 1.9 percent in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Sears has continued to struggle with clothing  
sales as consumers shunned moderately-priced department store 
clothes in favor of more upscale stores and specialty retailers 
such as the Gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Those losses have failed to offset continued healthy big-ticket  
sales of appliances, large-screen televisions and camcorders.

	``Although the arrival of colder weather during the holidays  
spurred seasonal apparel sales, quarterly apparel results were 
disappointing,'' said Arthur C. Martinez, the company's chairman 
and chief executive. ``Several categories did well, however, 
including women's special sizes, jewelry, cosmetics and fragrances. 
Off the mall, our hardware and dealer stores continued to perform 
well.''

	Sears also noted its credit-card business performed far better  
during the quarter as the retailer benefited from a decrease in the 
number of delinquencies and efforts to improve its debt-collection

to $245 million from $623 million in the same quarter a year 
earlier.

	Clinton Lawyer Decries Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House impeachment prosecutors ignored evidence  
that exonerates President Clinton, his private lawyer told the 
Senate today. David Kendall claimed the House managers attempted 
``to fit some of the facts into a sinister pattern'' of obstruction 
of justice. ``The direct evidence disproves the charges,'' he 
argued as the Clinton team completed its opening trial 
presentation. It came one year to the day after the Monica Lewinsky 
allegations became public and sparked a crisis.

	President Offers Education Details  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today offered a plan to  
funnel retiring soldiers into the nation's classrooms as teachers. 
He said schools need more teachers who have ``the accumulated 
weight of experience.'' The president said his budget plan for 
fiscal 2000 will contain $18 million for a program to train people 
who are retiring from active duty military service to become 
teachers. 

</P>
<P>
	Surplus Debate May Be Postponed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has asked Republicans to set  
aside most of the budget surplus until lawmakers can agree on a 
solution to Social Security's financial problems. Rep. Bill Archer 
of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, says the GOP is 
willing to comply. ``We would be willing to reserve 62 percent of 
the surplus until Social Security has been saved,'' Archer said. He 
still intends, however, to push for tax cuts with the rest of the 
surplus.

	Iraq Discussing French UN Proposal  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi and French diplomats are discussing  
ways to amend a French proposal that would ease U.N. sanctions but 
still monitor Baghdad's weapons programs, government officials 
said. They said France's top diplomat in Baghdad, Charge d'Affaires 
Yves Aubin de la Messuziere, is negotiating with Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq Aziz on how to make the proposal palatable to Iraq 
without antagonizing the United States.

	Tennessee Tornado Sirens Didn't Work  
</P>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- Emergency alert sirens malfunctioned as a  
killer storm bore down on this western Tennessee town, county 
officials said. Six Madison County residents were killed in the 
storm Sunday night, dozens were injured and hundreds of homes were 
destroyed. Two other people died in other counties. Many were 
within the estimated one-mile hearing radius, said Madison County 
Commissioner Jim Ed Hart. Eight of the city's 20 sirens failed in 
tests today.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A Nicaraguan military plane delivering  
supplies to bases on the Atlantic coast crashed today, killing all 
28 people aboard, the military reported. The Antonov AN-26 plane 
was heading from Managua, the capital, to the port city of 
Bluefields 180 miles to the east. Nine soldiers, 15 civilians and 
four crew members were on the flight, the Army reported. The cause 
of the crash was not known.

	IOC Vice President Issues Apology  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee's vice  
president apologized today for the worst corruption scandal in 
Olympics history. Dick Pound, a Canadian member of the IOC and the 
body's top investigator, said the affair had left the committee 
``profoundly disappointed'' and he apologized to fans, athletes and 
the people of Salt Lake City for the problems. ``We'd like to 
express our sincere apologies for the actions of certain IOC 
members,'' said Pound, who spoke to an audience of sports marketing 
leaders.

	Brazil Stocks, Currency Fall

<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stock and currency values  
dropped sharply today, despite approval by Congress of a pivotal 
austerity measure. The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange, Latin America's largest, closed down 4.8 percent. The 
real, trading freely against the dollar since Friday, slipped to 
1.71 against the U.S. currency from the previous day's close of 
1.58.

	Stocks Off; Dow Down 57.41  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower in late afternoon after an  
influential Wall Street analyst warned that the ``bubble'' in 
Internet stocks might be ready to burst. Just before the close, the 
Dow industrials was at 9278.50, down 57.41. On the NYSE, losers led 
gainers 1,924-1,109. The Nasdaq was at 2,368.43, down 47.06.

	NBA Is Back in Business  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA officially reopened for business today,  
and it was certain to be the busiest day in league history. A 
roomful of lawyers was ready in the league's ``War Room,'' prepared 
to start clearing dozens, if not hundreds, of trades and free agent 
signings. Practically all of the league's 29 teams were ready to 
make trades, sign nearly 200 free agents and open training camps.

<HEADLINE> Austin Signs $15m Deal With Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Penny Hardaway was determined to do  
whatever it took to get free agent Ike Austin in an Orlando Magic 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I offered him my house on weekends, my car -- anything that  
might help him make up his mind,'' the All-Star guard joked 
Thursday. ``I wanted him here that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out, Hardaway was quite a salesman.  
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting an opportunity to make more with other teams, Austin  
signed a three-year, $15 million contract to fill Orlando's void at 
center as training camp began for the lockout-shortened NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really do feel with me coming here, and the guys they have  
here, that we can be contenders. It's going to take a lot of work. 
But I think everybody has the effort and wants to put it in and 
wants to win,'' the sixth-year pro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway speculated that Austin, who stayed at the Magic star's  
home while working out in Orlando earlier this month, could have 
commanded a salary of as much as $9 million annually if he had 
signed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But Austin, who became friends with Hardaway while he was  
playing for the Miami Heat two years ago, had his heart set on 
continuing his career in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true, I probably could have gone other places,'' said  
Austin, who was traded from Miami to the Los Angeles Clippers last 
February. ``But in my head, I was stuck on Orlando. I felt it was 
an opportunity as a player to expand, to play with great players, 
to play with Penny, who I think can advance my game. And at the 
same time, I think it will help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To clear room under the salary cap to sign Austin, the Magic  
traded second-year forward Johnny Taylor and the rights to rookie 
Keon Clark of Nevada-Las Vegas to the Denver Nuggets in exchange 
for a first-round pick in this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the team announced the signing of one of its own free  
agents, guard Darrell Armstrong. The club also was working on 
re-signing Derek Strong, Gerald Wilkins and Danny Schayes, as well 
as deals with rookies Michael Doleac, Matt Harpring and Miles 
Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season begins Feb. 5 at home against the New York  
Knicks. The revised 50-game schedule includes home dates against 
the Houston Rockets (Feb. 21) and Los Angeles Lakers (March 21). 
</P>
<P>
	As happy as coach Chuck Daly was to address a need for a  
low-post scorer and strong inside defensive presence by signing 
Austin, the coach was just as enthusiastic about welcoming back a 
healthy Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star has missed 86 games over the past two  
seasons because of knee and leg injuries that not only raised 
questions about his durability, but his commitment to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about relief. That's where it starts'' Daly said.  
``You know from what you've seen that with a healthy Penny Hardaway 
this team has a chance to beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway averaged 16.4 points, four rebounds and 3.6 assists in  
19 games last season, when he was the subject of year-long trade 
rumors despite his insistence that he wanted to remain with the 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think I have a little to prove,'' he said. ``A lot of  
people lost a lot of confidence in me because I was injured and 
didn't play last year. ... I've set some goals for myself that I'm 
going to keep personal and just try to go out and play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Austin, Hardaway feels the Magic have the  
capability of being one of the best three teams in the Eastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 center was the NBA's most improved player two  
seasons ago with the Heat and his statistics improved last year 
after moving from his role as a backup with Miami (12.7 points, 6.3 
rebounds in 52 games) to a starter with the Clippers (15.2 points, 
8.7 rebounds in 26 games). 
</P>
<P>
	Filling in for the injured Alonzo Mourning at the beginning of  
the 1997-98 season, Austin averaged 18.9 points and 9.3 rebounds 
over a 22-game stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to get the respect right away. We're going to  
have to earn it,'' Hardaway said. ``But we know how good we can be 
with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who feels Orlando has a chance to be one of the more  
physical teams in the league, thanked Hardaway for recruiting 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Penny ever goes Penny-less, he could have a future in  
sales,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have upgraded our team dramatically,'' Daly added,  
turning to speak directly to Austin. ``I thought we had a lot of 
pieces in place. With Penny back healthy, I really truly believe we 
can play with anyone. I really feel good about where we can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic still may be in the market for a scorer. Among the  
players the team may consider signing is Cedric Ceballos, another 
friend Hardaway has been trying to woo to Orlando.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushing Air Competition Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a March 31 deadline, Congress is  
pushing for early action on major legislation to improve airports 
and ensure aviation competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying more and more for less and less real  
service,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	He is sponsoring legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation  
Administration and help some of the smaller aviation markets hit by 
deregulation of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate last year failed to reconcile differences  
on competing bills, forcing lawmakers to pass a temporary six-month 
measure to keep the FAA operating. That extension March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and  
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., have 
promised to move quickly to pass their respective bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bills are similar in many respects, but differ in key  
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster wants to make sure that all future airline ticket tax  
revenues go to aviation improvements and not the general federal 
budget. McCain is committed to increasing flights, particularly to 
underserved smaller markets, from four large airports -- O'Hare in 
Chicago, LaGuardia and JFK in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington 
National. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill, nearly identical to legislation that passed the  
Senate 92-1 last year, would reauthorize the FAA for two years and 
provide about $2.4 billion each year for the Airport Improvement 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	It would create 30 new slots -- each equivalent to a takeoff and  
landing -- at O'Hare, with 18 to go to underserved communities. 
</P>
<P>
	National would add 12 round-trip flights, six of which would go  
beyond 1,250 miles. That is the limit set by the 1986 ``perimeter 
rule'' to protect the economic viability of Dulles and 
Baltimore-Washington, the region's two long-haul airports. Only 
aircraft with the lowest noise levels could be added. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for aviation at the  
Transportation Department, agreed with McCain that perimeters and 
slots hurt consumers and ``are no longer required for safety and 
operational control.'' But he said noise and local development 
remain issues in expanding flights out of busy airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died last year in part because House Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., resisted the addition of 
flights at O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also would set up a four-year pilot program to expand  
service to smaller markets; require the Transportation Department 
to look into marketing and other aviation industry practices that 
may inhibit competition; and put regulations on commercial air tour 
flights over national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said last week that his committee would pass a sweeping  
aviation bill by the end of February that reauthorizes the FAA for 
five years and ensures that all the money in the Airport and Airway 
Trust Fund goes to airport programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport taxes this year will generate some $10 billion in  
revenues, but less than $6 billion will be used on airport 
construction. The rest remains in the general budget, to be used to 
balance the budget or on other programs.

<HEADLINE> Utah Seeks More Olympic Oversight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Seeking more influence over the 2002  
Winter Games, state lawmakers advanced a bill Thursday that would 
create an oversight committee with the power to draft legislation 
and analyze Olympic finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The buck stops in the Legislature,'' said Rep. Jordan Tanner,  
R-Provo, who warned the state could be responsible for any Olympic 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner's legislation would create an Olympic Coordinating  
Committee, a panel of 12 senators and House members. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was approved Thursday by the House Government  
Operations Committee and sent to the full House for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came as the International Olympic Committee's chief  
investigator said in New York that packages of cash and gifts worth 
more than $100,000 were common in Salt Lake City's winning bid for 
the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, a Canadian who is an IOC vice president, said the  
payments were part of Salt Lake's plan to win favor for the Utah 
capital and, while perhaps not criminal, went far beyond the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound is the head of a six-member panel looking into the worst  
corruption scandal in Olympic history. His commission is to release 
its report this weekend in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest amount previously publicized as having gone to an  
IOC member was $70,000, a figure provided by Frank Joklik, 
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, two weeks ago. He 
did not identify the IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said Thursday that the amounts had grown as IOC  
investigators reviewed books of the Salt Lake City bid committee 
that won the games in 1995 on a fifth try. The payments, Pound 
said, started in late 1991, shortly after Salt Lake had lost the 
1998 Winter Games to Nagano by four votes, and continued in a few 
cases beyond the winning vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner, the lawmaker pressing for more oversight, said the  
Sports Advisory Committee that now advises the Legislature on 
Olympic matters has ``no meat on its bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, his bill would preserve and enlarge that advisory  
panel, now made up of city, county and town officials and two 
athletes, by adding all the members of the Olympic Coordinating 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner said the legislative oversight committee would carry  
enough political weight to prevail on organizers to curtail the 
2002 Games to avert any budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner acknowledged the legislative panel wouldn't have absolute  
control over the Games, but noted, ``Right now, the Legislature has 
no teeth. I think we will have some teeth if we pass this 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt shares legislators' concerns about the state's  
possible liability for any Olympic shortfall, his lawyer, Gary 
Doxey, told the House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Doxey appeared to give the governor's endorsement for the  
oversight committee, then found himself under sharp questioning 
over whether the state will have to pay any Olympic budget 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Salt Lake City's guarantee protecting the  
International Olympic Committee against any debts or claims after 
the 2002 Games. Former Gov. Norm Bangerter, in turn, agreed to use 
the financial power of the state to protect Salt Lake City against 
any losses. But Leavitt has said that deal, undisclosed at the time 
to the Legislature, may not be constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could the state be on the hook?'' Doxey wondered aloud. He  
said state officials still are not certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to know the answer,'' demanded Rep. Marlon Snow,  
R-Orem. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving his best shot, Doxey said that Bangerter, acting on  
behalf of the state, had ``agreed to act in good faith to 
indemnify'' the Salt Lake Organizing Committee ``to the extent 
constitutionally permissible, and it's an open question what that 
is. All the parties have known from start to finish that that is an 
open question (but) it seemed to make the IOC comfortable during 
the bid process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, critics of the games threatened to launch a petition  
drive unless the governor and legislature act to protect taxpayers 
from financial disaster. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Blasts Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's private lawyer told  
senators today that evidence used by House prosecutors to allege 
obstruction of justice was ``profoundly ambiguous'' and that 
senators had an obligation to restore fairness to the impeachment 
process. ``The direct evidence disproves the charges,'' he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparing no words for the president's critics, Attorney David  
Kendall denounced the Whitewater investigation that led to the 
impeachment inquiry as ``tortuous and meandering'' and said he was 
before the trial to rebut the ``rhetoric'' of the House 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is more than rhetoric. It means in proceedings  
like these when important rights are being adjudicated that 
evidence matters, fairness matters. The presumption of innocence 
matters and proportionality matters,'' argued Kendall, who has 
represented the president through a variety of legal controversies 
dating to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall focused his attack on the impeachment article accusing  
Clinton of obstruction of justice, saying it was ``based on 
circumstantial evidence, and that evidence is at best profoundly 
ambiguous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence plainly shows that the president did not obstruct  
justice in any way and there is nothing in this article that would 
warrant his removal from office,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, a high-powered Washington trial lawyer, was to be  
followed by one of the Senate's best orators of recent years, 
just-retired Democrat Dale Bumpers of Arkansas. He was to make an 
appeal to his colleagues to reject the House work as a rush to 
judgment and to spare the country an unworthy conviction of the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators would then get their first chance to ask questions of  
the two sides, submitting those queries through Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning is expected to begin Friday and continue  
Saturday. Some 70 questions have been submitted by Republicans so 
far, a GOP spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said they oppose dismissal of the charges and  
support the need for limited live testimony from key witnesses such 
as Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and presidential 
secretary Betty Currie -- and they should get their way with a 55-45 
majority.

<HEADLINE> Utah Bans Anti-Olympic Plates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Car owners in Utah can get vanity license  
plates to express their views about Salt Lake City playing host to 
the 2002 Winter Games -- as long as the expressions are positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Velmer wanted plates that said ``2002NOT.'' Officials at  
the Department of Motor Vehicles said no, saying the personalized 
plate is ``not a public forum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to control opinions,'' Velmer said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The bidding process for the Games has become the biggest  
corruption scandal in Olympics history. 
</P>
<P>
	The state prohibits personalized license-plate messages that are  
profane, obscene or derogatory or refer to sex acts, excretory 
functions or sex organs. Utah already has issued several 
pro-Olympic plates, including ones that say ``OLYMPX,'' ``5RNGS,'' 
and ``02SLC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Tax Commission spokeswoman Janice Perry Gully said the  
difference between those plates and what Velmer wanted is that his 
amounted to a protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Velmer: ``Who's it going to hurt, some volunteer who eats,  
sleeps and dreams the Olympics?''

<HEADLINE> Conviction in Silent Movie Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 21-year-old man has been convicted of  
gunning down the owner of Hollywood's old Silent Movie Showcase in 
what prosecutors say was hitman-for-hire scheme worth $25,000 to 
the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Rodriguez was found guilty of first-degree murder for  
the 1997 shooting of Lawrence Austin, 74. The jury's decision, 
reached last week, was unsealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Silent Movie Showcase was the nation's only theater devoted  
solely to silent films. It was shut down after Austin's death. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate jury is deliberating the case of James Vansickle, who  
allegedly hired Rodriguez to kill Austin. Prosecutors said 
Vansickle, a 38-year-old theater projectionist, had a seven-year 
personal and business relationship with Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said Vansickle was the sole beneficiary of  
Austin's $1 million-plus estate. Both Rodriguez and Vansickle were 
charged with murder, attempted murder, attempted robbery and 
commercial burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	As about 60 people watched the movie short ``School Days'' two  
years ago, Rodriguez ran down the aisle firing a gun before going 
out an exit, Deputy District Attorney Jeff Ramseyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vansickle allegedly gave Rodriguez a handgun and promised him  
$25,000 to kill Austin and another $5,000 to kill a concession 
worker at the theater. The concession worker was wounded, but 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty phase of Rodriguez's trial is to begin Monday. Both  
defendants could face the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Teen Driving Restrictions Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new study indicates that some graduated  
driver's license laws, which phase in the times and situations 
under which young people can drive, may save more lives than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws' most critical elements are restrictions on teen-agers'  
nighttime driving and a requirement that an adult supervise the 
initial driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic experts also believe it helps to ban or limit teen-age  
passengers and to withhold full driving privileges until a driver 
reaches age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all graduated systems are created equal, and not all will  
have the same benefits,'' Allan Williams, senior vice president of 
research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute, in conjunction with the Traffic Injury Research  
Foundation in Canada, released research Wednesday that showed 
effects of the graduated driving law adopted by Florida in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	It requires a six-month learner's period, bans driving by  
16-year-olds between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. and withholds full 
privileges until a driver reaches 18. All drivers below 21 are 
subject to a zero-tolerance policy on drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 23 other states have made varying changes to their  
laws. Most of the other 27 states and the District of Columbia are 
expected to debate an array of changes during their current 
legislative sessions. With the exception of California, which has 
already updated its teen-driving law, the majority of remaining 
states are west of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance Institute found that during 1997, the number of  
fatal and injury crashes involving 15- to 17-year-olds in Florida 
was 9 percent below what would have been expected without the 
licensing change. 
</P>
<P>
	Crashes declined most for 15-year-olds, the study found, and  
nighttime crashes involving those from 15 to 17 years old were 17 
percent below what otherwise would have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute, a research group funded by insurance companies,  
found that there was no change in fatal and injury crashes in 
neighboring Alabama, which has yet to change its teen driving law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both inexperience and immaturity contribute to high crash  
rates with young drivers,'' said Daniel Mayhew, senior vice 
president at the Traffic Injury Research Foundation. ``Graduated 
systems can address both by delaying the age of full-license 
driving until 18.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Mayhew said that while the Florida study shows  
graduated licensing saves lives, the ideal system should have three 
phases: learner's, intermediate and unrestricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the learner's phase, driving should not begin until 16.  
During the next six months, a teen should have to complete 30 to 50 
hours of driving with an adult, some of it at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the intermediate phase, there should be restrictions on  
unsupervised nighttime driving beginning at 9 p.m. There should 
also be a ban or limit on teen passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers should not be granted unrestricted privileges until they  
are 18, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said young drivers tend to be more aggressive and less  
likely to recognize hazards in comparison to older drivers. Young 
passengers can be a distraction as well as an inducement to take 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't any substitute for on-the-road driving,'' Williams  
said, ``but let's get it in the lower-risk kind of situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were supported by AAA, the nation's largest driving  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all learn by doing, not necessarily by reading a book,''  
AAA spokeswoman Beth Duffy said. ``Graduated licensing extends the 
learning process for teen-age drivers.''

<HEADLINE> Donahue Joins 49ers' Front Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- In the latest installment of the San  
Francisco 49ers' front-office makeover, Terry Donahue was 
introduced Thursday as the team's director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Donahue, UCLA's coach for 20 years and a  
broadcaster for the last three years, was the first significant 
hire by general manager Bill Walsh, who has been on the job 
officially for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue, 54, succeeds Vinny Cerrato, who was fired last week. It  
is Donahue's first venture into player evaluation and acquisition 
for an NFL team, which he said was one of the main reasons he was 
attracted to the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy different challenges and this was something unique,  
something different,'' Donahue said. ``It's going to be an 
exciting, wild ride for me and I couldn't imagine being in a better 
place, with an organization that has as much history and success as 
the 49ers have. For me, it's a dream job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue actually began working for the 49ers last week, getting  
a jump on scouting available college talent as players prepared for 
the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. He'll also spend time working with 
Joe Collins, the team's coordinator of pro personnel, in assessing 
potential acquisitions via free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, 67, has said that Donahue will be groomed as a potential  
candidate to replace him at some point in the future as the team's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue, who was a candidate for the Chicago Bears coaching job  
before pulling out of the race when Walsh offered him the 
front-office post, added he has no plans at this point to return to 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should say never. You never know,'' he said. ``But I'm  
not looking to coach again. My interest at this point is in 
studying, analyzing and totally grasping the personnel side and the 
administrative side of professional football.''

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman suffered  
a broken nose and a cut after he was hit in the face by a puck 
during Thursday night's 4-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman had fallen to the ice when a pass from former Red Wings  
defenseman Paul Coffey struck him on the right side of the face. 
The incident occurred with the score tied 1-1 and 10:15 remaining 
in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	The cut was bad enough that blood dripped on the ice where  
Yzerman fell. Trainer John Wharton said after the game that 
Yzerman's nose was broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman's status for Sunday's NHL All-Star Game was not

<HEADLINE>  Atrocities Claimed in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Residents of a rebel-held  
neighborhood in Sierra Leone's capital accused insurgents Thursday 
of carrying out mass killings, torture and rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most areas of Freetown were quiet Thursday after two  
weeks of vicious, door-to-door combat, rebels fighting to unseat 
Sierra Leone's government were still sowing terror in the eastern 
Kissy neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said pro-government militias and the  
Nigerian-led intervention known as ECOMOG were slowly advancing on 
pockets of rebel resistance in Kissy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Fallah, who fled her home with her 80-year-old mother  
Wednesday night, said rebels had raped young girls and forced 
teen-age boys to carry booty pillaged from homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rebels raped most of the young girls. They take them from  
houses at night and return them in the morning,'' said Fallah, a 
Sierra Leonean employee for the U.N. Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of attempts by a West African coalition army to root  
them out, the insurgents also were using women and children as 
human shields, she said. Other Kissy residents said rebels had 
killed the neighborhood's traditional chief, Pa Komrabai. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Freetown, hunger and thirst cast a long shadow. Aid  
agencies have warned of impending starvation unless emergency food 
supplies are delivered to Freetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients in the city's main hospital have been abandoned, and  
countless homes have been destroyed by shelling and raging fires. 
No one has tallied all the casualties, but the number of dead run 
into the hundreds and possibly thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Minister Tijan Jalloh said Thursday that government  
workers had buried 420 corpses in mass graves and were searching 
the streets for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Many bodies were hastily buried by homeowners in shallow graves  
and would be disinterred and reburied, Jalloh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurgents also had hacked off the hands of at least 30  
Freetown residents, Jalloh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels have been accused of committing thousands of similar  
mutilations in rural villages last year during a campaign aimed at 
spreading their influence through terror. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of child soldiers had been taken prisoner and turned  
over to authorities for rehabilitation, ECOMOG commander Brig. Gen. 
Abu Ahmadu said. 
</P>
<P>
	State radio called on all government workers to return to their  
jobs by Monday, saying the improving security situation in Freetown 
had allowed authorities to partially lift an 18-hour curfew. The 
new curfew will be from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Indy Champ Brack Wants Quick Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Kenny Brack needs more time to  
work his way into the consciousness of the American public. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he won the 1998 Indy Racing League championship, Brack has  
found life to be pretty much the same as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that it bothers the 32-year-old driver.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like my normal self,'' Brack said. ``I don't feel I'm  
going to change, no matter what happens. I don't look at myself as 
a star, so I'm not concerned that people aren't treating me like 
one. I don't expect I'm going to suddenly change personality and 
become a spoiled guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brack and teammate Billy Boat lead the entries for the  
season-opening TransWorth Diversified Services Indy 200 on Sunday 
at Walt Disney World Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Most important to Brack is picking up where he left off last  
year when he won three races and gave team owner A.J. Foyt his 
second IRL title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	One way to make that happen is to get a quicker start. A year  
ago, Brack finished an undistinguished 13th as Tony Stewart won the 
Disney race. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Disney, the key is staying out of trouble,'' Brack said of  
the one-mile, nearly-flat oval. ``Normally, at the first race of 
the year, guys come back and tend to get a little excited and 
things happen. And the traffic at this place is unforgiving, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brack, whose background is mostly European road racing,  
including a stint in Formula 3000 -- just a step below Formula One -- 
says he isn't surprised about his quick success on the IRL ovals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I would win races when I went with A.J.,'' he said.  
``To predict in the beginning of the season that you'll win a 
championship is kind of hard, but I have always said that if you 
win races, you'll have a shot at the championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Brack says he and his team head into the 11-race season  
with plenty of confidence, there is one big change. Crew chief John 
King, a longtime Foyt employee has left the team. He has been 
replaced by Billy Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``John decided he wanted to take it easy, but Billy's been with  
the team a long time,'' the calm, cool Brack noted. ``I'm not 
worried about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people find Brack and Foyt to be an odd pairing.  
</P>
<P>
	Brack is quiet, slow to anger and sophisticated. Foyt -- once the  
most famous driver in the world -- at 63 is still fiery and brash. 
</P>
<P>
	``People that don't know A.J. think he's got a reputation of  
being difficult,'' Brack said. ``If he takes a liking to you, he 
treats you very well. And, really, our backgrounds are somewhat 
similar. We both started with zero -- no family money -- and we both 
made it on our own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first priority for both of us is we want to win. The will  
to win is everything. It helps us communicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boat also won his first IRL race last year, and he is expected  
to be a contender for the title currently held by his teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among others who could be contenders this season are Scott  
Sharp, who gave Foyt a share (with Buzz Calkins) of the first IRL 
title in 1996, Scott Goodyear, Buddy Lazier, Jeff Ward, Mark 
Dismore, Davey Hamilton, Robbie Buhl and Greg Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray and Sam Schmidt will both be in the spotlight beginning with  
Friday's opening practice as they move into seats left vacant by 
key veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is replacing former IRL champion Tony Stewart at Team  
Menard. Stewart has moved to NASCAR's Winston Cup series, although 
he may run in the IRL's Indianapolis 500 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt steps into the seat of two-time Indy 500 winner Arie  
Luyendyk at Treadway Racing. Luyendyk, the IRL's first big name, 
says he will run only at Indianapolis this year before retiring 
from open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Among others on hand this week will be 1998 Indy winner Eddie  
Cheever as well as veterans Calkins, John Paul Jr., Stephan 
Gregoire, Eliseo Salazar, Raul Boesel and Robert Guerrero. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pirates Wonder Where Martin May Fit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates manager Gene Lamont expects  
new left fielder Brian Giles to get 500-600 at-bats, Brant Brown to 
play every day in center field and right fielder Jose Guillen to 
drive in as many as 100 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Which raises this question: Where's Al Martin?  
</P>
<P>
	Martin, the Pirates' highest-paid player and one of their  
clubhouse leaders, apparently will go into spring training as a 
reserve outfielder -- a role he last played while backing up Barry 
Bonds in September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has been the Pirates' most consistent hitter since 1993,  
batting .300 in 1996 and hitting at least .281 five times, but 
slumped to a career-low .239 during an injury-marred 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Aware the Pirates were rebuilding around him, Martin suggested  
to general manager Cam Bonifay at mid-season that a trade might be 
in order, but one was never made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates will likely step up their efforts to make a deal as  
camp approaches, even though Lamont said, ``I expect him to be 
here'' on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative is to start the season with their only player  
with a salary approaching $3 million on the bench, a situation the 
low-budget Pirates almost certainly don't want. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Al is one of our three best outfielders, he'll play,''  
Lamont said of Martin, a .280 career hitter with a below-average 
arm. ``He's a left fielder. He probably can't play center field ... 
or right field. But if he's better than Jose Guillen, he'll play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Pirates didn't trade one of the NL's best left-handed  
relievers, Ricardo Rincon, for Giles just to sit him on the bench. 
They also aren't likely to sit down Guillen, who is only 22 but 
already has driven in 154 runs in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont said Giles or Brown will bat third, behind Jason Kendall  
and ahead of Kevin Young, with the other batting fifth ahead of 
third baseman Ed Sprague and Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles (Indians) and Brown (Cubs) both left playoff teams to join  
a franchise coming off a 69-93 season, but are looking forward to 
finally being starters in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to win, but it always was the same old song  
and dance in Cleveland. They said they were going to get me more 
at-bats, but then they would bring somebody else in,'' Giles said. 
``We've got some guys here who haven't had opportunities but, given 
some time, will produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles also said of the last-place Pirates, ``I don't think it's  
too far down the road here that we'll sneak up and surprise some 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Managing general partner Kevin McClatchy agreed, calling the  
Pirates ``the most improved team in our division'' following moves 
that brought in Giles, Brown, Sprague, infielder Mike Benjamin and 
left-hander Pete Schourek. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lamont said right-hander Rich Loiselle will go into  
spring training as the closer despite struggling with his control 
while going 2-7 with a 3.44 ERA and 19 saves last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But, like two seasons ago when he went into camp as the  
projected No. 5 starter only to make 29 saves as a rookie, Loiselle 
will pitch more like a starter than a reliever during spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to pitch him three innings some days,'' Lamont said.  
``Until last year, he had never gone into spring training as 
anything but a starter, and the biggest difference in him all year 
was his control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loiselle walked 36 in 55 innings last season, an unusually high  
number for a closer. He walked 24 in 72 2-3 innings in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly because of Loiselle, the Pirates' bullpen remains  
unsettled a month before camp begins, with right-hander Marc 
Wilkins and left-hander Jeff Wallace returning from surgery and 
Loiselle coming off a subpar season.

<HEADLINE> NJ Cops Oppose Concert for Convict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey State Police are outraged over  
having to provide security at a benefit concert for Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop killer on death row in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the troopers will be on hand for next Thursday's  
sold-out show at the Meadowlands, near New York City, because 
officials concluded they had no legal way to cancel the rock 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys, Rage Against the Machine, and Bad Religion  
will be the headliners at the $30-a-ticket concert. A portion of 
the $480,000 in proceeds will go to the defense fund of Abu-Jamal, 
a black former radio reporter on death row for the 1981 killing of 
a white Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	State police routinely back up private security at the  
Meadowlands, but Col. Carl Williams, superintendent of the State 
Police, said Wednesday he would write a letter to protest the use 
of troopers at the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting our troopers in with a hostile crowd and my  
people are going to be there trying to maintain law and order,'' 
Williams told The Record of Hackensack. ``This is amazing. I'm 
dumbfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams released a more subdued statement Thursday, supporting  
the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority ``and the quandary 
they face in scheduling events that swirl with controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia police also were offended by the concert.  
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that police are the last group in American society  
where it's politically correct to celebrate their murder,'' said 
Richard Costello, president of the Philadelphia chapter of the 
Fraternal Order of Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers scheduled to work the concert will not be able to  
request a change in assignment. ``State police put their emotions 
aside every single day,'' spokesman John Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Sports and Exposition Authority, Dennis  
Robinson, said the show's promoter, DelsenerSlater in New York, 
told him about the concert's purpose only a week before tickets 
went on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he didn't support the cause, but ``we were forced  
to make a very pragmatic, legal decision.'' The promoter had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman urged patrons Thursday to ``exercise their  
discretion and not go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Peter Verniero said the show must go on because  
of a 1997 federal judge's decision that went against the state when 
it tried to block a Marilyn Manson concert. The judge said the 
state-run arena was a public venue. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I deplore this concert and its cause, legally our  
hands are tied,'' Verniero said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings, including the 1995 book ``Live  
from Death Row,'' have made him a celebrity around the world, 
attracting the support of death penalty opponents and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal was convicted in the shooting of Daniel Faulkner, 26,  
who had stopped Abu-Jamal's brother for a traffic violation. Police 
found the dying officer and a wounded Abu-Jamal lying near his own 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has said police coerced an eyewitness to testify  
against him and stacked a jury with whites. Police and prosecutors 
have said he was fairly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Graffin, lead singer of Bad Religion, said the bands  
organized the concert to raise awareness about the racial 
inequities in the use of the death penalty. ``We also believe that 
Mumia should be given a fair trial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rage Against the Machine publicist Lisa Markowitz said the band  
strongly supports Abu-Jamal and raised $8,000 for him at a 1995 
concert in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beastie Boys declined comment through a publicist.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One week into defending antitrust charges,  
Microsoft is reasserting its contention the company does not 
exercise monopoly power in the high-tech industry despite the 
dominance of its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyers were expected today to concentrate on the  
prices it charges computer makers for its popular Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
	Its first witness, economist Richard Schmalensee of the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, testified previously that a 
true monopolist would set Windows prices 16 to 40 times higher than 
the roughly $50 it now charges computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies on Wednesday ended nearly  
four days of questioning Schmalensee. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Richard Urowsky said he expected to finish with  
the economist today. He asked Schmalensee on Wednesday whether 
Microsoft's high profits -- it reported almost $2 billion in 
quarterly profit earlier this week -- suggested monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems hard to me to walk away from the evidence that  
Microsoft is a highly profitable company,'' said Schmalensee, 
adding that high profits do not prove monopoly power. ``Successful 
companies tend to earn extraordinary returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, the government turned to what legal experts  
consider some of the strongest evidence against Microsoft by asking 
about alleged exclusionary agreements with the nation's computer 
makers and Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Microsoft limits how personal computer makers can  
alter the basic appearance of its dominant Windows operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee admitted that computer makers have no choice but to  
agree to demands because there effectively is no alternative to 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies showed Schmalensee an angry e-mail to Microsoft from an  
executive at Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's second-largest 
computer company, complaining about such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had a choice of another supplier, based on your actions  
in this area, I assure you would not be our supplier of choice,'' 
wrote John Romano, a manager at Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee called Romano ``clearly an angry person.'' But he  
said there were many examples of what he called ``channel 
conflict,'' where a manufacturer's legal actions make its 
distributors irate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be surprising ... if Microsoft reducing the freedom  
of action in some respects didn't cause them upset,'' Schmalensee 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft imposed restrictions as early as 1996 to discourage 
distribution of competing Internet software from rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sworn statements from executives at several PC companies  
indicated they were reluctant to sell Netscape's browser if already 
forced to distribute Microsoft's. Both products let people view 
information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In some agreements with Internet providers, Microsoft offered  
its browser free -- despite spending millions of dollars on its 
design -- if they agreed to limit distribution of Netscape's 
software below thresholds, often to fewer than 15 percent of their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies suggested that Microsoft has spent $500 million to develop  
its Internet browser since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that its agreements with computer makers and  
Internet companies are legal. It calls its distribution deals 
similar to those in other industries and says limits on PC makers 
ensure a ``common Windows experience'' even for customers using 
computers from different manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee called Microsoft's attempt to protect its design of  
Windows a ``plausible rationale'' for its restrictions on PC 
makers.

<HEADLINE> Stakes Rise Over Budget Surpluses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's call to divide federal  
budget surpluses among Social Security, Medicare and other programs 
is emboldening Republicans itching to use some of it for big tax 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did last year, Clinton still is insisting that surpluses  
be reserved until Social Security is revamped so it can provide 
baby boomers' benefits when they retire beginning in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But his acknowledgment that surpluses over the next 15 years --  
projected at a gigantic $4.4 trillion by the White House -- will be 
big enough to also beef up other programs has changed the political 
dynamic. Many Republicans said Wednesday that portions of the 
surpluses should be used for cutting taxes, or else Clinton will 
simply spend them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not for freezing all of the surplus for Social  
Security,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., among several 
conservatives who unsuccessfully pressed Senate GOP leaders last 
year to offer large tax reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight over federal surpluses, perhaps this year's most  
overarching legislative issue, was altered last week when Senate 
Republican budget analysts estimated that federal surpluses over 
the next decade could be $600 billion larger than was expected just 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's comments again have reshaped the debate. It has  
changed from whether to use hundreds of billions of dollars for 
programs other than Social Security to a struggle over which ones 
will benefit -- tax cuts Republicans want or domestic spending 
Democrats prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton declared, ``Save Social Security first.''  
That became code for leaving surpluses untouched until Democrats 
and Republicans agree on girding Social Security for the impending 
retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the political popularity of the pension program for  
the elderly, the line effectively blocked Republicans from winning 
tax cuts. It did not, however, prevent Clinton and Republicans from 
pushing a huge spending package through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton  
repeated his plea to fix Social Security before anything else. But 
he added a new twist, saying only 62 percent of the $4.4 trillion 
in surpluses expected over the next 15 years is needed to bolster 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest -- about $1.7 trillion -- should be spent on Medicare,  
new retirement accounts, and defense and domestic programs, Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials emphasize that the president would still  
oppose using any of the surplus for anything until a Social 
Security cure is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's words gave many Republicans political cover for  
proposing to use the remaining $1.7 trillion mostly for tax cuts, 
and perhaps for other purposes like defense and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference'' between last year and this, said  
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a moderate who has moved from opposing 
tax cuts last year to favoring them now. ``We'd be in an untenable 
position if we didn't save some of it (the surplus) for taxpayers, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such comments are crucial because skepticism among moderate  
Republican senators helped kill last year's GOP tax reduction 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Other moderates, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said  
Wednesday that they still prefer narrow tax cuts to broad ones. But 
GOP leaders, united behind an across-the-board 10 percent income 
tax cut, believe they will have more Republican support for cutting 
taxes than they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, particularly liberals, might also be more  
inclined this year to insist on using surpluses to increase 
spending on domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Democrats questioned Wednesday said they still wanted  
to heed Clinton's call to leave surpluses alone until Social 
Security's problems are solved. They realize their party's claim to 
protect the program is a valuable political tool to use against 
Republicans, especially looking ahead to a 2000 election in which 
they have a chance to recapture control of the House.

<HEADLINE> Lockhart Charged With Shoplifting </HEADLINE>

<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi forward Rahim Lockhart has been  
charged with shoplifting after allegedly stealing a cassette tape 
at a record store, the university's campus newspaper reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, a sophomore who is averaging 8.1 points per game, was  
taken to the Oxford Jail and released on his own recognizance late 
Thursday, according to the Daily Mississippian. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart is coming off two of his best performances since  
arriving in Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward had a career-high 21 points in the Rebels'  
78-60 win over Alabama on Jan. 7 and a career-high 12 rebounds for 
Ole Miss in Wednesday's 81-68 victory over Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report stated that an employee at the Sound Shop in  
Oxford observed Lockhart with a cassette tape, which was later 
noticed missing, the Daily Mississippian reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart served a one-game suspension against Vanderbilt on Jan.  
2 for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ole Miss athletic officials were unavailable for comment late  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe Not Expecting Warm Welcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- If he gets snubbed by waiters at restaurants in  
Miami or gets booed during pregame introductions at the Super Bowl, 
Shannon Sharpe knows he deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not generally mean-spirited, the Denver Broncos tight  
end has a gift for needling. His sharp tongue has gotten him in 
trouble on more than one occasion, but he just can't help himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Witness his taunting of the Miami Dolphins, which is sure to  
have repercussions when he and his Denver teammates are in that 
city next week for the Super Bowl on Jan. 31. Sharpe doubts that 
the welcome mat will be out for him in south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Broncos' 38-3 romp over the Dolphins in a divisional  
playoff game on Jan. 9 in Denver, Sharpe referred to Dolphins 
quarterback Dan Marino as a ``loser.'' On the field after the game, 
he asked several Miami players, ``How does it feel to have the 
Super Bowl at your house, and you're not invited?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he told the Dolphins to tell coach Jimmy Johnson ``to have  
his office ready because we're going to need it to break down film 
(for the Super Bowl).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe apologized to Marino, but he'll accept the consequences  
for his other, typically outspoken remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on Thursday what kind of reception he was expecting in  
Miami, he said, ``Is that a trick question? I don't really think 
I'll be getting very many free meals. But it doesn't bother me. I'm 
sure the Miami fans are disappointed, but my prognostication was 
right. We're going to have Miami's facilities, and Mike (coach Mike 
Shanahan) is going to get Jimmy's office. So they shouldn't be 
mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos figure to elevate their standing in NFL history if  
they can beat the Atlanta Falcons for their second straight Super 
Bowl title, Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they're going to view us as one of the  
greatest teams ever,'' he said, ``but obviously we'd have to go 
down as one of the greatest teams of the '90s. In this day and 
time, with free agency and parity getting so good in the league 
now, it's an unbelievable feat, especially with that run we had, 
going 13-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe noted that the Broncos are in the same ``predicament''  
that the Green Bay Packers were in a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won the Super Bowl the year before, they were back and  
they were favored,'' he said. ``But I think we're going to handle 
it a lot differently than they did. I think we have learned from 
their mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inevitably, the discussion shifted to the rift that existed in  
the early 1990s between Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, then the Broncos 
head coach; Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, then the Broncos offensive 
coordinator; and Broncos quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves feuded with Elway, then fired Shanahan for alleged  
insubordination. Reeves himself was fired after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he was most disturbed by a comment from Reeves on  
Wednesday that he had no proof that Shanahan and Elway scripted 
plays behind his back or tried to undermine his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not hiding anything,'' Shanahan said Thursday. ``He  
said he didn't have any proof, just a feeling. If I'm going to 
accuse somebody of something, I think I'd at least have some proof 
or a stronger feeling. I was very disappointed in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his relationship with Reeves was irrevocably damaged,  
Shanahan thought for several seconds and said, ``I would say yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said he was ``flabbergasted'' by Reeves' complaints.  
``It's hard for me to understand why this situation got to where it 
did,'' he said. ``There were a lot of people hurt by the whole 
situation. Looking back, there are always things you'd like to do a 
little differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Reeves' comments were honest or calculated,  
Elway said, ``I don't know. Really, it's not my concern. Our 
concern is to be the best we can to beat the Falcons. This is not 
something that will distract me, and I don't think it's something 
that will distract Mike or the rest of the football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe has insisted all along that he has ``the utmost respect  
for Dan Reeves, because he gave me a chance in this league. I can't 
say anything bad about Dan. He doesn't have a problem with me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this has been eating at Dan for a long time. It  
bothered him that he felt that Mike went behind his back, and it 
bothered him that John came out in the paper and said it was hell 
playing for him. And it bothered him that (Broncos owner) Pat 
Bowlen fired him. He had some great years here and went to three 
Super Bowls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beating the Broncos in the Super Bowl would be doubly delicious  
for Reeves, Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would probably mean more to him getting the Super Bowl  
trophy against us because he was here and the way he was dismissed 
and all the things that have circulated about his career here,'' 
Sharpe said. ``It would give him more ammunition if he could get it 
against us. But we're going to do everything we possibly can not to 
let that happen.''

<HEADLINE> Train Carrying Gas Rerails in N.Y. </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NELLISTON, N.Y. (AP) -- A train containing propane gas and acid  
derailed Thursday night, prompting an evacuation of residents from 
the area and the closing of a 75-mile section of the state Thruway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montgomery County Sheriff's Department reported that about  
31 cars jumped the tracks at around 6 p.m. in the town of 
Nelliston, which is 50 miles northwest of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no passengers on the Conrail train. No injuries were  
reported in the area of the derailment. About 150 people left their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A state police spokesman said both sides of the Thruway from  
Duanesburg to Utica were shut down because they were advised by 
hazardous materials crews on the scene that it was not safe to 
travel through the area. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if gas or acid was leaking from the  
wreckage, but police said the derailment was less than a half mile 
from the Thruway. The closing came at around 9 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies Logging Ban Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Logging will continue in the Allegheny  
National Forest despite warnings that it could eliminate habitat 
for the endangered Indiana bat, a federal judge has decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Forest Service has adequate standards to ensure timber  
operations in the 513,000-acre northwestern Pennsylvania forest 
won't harm the bat's summer habitat, U.S. District Judge Donetta 
Ambrose ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency found signs of the bat last year, and will keep  
certain trees in logged areas to provide bat habitat. The agency 
has not approved new logging contracts, but has allowed 61 existing 
contracts to continue on about 1,800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Loggers cut cherry, maple and other hardwood trees for furniture  
and other uses. Officials estimate about 270 Indiana bats live in 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Two environmental groups wanted all logging suspended.  
Indiana-based Heartwood Inc. and its Pennsylvania branch, the 
Allegheny Defense Project, did not know if they would appeal.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower, Tokyo Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen today amid  
concern over renewed trade friction between Japan and the United 
States. Tokyo stock prices rose for the second consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 217.37 points,  
or 1.55 percent, closing the session at 14,245.42. On Wednesday, 
the average surged 257.61 points, or 1.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 113.12 yen, down 0.28 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
112.85 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Japan  
Wednesday that its December steel exports to America must show 
``substantial'' reduction or the United States will take 
retaliatory action. Threats of such action often help boost the 
Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing on the dollar was yen-buying by Japanese  
companies, which often repatriate yen from overseas ahead of the 
end of their fiscal year on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other factors helping to undermine the U.S. currency were  
Brazil's financial woes and U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
impeachment trial, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 112.77 yen and 113.40 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.92 yen, down from 131.26  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks opened lower as buy orders from  
foreign investors were offset by profit-taking in the wake of the 
market's recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
	But buying of bank issues reversed the course as players  
welcomed reported merger talks between a major Japanese trust bank 
and a major commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Kogyo Shimbun, an industrial newspaper, said today  
that Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and Daiwa Bank have started 
negotiations for a merger around April of next year. The banks 
later denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange temporarily suspended trading in shares  
of the two banks as officials worked to verify the report. Trading 
of their shares resumed in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger report comes amid a major reconsolidation of Japan's  
financial industry, in particular the bad-loan plagued banking 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 539  
million shares, up from Wednesday's 452 million shares. Advances 
outnumbered declines 702 to 423, with 175 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section added 14.85 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,104.92. The 
TOPIX rose 5.27 points, or 1.42 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.780 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.770 
percent, driving its price down to 100.16 yen from 100.24 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Stocks, Currency Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stock and currency values  
dropped sharply today, despite approval by Congress of a pivotal 
austerity measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin  
America's largest, closed down 4.8 percent. The real, trading 
freely against the dollar since Friday, slipped to 1.71 against the 
U.S. currency from the previous day's close of 1.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said shares slipped because investors were taking  
profits after several sessions of rising prices. The real's decline 
was blamed on market jitters about everything from high local 
interest rates to speculation about a possible devaluation of the 
Chinese yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is extremely nervous, and any negative comment on  
the market at all creates panic,'' said one Rio de Janeiro dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders had expected a calmer scenario today after Brazil's  
lower house of Congress passed a bill cutting federal pensions, 
boosting the government's chances of trimming the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must also vote on the measure, which the Chamber of  
Deputies approved 335-147 on Wednesday. Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes said preparations for a vote will begin 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial cuts, which the Chamber had previously  
rejected four times, affect about 300,000 retirees. The move will 
save the government an estimated $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, however, was the message that the bill's  
approval sends to international investors -- that Congress is 
willing to embrace the measures deemed essential to reinvigorating 
Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote demonstrates Congress's understanding of Brazil's  
deepest problems,'' President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said after 
the vote. ``The deputies demonstrated the necessary firmness and 
feeling of urgency regarding the measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage also gives the government a much-needed  
boost, showing investors that it can spur Congress into action on 
crucial economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressman and former Finance Minister Antonio Delfim Netto had  
said that although he didn't agree with the measure, he would vote 
for it ``to stop the dollar going through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition party deputies took a different view.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking money from the elderly just to show foreign  
investors we're working on the crisis,'' said Paulo Paim of the 
Worker's Party in Rio Grande do Sul. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis engulfed Brazil in August, when  
investors withdrew funds for fear the government would not be able 
to cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms  
helped rekindle investor fears. After spending billions of dollars 
in foreign reserves trying to prop up its overvalued currency, the 
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	As the close of trading, the real had lost about 29 percent of  
its value since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, it could undermine other countries in 
the region -- and that would likely hurt the U.S. economy, which 
depends on Latin America as a major market for exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William  
McDonough, played down those fears Wednesday, saying that Brazil's 
economic crisis was not a threat to the U.S. financial system. He 
spoke after meeting in New York with Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan.

<HEADLINE> USSF Likes World Cup Every 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. Soccer Federation likes the proposal by  
FIFA president Sepp Blatter to play the World Cup every two years 
instead of every four. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Contiguglia, who succeeded Alan Rothenberg last August as  
the USSF president, said the desire to stage the World Cup in the 
United States again in 2010 or 2014 was a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this country, having another World Cup will provide a big  
boost,'' Contiguglia said Thursday after his speech to the Sports 
Summit, an annual gathering of sports marketing and advertising 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa, England and Germany are the top contenders to  
stage the tournament in 2006. If South Africa wins the bidding, 
Europe is expected to be the favorite to stage the tournament in 
2010. Japan and South Korea are co-hosts for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Blatter proposed switching to a biennial  
schedule, starting perhaps with a 24-team tournament in 2004, when 
FIFA celebrates its centennial as soccer's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would be able to get it back in the United States a lot  
sooner,'' Contiguglia said. 
</P>
<P>
	European soccer officials are opposed to the idea because it  
would conflict with the European Championship, currently played in 
the second year following a World Cup. In addition, clubs are 
fearful they would lose players to national teams for additional 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League Soccer, which plays from March until October, also  
would have a conflict with additional World Cup dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be bad for us in the United States to participate in  
something like that because of the MLS and its season,'' 
Contiguglia said. ``If it did happen, the MLS would adapt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Contiguglia said the benefits to the higher profile  
of soccer in the United States in World Cup years would overshadow 
the difficulties it would cause MLS teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would help us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Pinochet Hearing Resumes in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A hearing in Britain's House of Lords to determine  
the legality of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's arrest is revolving around 
two questions: Whether acts of torture can be prosecuted by any 
country, and if his status as a former head of state protects him 
from facing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Britain and Spain rolled through nearly a century of  
legal history Wednesday, the third day of arguments, to bolster 
their position that the former Chilean dictator cannot claim 
immunity from charges of crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	They will continue presenting evidence to Britain's highest  
court today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, 83, was arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant accusing  
him of ordering murders, kidnapping and torture throughout his 
17-year regime. Spaniards were among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it at its lowest form, torture is an internationally  
recognized crime and states have a duty to not accord immunity to 
people accused of this,'' Christopher Greenwood, a lawyer for 
Britain and Spain, told the seven-judge panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers contend that the aging general's arrest  
violates his rights to state immunity under British law. They will 
probably not begin presenting their case until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time the House of Lords has considered  
Pinochet's case. The first ended in a 3-2 decision denying him 
immunity in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords faces intense pressure to make its decision  
stick, after the embarrassment of overturning its own ruling last 
month when one of the judges who had ruled against Pinochet was 
found to have close ties to Amnesty International, a human rights 
group lobbying to bring him to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people were  
killed or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police 
after he overthrew elected Marxist Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish government also claims Pinochet began ordering  
torture in the months before his coup on Sept. 11, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet loses again in the House of Lords, the extradition  
battle will begin. But if the lords uphold a Nov. 25 High Court 
decision quashing his arrest, he would be free to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santiago, Pinochet's successor as army commander in chief,  
Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, said the army ``is a bit more optimistic 
this time'' that Pinochet will return to Chile soon. ``However, we 
cannot proclaim victory until the general is here,'' Izurieta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who was arrested in London while recuperating from  
back surgery, is not attending the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Lucia Hiriart, made a rare public appearance Wednesday  
when she went to pray at a church near the rented mansion west of 
London where her husband remains under police guard.

<HEADLINE> $6 Million in Funding for Coffee Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Millions of Americans know the therapy a  
cup of coffee can deliver early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Vanderbilt University say it's possible coffee  
could do more, perhaps even help people who suffer from depression 
and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	``People drink coffee because they like it or they like the way  
it makes them feel,'' Peter Martin, director of Vanderbilt 
University's Addiction Center, said Wednesday. ``My suggestion is 
that we really don't know what causes those effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt is scheduled to open its Institute for Coffee Studies  
within the next six months, thanks to $6 million in funding from 
trade groups in leading coffee-producing nations in Latin America, 
including Brazil and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have suggested coffee can help relieve depression,  
treat alcoholism and prevent colorectal cancer. The institute's 
mission is to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to help people get over the idea that coffee is  
caffeine,'' said Martin, who will head the institute. ``Caffeine 
actually is a very small component of coffee. There are a lot of 
other components in coffee that are not very well understood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have suggested that caffeine might slightly boost  
blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edward Giovannucci, an assistant professor of medicine at  
the Harvard Medical School, said most Americans have nothing to 
worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent a year reviewing medical literature on the health  
benefits of coffee drinking and found the risk of colorectal cancer 
drops 24 percent among those who drink four or more cups of coffee 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't tell people to go out and start drinking coffee,''  
Giovannucci said. ``But there isn't much harm in drinking coffee.''

<HEADLINE> Excite Inc. Narrows Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Excite Inc., a popular gateway to the Internet  
that has agreed to be acquired by At Home Corp., narrowed its 
losses in the fourth quarter as revenue jumped 163 percent from the 
final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1998, Excite lost $5.8 million, or  
11 cents per share, compared to a loss of $13 million, or 39 cents 
per share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The results included a charge of $7.6 million as part of a deal  
with Netscape Communications Corp. that gives Excite high 
visibility on Netscape's popular Web site. Excite also took a 
charge of $829,000 for acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the charges, Excite would have earned a net profit of  
$2.6 million, or 4 cents per share, meeting analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Internet companies, which have sunk millions of  
dollars into technological advances, Excite has not yet recorded a 
net profit. The company surprised analysts with a slim operating 
profit in the third quarter, but accounting charges pushed its net 
to a loss of 2 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Excite agreed to be acquired by high-speed Internet  
provider At Home in one of the largest Internet acquisitions ever. 
The deal was worth $6.7 billion when it was announced, but because 
of a decline in At Home's stock price, it is now worth about $5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's fourth-quarter revenue was $54.1 million, compared to  
$20.5 million in the year-earlier quarter. This year's 
fourth-quarter figure equalled Excite's revenue for all of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Excite, based in Redwood City, Calif., lost $37  
million, or 78 cents per share, on revenue of $154.1 million. In 
1997, the company lost $41.4 million, or $1.47 per share, on 
revenue of $54.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite continued to receive more traffic in the fourth quarter.  
The company said daily page views rose 15 percent in the fourth 
quarter, to 58 million. The number of registered users rose to 20 
million from 14 million in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite announced its results after stock markets closed. During  
the day, its shares tumbled $10.75, or 11 percent, to close at 
$85.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As Excite's competitors slipped 
as well, analysts said investors seemed to be cashing in on huge 
gains in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Meat Inspectors Find Safety Lapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new food inspection program implemented last  
year was supposed to bring additional safety checks to the nation's 
meat supply. But a group of federal inspectors says loose 
regulations are putting American consumers at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, the union  
representing inspectors, said Wednesday that the government's new 
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point program too often lets the 
meat industry regulate itself and forces inspectors to sit on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers ought to be outraged,'' said Bobby Harnage, national  
president of the American Federation of Government Employees, 
AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Riley, spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, said  
laws still allow inspectors to take action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel like there's lots of inspector presence and lots  
of involvement and enforcement going on in our plants,'' Riley 
said. ``There is no incentive for us to do anything but make the 
safest meat possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection  
Service, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inspectors have the same authority under HACCP as under past  
inspection methods,'' Gaston said. But she said the agency was 
taking the allegations seriously. ``Our policy is very clear. 
Unsafe or unwholesome meat or poultry should not be passed and 
should not receive the marks of inspection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency began implementing its new program in the country's  
300 largest processing plants last year. On Monday, nearly 3,000 
smaller plants are scheduled to begin the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency says the program, which involves checking meat  
throughout the food production system for such things as fecal 
contamination and proper temperature, has been successful in its 
first year. Before the program was implemented, plant workers only 
poked at carcasses to search visually for signs of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said that early figures show the HACCP  
program is making headway. They say that during the first six 
months after the law took effect, the incidence of salmonella in 
chickens dropped by almost half to 10.4 percent. Salmonella 
prevalence in swine carcasses dropped from 8.7 percent to 5.5 
percent, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	But inspectors alleged Wednesday that some plants do not have  
enough checkpoints to ensure safe meat. They also allege that the 
government is not allowing them to enforce the law and pull problem 
meat from the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors said they fear the government eventually will  
phase out their role, opting instead for a system where monitors 
make infrequent visits to check on plants. They hope to persuade 
Congress to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Sewell, an inspector from Camilla, Ga., said during  
inspections at a poultry plant in Georgia, she found evidence of 
diesel fuel from processing equipment on meat as well as shards of 
metal. She said when she tried to pull the problem meat, her 
supervisors told her to let the company handle it.

<HEADLINE> Spending Urged on Cancer Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal health researchers should take an  
``exponential leap'' forward in dealing with ethnic minorities and 
underserved communities, former U.S. health secretary Louis 
Sullivan told a Senate panel Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate Appropriations subcommittee heard testimony on a  
federal report that urged the National Institutes of Health to 
increase its efforts to determine why minorities are more prone to 
develop and die from certain cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Institute of Medicine, also found that the  
National Cancer Institute spent $24 million -- 1 percent of its 
fiscal 1997 budget -- on research and training programs geared to 
those groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan, health secretary during the Bush administration, said  
the report ``clearly demonstrates that much more needs to be done 
to address the needs of the nation's minority citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is needed is an exponential leap forward in the  
orientation of NIH officials with respect to their approach to 
ethnic minorities and underserved communities,'' added Sullivan, 
now president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the labor,  
health and human services and education subcommittee, to assess the 
``culture'' at NIH, Sullivan said there had been change since his 
tenure, but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply stated, if we are to see meaningful change, rather than  
continued benign neglect, bold steps are necessary,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Educators Protest Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A proposal that would have Catholic universities  
in the United States adhere to Vatican regulations would be 
detrimental to the quality of education, two prominent Catholic 
educators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning comes on the eve of the pope's latest U.S. visit.  
</P>
<P>
	The comments of President Edward Malloy of the University of  
Notre Dame and J. Donald Monan, chancellor of Boston College, were 
made in a joint article to be issued Friday in America magazine. 
America is published by the Jesuit order, which sponsors 28 U.S. 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	America's editor, Father Thomas Reese, said it was a coincidence  
that the article was ready for publication just before John Paul's 
Tuesday arrival for a 30-hour stopover in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed college and university rules, written by a special  
committee of U.S. bishops led by Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua of 
Philadelphia, were presented to the U.S. hierarchy for 
consideration in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Malloy and Monan say the rules undermine two essential qualities  
of U.S. campuses, academic freedom and institutional autonomy free 
from outside control. 
</P>
<P>
	They are especially alarmed over proposed requirements that  
theology teachers have a ``mandate'' from church authorities, that 
theology teachers and some administrators make a profession of 
faith and take an oath of fidelity upon appointment, and that 
colleges require appointees to display doctrinal and personal 
integrity in line with church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Such provisions are included in the code of canon law that the  
pope put into effect in 1983. But Malloy and Monan state that these 
provisions, ``with the full knowledge of the U.S. hierarchy, and 
with good reason, had been lifeless for 25 years'' until they were 
revived by the Bevilacqua committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict stems from a Vatican decree on Catholic higher  
education, Ex Corde Ecclesiae, which was approved by the Pope in 
1990. In 1996, the U.S. bishops overwhelmingly approved a plan to 
implement that document in the U.S. But the following year the 
Vatican rejected the plan and directed the Americans to tighten up 
the hierarchy's control over the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malloy-Monan article is accompanied by an analysis from  
Father James Conn, a Jesuit and dean and canon law professor at St. 
Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore. Conn criticizes a 
previous editorial in America stating that the proposed rules are 
``well-intentioned but unworkable'' and ``could be disastrous for 
U.S. Catholic higher education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conn says both educators and bishops need to answer ``irksome  
questions'' on precisely who applies what powers before the 
hierarchy discusses the text in detail at a meeting next November.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Begin With Patchwork Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Lenny Wilkens has been going to NBA  
training camps as a coach and player since 1960. He's never had a 
first day quite like this. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Hawks, with a patchwork of holdovers, draft picks  
and obscure free agents, started camp Thursday night at Life 
University just eight days before their first exhibition game and 
15 days before the regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy,'' Wilkens, the NBA's winningest coach, said after  
putting 11 players through a two-hour workout. ``It's very 
different to be starting so late and with so few players under 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks had only four players under contract when the lockout  
formally ended with the signing of an agreement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Dikembe Mutombo and guards Mookie Blaylock, Steve Smith  
and Ed Gray were joined by second round draft pick Shammond 
Williams and six players of lesser stature: 
</P>
<P>
	--Brian Oliver, a former Georgia Tech star, has played only 11  
NBA games since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kebu Stewart, whose big-league career covers a mere 15 games.  
</P>
<P>
	--Mitch Henderson, a rookie from Princeton.  
</P>
<P>
	--Jeff Sheppard, who played on Kentucky's national championship  
team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jason Lawson, a little-used rookie with Orlando last season.  
</P>
<P>
	--Bakari Hendrix, a first-year player who was playing with Quad  
Cities of the Continental Basketball Association last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge opportunity for a guy like me, going from  
playing in the CBA to being here now,'' said Hendrix, a 6-foot-8, 
230-pound forward. ``I want to show them what I can do and make the 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might have helped if the newcomers had worn name tags on  
their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking around going, `Where did that guy come from? And  
where did THAT guy come from?''' Blaylock said. ``It's different, 
but it's going to be exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roshwon McLeod, the team's first-round pick from Duke, was  
unable to take part in workouts the first day because of a problem 
finalizing his contract. He expects to be on the court Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even know what's going on,'' said McLeod, who rode an  
exercise bike on the sidelines while his teammates practiced. ``I'm 
anxious to get out there. I want to learn as much as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, the Hawks signed guard Anthony Johnson, who  
averaged 7.5 points, 4.3 assists and 2.2 rebounds during his rookie 
season with the Sacramento Kings, and 15-year veteran center Mark 
West, who played 15 games with Indiana last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks also hope to re-sign second-year forward Chris  
Crawford, who watched practice alongside McLeod. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just rode the bike,'' Crawford said. ``Hopefully, we'll get  
something done (Friday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks also are trying to complete a sign-and-trade deal that  
would send Christian Laettner to the Detroit Pistons for swingman 
Charles O'Bannon and forward Scot Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticeably absent from the first day of training camp was  
free-agent foward Alan Henderson, who supplanted Laettner as a 
starter midway through last season and averaged 14.3 points and 6.4 
rebounds, both career bests. The Hawks and Henderson's agent were 
far apart on money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks also lost out on a couple of other targets to fill the  
small forward opening. Rick Fox agreed to take the $1.75 million 
exception from the Lakers, while Billy Owens was signing with 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Wilkens has to be patient with the players he  
has. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to realize that the skill level is not what we're  
used to and not what we want,'' he said. ``As a coach, you can't be 
highly critical of the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkens didn't push his players too hard after the long layoff  
though most seemed to be in decent shape, especially Smith, 
Blaylock and Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who hasn't played since Jan. 8, when he suffered a broken  
foot during his rookie season, has lost almost 20 pounds from his 
previous playing weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had nothing else to do but work out,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Mixed; Dow Up 4.64 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed after a shaky opening this  
morning, as technology shares lost ground in New York and Brazil 
stocks plummetted. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 4.64 at 9,340.55. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 19.31 to close 
at 9,480.09. 
</P>
<P>
	But broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite  
was down a sharply 49.67 at 2,365.82, after climbing to a record 
high of 2,415.49 on Wednesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was 
off 9.09 at 1,247.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq stocks were lower as high-flying Internet stocks gave  
back some of their recent gains. Amazon.com was down 14 at 99 in 
leading Nasdaq volume. On the Big Board, America Online was down 7 
at 141 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered Advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 106.23 million 
shares, off slightly from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. market was bothered by a steep drop on the Sao Paulo  
Stock Exchange, where the Bovespa index was down 250 points despite 
congressional approval of an important austerity measure hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.55 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up .11 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.96 percent, and France's CAC-40 was

<HEADLINE> Killer-Rapist Gets Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A serial killer and rapist was  
sentenced to death Thursday for a spree that originally was blamed 
on an innocent man who served 16 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Parker, 43, was told that just one of the six murders  
during his 1978-79 spree would warrant an execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``That the defendant would repeat these acts six different times  
is beyond belief,'' Judge Francisco P. Briseno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors late last year convicted and recommended Parker's death  
for the rapes and killings of five women ages 17 to 31, and the 
murder of a full-term fetus being carried by the pregnant Dianne 
Green, now Dianne D'Aiello. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ex-husband, Kevin Green, was sentenced to life in prison for  
that case and served 16 years before he was exonerated in 1996. DNA 
evidence linked Parker to the attack, and he later confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. D'Aiello told Briseno that Parker deserved to die, but that  
she still believes Green beat and raped her shortly before Parker 
did. She had testified against Green at his trial, even though his 
attorneys argued that her recollection couldn't be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the two men is being sentenced here today but the other  
is being forgiven,'' she said. ``I feel like I've been raped by the 
system all over again 17 years later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green has remarried and moved to Missouri. He has maintained his  
innocence throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about me,'' he said Thursday in a phone interview  
from Jefferson City. Green said his ex-wife's mother raised the 
allegations out of animosity toward him ``at a time when Dianne 
couldn't even remember her name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bearded Parker held his head high and surveyed a courtroom  
sprinkled with victims' relatives as he walked to the defendant's 
bench with shackled hands in his pockets. He declined an offer to 
make a statement and stared straight at Briseno as the judge 
delivered the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``bedroom basher'' case terrorized women in Orange County,  
where Parker was stationed as a Marine staff sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	The other victims were Sandra Kay Fry, 17; Kimberly Rawlins, 21;  
Marolyn Carleton, 31; and Debora Jean Kennedy, 24. Most were alone 
in their homes when they were assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker said he attacked repeatedly under the influence of drugs  
and alcohol, and his attorneys told of a history of mental and 
emotional disturbance. Briseno said those factors weren't enough to 
mitigate a death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Edge Up Early / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose in morning trading Friday amid  
increased optimism corporate Japan has begun to speed up 
restructuring moves designed to improve profitability. The dollar 
rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 55.12 points, or 0.39 percent, to  
14,300.54 as of midday. On Thursday, the average closed up 217.37 
points, or 1.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.90 yen in late morning trading, up 0.78  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its level of 113.68 
yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stocks gained ground on buying from  
investors with expectations that streamlining and mergers in the 
banking industry and other sectors will pave the way to recovery, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some see that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and the  
market may be bottoming out very soon,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, 
general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were also encouraged by a report Friday in the Nihon  
Keizai financial daily that foreign investors are likely to resume 
buying Japanese shares in 1999, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 0.89 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,105.81. The 
TOPIX closed up 14.85 points or 1.36 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar continued to strengthen in  
Tokyo after surging in New York on rumors China was going to 
devalue its currency, which would further harm the struggling 
Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the US.currency's gains could be capped by worry over trade  
friction between the U.S. and Japan, which tends to weaken the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 131.93 yen, up from 130.92 yen  
late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.795  
percent from 1.780 percent on Thursday, driving its price down to 
100.04 yen from 100.16 yen.

<HEADLINE> Pope To Return to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The pope travels to Mexico on Friday to sign  
a document outlining church strategy for the Americas in the coming 
decades, and, just as importantly, to return to a country close to 
his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in 1979, during his first foreign trip as pope, that John  
Paul II referred to this country as ``Mexico, always faithful.'' 
Mexicans loved the label, and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country where 87 percent of people identify themselves as  
Roman Catholic, the pope was a major hit -- donning a sombrero at a 
bullfighting ring and strumming a guitar along with a mariachi 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexicans also feel a special closeness to the pope -- and the  
pope to Mexico -- because of his devotion to the Virgin of 
Guadalupe, whose image adorns everything from construction sites to 
government offices. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul was the first pontiff to visit her Mexico City shrine  
in 1979, and in 1992 he dedicated a chapel in St. Peter's Basilica 
to her, placing her image next to the tomb of the first pope. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mexican church officials, it was at the Basilica of  
Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1979 that the pope got the inspiration 
that has marked his papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was while praying here that he realized that he must be a  
traveling pope, going about the world spreading the gospel,'' said 
Hector Fernandez, spokesman for the organizing committee of the 
Pope's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul went on to make 84 more foreign trips over the past 20  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope will return to the basilica on Saturday to announce the  
document on church strategy, and to pray again in front of the 
image of the Virgin Mary which the church says appeared before a 
Mexican Indian in 1531, called him ``son'' and left her image on 
his cloak. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the pope will hold the largest gathering of his trip,  
celebrating Mass with 800,000 people packed into a racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, in the last public act of the trip, he will meet  
with Mexican families and groups from other countries of the 
Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a fitting goodbye for a pope that has stressed family  
values throughout his papacy and placed special emphasis on the 
importance of Latin America for the future of the Roman Catholic 
Church. Half the world's Catholics live in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will have a special message of hope for Latin America,''  
said Francisco Gonzalez Garza, organizer of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups in seven other cities -- Tegucigalpa, Honduras; Panama  
City; Los Angeles; Caracas, Venezuela; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Buenos 
Aires, Argentina and Lima, Peru -- will be able to participate in 
the event via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the transcontinental span of the mission, the focus  
is clearly on Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	As the pope said in June when he welcomed Mexico's new  
ambassador to the Vatican: ``I recall with fondness my pastoral 
visits to your beloved country, in which I could perceive ... the 
warmth of the welcome and hospitality and so many demonstrations of 
affection.''

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Veteran Leads George Mason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- George Evans is a Gulf War veteran who  
bought back guns for the U.S. Army on the streets of Haiti, drove 
Gen. John Shalikashvili around Belgium and watched in horror as 
people jumped into fires to find food in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is a 27-year-old sophomore forward who is leading George  
Mason to its best basketball season this decade. He leads the team 
in scoring, rebounding, blocked shots -- and level-headed 
perspective. After all, missing a layup in a game is nothing 
compared to the fight to liberate Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a lot,'' Evans said. ``But I thank God I have the  
life that I have now. I'm just trying to make it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Evans' latest mission, helping turn the Patriots into a  
winning program, is easy. Even though he grew up in Portsmouth, 
Va., and was based less than 100 miles away in Aberdeen, Md., 
during his seven-year stint in the Army, basketball in the D.C. 
area to him meant Georgetown, Maryland and George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never heard of George Mason until I got a call from (Paul)  
Westhead,'' said Evans, who was recruited by several schools 
because of his play with a touring Army select team. ``I signed a 
letter of intent without even visiting the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westhead is the former NBA coach whose effort to bring his  
run-and-gun style to George Mason was a failure in four losing 
seasons. He also had numerous off-the-court problems with players. 
When Westhead was fired in 1997, Evans was ready to change his mind 
about attending George Mason until new coach Jim Larranaga 
re-recruited him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 1 1/2 years later, Larranaga, Evans and a roster of good  
athletes with growing defensive prowess have the Patroits (9-8, 6-2 
Colonial Athletic Association) playing well. They started a 
school-best 5-0 in the CAA and trailed first-place Old Dominion by 
a half-game following Wednesday night's 77-68 victory over Virginia 
Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine victories match the total from last year's 9-18 team,  
and a winning record is possible for the first time since Ernie 
Nestor's team went 20-12 in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came here, I said that George Mason is a sleeping  
giant,'' Larranaga said. ``The biggest thing was establishing a new 
philosophy. We spend a lot of time with players off the court. We 
tell them they are role models. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The offense) changed from Day One. The first 3-pointer that  
(6-foot-9 center) Nik Mirich shot was the last. Before the ball hit 
the rim, there was a substitute at the scorer's table. I think I 
got my message across right away that it was going to be a lot more 
disciplined and a lot more fundamentals stressed. And, most 
importantly, putting a lot of emphasis into the defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which meant Evans would be just the player to lead the team in  
the locker room. Larranaga's two words to describe Evans are 
discipline and respect, essentials from military life that transfer 
easily to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned a lot about discipline and teamwork'' in the Army,  
Evans said. ``I learned that I had to depend on someone else more 
than I could depend on myself. He's watching my back and I'm 
watching his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, who has to put up with good-natured ``old man'' banter  
from teammates, left the Army because it began to wear on him after 
so many high-stress assignments. His decision to get a college 
degree has brought more stress: His wife took a job in Florida, so 
he only gets to see her and their 7-year-old daughter during 
college breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Evans said. ``But I can't let my wife know it's  
tough, because she barely handles it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans leads the CAA in scoring (17.7 points), and is in the top  
five in rebounding (8.5), blocks (2.82) and steals (2.05). Still, 
his exploits don't come close to filling even half of the 
10,000-seat Patriot Center, which never has been sold out for a 
basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Larranaga says success eventually will draw fans. For Evans,  
that could start with winning the CAA. Then he could emulate his 
brother Darrian, a senior forward for South Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went to the (NCAA) tournament last year,'' Evans said.  
``I'm trying to get there this year.''

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke May Have To Pay Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is seeking a civil fine  
from Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's choice to be United 
Nations ambassador, for contacting a former government colleague. 
But an ex-State Department executive said Thursday it would have 
been ``ridiculous'' to avoid that contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the White House reaffirmed that Clinton remains  
``lock, stock and barrel'' behind Holbrooke, a 57-year-old veteran 
diplomat whose ambition and forceful personality have produced 
detractors as well as fans. Spokesman David Leavy said the White 
House has no information about the proposed penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged conflict of interest was uncovered during an FBI  
investigation begun after Clinton announced his choice of Holbrooke 
for the high-profile diplomatic post seven months ago, Justice 
Department officials said Thursday, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. The nomination has yet to be sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Lord, who served as assistant secretary of state for  
East Asia and Pacific affairs from 1993 to 1997, said in an 
interview, ``It would have been ridiculous if he (Holbrooke) 
hadn't'' contacted U.S. Ambassador James Laney in South Korea while 
he was a government consultant on a diplomatic mission assigned to 
him by Lord. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the Justice Department, an official said, ``There are  
negotiations under way that stem from our investigation. The 
negotiations (with Holbrooke and his attorney) are over a possible 
civil penalty for improper conflicts of interest.'' No criminal 
violations were uncovered by the FBI probe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Justice official said the case involved Holbrooke's  
allegedly contacting a State Department official sooner than the 
law allowed after he left government in February 1996 to work for 
the investment banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal ethics laws limit the lobbying contacts that former  
officials can have for a period after leaving the government. The 
penalty in such a civil violation would probably be a fine of 
several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of Holbrooke said Thursday that the FBI cleared him of  
allegations of improper contacts with U.S. Embassy officials in 
Hungary in 1995, but questioned his contact with Laney, the 
ambassador, within months of Holbrooke's departure from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to clear this up, but he doesn't believe he's done  
anything wrong,'' said one friend, who requested anonymity. 
``Neither he nor First Boston benefited from the contact in 
Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lord said he asked Holbrooke in early 1996 to make some stops  
during an Asia trip that included Korea to explain U.S. policy and 
report back to him on his perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of my predecessors as assistant secretary for East  
Asia so he knew the region and as former ambassador to Germany he 
could talk to the Koreans about their concerns about reunification 
of their country,'' Lord said. Holbrooke was a State Department 
consultant and special government employee at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course he contacted Ambassador Laney. It would have been  
ridiculous if he hadn't,'' Lord said. ``It would have been rude, 
inappropriate and would have undercut the ambassador. I would have 
called him up and yelled at him if he hadn't contacted the 
ambassador.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lord emphasized, ``We never discussed business, only U.S. policy  
in Asia and Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Holbrooke nor his attorney was immediately available to  
respond to the report from officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times quoted unidentified friends of Holbrooke as  
saying he balked at paying a fine of several thousand dollars 
because he believed he had done nothing wrong and because such a 
settlement might endanger his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials had hoped the investigations could be  
wrapped up early this year, and Holbrooke, chief architect of the 
1995 Bosnia peace accord and recent settlement in Kosovo, cleared 
of any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the delay, Clinton has not wavered in his support of  
Holbrooke, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has enormous respect for Ambassador Holbrooke's  
intellect and judgment and believes he will be a superb ambassador 
to the United Nations,'' Leavy said. ``The events of the last 
couple months with Iraq and Kosovo prove that we need someone of 
Ambassador Holbrooke's caliber to advance U.S. interests at the 
United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president stands behind Dick lock, stock and barrel.''

<HEADLINE> Arms Control Treaty May Be Amended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said today it may seek to  
amend a 1972 arms control treaty to permit deployment of a national 
missile defense, but a senior official said the administration 
would not necessarily abandon the treaty if Russia refused to amend 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bell, an arms control specialist on the National Security  
Council, said news reports had misrepresented what Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday in announcing the 
administration will make an accelerated push to build missile 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary did not threaten to withdraw from the treaty,''  
Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen did note in his remarks at a Pentagon news conference  
Wednesday that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty allows either 
the United States or Russia to withdraw from it with six months' 
notice. Other officials said the administration would not let the 
ABM treaty stand in the way of deploying missile defenses if 
President Clinton decides such defenses are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the administration intends to open negotiations with  
Moscow on ways of amending the treaty to allow the United States to 
deploy missile defenses now in development. Bell stressed today 
that the administration had not yet decided which amendments it 
might propose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deployment may or may not require modifications to the  
treaty,'' Bell said. ``If deployment required modifcations, we 
would in good faith seek agreement on the needed amendments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That conflicted with an assertion by Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles,  
director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, that it was 
clear that an effective national missile defense could not be built 
without amending the ABM treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Cohen said he would prefer that the ABM treaty  
be preserved to discourage the spread of offensive missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked what the administration would do, however, if the  
Russians refused to amend the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we have the option of our national interest indicating we  
would simply pull out of the treaty,'' he replied. Cohen noted that 
the treaty provides for a right of withdrawal with six months' 
notice if either party concludes renouncing the pact is in its 
``supreme national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said administration officials are studying exactly what  
modifications would be needed. Russia, and before it the Soviet 
Union, long has opposed a U.S. national missile defense, in part in 
fear that such a system would make America the only nation 
invulnerable to missile attack. The Cold War-era ABM treaty was 
meant to make both superpowers vulnerable to attack and thus limit 
the chance that either would attempt a decisive first strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said  
President Boris Yeltsin received Clinton's message outlining U.S. 
proposals on the ABM treaty. Russia's ``position is now being 
worked out,'' Rakhmanin told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen announced that the administration now believes it probably  
will take two years longer than previously estimated to build a 
defense against long-range missile attacks. At the same time, he 
said the need for such a defense system is greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration moved its target date for deploying a  
national missile defense from 2003 to 2005, Cohen said. Deployment 
is estimated to cost $10.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Clinton's proposed 2000 budget, to be submitted to  
Congress on Feb. 1, will include an extra $6.6 billion for missile 
defense work through the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether actually to deploy a national missile  
defense will be made in June 2000, Cohen said. The decision will 
depend on two things, he said: The level of threat of a missile 
attack and the Defense Department's technical readiness to build 
such a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are affirming that there is a threat, and the threat is  
growing, and that it will pose a danger not only to our troops 
overseas but also to Americans here at home,'' Cohen said. He said 
the main worry was of a limited missile attack from a hostile 
nation such as North Korea or Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who long has argued for an accelerated  
push on missile defense, called the Pentagon announcement a ``small 
step'' in the right direction. He said it meant the administration 
was acknowledging it had underestimated the missile threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am encouraged by and hope today's announcement really  
signals a change in administration policy,'' Weldon said. ``But I 
remain skeptical given the president's continuing lack of a firm 
commitment to proceed with deployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The missile defense system Cohen described would include a  
sensor based in space that would detect the plume of a ballistic 
missile at liftoff, providing early warning of an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground-based radars in the United States would calculate the  
missile's trajectory and guide a ground-launched interceptor rocket 
to destroy the missile outside the earth's atmosphere. The 
interceptor rockets might be based in Alaska or North Dakota, Cohen 
said.

<HEADLINE> Polaroid Has $75M 4th Quarter Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Polaroid Corp. reported Thursday it lost  
$75.5 million during the fourth quarter due to cutbacks in orders 
from U.S. retailers and continuing weakness in overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's loss translated to $1.72 cents per diluted share,  
and compared with a loss of $202.8 million, or $4.51 per share, in 
the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring charges contributed to Polaroid's losses the past  
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the company has cut back on manufacturing for  
distribution in the United States as stores reduce their inventory 
of Polaroids. Domestic sales fell about 6 percent in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales overseas have also dropped -- about 16 percent for the  
period -- because of the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, sales for the fourth quarter fell to $541.8 million from  
$607.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary DiCamillo, the company's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said fourth quarter results met expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the fourth quarter would close out a difficult year,  
given worldwide market conditions and the dealer inventory 
reduction program,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Polaroid lost $51 million, or $1.15 a dilluted  
share, compared to $126.7 million, or $2.81 a diluted share, in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales declined to $1.85 billion from $2.15 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Polaroid had introduced new products in 1998 including instant  
cameras marketed for children in hopes of boosting sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Polaroid fell 56 1/4 cents to $18.06 1/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> No Script for Rest of Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After six days of rehearsed speeches, the  
Senate trial of President Clinton now plunges into uncharted 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows what will emerge from 16 hours of unscripted  
questions from senators, beginning Friday. After that, there will 
be unforeseen twists and turns in partisan debate over witnesses, 
Senate secrecy and motions to dismiss, acquit or convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Clinton be called or invited to testify? How long will the  
trial last? 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty is risky for both sides.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you start getting witnesses, who knows where it is going to  
lead?'' said presidential historian and biographer Robert Dallek of 
Boston University. ``Who knows what missteps might be made by 
either the prosecution or the defense? There are dangers on both 
sides in dragging it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Republicans, there is the threat that scandal-weary  
Americans will hold them accountable and punish them at the polls 
for prolonging the ordeal. ``You should never go into a war unless 
you have an exit strategy,'' Princeton University political 
scientist Fred Greenstein said. ``The problem for the Republicans 
is to find an exit strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Clinton, there is the possibility of unexpected testimony  
and surprise charges requiring more witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all heard these rumors about things that Clinton did in  
the past that haven't come out yet,'' said University of 
Pennsylvania political scientist Mark Rozell. ``If any such thing 
turned out to be true, the whole equation changes.'' But he thought 
that was unlikely, given the exhaustive investigation already 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real uncertainty,'' Rozell said, ``is how long is it going  
to take us to get exactly where we know this is going: a 
presidential acquittal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there is no sign of Democratic defections that could  
doom Clinton's presidency. While Republicans control the Senate by 
a 55 to 45 vote margin, they would have to pick up 12 Democrats to 
reach the 67 votes necessary to oust Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe a group of Republican moderates, tiring of  
the case, eventually will break away and reduce the effective GOP 
majority to under 50, putting an end to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of legal arguments, the next step is questions from  
the senators. Sixteen hours have been reserved, divided evenly 
between Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	There is uncertainty about how the process will unfold. How long  
will the lawyers have on each side to respond? Will followup 
questions be allowed? Most likely, Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
will decide. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is hard to imagine that the question and answer session  
will break ground not already explored in six long days of 
prosecution and defense arguments. To each question, there probably 
is an answer that has been heard before. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the Senate will begin considering motions likely to  
rock the bipartisanship that guided the first stage of the trial. 
One of the first tests will be a Democratic proposal early next 
week for a final up-or-down vote on the two articles of impeachment 
against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	That is unlikely to succeed at this stage, but the ensuing  
battle probably will shatter the notion that 100 senators -- 
Republicans and Democrats alike -- are without political motives in 
the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bipartisanship begins to evaporate at that  
point,'' said Rozell. Until then, there really hasn't been much 
reason to quarrel. ``What have the senators had to do but sit 
quietly and shut up? Pretty soon, that's not going to be the case 
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Inflation Said Too High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico's consumer prices rose too sharply  
last year but the inflationary trend will likely change course in 
February, Bank of Mexico Gov. Guillermo Ortiz said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy performed ``very well'' last year in light of global  
financial turmoil, with gross domestic product likely rising 4.8 
percent to 4.9 percent, Ortiz told reporters at the Santander 
Investment Latin American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But a weaker peso, market turbulence and higher prices for  
fruits and vegetables contributed to an unsatisfactory rise in 
consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the one point that wasn't good was inflation,'' said  
Ortiz. ``The (central) bank is certainly unhappy with the result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation reached 18.6 percent last year, up from 15.7 percent  
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we're going to have an important inflection in  
inflation toward the month of February,'' Ortiz said. ``You saw 
that the central bank tightened (monetary policy) last week and 
we're going to announce our (1999 monetary policy) next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank last week further restricted liquidity, sharply  
raising its daily ``short'' of the money market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz declined to comment on the bank's 1999 monetary policy,  
saying it would be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflationary expectations will diminish if the public is  
convinced that the central bank will act ``with determination,'' 
leading to lower interest rates, Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican economy faces a ``difficult panorama'' this year but  
will be among the best performers in Latin America, Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite last week's turbulence in Brazil, etcetera, I believe  
the (Mexican) economy has real strengths and resiliencies that are 
proven with results, that aren't theoretical speculation,'' Ortiz 
said. ``Our outlook is reasonable for maintaining growth and 
lowering inflation.''

<HEADLINE> Gateway Reports Record 4th-Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH SIOUX CITY, S.D. (AP) -- Strong personal-computer sales  
helped boost Gateway's fourth-quarter earnings to record levels, 
surpassing analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months ended Dec. 31, Gateway earned $129.1  
million, or 81 cents a diluted share. This was up 39 percent from 
the year-ago period, when Gateway earned $92.9 million, or 59 cents 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had projected earnings of 78  
cents per diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter sales totaled $2.31 billion, a 17 percent  
increase from $1.98 billion in the comparable period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway sold a record 1.14 million personal computers in the  
fourth quarter and crossed the $2 billion sales mark for the first 
time. It shipped 850,000 PCs during the last quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales both domestically and overseas helped Gateway,  
which added 59 stores in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our phone, retail and Web channels all performed well and even  
more importantly, in harmony, giving customers a superior buying 
experience,'' said Jeff Weitzen, president and chief operating 
officer, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, sales in 1998 were $7.4 billion, a 19 percent increase  
from 1997. Net income was $346.3 million, or $2.18 per diluted 
share, compared to $109.7 million, or 70 cents per diluted share, 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued after the markets had closed. Shares of  
Gateway fell 50 cents to $58 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II, slowed but far from stopped  
by illness and his 78 years, apparently didn't have to think twice 
before accepting Archbishop Justin Rigali's invitation to visit St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the two men are old friends, Rigali acknowledged,  
may have had something to do with it. Out of the spotlight, Rigali 
toiled for many years as one of the most influential Americans at 
the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	He also accompanied John Paul II on his U.S. trips in 1979 and  
1987 and joined him at World Youth Day in Denver in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did work very closely with him from the time he was elected  
(20 years ago) until I was named archbishop of St. Louis'' in 1994, 
Rigali said. ``When I was appointed here, I expressed the hope that 
he could come to St. Louis. Over the years I renewed the 
invitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Rigali said, when the pope decided to conclude the  
Americas synod by delivering his report on the debate in Mexico 
City, it all came together. The pontiff was arriving in the Mexican 
capital Friday, with his two-day St. Louis visit set to begin 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I renewed the invitation once more, and the pope graciously  
accepted it,'' said Rigali, noting that St. Louis has not had a 
previous papal visit. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not the city by the Mississippi River that calls itself  
the gateway to the West? ``The St. Louis area is rich in Catholic 
history and has had a splendid role to carry in the history of the 
United States,'' Rigali said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul was here in 1969, but at that time he was Cardinal  
Karol Wojtyla, archbishop of Krakow, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigali was born in Los Angeles, where he was ordained a priest  
at age 25 after studying at a Los Angeles diocesan seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduate studies in Rome, he entered the diplomatic  
service of the Holy See. While at the Vatican, he worked in the 
English section of the Secretariat of State, the super-agency that 
oversees all Vatican departments, under Pope Paul VI. He was 
appointed head the section in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	And he held an even more powerful post from 1989 to 1994 as  
secretary of the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops, which screens 
bishop nominations for much of the world. He was elevated to 
archbishop in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul has praised Rigali's ``ready availability, great  
industriousness (and) unceasing solicitude for the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican observers call Rigali a close collaborator of the pope  
and view him as being on the fast track to become a cardinal. His 
predecessor in St. Louis, the late John May, was pointedly bypassed 
for that honor, but the three preceding St. Louis archbishops all 
received the red hat. The first St. Louis cardinal was John 
Glennon, elevated in 1946 as the first U.S. cardinal west of the 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know him describe Rigali as tight-lipped,  
hard-working, intelligent and genuinely pious. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigali recalls that on previous U.S. visits the pope met with  
ecumenical and interfaith leaders at nearly every stop. And the 
same will be true in St. Louis. Leaders of other religions have 
been invited to an ecumenical prayer service Wednesday at the St. 
Louis Cathedral Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing us is a very important part of what he considers a  
pastoral visit, having personal contact with the local church and 
at same time with the larger community,'' Rigali said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's primary message, Rigali believes, will be familiar:  
``Emphasis on human dignity and life has been the hallmark of his 
preaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul II, history's most traveled pope, typically draws  
enormous audiences in his trips to many corners of the world. 
Between 500,000 and 1 million people attended Masses he celebrated 
in New York's Central Park in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of at least 1 million people for the St. Louis visit  
may be on the mark or even low, said Monsignor Richard Stika, 
coordinator for the papal visit. A crowd of 104,000 is expected to 
fill the Trans World Dome for Tuesday's scheduled papal Mass, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never realized what a monumental task this would be or how  
much influence the pope's visit here would have on people in other 
parts of the country,'' said Stika, noting that St. Louis' central 
location may add to the numbers. ``I'm guessing the crowd will be 
very, very large, if the weather is decent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even that won't be left to chance. Stika said about 150  
contemplative nuns in the St. Louis archdiocese have been asked to 
pray for good weather.

<HEADLINE> Suit Settled Against Fla. Harasser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A woman who says she endured 21 years of harassing  
phone calls from a stranger who claimed her missing daughter was 
held as a sex slave has settled a lawsuit against the man for $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Billig said Thursday that the deal with former U.S.  
Customs agent Henry Johnson Blair cannot restore her peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved for him to say `I'm sorry,' just once, but  
he never did,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Billig's daughter, Amy, disappeared March 5, 1974, at age  
17. Mrs. Billig held a service for her last year after a former 
motorcycle gang member confessed on his deathbed that Amy was 
drugged and raped by the gang and her body was dumped in the 
Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair was sentenced in 1996 to two years in prison for  
aggravated stalking. In her civil lawsuit, Mrs. Billig said Blair 
called her as often as seven times a night starting four months 
after Amy's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's attorney, Marcelle Poirier, had no comment.

	LONDON (AP) -- A group of churches has drawn fire for an Easter  
services recruiting poster that compares Christ with Marxist 
revolutionary Che Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
	The poster depicts the leader of Cuba's 1959 Communist  
revolution, his beret replaced with a crown of thorns. The caption: 
``Meek. Mild. As if. Discover the real Jesus. Church. April 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, created by an advertising agency on behalf of a  
group of churches led by the Church of England, was intended to 
show Jesus as a revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support the view that we should produce striking images of  
our lord,'' Julian Brazier, a Conservative Party lawmaker, told The 
Daily Mail. '' But portraying Christ as a Communist revolutionary 
is verging on the blasphemous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Tom Ambrose, secretary of the Churches Advertising  
Network, said the image showed the revolutionary spirit within 
mainstream Christian churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get away from the wimpy Nordic figure in a white  
nightie,'' Ambrose was quoted as saying. ``Jesus was more 
revolutionary that anyone in the 20th century. He was crucified 
exactly because he was a revolutionary.''

 *Churches plan a `Souper' Sunday    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Organizers expect 12,000 congregations to  
join the ``Souper Bowl'' Jan. 31. The nationwide fund-raising 
campaign to help the hungry coincides with pro football's Super 
Bowl. Last year, 8,600 churches raised $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At ``Souper Bowl,'' church youths ask worshippers to give $1  
apiece as they leave the services. Some also collect canned goods. 
The proceeds go to local charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea originated in 1990 with the youth group at Spring  
Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia. It went national in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this idea is a gift from God, and we encourage  
everyone to join the team,'' says the Rev. Brad Smith, one of the 
founders.

 *What constitutes 'gay marriage?'    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fifteen Catholics have petitioned Oakland  
Bishop John Cummins to defrock a Pleasanton pastor for allowing gay 
marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The targeted priest, the Rev. Dan Danielson of St. Augustine's  
Church, said he had authorized three gay blessings in his parish, 
but he did not conduct the ceremonies himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing resembling a marriage,'' Danielson said.  
``There was no exchange of vows or rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The petition said, in part, ``We are aware of the church's  
constant teaching that 'homosexual acts are acts of grave 
depravity' and of the pope's clear teaching that such relationships 
must never be blessed by the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Barbara Flannery, chancellor of the Diocese of Oakland,  
said the petition had been received and will be investigated.

 *Methodists reach out to Holiness groups    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Christian unity commission of the United  
Methodist Church will come together with representatives of 
Holiness churches Feb. 18-20 in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Holiness churches broke away from Methodism in the late 19th and  
early 20th centuries for several reasons, including some 
long-outdated issues such as pew rentals and slavery. Generally 
they have been more informal in worship style, more conservative in 
theology and more zealous in evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting at Southern Methodist University's theology school  
will include delegates from the Church of the Nazarene, Church of 
Christ Holiness, Church of God (Anderson, Ind.), Free Methodist 
Church, Korean Holiness Church, Salvation Army and Wesleyan Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are to celebrate their common roots, discuss the  
points in history when they went their separate ways and explore 
what they might do jointly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done very well through our history in keeping touch with  
our Anglican roots, but we haven't done so well keeping touch with 
our Holiness roots,'' said the Rev. Elisabeth Gamble of the 
Methodists' Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious 
Concerns.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Social Tax Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From caring for newborns to providing for  
disabled relatives, President Clinton seems to have a tax credit 
for every social concern. The White House is proposing billions of 
dollars in such targeted tax breaks in its new federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts say these credits are being used increasingly to  
replace direct spending on government programs, and some critics 
say they will make the tax code even more complex than it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a more popular way to channel money to people to cover  
basic needs,'' said Mimi Abramovitz, professor at New York's Hunter 
College of Social Work. ``It's kind of what they used to call 
social engineering: You get a tax cut if you perform certain 
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the tax code's most popular and long-standing such breaks  
is the deduction for home mortgage interest, which gives people a 
strong incentive to buy houses. Others include the new $500-a-child 
credit -- to encourage creation of traditional families -- and a 
break for businesses that hire people coming off welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	To that list, Clinton this month has proposed credits for the  
next fiscal year's budget that would benefit stay-at-home parents, 
long-term care of disabled people and companies that invest in 
certain low-income areas. There are breaks for the steel industry, 
credits for businesses that hire the handicapped and incentives for 
buyers of bonds used to finance setting aside natural spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the draft proposals released so far would cost  
roughly $10.5 billion over five years, but administration officials 
say the final total in credits and breaks in Clinton's coming 
budget plan is likely to reach about $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, a president might have proposed programs that would  
simply write government checks for such social needs. But with 
Republicans who control Congress and Clinton himself publicly 
opposed to big government, and complicated budget rules imposing 
tough limits on direct spending, a tax credit is much easier to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might be able to target a policy objective slightly more  
efficiently on the spending side, but you opt for doing it on the 
tax side because you can do it 75 percent as well with a far higher 
chance of passage,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's chief economic 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to make the perfect the enemy of the good.''  
</P>
<P>
	Many of Clinton's tax-credit proposals are individually cheered  
by Republicans, and they've frequently supported other targeted tax 
breaks, such as the Roth IRA, that provide incentives for private 
retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a group, the GOP says it would be better to simply enact  
broad tax cuts, such as their proposed 10 percent income tax 
reduction, and let people determine what problems need to be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than picking and choosing winners and losers or having  
'Nanny Washington' tell you how you're going to be able to use your 
money, ... wouldn't it be preferable to have a rate cut across the 
board? Let the people decide?'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts say the proliferation of tax credits means more  
complications in the tax code. For example, the Internal Revenue 
Service estimates taxpayers must spend about 90 minutes filling out 
forms for the new $1,500 Hope scholarship credit for college 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question it adds to the burden,'' said Gillian  
Spooner, director of tax policy at the KPMG accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businesses, who have been frequent recipients of targeted  
tax breaks, sometimes balk at taking advantage because of the time 
and paperwork it takes to do so, said Jack Faris, president of the 
National Federation of Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates another bureaucrat to come check to make sure that  
they're doing everything right, that they're keeping all the 
records,'' Faris said. ``They've learned just to not deal with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the question, some critics complain that  
tax credits often leave out the most needy people because they 
focus on those who earn income. For instance, Clinton's proposed 
$250 credit for stay-at-home parents stands in contrast to welfare 
laws that eventually force parents into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``People love these credits, but they don't like welfare for  
single mothers,'' said Hunter College's Abramovitz. ``They should 
not ignore the needs of people who can't find a job or can't get 
hired.''

<HEADLINE> Bumpers' Speech Defending Clinton-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of closing argument before the Senate of former Sen. Dale  
Bumpers, D-Ark., in President Clinton's defense, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment was debated off and on in Philadelphia for the  
entire four months, as I said. The key players were Governor 
Morris, Senator Specter, a brilliant Pennsylvanian. 
</P>
<P>
	George Mason, the only man reputedly to have been so brilliant  
that Thomas Jefferson actually deferred to him. And he refused to 
sign the Constitution, incidentally, even though he was a delegate, 
because they didn't deal with slavery and he was a strict 
abolitionist. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was Charles Pinkney. Senator Hollings from South  
Carolina, just a youngster, 29 years old, I believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Randolph from Virginia, who had a big role in the  
Constitution in the beginning -- the Virginia Plan. And then there 
was, of course, James Madison, the craftsman. 
</P>
<P>
	They were all key players in drafting this impeachment  
provision. And uppermost in the mind during the entire time they 
were composing was they did not want any kings. They had lived 
under despots, they had lived under kings, they had lived under 
autocrats, and they didn't want any of that. And they succeeded 
very admirably. We've had 46 presidents, and no kings. 
</P>
<P>
	But they kept talking about corruption, maybe that ought to be  
the reason for impeachment, because they feared some president 
would corrupt the political process. That's what the debate was 
about. Corrupt the political process and ensconce himself through a 
phony election, maybe as something close to a king. 
</P>
<P>
	They followed the British rule on impeachment, because the  
British said, the House of Commons may impeach, and the House of 
Lords must convict. And every one of the colonies had the same 
procedure: House, Senate. Though, in all fairness, House members, 
Alexander Hamilton was not very keen on the House participating. 
</P>
<P>
	But here was the sequence of events at Philadelphia that brought  
us here today. They started out with ``maladministration,'' and 
Madison said that's too vague. What does that mean? So they dropped 
that. They went from that to ``corruption'' and they dropped that. 
Then they went to ``malpractice.'' And they decided that was not 
definitive enough. 
</P>
<P>
	And they went to ``treason, bribery and corruption.'' And they  
decided that still didn't suit them. But bear in mind one thing. 
During this entire process, they are narrowing -- they are narrowing 
the things you can impeach the president for. They were making it 
tougher. Madison said if we aren't careful, the president will 
serve at the pleasure of the legislature -- the Senate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And then they went to ``treason and bribery'' and somebody said  
that's still not quite enough. 
</P>
<P>
	And so they went to treason, bribery, and George Mason added  
``or other high crimes and misdemeanors against the United 
States.'' And they voted on it, and on Sept. 10 they sent the 
entire Constitution to a committee. 
</P>
<P>
	They called a committee on style and arrangement, which was the  
committee that would draft the language in a way that everybody 
would understand; it would be well-crafted from a grammatical 
standpoint. But that committee, which was dominated by Madison and 
Hamilton, dropped ``against the United States.'' And historians 
will tell you that the reason they did that was because of 
redundance, because that committee had no right to change the 
substance of anything. They would not have dropped it if they 
hadn't felt that it was redundant. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, they put in for good measure -- we can always be  
grateful -- the two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Now this is one of the most important points of this entire  
presentation: The term -- first of all -- ``treason and bribery,'' 
nobody quarrels with that, and we're not debating treason and 
bribery here in this chamber. We're talking about ``other high 
crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	And where did ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' come from? It  
came from the English law, and they found it in an English law 
under a category which said, ``distinctly political offenses 
against the state.'' Let me repeat that. They said ``high crimes 
and misdemeanors was to be,'' because they took it from English 
law, where they found it in the category that said, ``offenses 
distinctly political against the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So colleagues, please, for just one moment, forget the  
complexities of the facts and the tortured legalisms. And we've 
heard them all brilliantly presented on both sides, and I'm not 
getting into that. But ponder this. If ``high crimes and 
misdemeanors'' was taken from English law by George Mason, which 
listed high crimes and misdemeanors as political offenses against 
the state, what are we doing here? 
</P>
<P>
	If, as Hamilton said, it had to be a crime against society or a  
breach of the public trust, what are we doing here? 
</P>
<P>
	Even perjury, concealing or deceiving. An unfaithful  
relationship does not even come close to being an impeachable 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has suggested that Bill Clinton committed a political  
crime against the state. So, colleagues, if you honor the 
Constitution, you must look at the history of the Constitution and 
how we got to the impeachment clause. And if you do that and you do 
that honestly, according to the oath you took, you cannot -- you can 
censure Bill Clinton, you can hand him over to the prosecutor for 
him to be prosecuted, but you cannot convict him. And you cannot 
indulge yourselves the luxury or the right to ignore this history. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been a suggestion that a vote to acquit would be  
something of a breach of faith with those who lie in Flanders 
Field, Anzio and Bunker Hill and Gettysburg and wherever. I didn't 
hear that; I read about it. 
</P>
<P>
	But I want to say, and incidentally, I think it was Chairman  
Hyde who alluded to this and said, ``Those men fought and died for 
the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I can remember a cold Nov. 3 morning in my little home town of  
Charleston, Ark. I was 18 years old. I had just gotten one semester 
in at the university when I went into the Marine Corps. And so, I 
reported to Little Rock to be inducted. 
</P>
<P>
	My, it was cold. The drugstore was the bus stop. I had to be  
there by 8 o'clock to be sworn in, and I had to catch the bus down 
at the drugstore at 3 o'clock in the morning so my mother and 
father and I got up at 2 o'clock, got dressed, and went down there. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm not sure I can tell you this story.  
</P>
<P>
	And the bus came over the hill. I was rather frightened anyway  
about going in. I was quite sure I was going to be killed, only 
slightly less frightened that Betty would find somebody else while 
I was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	When the bus came over Schoolhouse Hill, my parents started  
crying. I had never seen my father cry. I knew I was in some 
difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as a parent at my age, I know he thought he was giving not  
his only begotten son, but one of his begotten sons. Can you 
imagine? You know that scene. It was repeated across this nation 
millions of times. 
</P>
<P>
	And then happily, I survived that war, saw no combat, was on my  
way to Japan when it all ended. I'd never had a terrible problem 
with dropping the bomb, though that's been a terrible moral dilemma 
for me, because the estimates were that we would lose as many as a 
million men in that invasion.

<HEADLINE> United, Continental Earnings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, saw its  
fourth-quarter earnings fall 18 percent, hurt by weak demand for 
travel in Asia and slower growth in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines' quarterly earnings dropped by 9.6 percent,  
with a rise in passenger traffic offset by a decline in the average 
fare paid by passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Airlines Co. reported a 36 percent rise in its  
fourth-quarter earnings, with its results boosted by cheaper jet 
fuel. 

</P>
<P>
                             *UAL Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based company, which is the nation's biggest air  
carrier, earned $189 million for the quarter, or $1.52 a share, 
compared with $231 million, or $1.74 a share, in the same quarter a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include a non-cash, foreign-exchange yen  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter was $4.28 billion, compared with $4.24  
billion in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited weak Asian economies, increased competition  
for international passengers and slower growth in U.S. travel as 
hampering profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with our fourth-quarter results, especially  
considering the external constraints under which we were 
operating,'' UAL Chairman and CEO Gerald Greenwald said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	United's earnings comes a day after the carrier said it was  
interested in acquiring smaller rival America West Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, earnings were $1.34 billion, or $10.50 a share,  
compared with $1.320 billion, or $9.97 a share, in 1997. Revenue 
for the year was $17.56 billion, compared with $17.38 billion in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL's results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. Its  
stock was down 93 3/4 cents at $60.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Continental Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The Houston-based airline reported fourth-quarter earnings of  
$66 million, or 91 cents per diluted share, compared with $73 
million, or 97 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental, the nation's fifth-largest carrier, had revenues of  
$1.9 billion, up 5.8 percent from $1.8 billion in the 1997 period. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Continental began its alliance with Northwest Airlines  
by launching joint frequent flyer programs. This month, the two 
carriers instituted a domestic and international code-sharing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental also continued expanding into new international  
markets in 1998, adding nonstop service to such cities as Tokyo, 
Dublin and Santiago, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Continental reported earnings of $383  
million, of $5.02 per diluted share, compared with $385 million, or 
$4.99 a share, the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $7.95 billion, up from $7.21 billion a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Continental's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates.  
Continental's Class B shares were unchanged at $33.31 1/4 on the NYSE. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Southwest Airlines Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based carrier earned $100.4 million, or 29 cents a  
diluted share, compared with fourth quarter 1997 earnings of $80.5 
million, or 23 cents per share on a diluted basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 7.4 percent to $1.05 billion, compared with  
$975.6 million, compared with a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest chairman Herb Kelleher said the airline was able to  
keep costs down in the quarter mainly because of low fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took advantage of falling prices in the latter part of the  
fourth quarter and aggressively locked-in a substantial majority of 
our first quarter 1999 jet fuel needs at prices well below first 
quarter 1998 levels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Southwest reported a 36 percent increase in  
earnings to $433 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, compared to 
$318 million, or 93 cents per diluted share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-year revenue was $3.96 billion, up from $3.64 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Southwest's results met Wall Street analysts' estimates. Its  
stock was down 25 cents at $26.37 1/2 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Congress OKs Reform Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's lower house of Congress has  
passed a bill cutting federal pensions, an important austerity 
measure that gives a boost to the government's efforts to right the 
nation's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must also vote on the measure, which the Chamber of  
Deputies approved 335-147 on Wednesday. Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes said preparations for a vote will begin 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial cuts, which the Chamber had previously  
rejected four times, affect about 300,000 retirees. The move will 
save the government an estimated $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, however, was the message that the bill's  
approval sends to international investors -- that Congress is 
willing to embrace the measures deemed essential to reinvigorating 
Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote demonstrates Congress's understanding of Brazil's  
deepest problems,'' President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said after 
the vote. ``The deputies demonstrated the necessary firmness and 
feeling of urgency regarding the measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage also gives the government a much-needed  
boost, showing investors that it can spur Congress into action on 
crucial economic reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressman and former Finance Minister Antonio Delfim Netto had  
said that although he didn't agree with the measure, he would vote 
for it ``to stop the dollar going through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition party deputies took a different view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any economist knows this vote will not resolve the (economic)  
situation,'' said Paulo Paim of the Worker's Party in Rio Grande do 
Sul. ``We're taking money from the elderly just to show foreign 
investors we're working on the crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis engulfed Brazil in August, when  
investors withdrew funds for fear the government would not be able 
to cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms  
helped rekindle investor fears. After spending billions of dollars 
in foreign reserves trying to prop up its overvalued currency, the 
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has lost about 24 percent of its value since then. On  
Wednesday, the real closed at 1.58 to the dollar, slightly weaker 
than Tuesday's close of 1.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange closed up 4 percent Wednesday. The  
smaller Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange was closed due to a state 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, it could undermine other countries in 
the region -- and that would likely hurt the U.S. economy, which 
depends on Latin America as a major market for exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William  
McDonough, played down those fears Wednesday, saying that Brazil's 
economic crisis was not a threat to the U.S. financial system. He 
spoke after meeting in New York with Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan.

<HEADLINE> Palmer Hired As Browns Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Browns were first brought into the NFL  
nearly 50 years ago by a quiet, cerebral, tough coach named Paul 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland makes its return to the league led by a man with those  
same traits. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Palmer, offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars  
the past two seasons and a longshot for the Cleveland job just a 
week ago, was hired as the Browns' coach on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, 49, is the ninth full-time coach of the Browns, who are  
returning to the NFL next season as an expansion team following a 
three-year absence. Former owner Art Modell took the old team to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cleveland Browns have always been my first choice,''  
Palmer said during a news conference. In the front row was Browns 
Hall of Famer Dante Lavelli and former All-Pros Gene Hickerson, 
Doug Dieken and Hanford Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a football coach who has waited for this moment my  
whole life,'' said Palmer, a nine-year NFL assistant whose only 
head coaching experience came at the college level. ``And this is 
my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns president Carmen Policy said details of Palmer's contract  
still needed to be finalized, but that it was for five years and 
would be worth approximately $5 million plus incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was offered and accepted the job on Wednesday after a  
full day spent with Policy, team owner Al Lerner and director of 
football operations Dwight Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the only candidate who we got to the point that we were  
ready to offer a job to,'' Lerner said. ``I think we're making 
exactly the right decision, and I think he's making just the right 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer had previously interviewed with Baltimore, but after his  
first meeting with Policy, knew that although he was a longshot, 
Cleveland was where he wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I looked at it, the more I thought, `that's the job I  
want,''' he said. ``I may have been in the outside lane, but I made 
the turn well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer will be responsible for ushering Cleveland into a new  
football era, much like Brown did in 1950 when the Browns joined 
the NFL after dominating the All-American Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	And although he grew up in Mount Kisco, N.Y., rooting for the  
New York Giants, Palmer understands what tradition, history and 
football mean here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a passion,'' he said. ``Ohio is football. My favorite  
book is one about Paul Brown and how he developed the Cleveland 
Browns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he talked about his plans for building the new Browns, Palmer  
stopped to address the former Cleveland players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tradition and pride that you guys have built with the  
Browns is something we'll cherish and build our program on,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the same type of comment that helped Palmer win over  
Policy in their first interview late last week. Policy had never 
met Palmer, but came away from their visit shocked by Palmer's 
preparedness and an engaging personality he had only heard about. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who said his first priority would be to assemble a  
coaching staff, fit the Browns' head coaching profile -- 
offensive-minded, expansion team background, experience with young 
quarterbacks -- from the start. But he had been rarely mentioned as 
a possible candidate until well after the Browns had begun their 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a search that proved to be more problematic and time  
consuming than Policy had ever anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a great weight has been lifted from my  
shoulders,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy had to remove his top two candidates from contention  
early on when the league prohibited him from interviewing former 
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren, and San Francisco coach Steve 
Mariucci signed an extension with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns had intended to try and hire Minnesota offensive  
coordinator Brian Billick on Monday, but when he told Cleveland he 
was still interested in interviewing with Baltimore, Policy said to 
go ahead and Billick signed with the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy called Palmer back for a second interview to meet with  
Lerner and Clark, who were both out of town when the coach first 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer scored points as he handled tough questions posed by  
Lerner, a billionaire banker and former Marine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a pleasant experience,'' Policy said of a Lerner  
interview. ``He comes off all warm and fuzzy and sweet but in an 
interview situation, there is an intensity that fills the room. And 
Chris dealt with it, and he dealt with it so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said while the interview continued, the Browns received  
two dozen phone calls from players like Bledsoe, Brunell, Doug 
Flutie, owners, agents, and coaches -- all of whom wanted to put in 
a good word for Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hiring a really good guy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Sharpe Ready for Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- His sharp tongue has gotten Shannon Sharpe in  
trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe and his Denver teammates head to Miami this weekend for  
the Super Bowl on Jan. 31, and the Broncos tight end doesn't expect 
the welcome mat to be out for him in south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Broncos' 38-3 romp over the Miami Dolphins in a  
divisional playoff game on Jan. 9 in Denver, Sharpe referred to 
Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino as a ``loser.'' On the field after 
the game, he asked several Miami players, ``How does it feel to 
have the Super Bowl at your house, and you're not invited?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he told the Dolphins to tell coach Jimmy Johnson ``to have  
his office ready because we're going to need it to break down 
film'' for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe apologized to Marino for that comment, but he'll accept  
the consequences for his other, typically outspoken remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on Thursday what kind of reception he was expecting in  
Miami, he said, ``Is that a trick question? I don't really think 
I'll be getting very many free meals. But it doesn't bother me. I'm 
sure the Miami fans are disappointed, but my prognostication was 
right. We're going to have Miami's facilities, and Mike (coach Mike 
Shanahan) is going to get Jimmy's office. So they shouldn't be 
mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Broncos can defeat the Atlanta Falcons for their second  
straight Super Bowl title, the achievement should elevate the 
Broncos' status in NFL history, Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they're going to view us as one of the  
greatest teams ever,'' he said, ``but obviously we'd have to go 
down as one of the greatest teams of the '90s. In this day and 
time, with free agency and parity getting so good in the league 
now, it's an unbelievable feat, especially with that run we had, 
going 13-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe noted that the Broncos are in the same ``predicament''  
that the Green Bay Packers were in a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won the Super Bowl the year before, they were back and  
they were favored,'' he said. ``But I think we're going to handle 
it a lot differently than they did. I think we have learned from 
their mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inevitably, the discussion shifted to the rift that existed in  
the early 1990s between Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, then the Broncos 
coach; Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, then the Broncos offensive 
coordinator; and Broncos quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves feuded with Elway, then fired Shanahan for alleged  
insubordination. Reeves himself was fired after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he was most disturbed by a comment from Reeves on  
Wednesday that he had no proof that Shanahan and Elway scripted 
plays behind his back or tried to undermine his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not hiding anything,'' Shanahan said Thursday. ``He  
said he didn't have any proof, just a feeling. If I'm going to 
accuse somebody of something, I think I'd at least have some proof 
or a stronger feeling. I was very disappointed in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his relationship with Reeves was irrevocably damaged,  
Shanahan thought for several seconds and said, ``I would say yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway said he was ``flabbergasted'' by Reeves' complaints.  
``It's hard for me to understand why this situation got to where it 
did,'' he said. ``There were a lot of people hurt by the whole 
situation. Looking back, there are always things you'd like to do a 
little differently. But I don't think this is something that will 
distract Mike or the rest of the football team. We'll address it 
and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe has insisted all along that he has ``the utmost respect  
for Dan Reeves, because he gave me a chance in this league. I can't 
say anything bad about Dan. He doesn't have a problem with me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this has been eating at Dan for a long time. It  
bothered him that he felt that Mike went behind his back, and it 
bothered him that John came out in the paper and said it was hell 
playing for him. And it bothered him that (Broncos owner) Pat 
Bowlen fired him. He had some great years here and went to three 
Super Bowls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beating the Broncos in the Super Bowl would be doubly delicious  
for Reeves, Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would probably mean more to him getting the Super Bowl  
trophy against us, because he was here and the way he was dismissed 
and all the things that have circulated about his career here,'' 
Sharpe said. ``It would give him more ammunition if he could get it 
against us. But we're going to do everything we possibly can not to 
let that happen.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Amtrak Official Accused of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former Amtrak official was charged Thursday  
with taking $400,000 in kickbacks while he managed the renovation 
of Chicago's historic Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury indicted Raymond M. Corcoran, 48, on five  
counts of mail fraud and five counts of bribery. He is accused of 
approving more than $2.5 million in work contracts in return for 
payoffs while the project was underway from 1991 through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who answered the phone at Corcoran's home Thursday night  
said Corcoran was not there. Attorney William Hooks, who has 
represented Corcoran, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Station is a massive, ornate reminder of the era when  
railroads were king. It was the setting for an action scene in the 
movie ``The Untouchables'' and remains the main departure point for 
southbound trains.

<HEADLINE> Korda Energized by Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The kick is back.  
</P>
<P>
	Defending Australian Open champion Petr Korda, whose game and  
exuberance were stifled after he returned a positive test for 
steroids last year, resurrected his trademark victory kick today 
after an easy three-set win in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	After a five-set test in the first round, the spikey-haired  
Czech swept over 104th-ranked Spaniard Julian Alonso with pinpoint 
serving and a flurry of passing shots from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of what Korda said were some ``improper and  
insulting'' comments from some spectators, he had an unexceptional 
day. There was no sign of soreness in the ankle he twisted in the 
first-round match against Spain's Galo Blanco, and unlike his 
compatriot, Alonso shook Korda's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Although again forced to play away from center court, normally  
the defending champion's privilege, Korda had the vocal support of 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	They cheered when he served his 11th ace to set up match point.  
Two points later, they cheered again when Alonso hit the final 
return into the net. Korda clenched his fists, then walloped a ball 
high into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda saluted the crowd as he walked from the court, then almost  
as an after thought, dropped his bag and performed the scissor 
kick, a trademark from last year's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a high spirit,'' he said. ``I have my head up. I'm  
trying to play tennis here only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the exhausting match against Blanco, Korda said he knew he  
needed to improve his game. After struggling for the past six 
months -- he dropped in the rankings from 13 at the end of 1998 to 
20 after the drug scandal broke -- he said putting two straight wins 
together was ``fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the small steps,'' he said. ``If you fall with the  
small ones, your butt is not going to be so sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A taste of victory has given him a taste for more.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not comparing the years, but I am a different person than  
I was last year. I know how it is to win a Slam. That can help me a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda will meet Todd Martin in the third round on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Vows To Push HMO Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new speaker of the House is promising to  
bring popular legislation regulating HMOs to the floor this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert said in a letter Thursday to House  
members that a ``patient protection'' bill will move through the 
committee process and reach the floor before adjournment next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year the House will address many important issues,'' he  
wrote. ``Key among them will be our discussion on patient 
protections in health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Illinois Republican warned he is not likely to support  
legislation making it easier for patients who are denied care to 
take health maintenance organizations and other managed care 
companies to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been shy about advocating a process where patients  
receive care in hospital rooms -- not in courtrooms,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He also indicated he is wary about proposals that raise the cost  
of insurance -- an argument that a main line of defense for 
opponents of imposing new regulations on HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hastert was the leader of a GOP task force that  
developed HMO legislation meant to counter more sweeping proposals 
by President Clinton, congressional Democrats and some Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill gave patients many of the same protections Democrats  
want but added some controversial GOP ideas and did not include the 
right to sue. It was approved on a mostly party-line vote in the 
House but died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats have vowed to make HMOs an issue again  
this year.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Says He's Weighing Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Barkley, who says his first  
priority is to play for a championship team, is weighing his NBA 
options with that in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he teed off Wednesday in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic,  
the free-agent forward said he has narrowed his choices to three 
teams. By the end of the round, he had, without explanation, upped 
it to four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll decide between the Atlanta Hawks, Houston and the Seattle  
SuperSonics,'' he had said on the driving range. ``I'm just trying 
to decide who has the best chance to win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, he added New York as a possibility.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he was flattered that a number of teams expressed  
interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were seven or eight, which made me feel good,'' he said.  
``Now I've got it down to three teams I think have a chance to win 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Seattle and I love playing in Houston, but I just want  
to look at everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley added with a grin: ``I'm going to consult with my  
financial adviser, Michael Jordan, and make a decision by the end 
of the week. In the meantime, I'm just going to play some golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He, Jordan and former NFL receiver Roy Green were the amateurs  
playing in a foursome at Bermuda Dunes Country Club with the PGA's 
Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets' acquisition of Scottie Pippen from Chicago should  
provide Barkley added incentive to return to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon would give the Rockets an  
imposing front line, and Barkley ostensibly would be able to sign 
for the $1 million minimum and keep his Larry Bird-exception rights 
for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Picking up Scottie, who's one of the best players in the  
league, definitely will help the Rockets,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Little Rock Zoo Loses Accreditation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Forgive the folks at the Little Rock  
Zoo if they seem a little cagey these days. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo lost its accreditation from the American Zoological and  
Aquarium Association last July and things haven't been the same. 
Aquariums and other zoos around the country -- accredited ones, 
anyway -- won't let Little Rock Friends of the Zoo members in for 
free or reduced price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't necessarily travel somewhere just to go to a zoo,''  
said Ann Fox, visiting the zoo this week with 1-year-old daughter, 
Audrey. ``But if we're there, it's nice for the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why the bad rap?  
</P>
<P>
	Association spokeswoman Jane Ballentine said there was mounting  
concern over inadequate exhibits, funding for improvements and the 
lack of a satisfactory emergency plan should animals escape. In 
1997, two gorillas got into a zookeeper work area and snacked on 
apples and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo also failed to renew its U.S. Department of Agriculture  
license without informing the association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say this when we're talking about a zoo, but that  
was the straw that broke the camel's back,'' Ballentine said. The 
zoo later got a new USDA license. 
</P>
<P>
	The zoo must wait a few more months before it can apply for  
accreditation. In the past year, the zoo spent $850,000 on a new 
lion's exhibit and amphitheater and has begun work to improve 
wastewater drainage.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucille Kallen, the only woman on the team of  
comedy writers behind Sid Caesar's ``Your Show of Shows,'' died of 
cancer on Monday. She was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, which starred Caesar and Imogene Coca, was  
broadcast live on Saturday nights from 1950 to 1954 and is 
considered a classic of television's golden age. Kallen was among a 
handful of female television comedy writers working at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The writers who put together ``Your Show of Shows'' were so  
famous that they were depicted in the 1982 movie ``My Favorite 
Year,'' which was remade as a Broadway musical in 1992, and in Neil 
Simon's ``Laughter on the 23d Floor.''

composer and arranger who founded a school of music that taught 
students like Michael Jackson and Linda Ronstadt, died Dec. 26 of a 
heart attack. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Grove established the Dick Grove School of Music in 1973. At its  
peak, the school had about 450 students, and classes were taught by 
such well-known performers as Henry Mancini and Bill Conti. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Jazz Society awarded Grove its jazz educator  
award in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Grove started his career teaching piano in the Denver area and  
later moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to play with various studio bands and did  
arrangements for Buddy Rich, ``The King Family Show'' and other 
television programs. He also wrote scores for Paul Horn and Nancy 
Wilson, and in the 1960s had his own big band. One of his key 
recordings was ``Little Bird Suite'' in 1963.

<HEADLINE> Browns Name Chris Palmer As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns finally ended their  
scrambled search for a coach today, hiring Chris Palmer to lead the 
return of the Browns to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, the Jacksonville Jaguars' offensive coordinator the past  
two seasons, was introduced by the Browns at a noon EST news 
conference at the team's headquarters in Berea. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed, although  
WOIO-TV cited unidentified sources saying Palmer's contract is for 
five years and worth $8 million to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a smile on our faces and I have to tell you there's a  
smile in our hearts,'' Browns president Carmen Policy said. ``We 
were searching for a teacher and we found a teacher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, 49, is the ninth full-time coach of the Browns, who are  
returning to the NFL next season as an expansion team following a 
three-year hiatus that began when former owner Art Modell took the 
old team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cleveland Browns have always been my first choice,''  
Palmer said at the news conference, attended by many former Browns 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer's hiring ends a coaching search Policy said was more  
time-consuming than he anticipated. It finally gives Cleveland a 
chance to focus on other things, including the NFL expansion draft 
less than three weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	A virtual unknown to Policy and Browns fans just a week ago,  
Palmer will now lead the Browns into a new era. 
</P>
<P>
	He has just seven months to get his team ready for the Dallas  
Cowboys on Aug. 9 in Canton, Ohio, and his every decision -- 
especially with the No. 1 pick in April's college draft -- is sure 
to be scrutinized in this football-crazy town. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cleveland initially seemed interested in bigger name  
coaches, Palmer impressed Browns executives with his knowledge of 
Cleveland's expansion situation and his background tutoring 
quarterbacks.

<HEADLINE> Latin America in Economic Quagmire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Brazil's decision to devalue its  
currency is raising fears other Latin American nations will be 
forced to do the same, leading to slower growth and higher 
inflation throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Brazil's decision this week to float its currency, the  
real, has been met with signs of investor confidence, although the 
stock market slid Thursday as buyers sought to make profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the question remains whether other countries, many with  
close ties to Brazil's giant economy, will feel forced to pare the 
value of their currencies. The competitive devaluations could lead 
to high inflation and recession. With Brazil's currency weaker, its 
exports will cost less in foreign markets, which likely would lead 
to higher sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Wednesday that  
the potential for Brazil's troubles to reduce demand for 
neighboring nations' goods is a ``possible source of downside 
risk'' for demand in the United States as well. A third of U.S. 
exports go south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the region weakens, some analysts doubt that it will be  
pummeled as badly as the Asian nations were when the global 
financial crisis began there in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a tinderbox in Latin America that will blow up the  
exchange rates as opposed to just weaken them, that will blow up 
the banking systems the way it did in Asia and cause long-lasting 
and deep recessions and lingering pain? I think the answer is no,'' 
said Robert Gay, a chief economist at BTAlexBrown in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina, which sends 30 percent of its exports to Brazil, is  
watching its larger neighbor with particular anxiety. The Brazilian 
real has lost 29 percent of its value in the past week, making 
Argentine exports prohibitively expensive and Brazilian imports 
enticingly cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine authorities are considering imposing two duties on  
Brazilian imports. In the meantime, economists have begun to 
downgrade this year's growth predictions for Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's other main Latin American trading partners -- Chile,  
Uruguay and Paraguay -- all stand to lose business because of the 
cheaper real. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Brazilian spillover isn't only about trade. As Latin America  
learned after the Asian and Russian crises, investors are loathe to 
distinguish between emerging markets when the chips are down. When 
one market falls, they often take their money from all of the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	This so-called ``contagion'' effect could be especially brutal  
on Venezuela, where the recent election as president of former coup 
leader Hugo Chavez has created great political uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela and Ecuador are especially vulnerable to regional  
economic dislocations because they depend on oil exports, their 
currencies are considered grossly overvalued, and they lag behind 
the rest of Latin America in instituting structural reforms. 
Mexico, too, could be hurt by the Brazil crisis because of downward 
pressure on the peso and the attendant inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for Latin American mainstays such as oil, coffee and  
copper have plunged in recent months, exacerbating an economic 
downturn caused by fallout from the Asian financial crisis. Instead 
of increasing spending to spur growth, most Latin governments are 
carrying out austerity programs to balance their fiscal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's decision to float its currency frees the government  
from having to deplete its international reserves to support an 
artificial exchange rate. Some argue the move could even enable 
Brazil to take a greater role in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trade account of Brazil will turn into surplus very  
quickly because of the powerful combination of the recession and 
the devaluation,'' said Arturo Porzecanski, Americas Chief 
Economist at ING Barings. ``Exporters will export, importers won't 
import, tourists will stay at home, and Brazilian assets will be 
cheaper.''

<HEADLINE>  Islanders' Milbury Resigns As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mike Milbury resigned as the New York  
Islanders' coach for the second time in two years on Thursday, 
saying his players were quitting on him the way they did former 
coach Rick Bowness last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, who signed a five-year coaching contract only last May,  
will stay on as general manager but was replaced as coach by former 
assistant Bill Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite high expectations going into this season and again in  
December after re-signing scoring star Zigmund Palffy to a $25 
million contract, the Islanders were winless in 11 games (0-10-1) 
before beating Pittsburgh 5-2 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this will get things turned around,'' said Joe  
Sacco, whose shorthanded goal put the Islanders ahead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said of his first NHL victory, ``Any time you make a  
change, there's new atmosphere and new life, but we've still got a 
lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders (14-29-3) had won only three times since Nov. 26  
until Claude Lapointe's two points and an assist led them to their 
first victory in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get into a streak like we are,'' said Milbury, who  
announced the decision only 2 1/2 hours before the game. ``It happened 
to Rick last year. When the team quits on the coach, it's tough to 
get them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury decided Wednesday to remain as coach for the rest of the  
season, but changed his mind after a 5-2 loss that night to 
Florida. The Islanders had only 19 shots on goal, just nine in the 
first two periods, as fans chanted, ``Mike must go!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a no-hitter last night, and it struck home,'' Milbury  
said. ``When a team makes a cold and clear statement like that ... 
I've seen it with other coaches, it's tough to get them back, short 
of making wholesale changes. The message our players sent last 
night was a strong one and not a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sacco said, ``It was pretty bad, the worst we've played all  
year, everyone agrees on that. We've been losing lately, but not 
like that. That wasn't going to happen tonight; we took it up one 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, 46, first coached the Islanders in 1995-96, then  
resigned on Jan. 24, 1997 and turned the team over to Bowness. He 
fired Bowness and returned to coaching on March 11, 1998, not long 
after a 10-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, Milbury installed an NFL-style coaching  
system featuring offensive and defensive coordinators among four 
assistant coaches, but with Stewart moving up to coach, that system 
effectively has been dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of extra coaches is not a bad idea. It hasn't worked,  
but there is some merit to it,'' Milbury said. ``It isn't the 
reason for the problem ... but you have to face the reality of a 
long-term losing streak. I think we were always prepared, but the 
players couldn't always handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was the 1997-98 AHL coach of the year, leading the St.  
John's Flames to a 43-24-13 record and a berth in the Calder Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that there's a new coach, what happened in the past has  
happened, and we look to the future because that's the only thing 
we can take care of,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury said, ``When he was hired as associate coach, I thought  
he could be a coach who could handle the team in my absence. I 
always felt Bill would be the guy. He is a no-nonsense type of guy, 
and he will leave a strong imprint. He's a fairly defensive-minded 
guy, a batten-down-the-hatches guy and maybe now we can win some 
games by scoring three goals but giving up only two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By giving up his coaching duties, Milbury will devote more time  
to the front office and trying to find players more committed to 
winning than the Islanders currently have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have seen it (the losing) bother other  
people besides myself, maybe see somebody rattle a few cages, but, 
if it happened, I wasn't aware of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury spent 20 years in the Boston Bruins organization as a  
player, coach and front office executive before becoming the 
Islanders' coach on July 5, 1995, a year after New York's last 
appearance in the playoffs. He took over as general manager from 
Don Maloney on Dec. 12, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 56-111-24 as the Islanders coach and is 146-160-45 in the  
NHL, reaching the Stanley Cup finals once with Boston.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics Fly in Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Talk about fancy.  
</P>
<P>
	From extra-large leather recliners to a fold-down cocktail  
table, the Seattle SuperSonics' new plane will whisk players from 
city to city in custom-made style. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's Boeing 727-200, built in 1975, is the product of a  
10-month, $18 million overhaul. It can fly nonstop anywhere in the 
country and even from the East Coast to Europe without refueling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel confident that this is the best plane in the league,''  
said Chris Ackerley, vice president of the Ackerley Group, which 
owns the Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pilots, an engineer and three flight attendants will fly  
with the team. The cockpit was refurbished with a digital flight 
management system and radar to make it Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally built to accommodate 174 passengers, the plane now  
features a spacious interior with 38 seats, two galleys and three 
cabins -- complete with custom woodwork and Sonic logos etched on 
side panels lined with ultra leather. 
</P>
<P>
	It is equipped with 10 TV screens and VCRs, wireless headsets  
and a workstation with outlets to connect laptop computers to the 
Internet and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight is the players' cabin in the middle of the plane  
which features 14 seats that recline into what essentially becomes 
a bed. The Sonic green chairs -- seven on each side, 3 feet apart -- 
also swivel 360 degrees.

<HEADLINE> Nugent Seeks To Boycott Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- American rocker Ted Nugent is so angry at  
Ontario's decision to ban its spring bear hunt that he's organizing 
a U.S. boycott of Canadian tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent, an outspoken hunting and pro-gun crusader who lives in  
rural Jackson County, Mich., said he wants Canada to pay for what 
he calls the province's ``tomfoolery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to shut off the flow of American dollars into  
Canada, not just for bear hunting, for anything, and I can do it,'' 
said Nugent, who believes the ban will bring a surplus of bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Ontario's Natural Resources Minister John Snobelen announced  
last week he was banning the spring hunt because it resulted in too 
many orphaned cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nugent, the self-proclaimed Motor City Madman who found fame  
in the 1970s with the hit ``Cat Scratch Fever,'' said the ban 
``only helps the touchy-feely fantasy of a bunch of people who 
would ban you and I from ever wearing leather or having a steak.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Likes Brazilian Tariff Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard  
Fisher welcomed Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
suggestion he might reduce tariffs on imports if needed to deal 
with the country's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher also commended the ``tough, strong, encouraging''  
handling of the crisis so far by Cardoso, Finance Minister Pedro 
Malan and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard (Cardoso) say two days ago that tariffs could be  
lowered, I took heart,'' Fisher said Thursday in a speech at the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``He is my kind of guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said trade ``was not responsible for the crisis and must not  
become its victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil, Latin America's largest  
economy, succumbs to an Asian-style currency crisis, it could 
undermine other countries in the region and that would likely hurt 
the U.S. economy. Latin America is a major market for U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Brazil would emerge successfully from financial  
turmoil if it carried out economic and fiscal reforms that include 
cutting its $65 billion budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a condition for a $41.5 billion rescue package from the  
International Monetary Fund that it agreed to in November, Brazil 
has to reduce its deficit almost by half this year. After the IMF 
agreement, foreign investors continued to pull their money out of 
the country, forcing Brazil to devalue its currency, the real, last 
week and sparking the economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said that with several governments in Latin America  
likely to have new presidents in elections in the near future, 
stability in Brazil is important to maintain investor confidence in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that ``present indications are not only that President  
Cardoso is up to the test ... but also that he welcomes it.''

<HEADLINE> Hispanics Feel Left Out of Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hispanics in both the uniformed military and  
the civilian defense work force are disproportionately represented 
in the lowest pay grades, with the fewest responsibilities and 
opportunities, an advocacy group says. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. military enjoys the reputation as one of the most  
hospitable work forces for minorities in government, the situation 
isn't as bright for Hispanics, Raul Yzaguirre, president of the 
National Council of La Raza president, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned that when the president launched his race  
initiative, he applauded the nation's armed forces as having gotten 
it right. But it might not have gotten it when it comes to our 
community,'' said Yzaguirre, whose organization studied Latinos in 
defense work. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Hispanics made up about 7 percent of active U.S.  
military forces and 6.3 percent of the Defense Department's 
civilian workforce, but they represented more than 11 percent of 
the nation's total civilian labor force. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, more than 41 percent of enlisted Hispanics were in  
the lowest three pay grades, compared to 26 percent of blacks and 
30 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department spokesman, U.S. Army Col. Richard Bridges,  
said: ``We understand a lack of representation exists but we have 
made some progress over the years. We will continue to try and be 
as open an organization as possible and that goes for all groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yzaguirre, a U.S. Air Force veteran, said that while military  
service is voluntary, the problem isn't a lack of interest on the 
part of Hispanics, who will surpass blacks as the nation's largest 
minority group in the next 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Latinos want to join both military and civilian ranks but are  
sometimes held back by low educational attainment and citizenship 
requirements for civil service employment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzaguirre urged increased recruiting efforts and remedial  
assistance for Hispanics who might not make the grade 
educationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not talking about lowering standards but understanding  
that a high school diploma isn't the only predictor of good 
performance,'' Yzaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current findings were especially troubling in light of high  
Hispanic rates of military participation during the Vietnam War, 
Yzaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of front line casualties in Vietnam were  
Hispanic at a time when Hispanics comprised about five percent of 
the U.S. population. Now, when Hispanics make up 11 percent of the 
nation's population, they make up a much smaller share of today's 
military force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been overrepresented in fighting forces, yet in  
peacetime, the armed forces don't have what it takes to recruit 
us,'' Yzaguirre said. ``It's an interesting paradox.''

<HEADLINE> Randolph Does Broadway Walking Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joyce Randolph can get you to the theater on  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Randolph, who played Trixie on ``The Honeymooners,'' was  
recruited recently by the owner of Chez Josephine restaurant to 
figure out how long it takes to walk to theaters nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Chez Josephine owner Jean-Claude Baker wanted to reassure  
customers of his 42nd Street restaurant who worry about being late 
for a performance. So he asked Miss Randolph to walk to several 
theaters and time herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The trips took anywhere from under two minutes to nearly 10  
minutes. The exercise confirmed Baker's suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``People behave like children, panicking at 7:15 when we all  
know you have 50 minutes because the show will never start before 
five minutes past,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Returns Verdict Against HMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- A jury ordered Aetna U.S. Health  
Care of California to pay a record $120.5 million in damages to a 
woman whose husband fought until his death for coverage of 
experimental cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Goodrich of Yucaipa was awarded $116 million Wednesday in  
punitive damages and $4.5 million last week for medical expenses 
and loss of companionship in the 1995 death of her 44-year-old 
husband, David Goodrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers said the San Bernardino County Superior Court jury's  
award was by far the largest ever against an HMO for denying health 
care. The previous record was $89.3 million in 1993 against 
HealthNet in Riverside County, said Mark Hiepler, an attorney in 
that case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the meaning of this verdict is that people are just  
plain mad,'' said Michael Bidart, Mrs. Goodrich's attorney. ``The 
HMOs are corporate executives practicing medicine where profit is 
the motive, not the best interest of the patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna officials said Goodrich's death was a tragedy, but the  
company acted fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we believe the rulings of the court prevented the  
jury from hearing critical facts,'' the company said in a 
statement. ``Had these facts been known, we are confident the 
outcome would have been different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to appeal the award.  
</P>
<P>
	Most patients wouldn't have had the same opportunity as Mrs.  
Goodrich to win substantial damages from an HMO. Because of a 
federal law governing employee benefits, most Americans with 
employer-based insurance are precluded from recovering damages from 
HMOs beyond the costs of a treatment improperly denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Government and church employees are the exceptions; Goodrich was  
a former San Bernardino County deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidart argued during the two-month trial that Aetna had for 2 1/2  
years delayed and denied approval for treatment of Goodrich's rare 
form of stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said even Goodrich's doctors agreed he needed to be treated  
outside the Aetna network, but Aetna balked. When Goodrich finally 
did receive treatment, Aetna refused to pay for it, Bidart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna attorneys claimed Goodrich sought treatment outside the  
Aetna plan without first getting the HMO's approval. They said 
network doctors could have treated him, but conceded they were 
``inexperienced'' with Goodrich's rare cancer.

<HEADLINE> Wheelchair User Violated Street Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who uses a wheelchair because of  
muscular dystrophy and says the city's sidewalks aren't accessible 
was found guilty Thursday of using her wheelchair in a street. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Erich O'Brien of Sandusky Municipal Court said he had no  
choice but to convict Kelly Dillery, who has suffered from the 
degenerative muscle disease since her high school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were in the actual lane of travel,'' O'Brien told Ms.  
Dillery, adding that she put herself and motorists in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us want to see you get hurt,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery was cited in early December after police saw her in  
a wheelchair on a busy street. She was charged with being a 
pedestrian in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and the city prosecutor said they had received several  
complaints about Ms. Dillery's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	She also faces a child endangerment charge for strapping her  
4-year-old daughter Kelsi on her lap and riding in the street on a 
separate occasion. She has pleaded innocent to that charge. 
</P>
<P>
	K. Ronald Bailey, Ms. Dillery's lawyer, said his client has no  
choice but to ride in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandusky City Prosecutor Rob DeLamatre said the city was simply  
trying to protect Ms. Dillery. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to settle the case out-of-court were unsuccessful, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always believed there was a better way to do this,''  
DeLamatre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not sentence her and will likely wait until the  
other case is resolved. The penalty is a $100 fine.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft: Its Prices Deny Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- How does $2,000 sound for your next copy of  
Microsoft's Windows software? 
</P>
<P>
	An economist testifying Thursday for the company at its  
antitrust trial said that if Microsoft Corp. were a genuine 
monopolist, it would charge $900 to $2,000 for its popular 
operating system -- roughly the cost of an entire computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's lead lawyer later dismissed it as ``a silly  
conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of its first week defending itself, Microsoft  
returned to an important theme asserted by its witness -- that 
despite the dominance of Windows, the company doesn't wield 
monopoly power in the nation's high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that its frequent improvements to Windows and  
its low wholesale price of about $50 helps prove the company 
doesn't possess monopoly power, a crucial distinction under 
antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I find nonsensical is that a firm with an ironclad lockup  
... only takes $50 on a computer system that costs thousands of 
dollars,'' said economist Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over monopoly power is critical for the government,  
which alleges that Microsoft illegally bundled its Internet browser 
software into newer versions of Windows to ``crush'' Netscape 
Communications Corp., whose own popular browser was a direct 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the government's claims of predatory behavior hinge on  
first convincing the judge that the software giant possesses 
monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee calculated that raising the wholesale price of  
Windows to $2,000 would dramatically cut the company's sales from 
60 million to 15.8 million, but that it would increase revenues 
tenfold from $3 billion to $31.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	He also compared the retail price of Microsoft's software to  
rival operating systems offered by IBM Corp., Apple Computer Inc. 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Microsoft prices are not wildly out of line,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies said the Windows price is  
less important than the profits Microsoft earns or its overwhelming 
dominance among rival computer operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't infer the presence or absence of monopoly power just  
by prices,'' Boies said outside court. ``Microsoft is making huge 
profits, monopoly profits, on what it charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft announced earlier this week a record quarterly profit  
of almost $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wanted to know  
Thursday whether Microsoft by keeping today's prices low might be 
looking toward ``a larger glory at some later time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee asserted that Microsoft sets its Windows prices with  
an eye on its ``stream of profits over time,'' trying to encourage 
growth in the industry and continued reliance on Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe this is being done for charitable reasons,''  
he testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee was expected to remain on the stand through early  
Monday, when the government will ask him in closed session about 
the actual prices that Microsoft charges PC makers, which are among 
the industry's most closely guarded secrets.

<HEADLINE> Smiley Face Creator Fights Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Smile and the world smiles with you.  
</P>
<P>
	So hopes Harvey Ball, a graphic artist who earned $45 for  
designing the ubiquitous smiley face for an insurance company 35 
years ago and now hopes to gather profits from the round yellow 
icon for charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball has declared Oct. 1 as ``World Smile Day,'' and he formed  
the World Smile Corp. to market a line of greeting cards, buttons 
and other items in conjunction with the festivities. Profits will 
go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ball created the design, others have staked their  
claim. Last spring, Ball learned Franklin Loufrani, a 55-year-old 
French entrepreneur, had registered the smiley trademark in more 
than 75 countries -- and was threatening to sue U.S. companies that 
sell smiley products overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Ball thought about a lawsuit but decided he just  
couldn't sue over a smile. ``It's repugnant. Yucky,'' he said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Better, he said, to outsell the Loufranis of the world in the  
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Loufrani, Franklin Loufrani's son and vice president of  
marketing for London-based Smiley Licensing Corp., said he wishes 
Ball the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the right to use the smiley character in the U.S.,'' he  
said. ``If he's able to sell smiley products and give the money to 
charity, that's great.''

<HEADLINE>  IOC Vice President Issues Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The IOC's top investigator apologized today to  
fans, athletes and the people of Salt Lake City for the worst 
corruption scandal in Olympics history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, vice president of the International Olympic  
Committee, told an audience of sports marketing leaders that the 
case has left the committee ``profoundly disappointed'' and that it 
was prepared to take strong steps to make sure the culprits are 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to express our sincere apologies for the actions of  
certain IOC members,'' said Pound, whose six-member panel will 
release its report in Lausanne, Switzerland, this weekend. ``Their 
conduct has been completely contrary to everything the Olympic 
movement has worked so hard to represent. 
</P>
<P>
	``These actions are also an affront to the Olympic athletes who  
have inspired us through the years and whose lives so poignantly 
embody the Olympic ideals. ... Moreover, the IOC would like to 
express its deepest regrets to the people and community of Salt 
Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound refused to identify the dozen IOC members known to be  
implicated in the scandal and would not say what actions would be 
taken against them. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch earlier 
said that the majority faced expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said his investigation had found no evidence of  
criminal activity, but said the behavior of a few of the 115-member 
committee could not be tolerated. He also said Salt Lake City won 
the 2002 Games ``because it produced the best, most comprehensive 
bid. End of story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are as well prepared as a city can be and they will,  
without a doubt in my mind, produce the greatest Winter Games we 
have seen to date,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skittish Olympics sponsors, meanwhile, called for the  
investigations into the bribery allegations to end and the 
improprieties dealt with once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as one investigating panel prepares to issue its  
report, one more probe has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Attorney General Jan Graham said Wednesday she will begin  
the fifth independent inquiry -- but not until the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee's ethics panel and the IOC release their 
reports. The U.S. Olympic Committee and the Justice Department also 
are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound told The Washington Post that there ``is solid,  
irrefutable evidence'' at least a dozen IOC member or their 
relatives received cash, gifts, or donations directly or indirectly 
from the Salt Lake City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games, in 
several cases more than $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see it in black and white, it's pretty blatant stuff,  
so I don't think the people involved are going to be able to 
explain it away. But we'll see,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal said Wednesday that a draft version  
implicated as many as 16 members and warned committee officials 
they might be subpoenaed in the Justice Department's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USA Today reported today that the Customs Service is  
exploring whether Alfredo La Mont, the USOC's former senior 
director of international relations, violated a currency reporting 
law in allegedly transporting cash to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC said last week that La Mont stepped down after  
informing the committee ``of a previously undisclosed business 
relationship with the Salt Lake Olympic (Bid) Committee through the 
office of former SLOC president Tom Welch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said her office will not duplicate the federal  
investigation, but instead will examine potential violations of 
Utah criminal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work will be done carefully, but as quickly and  
professionally as possible so that questions surrounding potential 
criminal conduct do not linger,'' she said. ``Those questions need 
to be answered with confidence and finality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office will use its own staff  
investigators, but Graham said they would rely heavily on the 
information uncovered in the SLOC report and in the Justice 
Department probe, which will likely take months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics committee's findings are expected to be released  
before Feb. 11, spokesman Frank Zang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the scandal broke last month with news that Salt Lake, in  
its successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, gave college 
scholarships to relatives of IOC members, Olympic officials have 
tried to convince corporate sponsors that their multimillion-dollar 
investments will not be tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	They maintained that sponsors were remaining committed to their  
Olympic contracts even as the scandal grew to include cash, free 
medical care and lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, John Krimsky, USOC marketing director, says two  
companies that were close to final agreement on Salt Lake 
sponsorships have ``asked that the announcement of sponsorship be 
withheld until the results of the investigation are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are ongoing. I believe they are solid,''  
Krimsky said. ``But until there is a signed contract, they could 
back out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky refused to identify the companies, but said their  
involvement would be ``above entry level,'' each worth more than 
$25 million in cash and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake still has almost $250 million in sponsorships to raise  
toward its $1.453 billion budget, with Krimsky overseeing the 
project in a partnership between the USOC and SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	He and IOC marketing director Michael Payne said they remained  
confident the full amount will be raised, and Payne said sponsors 
want the scandal dealt with quickly and completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to get to the bottom of this. That is exactly  
what we are doing,'' Payne said. ``I told the sponsors the IOC 
wants to deal with any improprieties of any dimension. That the IOC 
is in control of rooting out improprieties. That the 2002 Winter 
Games will be held in Salt Lake City and be a success. That the IOC 
will be open in its response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The USOC inquiry, primarily intended to recommend new  
guidelines for American cities bidding for future Olympics, will be 
finished before March, said the investigation's leader, former 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pressure from the Winter Olympics bribery scandal has prompted  
Sydney Games officials to release documents to help show its bid 
for next year's Summer Games was clean. Australian Olympic 
Committee chief John Coates said he would make public Friday the 
Endorsement Contract between the Australian Olympic Committee, the 
New South Wales state government and the Sydney bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Its release is expected to rebuff criticism that Sydney's  
preparations are too secretive. 
</P>
<P>
	--The British Olympic Association called for a complete overhaul  
of the Olympic bidding and site-selection process to prevent 
further scandals. The proposals, submitted to the IOC executive 
board, would take the selection of cities away from the IOC general 
assembly and leave the decision to a smaller group. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics said they would welcome  
an investigation, if only to stop speculation about possible 
misdeeds during the bidding process. ``We'd be delighted to talk 
about the experience: the good, the bad and the difficult,'' Billy 
Payne, leader of the volunteer bid committee and later president of 
the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, told the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. ``We ain't perfect, and we ain't arrogant, 
but we didn't bribe anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Roster Restocking on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- No Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen or Dennis  
Rodman. No practice, either, for the roster-depleted Chicago Bulls 
on the first day of this strange, new season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have yet to get off the ground in the post-Michael  
era. During the chaotic, first official day of business following 
the NBA lockout, there were only six players under contract by a 
mid-afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Bulls, three days before their first exhibition and 16  
days before a championship rematch with the Utah Jazz in their Feb. 
5 season opener, called off practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was very tough. We thought we would be here with a whole  
basketball team, but we had six guys here,'' veteran Ron Harper 
said. ``We are not the only team probably having a hard time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls did announce they had re-signed center Bill Wennington  
-- to a minimum contract of $1 million for 10-year veterans -- and 
also signed free agent Curtis Staples, a 3-point specialist from 
Virginia. Add Harper, Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth, who 
were already under contract, and that makes six. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agent Brent Barry was at the Berto Center for a workout,  
but left for dinner with new coach Tim Floyd without signing a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls are supposed to pick up at least four players in  
sign-and-trade deals, but the only one to show was Mark Bryant, 
part of a deal with Phoenix for Luc Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sight of Roy Rogers, acquired in the swap with  
Houston for Pippen. Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells, part of the 
Suns deal for Longley, weren't there, either. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 14 players shooting baskets and limbering up when  
tired-of-waiting coach Floyd called them to the center of the floor 
to say there weren't enough players under contract at the time to 
hold his first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause made a brief appearance. He claimed  
the new player contracts were so different from past ones that 
there was a backlog in the league office, thus the delay in getting 
players signed and to the floor for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to get them done with the utmost speed,'' Krause  
said, adding he expected to have 20 players signed in the next 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was to sign a five-year, $67.2 million deal -- with an  
additional $15 million in incentives -- and then be shipped to 
Houston for Rogers and a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Steve Kerr was to get a five-year, $11 million deal before  
heading to San Antonio for draft picks and veteran Chuck Person. 
And center Longley was to receive a five-year, $30 million package 
before being traded to Phoenix for Bryant, Muursepp and Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan playing golf in retirement and Rodman as usual  
sending mixed signals about his future, the Bulls will turn to 
Kukoc for leadership, ball handling and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	He still wasn't sure Thursday in the midst of the chaos what his  
new team would look like or even when it would finally be together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is going to show. It's too early to judge what Jerry's  
doing right now,'' Kukoc said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of teams needed years to rebuild. I guess management  
just felt the situation right now is probably the best point to 
start rebuilding.''

<HEADLINE> Win Boosts Cavagnoud's Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) -- Regine Cavagnoud couldn't have  
chosen a better day for her first career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	After eight years on the ski circuit -- always dreaming of a  
triumph -- Cavagnoud finally made a breakthrough Thursday on the 
last downhill race prior to the World Championships in Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I could win,'' Cavagnoud said. ``And I especially  
wanted to win before the Worlds. It is the best way to prepare for 
the championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to boosting Cavagnoud's confidence at a key moment,  
the victory also ended a 17-year drought by French women in the 
World Cup downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is about time a French woman won in downhill,'' Cavagnoud  
said. ``All of us (on the French team) were very motivated to break 
this record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavagnoud said she and her teammates came very close to winning  
in the past few seasons, but always ended up a few tenths of a 
second short. 
</P>
<P>
	The French women's last previous victory in downhill was in  
1982, when Caroline Attia won in Sansicario, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavagnoud edged Italian favorite Isolde Kostner -- winner of the  
past three downhills here -- by just .14 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The French skier sped down the long and winding turns at more  
than 75 mph to complete the Tofane course in 1 minute, 31.06 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions were excellent,'' said Cavagnoud, referring to  
the bright sunshine and hard-packed snow. ``My run was just about 
perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was especially pleased at beating Kostner, who has  
scored four of her five World Cup victories in Cortina and was a 
big favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Olympic bronze medalist in downhill, Kostner started  
well this season, placing second in back-to-back downhills in Lake 
Louise, Canada, in November. But she failed to make the podium 
again until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had a chance to pull myself out of my slump here in  
Cortina,'' Kostner said. ``I didn't win. But this result gave me a 
lot of confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kostner hopes to improve on her second-place finish in the two  
super-G's scheduled here today and Saturday. Kostner won the event 
here in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavagnoud's best previous results were two second places in  
downhill in Veysonnaz, Switzerland, one in 1993 and another earlier 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Third place Thursday went to Germany's Hilde Gerg, the 1998  
Olympic slalom champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old German completed the race in 1:31.26 and shrank  
Alexandra Meissnitzer's lead in the overall World Cup standings 
from 180 to 133 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, winner of five World Cups this season, finished  
18th Thursday. Germany's Regina Haeusl was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Rey Bellet, who made World Cup history Saturday  
when she won a downhill and super-G in the same day, was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the back-to-back super-G's, the women compete in a  
giant slalom Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The events in Cortina are the last on the women's World Cup tour  
prior to the World Championships, which begin Jan. 31.

	AUBURN, Wash. (AP) -- New, more reliable computer equipment to  
help federal air traffic controllers across the United States has 
been introduced first in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	All 20 national air traffic control centers are to have the new  
systems by the summer of 2000 to replace vacuum-type radar display 
equipment that is prone to breakdowns. The project will cost $1.05 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Garvey, administrator of the Federal Aviation  
Administration, and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater 
dedicated the new system Wednesday at the Seattle Air Route Traffic 
Control Center, which oversees flights over Washington, most of 
Oregon and portions of Idaho, Montana, Northern California and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system will ``help keep our skies the safest in the  
world while air traffic continues to grow,'' Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Auburn system was installed last October and air traffic  
controllers began using it about a month ago. Salt Lake City and 
Cleveland are next in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the new system is considered faster and more reliable  
than the 1970s-era technology it is replacing, it is not immune to 
glitches like the one Auburn controllers dealt with on Friday. A 
battery failure during a routine check of a backup power supply cut 
power to the center and the new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers were able to maintain contact with jetliners with a  
backup radio system, but radar used to prevent collisions was shut 
down for 35 minutes. Hundreds of flights were delayed and airline 
traffic was frozen for an hour. There were no reports of planes 
flying too close together. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers said one of the advantages of the new system is that  
it's easier to maintain. Parts needed for the old system are no 
longer made. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem was the components -- they would break and you just  
couldn't get them anymore,'' controller Mark Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Air Traffic Management of Bethesda, Md., is the  
prime contractor for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Other improvements under way or planned by the FAA include a new  
system that helps pilots make precision landings guided by the 
Global Positioning System, and an e-mail system between computers 
on the ground and in the cockpit. That should reduce the time lag 
and chance of errors in voice communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's announcement came only hours after a single-engine  
Cessna came within 100 feet of a Southwest Airlines jet as the two 
were taking off from Austin, Texas, on runways that crossed, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller plane passed just under the Boeing 737 with 125  
people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, the captain noticed the smaller plane out of the  
corner of his eye,'' Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart said. ``He 
immediately pulled the airplane into a much steeper climb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Murphy, a regional air traffic manager for the FAA, said  
the Cessna pilot could face discipline ranging from a warning to 
license suspension.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Keep Clinton Trial Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today  
cautioned against a lengthy Senate trial of President Clinton, 
saying time would be lost in tending to ``the people's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What bothers me is we have a huge agenda,'' Albright said as  
she outlined foreign policy programs confronting her as she nears 
the end of two years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Congress has the authority to try Clinton, but it also  
is a partner of the administration in dealing with such problems as 
Kosovo, Iraq and the spread of nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``So any time we are not spending on the people's business  
ultimately is time lost,'' Albright said following a speech to the 
Center for National Policy, a private group she once headed. 
</P>
<P>
	The House impeachment of the president and his current trial in  
the Senate is puzzling to foreign leaders, Albright said. ``Friends 
around the world are kind of amazed this is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Albright said respect for the United States and its  
powers remains very high. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright will leave Sunday on a six-day trip to five countries:  
Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Britain and France. Topping her agenda 
is the conflict in Kosovo and the situation in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre last Friday of 45 Albanian ethnic civilians in  
southern Kosovo ``has brought tensions to a razor's edge,'' 
Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must reverse his expulsion  
of William Walker, the American diplomat who heads a European 
monitoring group, and permit the crew to operate unhindered. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, she said, the group will be disbanded.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that we be persuasive in dealing with  
Milosevic, and that requires we be prepared, if necessary, to use 
force, because force is the only language he appears to 
understand,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, Albright said ``we must and will persist in thwarting''  
its potential for aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	Vowing to help the Iraqi people to free themselves from  
President Saddam Hussein, ``a leader they do not want, do not 
deserve and never chose,'' she announced the appointment of 
American diplomat Frank Ricciardone to coordinate U.S. military 
assistance and advice to Iraqi opposition groups.

<HEADLINE> United Looking To Buy America West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines hopes to snap up rival America  
West Airlines in a purchase that would ensure its dominance along 
the West Coast and pose a threat to competitors in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, however, faces formidable hurdles.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after the nation's largest airline revealed it is  
interested in acquiring America West Holdings Corp., the nation's 
ninth-largest carrier, analysts suggested Thursday the combination 
would make a good fit, but might be hard to put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Neidl at Furman Selz said United ``must get approval  
from their union work force, the Justice Department -- and one of 
their competitors. I would say those are some formidable hurdles to 
overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An investment firm, Texas Pacific Group Inc., holds a 49 percent  
stake in America West. Continental, the nation's fifth-largest 
airline, owns 8.3 percent and has first rights to purchase TPG's 
shares for an America West acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, United's pilots and machinists could nix the deal  
since they and other employees control a majority interest in the 
company and have seats on the board. America West has been plagued 
by labor unrest, first with its mechanics and currently with its 
flight attendants' union. 
</P>
<P>
	United pilots also could become concerned about lost jobs to  
America West's lower-paid pilots. Madison Walton, a spokesman for 
United's chapter of the pilots union, said it was premature to 
discuss the ramifications of a pairing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is so dynamic that in the past few years  
somebody is constantly looking at somebody else, but it's never 
amounted to anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But analyst Brian Harris at Solomon Smith Barney said the  
``chances are not bad'' for the deal to receive regulatory 
clearance since America West does not have the national presence of 
other competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered the news of takeover interest in America West,  
pushing the company's shares up 3.56 1/4, or 18 percent, to $23.06 1/4 on 
the New York Stock Exchange Thursday. UAL stock fell $1.18 3/4 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard &AMP; Poors Corp., in affirming its positive credit outlook  
for United, also noted ``direct overlap between United and America 
West is not large, and passengers in the markets served by America 
West currently would continue to benefit from Southwest's low-fare 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, federal regulators, lawmakers and consumer groups  
increasingly are sounding alarm bells about the rapid pace of 
alliances and mergers in the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit over the  
planned purchase by Northwest -- the nation's fourth-largest airline 
-- of a controlling stake in No. 5 Continental, saying it would 
reduce competition, raise prices for travelers and lower the 
quality of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of any United-America West deal are sure to argue that  
pairing the dominant West Coast carrier with the No. 3 carrier in 
the region also would pose antitrust concerns. The biggest losers 
would be American, which has been seeking to bolster its Western 
operations, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental said it was examining its options, while Southwest's  
chief financial officer said it was too early to tell what effect 
such a combination would have on its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	United also has another reason for pursuing an American West  
buyout instead of seeking a looser alliance. United recently 
announced it would sharply expand its presence out of Washington's 
Dulles airport in the face of increased competition from USAirways, 
Southwest and Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the carrier needs additional planes to meet its  
goal and that America West's 111 aircraft would fit the bill. But 
that, too, is likely to raise the ire of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL executives in a conference call following the release of the  
carrier's fourth-quarter earnings refused to discuss the progress 
of the American West talks, but they expressed concern about stiff 
competition that has kept ticket prices down and affected profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have been turning to alliances such as code-sharing as  
a way to promote seamless air travel and cater to lucrative 
business fliers. But economic troubles overseas have made snaring 
domestic travelers more important and heated up competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do expected to make money next year, but a lot depends on  
the fare environment, which is hard to predict,'' said Rono Dutta, 
the company's senior vice president for planning. 
</P>
<P>
	America West, founded in 1983, has 12,000 employees and hubs at  
its base in Phoenix as well as Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio. It 
flies to more than 60 cities in the United States, Mexico and 
Canada and has code-sharing agreements to book passengers on other 
airlines for more than 30 other U.S. destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., serves more  
than 150 destinations in the United States and an additional 29 
worldwide. Along with Chicago, it has hubs in Denver, London, San 
Francisco, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Boston Schools Have Tampered Scores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The puck stops here.  
</P>
<P>
	The athletic director for Boston schools has acknowledged  
reporting phony hockey scores to newspapers to avoid embarrassing 
the losers. He's promised to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocco DiLorenzo, athletic director for the city's schools,  
wouldn't say if bogus scores had been entered in other sports, but 
one basketball coach said fake scores occasionally had been called 
into newspapers for his sport. 
</P>
<P>
	DiLorenzo confirmed the policy has existed for hockey games for  
more than 30 years and came out of an informal agreement between 
his office and Boston hockey coaches. The scores were reported 
inaccurately to The Boston Globe and Boston Herald when the game 
was especially lopsided. While the scores were changed, the winners 
always remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad enough already in the hockey arena when it so  
physical and the adrenaline is pumping,'' DiLorenzo said. ``Then to 
look in the paper and to have your nose rubbed in a bad score is 
really embarrassing. So we improvised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kinder scores also have been seen on the basketball courts  
when there have been near-shutout games, said Kenny Grubbs, a 
basketball coach for Snowden International High in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a big blowout, the coaches don't want to make it look  
that bad,'' Grubbs said. ``(You) tell the newspaper a different 
score just to save a little face for (the athletes). 
</P>
<P>
	A Boston Globe report exposed the phony hockey scores after a  
photographer realized the scores published in the paper didn't 
match what she had witnessed on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	DiLorenzo said fudging the scores not only made the students  
look better, but it also boosted morale for the hockey teams. He 
wouldn't comment on whether the false reporting happened in other 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	One parent said the net result of the phony scores was not good.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not helping the kids. It teaches kids that honesty is not  
the most important thing,'' said Sherry Williams, whose 12-year-old 
daughter plays basketball for Boston Renaissance Charter School. 
</P>
<P>
	Supervisors of the Boston School District said they did not know  
such a practice existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly isn't a practice that we condone,'' Boston  
Schools spokeswoman Tracey Lynch said. ``We are looking into the 
matter further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiLorenzo pledged in writing to provide accurate scores to media  
outlets in the future -- no matter what the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assure that this will not happen again,'' he said. ``But  
there's never been a complaint over all these years from kids or 
parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state high school athletic association criticized the bogus  
scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand what he's saying about the sportsmanship and  
embarrassment but I also understand the position of the media in 
wanting accuracy,'' said Bill Gaine, deputy director of the 
Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Fritz McGinness of the National Federation of State High School  
Associations -- a group in Kansas City that writes rules for all 
high school athletic events -- said the policy set a bad example for 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes to get defeated 20-0, but reality has to take  
place once in a while,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Contenders Wary of California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A half-dozen Republicans with White  
House dreams are coming to the GOP state convention next month to 
strut their stuff and raise money. Just as intriguing as who is on 
the list of candidates is who isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush declined an invitation. Ex-Gov. Pete  
Wilson and Elizabeth Dole are wavering. Ohio Rep. John Kasich was 
pointedly snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plum speaking spots at the California Republican Party  
Convention Feb. 26-28 have been snapped up by former Vice President 
Dan Quayle, Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire, 1996 candidate Steve Forbes and former Tennessee Gov. 
Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Another convention speaker and presidential hopeful is Gary  
Bauer, a conservative activist who this week tapped Michael Reagan, 
son of the former president and California governor, to head his 
political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani don't appear on the list of speakers. Nor does former 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich or broadcaster and past candidate Pat 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-annual convention offers presidential hopefuls a  
chance to dazzle the GOP faithful, schmooze with operatives and tap 
into California's massive fund-raising machine. 
</P>
<P>
	They are coming this year en masse.  
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can recall, going back at least 20 years, I've  
never seen so many presidential candidates at a convention,'' state 
party Chairman Mike Schroeder said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The urgency of courting California has never been greater. The  
state has moved its primary up to the earliest possible date -- 
March 7, 2000 -- potentially giving it unprecedented clout in the 
nomination process. The primary usually takes place in June, long 
after the nominations are sealed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubt remains about whether that primary election will be  
recognized, since California allows voters to cross party lines; 
the Republican and Democratic national parties have threatened to 
ignore the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder sent out the speaking invitations about two months  
ago. Kasich was snubbed over his plan to speak at a fund-raiser for 
Democratic Rep. Gary Condit, a longtime friend. A spokesman said 
Kasich hadn't planned to attend anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential candidates who weren't invited were Buchanan,  
Gingrich, Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was invited, but has yet to signal his intentions. He has  
said his decision to run for president hinges on how much money he 
can raise. 
</P>
<P>
	California's ``favorite son'' has had a tumultuous relationship  
with the state party, and the rifts occasionally erupted at GOP 
state conventions. In 1991, conservatives furious with his tax hike 
tarred and feathered him in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the front-runner in many polls though he hasn't announced  
his plans, said he'd be too busy with Texas business until 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, initially refused,  
then reconsidered after resigning as head of the American Red 
Cross. But she hasn't said yet whether she'll come. 
</P>
<P>
	The state GOP never got responses from Pataki or Giuliani.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The president and chief executive of the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange is resigning after two years in the position. 
</P>
<P>
	T. Eric Kilcollin said today his resignation will be effective  
in 60 days, but he has agreed to stay longer if needed until a 
successor is found. 
</P>

<P>
	Kilcollin first joined the exchange in 1981, serving as chief  
economist from 1982 until 1990 and chief operating officer from 
1990 to 1994. He left in 1994 to become chief executive officer of 
the Investment Services Group at Wells Fargo Nikko Investment 
Advisors, then returned to the exchange in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Does His Part To Help Boxers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A tearful Alex Ramos, who knows about hard  
knocks in and out of the ring, talked Thursday about helping others 
who toiled in the hard world of professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the dark, I didn't see the light,'' said the  
36-year-old Ramos, a former middleweight contender. ``I was into 
drugs and alcohol and I was homeless. I had been on top of the 
world and -- boom -- I hit rock bottom, but I picked myself up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when he straightened himself out through rehabilitation in  
1995, he saw the light in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I wanted to do is help retired fighters,'' Ramos said on  
the final day of three days of hearings conducted by the National 
Association of Attorney Generals Boxing Task Force at the Downtown 
Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos is founder and president of the Retired Boxers Foundation,  
a non-profit organization that helps direct retired fighters to 
services that can help them. It is especially directed to help 
ex-fighters who are alcoholics, substance abusers, homeless and 
show the effects of Dementia Pugilistica (punch drunkenness). 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation is a way of keeping Ramos involved in the sport  
he loves. He fought professionally about 40 times from 1980-1994, 
except for being inactive in 1992-93. He made an unsuccessful bid 
for a piece of the world middleweight title in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the sport of boxing as much as anybody,'' Ramos said.  
``I will die a boxer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love of the sport and the quest for championship money and  
glory, of course, leads to a lot of problems for boxers because 
they fight too long, or are overmatched too many times. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the roar of the crowd is gone ...'' said Gerry Cooney,  
who failed to win the WBC heavyweight title from Larry Holmes in 
1971, noting the emptiness that retirement can bring to a fighter, 
especially a successful one. ``That walk from the dressing room to 
the ring is special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been out of the ring for a while and I haven't found it  
(a satisfactory replacement) yet,'' added Cooney, who attempted a 
couple of comebacks, and who helped found the Fighters' Institute 
for Support and Training, a non-profit organization. ``It helps 
former fighters get job training, psychological testing and medical 
help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it was just a way for a moment to stand tall,'' Ramos  
said of the reason to become a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also appearing before the task force Thursday were Bobby  
Bartells of Ring 8 of the Veteran Boxers Association; Stephen 
Acunto Jr., president of the American Association for the 
Improvement of Boxing, and George Otto of the Jerry Quarry 
Foundation for Dementia Pugilistica, founded by the former 
heavyweight contender. Quarry died Jan. 3 of cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry had Dementia Pugilistica. Otto said Quarry's brothers,  
Mike, a former light heavyweight contender, and Bob, who boxed as a 
heavyweight, also suffer from it.

<HEADLINE> IOC Offers To Return Tax Concession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC plans to give back a $1.45  
million-a-year Swiss tax concession, according to the senior 
committee member who set off the biggest corruption investigation 
in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, an IOC executive board member and finance committee  
chairman, told today's Berner Zeitung that the tax decision had 
been made by himself, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and 
direcor general Francois Carrard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided last Friday to give the money back to the (Swiss)  
treasury,'' Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the committee would ask for the money to be used  
for the furthering of sport in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss finance ministry said it knew nothing of the offer.  
Earlier reports said the bribery scandal could cost the IOC its 
tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board meets this weekend to consider the  
expulsion of members accused of taking bribes or other favors in 
connection with Salt Lake City's Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The exemption from value-added tax (VAT) was granted to the  
International Olympic Committee by the Swiss government last 
September, nearly four years after the Lausanne-based IOC requested 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland has exempted the IOC from direct federal tax since  
1981 due to its public-service aims. VAT came into force at the 
beginning of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The VAT exemption is due to be reviewed by a commission of the  
lower house of the Swiss parliament next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to Hodler's statements, the IOC released a letter from  
Carrard to the parliament commission's members in which he said he 
would let them know the outcome of the weekend's discussions in 
time for their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said Hodler was speaking  
in his personal capacity only, and the matter of VAT had not been 
discussed by the executive board, although it might be at a future 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler blew the whistle on alleged widespread corruption in the  
selection of host cities for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A special IOC commission investigating alleged vote-buying in  
the awarding of the 2002 winter Olympics to Salt Lake City is due 
to issue its report this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Amtrak Official Accused of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The modernization of Chicago's historic Union  
Station was accompanied by old-fashioned payoffs from contractors 
to a key Amtrak official, federal prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Corcoran, 48, was charged in a 10-count indictment  
Thursday with taking $400,000 in kickbacks from five contractors 
who worked on the renovation project from 1991 through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Corcoran, 48, indicted on five counts of mail fraud and five  
counts of bribery, is accused of approving more than $2.5 million 
in work contracts in return for payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who answered the phone at Corcoran's home Thursday night  
said Corcoran was not there. Attorney William Hooks, who has 
represented Corcoran, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Station is a massive, ornate reminder of the era when  
railroads were king. It was the setting for an action scene in the 
movie ``The Untouchables'' and remains the main departure point for 
southbound trains.

<HEADLINE>  Crash May End Ortlieb's Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- A terrifying crash Thursday on the  
dangerous Streif course might have ended the career of Patrick 
Ortlieb of Austria, the former Olympic and world downhill champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb fractured his right thigh, dislocated his right hip and  
sustained neck bruises in a practice run for a downhill 
doubleheader Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian, who won the Kitzbuehel downhill in 1994, lost his  
balance in the final corner of one of the most treacherous courses 
on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the Hausbergkante corner at a speed of about 60 mph,  
Ortlieb cartwheeled and smashed into the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated on the scene before being taken by helicopter to  
a hospital. Later, Ortlieb was flown to a hospital in Innsbruck for 
emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb won the Olympic downhill at the 1992 Games and the world  
title in 1996. He was fourth at the 1994 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The severity of the injuries appeared likely to end the career  
of Ortlieb, who had been thinking of retiring after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb also crashed badly at Wengen, Switzerland, last weekend,  
injuring his back and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ortlieb's accident, Frederic Marin-Cudraz of France also  
crashed at the same spot and was hospitalized with torn ligaments 
in his left knee. He will miss the rest of the season. He is the 
fourth French downhiller to be injured this season, including 
Olympic champion Jean-Luc Cretier. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's crashes came at the same spot where Brian Stemmle of  
Canada tore shoulder ligaments in a spill Wednesday, ending his 
season. Stemmle was nearly killed on the Streif 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus of Norway, winner of three downhill races this  
season, posted the fastest time in practice for downhills Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, the 1996 overall World Cup champion who is recovering from  
a lung infection, won the longest downhill on the circuit in 
Wengen, then took third in a slalom to win the season's first 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	A repeat of last weekend's performance could vault Kjus past  
overall World Cup leader Hermann Maier in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, bothered by a sore back and racing the Streif for the  
first time, will carry the added burden of thousands of demanding 
home fans, who will descend on the tiny village for the weekend 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the defending overall world champion who has made the  
World Cup downhill title a goal this season, leads the overrall 
with 1,021 points, 169 ahead of Kjus. The roles are reversed in the 
downhill standings, where Kjus leads with 380, with Maier 120 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier was 10th in Thursday's final practice.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Clinton's Defense-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from President Clinton's defense team's presentation to  
the Senate Thursday, as transcribed by the Federal Document 
Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, these allegedly impeachable denials to the four aides  
occurred, as I said, right after the publicity broke. Indeed, one 
of them occurred on Jan. 21 last year, and then also on the 23rd 
and the 26th. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was at the very time the president was denying he'd had  
sexual relations with Miss Lewinsky in nearly identical terms on 
national television to whoever across the United States happened to 
be watching at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, having made this denial to the entire country, it's  
simply absurd to regard it any differently when made to four aides 
in the White House directly and person to person rather than 
through the medium of television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president talked to these individuals about the Lewinsky  
matter because of his personal relationship and his direct 
professional exposure to them on a daily basis.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the proof that is in the record is that there was no  
corrupt linkage, no assistance whatsoever which was designed and 
focused to get Ms. Lewinsky to do anything, nothing which tied the 
job assistance to what was going on in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jordan did help open doors, and Ms. Lewinsky went through  
those doors, and she either succeeded or failed on her own merits. 
Two of the companies declined to offer her a job, and at the third 
she did get an entry-level job which she received on her own 
merits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no fix, no quid pro quo, no link to the Jones case.  
And also, there was no urgency to Mr. Jordan's assistance to her. 
He started assisting her well before she showed up on the Jones 
witness list and he helped her whenever he could consistently with 
his own heavy travel schedule.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, Mr. Jordan, who is an eloquent and exceedingly articulate  
man, took care of that claim in his own grand jury testimony. He 
was asked about any connection between the job search and the 
affidavit. He said there was absolutely none.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, let me just pause here and observe that if there had been  
any improper motive for any sinister effort to silence Ms. 
Lewinsky, it would have been extremely easy for the president to 
have arranged for her to be hired at the White House. If there were 
some corrupt intent to silence her, that was an obvious solution 
because she very much wanted to go back to work at the White House. 
It mattered a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But while she was interviewed a couple of times by White House  
officials in the summer of 1997, those interviews never resulted in 
a job offer. The fix was not in. There was no corrupt effort to 
bring Ms. Lewinsky back, give her a White House job, or indeed 
transfer her in any way from her Pentagon job.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jordan was able to open doors, but once open, there was no  
inappropriate pressure. '' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``And so it is here. You can keep adding zero to zero to zero  
for a very long time, indeed forever, and you'll still have zero. 
The big picture here just doesn't exist, and no matter how many 
times the House managers keep making the assertion, there is just 
no evidence of any kind.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that there are self-inflicted wounds here,  
wounds that are very real and very painful and very public. There's 
just no question about that. The question before you is whether 
these self-inflicted wounds rise to such a level of lawless and 
unconstitutional conduct that they leave you no alternative, no 
choice but to assume the awesome responsibility for reversing the 
results of two national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	On that question, what the situation demands is not eloquence,  
which the very able managers have in abundance, but rather a 
relentless focus on the facts, the law, and the Constitution, all 
of which are on the side of the president.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, this place has been really a haven of sanity,  
balance, wisdom. You've debated controversial issues which have 
been passionately felt with candor, with courage and civility. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so, once again, I think it is your responsibility, and  
yours alone, committed to you by the Constitution, to make a very 
somber judgment.'' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask only that you give this case, and give this country,  
the constitutional stability and the political sanity which this 
country deserves. The president did not commit perjury, he did not 
obstruct justice, and there are no grounds to remove him from 
office.'' -- Kendall.

<HEADLINE> NYPD To Seize Cars After DUI Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anyone arrested for drunken driving in New York  
City will have their cars seized until they are acquitted of the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Police Department plans to implement the ``Zero  
Tolerance Drinking and Driving Initiative'' within the next month, 
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, calling New York the first 
major city with such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	City code allows police to seize ``instrumentalities of crime,''  
Safir said. ``This is a creative use of a law designed to deal with 
instrumentalities of crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, cars of people arrested for drunken driving are held  
by police until someone comes to pick them up, Safir said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil  
Liberties Union, thinks Safir's plan can be legally challenged 
because the city code does not cite drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``The executive branch can't add punishment to the drunk driving  
laws,'' Siegel said. ``We recognize that drunk driving is a serious 
crime, but an open-ended grant of authority ... is not adequate in 
our perspective.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Up on Heating Oil Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures surged Thursday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, buoyed by unexpectedly sharp declines in heating oil 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, natural gas futures also gained. Wheat futures  
fell to four-month lows, while corn and soybeans gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude posted in first gains in a week after the American  
Petroleum Institute, defying expectations, reported inventories 
plunged 2.164 million barrels in the past week, putting supplies at 
321.9 million barrels. That's just slightly more than 1 percent 
larger than at the same time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories of distillate stocks, which include heating oil fell  
4.009 million barrels in the past week as cold weather socked the 
Midwest and Northeast, forcing consumers to crank up their 
thermostats. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts noted the National Weather Service's latest  
forecast for the next 10 days called for normal to above-normal 
temperatures in the two regions. With less than two months left in 
the peak heating season, there is little time further reduce 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the news was heartening to a market that has been  
continually depressed by a world oil glut and weak Asian demand. 
Crude prices in December tumbled to a 12-year low of $10.35 a 
barrel as production cuts from world oil producers failed to stem 
the flow of goods to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas jumped after the American Gas Association reported  
cold weather forced the withdrawal of 203 billion cubic feet of gas 
from storage, the second week in a row of large declines. 
</P>
<P>
	As with heating oil, however, analysts said the gain should be  
short-lived since the peak heating season soon will be coming to a 
close and storage remains at 68 percent of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for March delivery jumped 59 cents to $12.46 a barrel;  
February heating oil rose 0.71 cent to 32.05 cents a gallon; 
February unleaded gasoline rose 0.64 cent to 34.37 cents a gallon; 
February natural gas rose 6.5 cents to $1.892 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  
corn and soybean futures were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures gained on word that economic  
uncertainty in Brazil had delayed some exports. Prices also saw 
support from drier weather in competing South American growing 
regions and from continued technical buying tied to heavy losses 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by concern about the weak export  
picture and ample supplies. U.S. exporters in recent weeks have 
been losing business to competitors from Australia, Canada and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat delivery fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.68 a bushel; March corn  
rose 1 cent to $2.16 a bushel; March oats rose 1/4 cent to $1.07 1/4 a 
bushel; March soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to $5.30 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> States Say Tobacco Money Is Theirs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers and state attorneys general said  
Thursday they would use both legislation and lawsuits to deny the 
federal government any part of the billions of dollars states won 
from the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked long and hard to get this money for our respective  
states. Fair is fair,'' Ohio's attorney general, Betty Montgomery, 
said at a Capitol Hill news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said in 1997 it was entitled to part of any  
settlement the states reach with tobacco companies because the 
states were trying to recover Medicaid money spent on 
smoking-related illnesses. The federal government pays the states 
for at least half of Medicaid in every state. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are huge if Washington lays claim to half the $40  
billion settlement reached by four states and the $206 billion the 
tobacco industry says it will pay the other 46 states in a 
settlement reached last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the four largest tobacco companies agreed Thursday  
to set up a trust fund of $5.15 billion to help tobacco growers 
damaged by ramifications of those settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Bob Graham, D-Fla., are  
leading a bipartisan group proposing legislation to bar the federal 
government from taking any of the state money. Rep. Mike Bilirakis, 
R-Fla., has introduced a similar measure in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration ``never offered the states any assistance  
while they were pursuing their own cases,'' Graham said. The 
``Johnny-come-lately attempt to share in the spoils of their 
victories puts these initiatives at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham and Hutchison introduced a similar bill last year, but it  
died when anti-tobacco legislation stalled in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, said the legislation is needed  
because many states, unsure of how much they might lose to 
Washington, are holding back on needed spending of money expected 
from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``States should not be hindered from using the settlement funds  
for programs to promote the health, education and welfare of their 
citizens,'' Gov. Thomas Carper, D-Del., and Gov. Michael Leavitt, 
R-Utah, chairman and vice chairman of the National Governors' 
Association, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in Tuesday's State of the Union address, said  
the government would initiate its own lawsuit against the tobacco 
industry, separate from the states, to recoup billions of dollars 
that Medicare and other federal health programs must pay to treat 
smoking-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing tough resistance from the states, the administration has  
backed off an immediate move to reduce Medicaid payments to the 
states as a means of recouping the medical costs of smoking. 
Administration officials now say they are willing to strike a deal 
in which states would keep the money but would agree to use it for 
public health. 
</P>
<P>
	But Graham warned that it would be ``unwise to be lulled into a  
sense of false security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said the  
states would not compromise. ``The first time a penny is deducted 
from the states we'll precipitate state lawsuits,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An ``amicable resolution,'' she said, ``is the U.S. Congress  
saying the federal government has no claim.''

<HEADLINE> Activists Seek Snowmobile Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First it was Jet Skis. Now environmentalists  
want snowmobiles banned from the national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're killing our wildlife, ruining our air and water  
quality, poisoning the health of rangers exposed to snowmobiles' 
carbon monoxide exhaust, and destroying the solitude and peace 
cherished by other winter visitors,'' said Russell Long, executive 
director of the Bluewater Network, a coalition of groups that filed 
a petition with the National Park Service on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobiles are permitted in 28 park units, with the heaviest  
use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in Wyoming, and 
at Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 120,000 snowmobiles go into Yellowstone each year, and the  
air around the park's west entrance, where they congregate, is 
sometimes thick with their blue smoke. At Old Faithful geyser 
alone, snowmobiles create more pollution in one weekend than a 
year's worth of automobile traffic, says the petition. It also 
blames the machines for causing bison to leave the park and 
disturbing other wildlife, including grizzly bears. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service is required by law to respond to the petition,  
but agency officials had not reviewed it and declined comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service last fall refused to ban Jet Skis and other  
personal watercraft but limited their continued use to 25 
recreation and seashore areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the groups are asking the Environmental Protection  
Agency, Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration to consider new emission and 
safety standards for snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobiles use the same two-stroke engines as Jet Skis and many  
boats, making them one of the nation's largest sources of 
``unchecked pollution,'' the groups say in a letter to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of snowmobiles have doubled since 1992 to more than  
160,000 units a year, according to the International Snowmobile 
Manufacturers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobile owners say the machines are accused unfairly of being  
dangerous and dirty. ``More often than not the facts and figures 
are twisted. They paint the worst-case scenario whenever 
possible,'' said Jeff Mausolf, a former president of the Minnesota 
United Snowmobilers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers are working on a fuel-injected system that  
could reduce emissions by 80 percent and make the machines quieter 
as well, but the motor would still not be as clean as a four-stroke 
engine. Two-stroke motors are preferred for snowmobiles because 
they start better in the winter and accelerate more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're testing so many types of new technology that there's  
really nothing we're leaving untouched,'' said Heather Hauschild, a 
spokeswoman for Arctic Cat Inc., one of two U.S.-based 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service monitors air quality around Yellowstone's west  
entrance and is considering new regulations on snowmobiles in the 
park, including reduced use in some areas. In Voyageurs, 
snowmobiles have been banned from areas where gray wolves feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups making up the Bluewater Network include the Natural  
Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, American Lands and 
numerous regional organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not rule out seeking a ban on off-road vehicles, which  
are currently permitted at some seashores and recreation areas. But 
snowmobiles have ``far greater impact'' on wildlife than off-road 
vehicles, said D.J. Schubert, a wildlife biologist who co-authored 
the 55-page petition.

<HEADLINE> USDA Rules on Organic Food Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Farmers upset by the overly broad  
label of ``organic'' foods may find relief later this year with an 
expected government ruling that will limit the kinds of foods 
receiving that definition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to  
protect the integrity of your industry,'' Keith Jones of the 
Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program told farmers 
at the Ecological Farming Conference on Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label  
``organic'' for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered 
or treated with antibiotics. The new labeling plan responds to an 
outcry from farmers last year against an earlier set of rules the 
farmers considered too permissive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob  
Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is a 
member of the National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of 
organic farmers. ``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the 
government's attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department is developing the first national standards on  
organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and 
industry guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually  
for the last seven years. In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms  
trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming 
Research Foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call  
organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides,  
herbicides or preservatives. Livestock should be raised in open-air 
environments, without antibiotics or hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the USDA proposed allowing food to be labeled  
``organic'' even if it was irradiated to kill germs, genetically 
engineered, or subjected to sewage sludge. The rules also would 
have permitted applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited 
by industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000  
protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to 
withdraw the proposal and try again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farmers at the conference remained skeptical that his  
verbal assurances may not hold once rules are published again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but  
we still believe in it. That's kind of where we are in this 
process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for 
Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,''  
said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a 
Santa Fe, N.M. company. ``For many of us, this is a continuation of 
a lifetime of work. First it was civil rights. Then it was 
anti-war. Now it's food security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules will probably be published this summer in the  
Federal Register and could take effect in the fall, said Jones.

<HEADLINE> Truckers, Regulators Said Too Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal office that regulates trucking  
violated rules by asking truckers to lobby Congress against a plan 
to appoint another agency to supervise the office, a report 
released Thursday said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders in the Office of Motor Carriers drafted and edited  
letters last year for trucking associations and personally lobbied 
several large companies to combat the change, the report by the 
Transportation Department's inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ultimately defeated the proposal, which would have  
transferred oversight of the OMC from the Federal Highway 
Administration, which primarily builds roads, to the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees automotive 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of the proposal said the highway administration in  
general and the OMC in particular are too cozy with truckers, who 
are major users of the nation's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation shows the incestuous relationship that has  
developed between the trucking industry and the government agency 
charged with enforcing the compliance with the rules and 
regulations and laws governing the industry,'' said Rep. Frank 
Wolf, R-Va. He proposed the change in oversight and requested an 
investigation after it was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	In his report, Inspector General Kenneth C. Mead said the OMC  
lobbying violated Transportation Department policy and its 
anti-lobbying rules. He urged the highway administration ``to field 
new leadership,'' take disciplinary action and reinforce its 
lobbying provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of OMC's senior management foster, at a minimum  
..., an appearance that OMC does not have the `arm's length' 
relationship called for between safety regulators and the 
industry,'' Mead wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	For privacy reasons, names of officials involved were blacked  
out from a copy of the report Wolf released to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press learned they include George Reagle, who  
until Tuesday headed the Office of Motor Carriers. He was replaced 
by Julie Anna Cirillo, a 21-year agency veteran, and assigned to 
new duties within the highway administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The others named in the report are Jill Hochman, director of the  
Office of Motor Carrier planning and customer liaison; Clinton 
Magby, director of motor carrier field operations; and Cynthia 
Elliot, chief of the Policy Planning and Customer Liaison division. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Federal Highway Administrator Kenneth Wykle said  
the report ``indicates a serious breach of departmental policy and 
congressional prohibition against lobbying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wykle said he was replacing Reagle ``consistent with the  
recommendation of the report and following through on an earlier 
personnel agreement'' with Ms. Cirillo. He also said he was 
launching an internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Motor Carriers is a 700-person agency with a $150  
million annual budget. It is supposed to supervise truck safety and 
promote trucking. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics complain that it has spent more than a decade updating  
regulations aimed at preventing trucker fatigue and has not 
mobilized in the face of 5,000 deaths annually from truck crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying began in July 1998 and continued until October  
1998, when Wolf's proposal was removed from a massive spending 
bill, Mead said. Among other things, OMC leaders instructed field 
managers to solicit trucking organizations in their state to oppose 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was an attempt to have a United Parcel Service  
employee who is a cousin of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott try 
to lobby the senator.

<HEADLINE> Former ABL Star Price Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLMEAD, Texas (AP) -- Former Stephen F. Austin basketball star  
Katrina Price was remembered Thursday as a hero and a friend whose 
few years in the limelight left a lifetime of memories. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 people gathered in the La Vega High School  
auditorium for a memorial to Price, who died in Nacogdoches on 
Monday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Katrina was a rare individual with talent, warmth, and an  
intense desire to give of herself to others,'' said Robbie 
Williams, Price's basketball coach for three years at La Vega. 
``This is what made it all the harder to realize she has been taken 
from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-five of Price's relatives attended the hour long service,  
including five sisters who still live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	A table in front of the stage displayed two of her blue and gold  
No. 44 jerseys from her days as a Lady Pirate. Two other jerseys 
were from the Stephen F. Austin Ladyjacks and the Philadelphia Rage 
of the ABL. 
</P>
<P>
	But as much as everyone tried celebrating her life, the ceremony  
had an overwhelming sadness as those in attendance considered 
Price's apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lots of questions,'' said the Rev. Ken Shultz. ``How  
can a bright, attractive, loved young woman come to an end like 
this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hawkins, mayor of the town of 10,000 just north of Waco,  
read a proclamation declaring Thursday a day of mourning in 
Bellmead, where Price's family moved when she was in sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Katrina was a gifted young woman who excelled in academics and  
sports,'' Hawkins read from the proclamation. ``In all ways, she 
was a model of excellence ... inspiring others to higher levels of 
citizenship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Nacogdoches have yet to rule Price's death a  
suicide because there were no witnesses. Although the case is being 
investigated as a suicide, there are no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends remained mystified at what caused such a  
tragic end to a promising life. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Price's basketball career was derailed when the ABL  
folded recently, there still were chances for her overseas or in 
the WNBA. She also was enrolled in graduate school at Stephen F. 
Austin and had begun working towards a master's degree in hopes of 
becoming a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the person who could do both (academics and  
athletics), be both, and win,'' said Jennifer Logan, a high school 
classmate. ``She was a person who could pull us together for a 
common goal -- success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thank you, Katrina, for shining your light on us. You'll  
always be loved and missed. Your light still shines bright with 
hope and determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price will be buried Saturday in Oakwood.

<HEADLINE> Study: Unplanned Pregnancies Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Abortion rates are similar in rich and poor  
countries but the mortality rates due to complications from the 
procedure are higher in the developing nations, according to a new 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-nine out of every 1,000 women of childbearing age have  
abortions each year in developed countries, compared to 34 per 
1,000 in developing countries, said a study released Thursday by 
The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that 
receives some funding from Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the rate is that high in the developing world,  
where abortion is illegal, and therefore expensive or unsafe, it 
indicates to us how motivated women are'' to seek abortions, said 
Susheela Singh, the institute's director of research. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to find a way, even when there's a risk,'' Singh  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In developing countries that outlaw abortion or where it is  
widely unavailable, the mortality rate from complications is far 
higher than in developed nations -- an average of 330 deaths per 
100,000 abortions compared with between 0.2 and 1.2 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In Africa, an estimated 680 of every 100,000 women who undergo  
an abortion die of complications, researchers said. In Canada, 
which has one of the lowest abortion death rates, the study said 
there were 0.1 deaths per 100,000 abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 38 percent of the estimated 210 million pregnancies  
that occur worldwide each year are unintentional; 22 percent end in 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, about 35 of every 1,000 women of childbearing age --  
3.5 percent -- have abortions each year, the report said. About 26 
million women have legal abortions each year, and about 20 million 
have illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers attributed the high rates of unplanned pregnancy and  
abortion worldwide to inadequate availability and use of 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really points to the difficulties that women and couples  
have in planning their pregnancies,'' said Susan Tew, a spokeswoman 
for the Guttmacher Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Europe had the highest rate of unplanned pregnancies and  
the highest abortion rate of any area of the world: 90 abortions 
per 1,000 women of childbearing age, the study said. Western Europe 
had the lowest abortion rate, 11 per 1,000 women, although its 
abortion laws are similar to those in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the disparity could be because of the greater  
availability and use of contraceptives in the west. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 30 percent of all pregnancies in Africa  
were unplanned, as were 39 percent in eastern Asia (excluding 
Japan), 34 percent in the rest of Asia, 52 percent in Latin 
America, 63 percent in Eastern Europe, 33 percent in the rest of 
Europe and 45 percent in North America, Australia, New Zealand and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings follow recent surveys that showed abortion  
and teenage pregnancy rates declining in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. abortion rate in 1995 and 1996 among women ages 15-44  
was the lowest since 1975. Twenty-three of every 1,000 women of 
childbearing age had an abortion in 1995-96 compared with 22 per 
1,000 in 1975, according to a Guttmacher study released in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three percent of all U.S. pregnancies end in abortion,  
the new study said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bumpers Makes Plea for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a plea to former colleagues, retired Sen.  
Dale Bumpers told senators today they must resist a House effort to 
remove President Clinton from office in a drive that ``is dangerous 
to the unique mix of pure democracy and republican government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech that mixed self-deprecating humor, emotional  
descriptions of his friendship with Clinton and repeated references 
to his own reverence for the Constitution, Bumpers closed out the 
White House opening defense argument with a personal appeal after 
the president's lawyers relentlessly attacked the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have taken a solemn oath to be fair and impartial. I know  
you all, I know you as friends and I know you as honorable men and 
I am perfectly satisfied to put that in your hands, under your 
oath,'' said Bumpers, who retired from the Senate in December after 
24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He denounced Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky  
controversy as ``a breach of his marriage vows'' and a ``terrible 
moral lapse'' -- but not a crime that was impeachable. He spoke 
eloquently of the human toll the president's mistake had on 
Clinton's family, while chiding House prosecutors for a lack of 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned the senators that the idea of removing Clinton for  
such offenses is ``dangerous to the political process and is 
dangerous to the unique mix of pure democracy and republican 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh colleagues, you have such an awesome responsibility,''  
Bumpers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though mostly serious, he also brought laughter to the floor. He  
recalled how he and Clinton had once survived a rough plane landing 
in Arkansas one snowy day. ``We jumped out and ran away unscathed -- 
to the dismay of every budding politician in Arkansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he reminded his recent colleagues that he was not there as  
Clinton's friend but as a former senator concerned about the 
precedent a conviction of Clinton would set. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that the Founding Fathers had put impeachment in the  
Constitution ``to protect the public, not punish the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton's private lawyer charged that House impeachment  
prosecutors had ignored evidence that would exonerate the president 
in an ``attempt to fit some of the facts into a sinister pattern'' 
of obstruction of justice. ``The direct evidence disproves the 
charges,'' David Kendall argued as the Clinton team completed its 
opening presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's presentation was methodical, unrelenting and a stark  
contrast to that of Bumpers. He spared no words for the president's 
critics in denouncing the Whitewater investigation as ``tortuous 
and meandering'' and said he was before the trial to rebut the 
``rhetoric'' of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The final presentation came one year to the day after the  
Lewinsky allegations became public and thrust the presidency into 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is more than rhetoric. It means that in  
proceedings like these, where important rights are being 
adjudicated, that evidence matters. Fairness matters. ... The 
presumption of innocence matters,'' argued Kendall, who has 
represented the president through a variety of legal controversies 
dating to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law is not the monopoly of the House managers, and  
it ought to be practiced in these proceedings as well as talked 
about in speeches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closing statement invoking Thomas Jefferson and George  
Washington, Kendall pleaded with senators to ``cool the passions of 
the moment'' and cast aside the ``poisonous partisanship'' of the 
House impeachment vote. ``We ask only that you give this case and 
give this country the constitutional stability and the political 
sanity which this country deserves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's criminal lawyer focused his attack on the  
impeachment article accusing Clinton of obstruction, saying it was 
``based on circumstantial evidence, and that evidence is at best 
profoundly ambiguous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His assessment of the House prosecutors' case was harsh. At one  
point, he ridiculed as ``entirely untanable '' Rep. Bob Barr's 
assertion last week that Clinton tried to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in 
New York to avoid a subpoena in the Paula Jones sexual harassment. 
``She was just as vulnerable to subpoena in New York as 
Washington,'' Kendall retorted. 
</P>
<P>
	He dissected in great detail the allegation that Clinton had  
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	With a touch of sarcasm, Kendall read Ms. Lewinsky's testimony  
that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job 
for my silence.'' And then he asked, ``Is there something difficult 
to understand here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall noted that Ms. Lewinsky had testified she believed she  
was filing a true affidavit when she denied having ``sexual 
relations'' with the president and that Clinton ``showed no 
interest in viewing'' the affidavit before it was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	He charged that those were ``obviously exculpatory'' facts that  
``the House managers simply ignored in their attempt to fit some of 
the facts into a sinister pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators will soon get their first chance to ask questions of  
the two sides, submitting those queries through Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist. That questioning is expected to begin Friday and 
continue Saturday. Some 70 questions have been submitted by 
Republicans so far, a GOP spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said they oppose dismissal of the charges and  
support the need for limited live testimony from key witnesses such 
as Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and presidential 
secretary Betty Currie -- and they should get their way with a 55-45 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with a two-thirds majority needed to make Clinton the  
first president evicted from his job, Democrats hold the votes for 
acquittal and show no signs of backing a move to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.  
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union 
address Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to 72 
percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One well-known conservative Republican, evangelist and  
broadcaster Pat Robertson, said Clinton pulled off such a public 
relations coup in the address that there is no chance he will be 
convicted. ``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing 
and get on with something else,'' he said on ``The 700 Club'' 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, in town to attend a Senate  
lecture series sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., declined a chance to discuss the impeachment trial. But 
speaking in the Old Senate Chamber Wednesday evening, the former 
Republican president lamented that today in Washington, ``we are 
confronted with a deficit of decency -- one that deepens by the 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's defense before senators Wednesday, Deputy White  
House Counsel Cheryl Mills argued that House managers ignored 
testimony from Mrs. Currie in order to falsely accuse the president 
of trying to obstruct the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those facts, those stubborn facts that just don't fit,''  
Ms. Mills said.

<HEADLINE>  Deadline Passes in Yugo Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The deadline passed today for a U.S.  
peace monitor to leave Yugoslavia with the envoy still in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 5 p.m. (11 a.m. EST) deadline approached, members of the  
mission that William Walker heads barricaded the building where he 
remained holed up in Kosovo's capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	They removed the iron barricade within the hour, after Yugoslav  
police made no move to get Walker. Three uniformed officers merely 
continued to watch the building from across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not leaving now,'' Walker's spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet,  
told reporters. Walker said earlier he planned to fly today to 
Belgrade. Grunnet said, however, it was decided ``at the moment 
it's not a good idea to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government ordered Walker expelled for publicly  
accusing the Serbs of massacring 45 ethnic Albanians whose 
mutilated bodies were discovered Saturday in a gully outside the 
Kosovo village of Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador was given two days to  
leave Yugoslavia but after diplomatic maneuvers intensified and 
NATO renewed threats of airstrikes, the government allowed him to 
remain 24 more hours, until this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had hinted late Wednesday, following Russian  
diplomatic intervention, that Walker may be allowed to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington today, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  
international monitors would be pulled out if Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic did not reverse the expulsion of their leader 
and permit the group to operate unhindered. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Milosevic had invited ``world condemnation'' by  
trying to expel Walker and for blocking efforts by the U.N. war 
crimes tribunal to investigate the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 750 monitors are in Kosovo to verify Yugoslav compliance  
with the Oct. 12 cease-fire brokered by the United States. By 
eliminating fears for their safety, their departure could clear the 
way for NATO to stage airstrikes from its forces that have been 
beefed up in the Adriatic Sea and at Brindisi, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Walker stays, Milosevic must do more to end the  
bloodshed if Yugoslavia, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is clear is that the status quo is neither acceptable nor  
sustainable,'' she said, adding the United States and its allies 
must be prepared to use force in dealing with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a police sweep was under way today in the village of  
Vraganica, about 25 miles northwest of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. 
Two guerrillas from the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army were 
killed in fighting there Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources among the police and the international monitors reported  
sporadic gunfire as police went house-to-house looking for 
suspected rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasional mortar and machine-gun fire resounded in the Racak  
area, scene of last week's massacre, as a U.N. refugee agency 
convoy delivered aid -- including food and blankets for the winter 
weather -- to villagers driven from their homes by shelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid officials estimated 400 people are camped in the open on  
steep mountains south of the village or were seeking shelter in 
bombed-out houses. 
</P>
<P>
	With diplomatic pressure mounting on Yugoslavia, signs of  
compromise emerged late Wednesday. Deputy Prime Minister Vuk 
Draskovic said the ``case of Ambassador Walker will be solved 
through compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic spoke after meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign  
Minister Alexander Avdeyev. The Russian official also met with 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic blunted -- but did not end -- the threat of NATO  
airstrikes in October when he agreed to end a prolonged crackdown 
on guerrillas fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province of 
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions in Kosovo escalated dramatically after the discovery of  
the bodies in Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslavs refused to let the U.N. war crimes tribunal  
investigate the killings, turning away the chief prosecutor for 
three days this week, but invited forensic experts from Finland to 
take part. Five of them began work today at the morgue in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Finnish team, Helena Ranta, appealed to Serb  
authorities to halt their investigation until her entire team is in 
place with its X-ray equipment. The last members of the team were 
due here today. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no X-ray facilities and the victims have been  
shot,'' Ranta said. ``To detect bullets, you have to have X-rays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people have died in Kosovo fighting the past year.

	SHANGHAI (AP) -- China's market watchdog, the China Securities  
Regulatory Commission, has revoked the licenses of two futures 
brokerages found guilty of trading violations, the official 
newspaper China Securities News said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chengdu Zhonghai Maoshuyin Futures Brokerage company and Far  
East Futures Brokerage were discovered to have illegally traded in 
stocks, used clients' deposits to speculate in China's futures 
market, issued falsified annual reports and provided unlicensed 
overdraft facilities to clients, the report said.

<P>
	The closures come as Beijing cleans up its casino-like futures

<HEADLINE> More Cancer Stamps To Be Printed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special postage stamp designed to raise  
money for breast cancer research has become so popular that an 
additional 80 million are being printed, the post office announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it went on sale last summer some 61 million of the stamps  
have been sold, raising up to $4.9 million for research the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamp sells for 40 cents and is valid for the current  
33-cent first-class postage, with most of the difference designated 
for research at the National Institutes of Health and Defense 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional printing will bring the total number of breast  
cancer stamps printed to 280 million, which is expected to meet 
demand until sales of the stamp end in July 2000.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Say Surviving Octuplets OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Doctors are predicting a healthy future for the  
seven surviving Houston octuplets, saying there are no signs of 
developmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These children have a good chance of being normal,'' said Dr.  
Leonard Weisman, chief neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkem Chukwu delivered eight babies, but the eighth, Odera, died  
a week after birth. The surviving two boys and five girls are now 
off ventilators and receiving breast milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Brain scans revealed no bleeding, usually a hallmark of  
developmental problems. Two babies -- Gorom, the tiniest, and her 
brother Ikem -- are fighting infection but all of the babies are 
gaining weight. 
</P>
<P>
	At birth, all seven were under 2 pounds. By Thursday, Jioke, a  
boy, continued to lead his siblings as the heaviest, weighting 2 3/4 
pounds. Gorom was just over 1 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies, born three months premature, will have to remain at  
Texas Children's until at least March, or until they gain 
sufficient weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical bill is expected to reach $1.75 million.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympics Welcomes Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Organizers of the 1996 Summer Olympics want to  
end speculation about what misdeeds might have occurred in bringing 
the games to Atlanta, even if that means an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways I wish they'd just investigate us, because I  
don't think they'd find anything,'' said Charlie Battle, a key 
member of the city's bid effort. ``And then they'd give us a clean 
bill of health and we could get on with things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Payne, who was president of the Atlanta Committee for the  
Olympic Games, is sure no wrongdoing would be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be delighted to talk about the experience: the good, the  
bad and the difficult,'' he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
in an interview published Thursday. ``We ain't perfect, and we 
ain't arrogant, but we didn't bribe anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said media inquiries were distracting him from his current  
job as an executive of Premiere Technologies. He also said he 
hasn't heard from any of the four investigations into suspected 
wrongdoing by Salt Lake City Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee said it would expand its  
inquiry to other cities if presented with evidence, but Payne said 
no one has contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notwithstanding the fact that we all have other jobs now, and  
this was 10 or 12 years ago, and it's hard to remember, we're still 
put in a position where we have to explain the fact that we 
competed under the rules, which is regrettable,'' he said. ``But 
we're not stonewalling anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he responded to IOC questions in 1990 after Atlanta  
won the games. The IOC at that time convened representatives of all 
bid cities in Lausanne, Switzerland, and questioned them about the 
bid process and any abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so euphoric, we didn't have anything bad to say about  
the process,'' Payne said, adding he does not recall any losing 
bidders citing specific problems. ``We would say what we already 
said. We played by the rules. There was nothing untoward, nothing 
unethical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he was shocked when confronted with allegations that  
Salt Lake officials provided scholarships, medical care, lavish 
gifts and cash to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake had the best bid on its merits to host the Winter  
Olympic Games,'' Payne said. ``It was not necessary, given the 
incredible impressiveness of their bid, to move outside at all the 
permitted boundaries of the bidding process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $400,000 Salt Lake scholarship program that benefited  
relatives of at least six IOC members was inappropriate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is systematic, it is organized,'' Payne said. ``It is  
intentional. I even saw where a member of their board said, `Yeah, 
we used the Atlanta model.' Well, we didn't have a scholarship 
program. We didn't have a model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, Payne's close ally in the  
Atlanta bid effort, said last week he thought the scholarship 
program was acceptable because it helped poor Africans receive an 
education. Payne said he disagrees but he understands Young's 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Andy espouses that there is nothing wrong with this  
program, I know from the bottom reaches of his heart he sincerely 
believes this,'' Payne said. ``In this particular context, as it 
relates to the fact that relatives of these students were to later 
cast their vote, I think it is inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young recently admitted delivering equipment and apparel to  
Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member implicated in the scandal. The 
goods, to be distributed to African youth, were delivered a month 
before Atlanta won the bid in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Young's activities were questionable, Payne said,  
``When Andy Young tells me and others that in taking those balls 
and T-shirts to those kids he was doing it as a part of what he 
considered his mandate in life, to help others, then I would 
support that with my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said Atlanta bid officials were told to provide  
first-class air fare for IOC members and that gifts up to $200 or 
$150 were permitted. But ``instead of taking them to fancy 
restaurants, we took them into our homes,'' he said. ``We felt it 
was just an extension of Southern hospitality. I felt we were 
showing our city in its best light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he never was approached by any consultants seeking  
bribes for votes and would not have responded favorably if he had.

<HEADLINE> DeLay: Impeachment Could Help GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Majority Whip Tom DeLay told a  
conservative gathering Thursday night the Republican Party could 
benefit from moving forward with the impeachment of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a difference between right and wrong, and there is a  
clear choice between justice and corruption,'' the Texas Republican 
said in a keynote dinner speech at the Conservative Political 
Action Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay disagreed with some political analysts who have said a  
drawn-out impeachment trial could hurt the GOP in elections next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``And when this impeachment situation is resolved, the American  
electorate will match the strength of our convictions with the 
merits of our ideas,'' he said, ``and when the sun rises following 
election night 2000 I think we will control both ends of 
Pennsylvania Avenue because of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay also dismissed criticism that the process has been  
one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to tell you that there was nothing partisan about  
how we approached the impeachment process,'' he said. ``Because it 
is impossible to be partisan when you are following your 
constitutional obligations.''

<HEADLINE> Lucille Kallen, TV Comedy Writer, Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucille Kallen, the only woman on the legendary  
stable of comedy writers behind Sid Caesar's ``Your Show of 
Shows,'' died of cancer at 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kallen died Monday at her home in Ardsley, a New York  
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The television program, which starred Caesar and Imogene Coca,  
was broadcast live on Saturday nights from 1950 to 1954 and is now 
considered a classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kallen was among a handful of female television comedy  
writers working at the time. She also wrote six novels, including 
the C.B. Greenfield mystery series and ``Outside There, 
Somewhere,'' a 1964 novel that explored the competing demands of 
motherhood and career. 
</P>
<P>
	The group that put together ``Your Show of Shows'' was so famous  
that it was depicted in the 1982 movie ``My Favorite Year,'' which 
was remade as a Broadway musical in 1992, and in Neil Simon's 1993 
play ``Laughter on the 23rd Floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her colleagues on the program included Simon, Mel Brooks, Carl  
Reiner, Larry Gelbart and a young Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiner, who played Caesar's second banana, described Ms. Kallen  
as a ``real writer'' with a fine ear for dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was quite a talented girl, and she was cute as a button,  
too,'' he said. ``And being the woman, she did give it the woman's 
touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Reiner created ``The Dick Van Dyke'' show, he based the  
character of comedy writer Sally Rogers in part on Ms. Kallen. The 
character was played by Rose Marie. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ms. Kallen found a piece of paper in her attic that  
summed up her talent. It included notes for a Caesar-Coca sketch 
about a wife complaining to her husband that the spark had faded 
from their marriage: 
</P>
<P>
	Wife: Where is the sense of adventure? Where is the fun? Where  
is the romance? 
</P>
<P>
	Husband: How do I know where you put things? I can't even find  
my shirt! 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Tolkin, the head writer of ``Your Show of Shows,'' said Ms.  
Kallen could get a little lost in the shuffle of the raucous 
writers' room. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was generally the least given credit because the other  
people are so loud and so famous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kallen took up writing after studying classical music at the  
Juilliard School. She put together a nightclub revue, which led to 
an invitation to perform her act at a Poconos resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sketches landed her a job as a writer for ``The Admiral  
Broadway Revue,'' also with Caesar and Ms. Coca, the precursor to 
``Your Show of Shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When ``Your Show of Shows'' went off the air, Ms. Kallen wrote  
for ``The Imogene Coca Show,'' which lasted a year. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by her husband, Herbert Engel; a daughter; and a  
son.

<HEADLINE> 5th Inquiry Eyed for Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two corporations that pledged at least $25  
million each to sponsor the 2002 Olympic Games have decided to 
withhold a final decision until investigations involving bribery 
allegations are concluded, said a top U.S. Olympic Committee 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	But the investigations into alleged payments and gift giving  
involving the Salt Lake City Winter Games are far from over. On 
Wednesday, Utah Attorney General Jan Graham announced she will 
launch her own inquiry -- the fifth official probe into the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work will be done carefully, but as quickly and  
professionally as possible so that questions surrounding potential 
criminal conduct do not linger,'' Graham said. ``Those questions 
need to be answered with confidence and finality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said she will not begin her probe until the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee's ethics panel and the International Olympic 
Committee release their reports. The U.S. Olympic Committee and the 
Justice Department also are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC's ethics committee's findings are expected to be  
released before Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the IOC investigation are to be released in Lausanne,  
Switzerland, on Sunday. The report is expected to recommend 
expulsion of at least eight IOC members. The Wall Street Journal 
said Wednesday that a draft version implicated as many as 16 IOC 
members and warned committee officials they might be subpoenaed in 
the Justice Department's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the allegations arose last month that IOC members were  
bribed by during the city's bidding process for the games, Olympic 
officials have tried to convince corporate sponsors that their 
multimillion-dollar investments will not be tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	They maintained that sponsors were committed to their Olympic  
contracts even as the scandal grew to include cash, free medical 
care and lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, John Krimsky, U.S. Olympic Committee marketing  
director, says two companies that were close to final agreement on 
sponsorships have ``asked that the announcement of sponsorship be 
withheld until the results of the investigation are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are ongoing. I believe they are solid,''  
Krimsky said. ``But until there is a signed contract, they could 
back out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky refused to identify the companies, but said their  
involvement would be ``above entry level,'' each worth more than 
$25 million in cash and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake still has almost $250 million in sponsorships to raise  
toward its $1.45 billion budget, with Krimsky overseeing the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USA Today reported today that as part of the Justice  
Department probe, the Customs Service is exploring whether Alfredo 
La Mont, the USOC's former senior director of international 
relations, violated a currency reporting law in allegedly 
transporting cash to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC said last week that La Mont stepped down after  
informing the committee of ``a previously undisclosed business 
relationship with the Salt Lake Olympic (Bid) Committee through the 
office of former SLOC president Tom Welch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Dick Pound, the IOC vice president leading the  
organization's investigation, said in today's Washington Post that 
there ``is solid, irrefutable evidence'' that at least a dozen IOC 
members or their relatives received cash, gifts, or donations 
directly or indirectly from the Salt Lake City bidders for the 2002 
Winter Games. The newspaper reported today that Pound said that in 
several cases the amounts exceeded $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see it in black and white, it's pretty blatant stuff,  
so I don't think the people involved are going to be able to 
explain it away. But we'll see,'' Pound told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE>  Islanders' Milbury Resigns As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mike Milbury resigned as the New York  
Islanders' coach for the second time in two years on Thursday, 
saying his players were quitting on him the way they did former 
coach Rick Bowness last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, who signed a five-year coaching contract only last May,  
will stay on as general manager but was replaced as coach by former 
assistant Bill Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite high expectations going into this season and again in  
December after re-signing scoring star Zigmund Palffy to a $25 
million contract, the Islanders were winless in 11 games (0-10-1) 
before beating Pittsburgh 5-2 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, this will get things turned around,'' said Joe  
Sacco, whose shorthanded goal put the Islanders ahead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said of his first NHL victory, ``Any time you make a  
change, there's new atmosphere and new life, but we've still got a 
lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders (14-29-3) had won only three times since Nov. 26  
until Claude Lapointe's two points and an assist led them to their 
first victory in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get into a streak like we are,'' said Milbury, who  
announced the decision only 2 1/2 hours before the game. ``It happened 
to Rick last year. When the team quits on the coach, it's tough to 
get them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury decided Wednesday to remain as coach for the rest of the  
season, but changed his mind after a 5-2 loss that night to 
Florida. The Islanders had only 19 shots on goal, just nine in the 
first two periods, as fans chanted, ``Mike must go!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a no-hitter last night, and it struck home,'' Milbury  
said. ``When a team makes a cold and clear statement like that ... 
I've seen it with other coaches, it's tough to get them back, short 
of making wholesale changes. The message our players sent last 
night was a strong one and not a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sacco said, ``It was pretty bad, the worst we've played all  
year, everyone agrees on that. We've been losing lately, but not 
like that. That wasn't going to happen tonight; we took it up one 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, 46, first coached the Islanders in 1995-96, then  
resigned on Jan. 24, 1997 and turned the team over to Bowness. He 
fired Bowness and returned to coaching on March 11, 1998, not long 
after a 10-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, Milbury installed an NFL-style coaching  
system featuring offensive and defensive coordinators among four 
assistant coaches, but with Stewart moving up to coach, that system 
effectively has been dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of extra coaches is not a bad idea. It hasn't worked,  
but there is some merit to it,'' Milbury said. ``It isn't the 
reason for the problem ... but you have to face the reality of a 
long-term losing streak. I think we were always prepared, but the 
players couldn't always handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was the 1997-98 AHL coach of the year, leading the St.  
John's Flames to a 43-24-13 record and a berth in the Calder Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that there's a new coach, what happened in the past has  
happened, and we look to the future because that's the only thing 
we can take care of,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury said, ``When he was hired as associate coach, I thought  
he could be a coach who could handle the team in my absence. I 
always felt Bill would be the guy. He is a no-nonsense type of guy, 
and he will leave a strong imprint. He's a fairly defensive-minded 
guy, a batten-down-the-hatches guy and maybe now we can win some 
games by scoring three goals but giving up only two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By giving up his coaching duties, Milbury will devote more time  
to the front office and trying to find players more committed to 
winning than the Islanders currently have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have seen it (the losing) bother other  
people besides myself, maybe see somebody rattle a few cages, but, 
if it happened, I wasn't aware of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury spent 20 years in the Boston Bruins organization as a  
player, coach and front office executive before becoming the 
Islanders' coach on July 5, 1995, a year after New York's last 
appearance in the playoffs. He took over as general manager from 
Don Maloney on Dec. 12, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 56-111-24 as the Islanders coach and is 146-160-45 in the  
NHL, reaching the Stanley Cup finals once with Boston.

<HEADLINE> Wheelchair User Violated Street Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who uses a wheelchair because of  
muscular dystrophy and says city sidewalks aren't accessible has 
been found guilty of using her wheelchair in a street. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Erich O'Brien said he had no choice but to  
convict Kelly Dillery, who suffers from the degenerative muscle 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were in the actual lane of travel,'' O'Brien told Ms.  
Dillery on Thursday. ``None of us want to see you get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery was cited in December after police saw her in a  
wheelchair on a busy street. She was charged with being a 
pedestrian in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	K. Ronald Bailey, Ms. Dillery's lawyer, said his client has no  
choice but to ride in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	She also faces a child endangerment charge for strapping her  
4-year-old daughter Kelsi on her lap and riding in the street on a 
separate occasion. She has pleaded innocent to that charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not sentence her and will likely wait until the  
other case is resolved. The penalty is a $100 fine.

<HEADLINE> Airman Could Be Court-Martialed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- An Air Force airman faces a  
possible court-martial for refusing an anthrax vaccine that some 
servicemen fear may be linked to Gulf War illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has ordered the shot for all 1.5 million  
active-duty service members and 1 million reservists. Airman 1st 
Class Jeff Bettendorf refused, and was told he could be 
court-martialed as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials insist the vaccine is safe and necessary  
because rogue nations such as Iraq are suspected of storing anthrax 
in their arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax is an infectious disease that occurs naturally in  
livestock. Its dry spores can be stored in weapons and even 
microscopic amounts can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bettendorf and other military personnel have complained  
about possible side effects of the vaccine, including headaches, 
nausea and dizziness. Critics also worry it could lead to cancer, 
lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome and infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen Marines have refused the shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you there are a lot of people who are afraid of  
getting this shot,'' Bettendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Gulf War troops blame experimental vaccines given during  
the 1991 conflict for illnesses they contracted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under military law, anyone convicted in a summary court-martial  
faces 30 days of confinement, a demotion in rank and forfeiture of 
two-thirds pay for one month. Conviction would not mean a 
dishonorable discharge from the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen in 1997 ordered development of a  
program to inoculate troops against anthrax. All military forces 
are expected to be immunized by 2004 or 2005. An annual booster 
shot is needed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers Try To Turn Tables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Who's on trial here, President Clinton or his  
accusers? 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers are trying to turn the tables on GOP House  
prosecutors, claiming their impeachment case is politically 
charged, flawed and unfair. Perjury? Nonsense, they say. 
Obstruction of justice? No case, they claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-written indictment ``falls well below the most  
basic, minimal standards and should not be used to impeach and 
remove this president,'' presidential counselor Greg Craig told the 
Senate Wednesday. His colleague, Cheryl Mills, accused the House of 
encouraging senators to ignore evidence that exonerates Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a legal basis for impeaching Clinton, the president's  
lawyers suggest, the only reason for putting him on trial is a 
partisan campaign to embarrass and weaken him and push him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do not inject a poison of bitter partisanship into the body  
politic which, like a virus, can move through our national 
bloodstream for years to come, with results none can know or 
calculate,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	But political strains run deep through this impeachment drama,  
from the party-line votes against the president in the House 
Judiciary Committee and the full House to the all-Republican makeup 
of the 13-member House prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a strong advantage for the White House if it can keep  
the impeachment case on a partisan footing. After a year of the 
Monica Lewinsky saga, Americans still give Clinton high approval 
ratings, want him to stay in office and hope the impeachment case 
goes away. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate decides Clinton's fate on a partisan vote, the  
president wins. To achieve the 67 votes required to throw Clinton 
out of office, Republicans would have to peel away at least 12 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, himself a former federal  
prosecutor, complained that Clinton's attorneys were improperly 
trying to make it a case of the GOP managers versus the White 
House. ``This should not be a battle between the managers and the 
White House defense team,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while attacking the Republican prosecution, the White House  
presented a show of humility for the Senate judges, Republicans and 
Democrats alike. To lawmakers who have complained about legalistic, 
hairsplitting responses from the White House, Craig said, ``We 
apologize to you and to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's trial runs longer, likely into February,  
Republicans run the risk of being seen as obsessed with impeachment 
instead of matters like Social Security and education that 
Americans care about. Many Republicans fear there is a real threat 
that, on the heels of election losses in November, they could lose 
control of the House and Senate two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the trial runs on, there also are more opportunities for  
surprise that could sting Clinton. There are no advantages for 
Republicans or Democrats. ``The Democrats take the president's 
line'' that shorter is better, said Stephen Hess, political analyst 
at the Brookings Institution. ``The Republicans have seen this 
whole scandal like a third rail -- any institution that touches it 
gets badly burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's strong poll numbers climbed even higher after his  
State of the Union address Tuesday night. In an outpouring of 
support, more than 20,000 snow-weary people turned out in Buffalo, 
N.Y., to cheer Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a prominent conservative, television evangelist Pat  
Robertson, said Clinton ``hit a home run'' in his speech and that 
``from a public relations standpoint, he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing and get on  
with something else,'' Robertson said on his television program, 
``because it's over as far as I'm concerned.''

<HEADLINE> McLaughlin May Be Headed to MSNBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Check the volume. John McLaughlin is apparently  
heading to cable. 
</P>
<P>
	The ringleader of the combative pundits on ``The McLaughlin  
Group'' will host a new public affairs program each night on MSNBC, 
a broadcast executive who asked not to be identified said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC is expected to announce the new show on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	His new 30-minute show will air weeknights at 8:30 p.m. EST,  
part of a juggled prime-time schedule for NBC's cable affiliate. 
Like ``The McLaughlin Group,'' it will feature panelists debating 
the news of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hockenberry, only recently named to host an hour-long  
program at 8 p.m., will move the show to 10 p.m. each night. That 
will replace MSNBC's show, ``White House in Crisis,'' presumably 
looking forward to a day when the White House crisis ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internight,'' with John Gibson as host, will expand to 90  
minutes and run from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``The McLaughlin Group,'' in its 16th year, is aired weekly on  
320 PBS stations across the country and will continue. McLaughlin, 
a former aide in the Nixon and Ford administrations, was also host 
of a nightly talk show on CNBC from 1989 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC's prime-time schedule has been suffering in the ratings  
lately, losing in recent weeks to Fox News Channel.

<HEADLINE> NC State's Holt To Miss Senior Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina State's Torry Holt injured  
his right knee during practice for Saturday's Senior Bowl and will 
miss the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt, an All-American wide receiver who was on the North team's  
roster, tore a ligament during practice Tuesday and underwent 
arthroscopic surgery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	N.C. State team physician Mike Fajgenbaum performed the  
procedure. Holt is expected to return to full activity within 10-14 
days, said Annabelle Vaughan, director of sports information. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt is expected to be a high pick in the NFL draft this year,  
and the injury should not hamper his prospects, Vaughan said. He 
will not miss the NFL combine or individual workouts that NFL 
officials use to rate potential players, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt's jersey was retired Saturday night at a halftime ceremony  
during the Wolfpack's basketball game against North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Educators Against Vatican Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just four days before the pope arrives in the  
United States, leaders of two leading Catholic campuses are warning 
that proposed rules fashioned to fit Vatican dictates ``would be 
profoundly detrimental to Catholic higher education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protest, in an article by Fathers Edward Molloy of the  
University of Notre Dame and J. Donald Monan of Boston College, was 
to appear today in America magazine, a publication of the Jesuit 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The editor of the magazine said the timing of the article was  
coincidental. The pope arrives in St. Louis on Tuesday for a 
two-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jesuits operate 28 U.S. colleges and universities. Molloy,  
the president of Notre Dame and Monan, the chancellor and former 
president of Boston College, are among the leading figures in 
Catholic higher education. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial college and university rules were written by a  
special committee of U.S. bishops led by Anthony Cardinal 
Bevilacqua of Philadelphia. They received first reading at a 
meeting of the full U.S. hierarchy last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Malloy and Monan contend that the rules would undermine academic  
freedom and institutional autonomy from outside control, essential 
qualities they say Catholic schools have come to share with other 
American campuses as they have risen in prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	The priests are especially alarmed over proposed requirements  
that theology professors receive a ``mandate'' from church 
authorities, take an oath of fidelity upon appointment and 
otherwise show doctrinal and personal integrity in accord with 
church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Those provisions are drawn from the canon law code that Pope  
John Paul promulgated in 1983. But Malloy and Monan state that 
those canons, ``with the full knowledge of the U.S. hierarchy, and 
with good reason, had been lifeless for 25 years'' until they were 
revived by the Bevilacqua committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict originated with a Vatican decree on Catholic higher  
education titled Ex Corde Ecclesiae, which was approved by the pope 
in 1990. Throughout the process, American Catholic educators 
insisted their schools were different from those in some other 
countries due to cultural tradition and secular law. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the U.S. bishops overwhelmingly approved a plan to  
implement that document in the United States. But the following 
year the Vatican rejected the plan and directed the Americans to 
tighten up the hierarchy's juridical control over theology 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malloy-Monan article is accompanied by an analysis from  
Father James Conn, a Jesuit and dean and canon law professor at St. 
Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore. Conn criticizes a 
previous editorial in America stating that the proposed rules are 
``well-intentioned but unworkable'' and ``could be disastrous for 
U.S. Catholic higher education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conn says both educators and bishops need to answer ``irksome  
questions'' on precisely who applies what powers before the 
hierarchy discusses the text in detail at a meeting next November.

<HEADLINE> Yashin NAC Donation Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Ottawa Senators star Alexei Yashin wanted the  
National Arts Centre to pay up to $85,000 a year to his parents as 
a condition of his five-year, $1 million donation to the center, 
the NAC said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, the center said the money, to be paid to  
Yashin's parents though Tatiana Entertainment Inc., was part of a 
side deal agreed to by John Cripton, former chief of the arts 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors was not advised of the arrangement, Jean  
Therese Riley, chairwoman of the board, said in the statement. It 
came to light only after Cripton departed -- amid controversy over 
other matters -- in October. 
</P>
<P>
	A review by prominent Ottawa lawyer David Scott concluded the  
agreement was ``illegal, unenforceable and could not possibly be 
honored by the NAC,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments were supposedly to be made to Yashin's parents for  
services rendered. But Scott wrote in his legal opinion that ``it 
is now recognized that the intent was that such payments would not 
be dependent upon the actual delivery of services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No money was ever paid to Yashin's parents.  
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million donation by the Senators' center and captain was  
announced with much fanfare by the arts center a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yashin made only the first annual payment of $200,000. It  
was disclosed this week that he would make no more contributions 
for ``personal reasons.'' His withdrawal from the deal came after 
the NAC told Yashin's lawyer and agent that his parents would not 
be getting any money. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Yashin, who was in Boston  
with the Senators for a game. His agent, Mark Gandler, could not 
immediately be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin refused to speak to reporters after the Senators' 3-1 win  
over the Bruins, but Ottawa coach Jacques Martin defended him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yashin situation is outside of hockey,'' Martin said after  
the game. ``We've ignored it and we will support him in any way. As 
long as we remain focused on every game, it shouldn't affect the 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators president and CEO Roy Mlakar issued a written statement  
earlier on Thursday, reiterating the club's support for Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident Alexi's intentions of supporting the NAC were  
well meaning and well intended,'' Mlakar said in the statement. 
``We have been assured that Alexi will continue the very positive 
vein of supporting the center and other Ottawa-Carleton charities 
as he has in the past.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Motor Earnings Are Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s profit for the fourth  
quarter declined after several one-time charges but its operating 
earnings increased nearly 7 percent, beating Wall Street's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker reported today it earned $1 billion,  
or 84 cents a fully diluted share, in the October-December period, 
down 42 percent from $1.8 billion, or $1.45 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding $631 million in after-tax charges, Ford earned $1.7  
billion, or $1.35 a diluted share, on an operating basis, up from 
$1.6 billion, or $1.27 a share, a year ago. Most of the profits 
came from North American automotive operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.  
earlier this week was for operating earnings of $1.27 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ford shares  
were down $1.62 1/2, or 2.5 percent, to $63.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $37.9 billion, down 5 percent from $40 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's U.S. employees will receive profit-sharing checks  
averaging $6,100 on March 3, a record since Ford began profit 
sharing in 1984. The previous high was $4,400 for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's earnings were reduced by $631 million after taxes, or 51  
cents a share, including $472 million for an aggressive early 
retirement and employee buyout program that reduced the company's 
work force by nearly 9,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Other charges included $86 million to write off the loss related  
to its investment in Korea's bankrupt Kia Motors Corp. Ford sold 
its stake in Kia last month after its failed bid to take over the 
automaker in an auction. Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. won the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also took a $73 million charge for the transfer of its  
Batavia, Ohio, transmission plant to a new joint venture formed by 
Ford and ZF Friedrichshafen AG of Germany to make a new high-tech 
transmission. That deal should be completed during the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Ford earned $22 billion, more than triple the $6.9  
billion it earned in all of 1997. Excluding the $16 billion gain 
from the spin-off of The Associates, a financial subsidiary, and 
other one-time factors, Ford's operating profit was $6.6 billion, 
or $5.30 a diluted share, up 10 percent from $6 billion, or $4.86 a 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's revenue last year totaled $144.4 billion, down 6 percent  
from $153.6 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The transformation of Ford continued to gain momentum in  
1998,'' said Jac Nasser, president and chief executive. ``Our 
quality is the best it has ever been, we improved our operating 
efficiency and our products continue to be well-received by our 
customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ford posted its best retail sales in the United States  
in 20 years in 1998 and all-time U.S. sales records at Ford 
Division and Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's report followed Wednesday's announcement by General  
Motors Corp. that it had record fourth-quarter earnings of $1.8 
billion. Both automakers have achieved gains through rigorous 
cost-cutting and new products, especially trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it reduced costs by $2.2 billion in 1998, adjusted for  
a constant volume and mix of cars and trucks. That was more than 
double its goal of $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford's been doing a better job for a longer time than GM in  
cost-reduction,'' said analyst Maryann Keller of ING Baring Furman 
Selz. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said the fourth quarter was its 11th consecutive period of  
improved operating earnings. As with GM, most of its strength was 
in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time charges, Ford earned $1.4 billion in  
North America, up 4 percent from $1.35 billion a year ago. But 
Ford's earnings from Europe were down 60 percent to $63 million and 
it lost $70 million in South America. Elsewhere overseas, Ford 
earned $42 million, compared with a $99 million loss a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic and market conditions in Brazil continue to be  
difficult,'' Nasser said. Ford expects to improve its results there 
in 1999, but not to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser also said prospects in Europe are looking up with the  
recent introduction of the new subcompact Focus line. The launch of 
the Focus, which reduced production volume, and lower export sales 
contributed to the poorer performance there in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Visteon, Ford's parts subsidiary, said it earned $132 million in  
the fourth quarter, up 175 percent from the $48 million earned in 
the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $4.35 billion, up 1 percent 
from $4.29 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Credit Co., Ford's automotive financing unit, reported a  
fourth-quarter profit of $234 million, up 7 percent from a year 
ago. Excluding charges, earnings totaled $240 million, up 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hertz Corp., Ford's rental vehicle unit, earned $48 million, up  
37 percent from $35 million in the October-December period of 1997. 
Ford's share of that profit was $39 million.
