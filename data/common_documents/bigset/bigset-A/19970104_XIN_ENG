<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Rise 8.4 Pct in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain rose
sharply in December and are now more than 8 percent higher than a
year ago, the Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest mortgage
lender, said today.
</P>
<P>
The building society, which published its final figures for
1996 today, said that house prices rose 1.2 percent in December
compared with the previous month, following a 0.6 percent increase
in November.
</P>
<P>
The average price of a home now stands at 66,800 pounds
(112,900 US dollars), an increase of 5,200 pounds (8,788 dollars)
over January 1996.
</P>
<P>
This took the annual house price rise to 8.4 percent, much
higher than Halifax's prediction of a 7 percent increase for the
whole of 1996. It is the largest annual rise since 1988 when house
prices went up by 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Halifax's figures mirror those of the Nationwide Building
Society, Britain's second largest mortgage lender, which reported
an 8.5 percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The society forecast that house prices on average are likely to
rise by another 7-8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Recent increases in mortgage interest rates and the prospect of
a further small rise in 1997 would prevent the housing market from
overheating this year, Halifax said.

<HEADLINE> Pupils from Chinese Mainland Bring 1,997 Letters to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five pupils from the
primary schools of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou handed
over 1,997 letters to Hong Kong pupils here today.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held here, Guo Xiang, head of the pupil
delegation for delivering the letters to their counterparts in
Hong Kong, said that the 1,997 letters are not just ordinary
letters, noting that they represent sincerity and friendship of
all the pupils from the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 1,997 letters were selected from more than 1
million letters written by the pupils in 70 cities in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, about a dozen organizations in the mainland
and a Hong Kong primary school jointly organized the program with
an aim to celebrate Hong Kong's returning to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
The theme for the letters is "I love China, I love Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
In their letters, the 1,997 pupils narrated the development of
their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
They also informed their Hong Kong counterparts of their
families, schools and their interests.
</P>
<P>
Weng Xinqiao, director of the Education and Science Department
of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said that the letters from
the pupils of the Chinese mainland will promote exchanges and
understanding between the pupils in the mainland and in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
The 25 pupils also give singing and dancing performances for
the Hong Kong pupils at the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Divers Dominate FINA Diving Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Yu Zhuocheng, silver
medalist in the men's three-meter springboard at the Atlanta
Olympiad, won the gold in the same event at the FINA Diving Grand
Prix here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yu, also the 1994 world champion who came second behind
compatriot Xiong Ni in the Atlanta Games, collected a total of
456.66 points, followed by another Chinese Xu Hao with 429.09.
</P>
<P>
China's Gong Ming finished third with 423.30. But Gong had to
hand out the bronze to Russia's Valeri Statsenko since one nation
cannot enter more than two divers in the finals under the rules.
</P>
<P>
Statsenko was fourth with 390.18 points.
</P>
<P>
But another Olympic silver medalist Annika Walter of Germany in
the women's section went different way from Yu.
</P>
<P>
Walter, who took the silver in Atlanta to everyone's surprise,
managed a modest sixth place, coming back from the unbelievable
ninth in the semifinals though.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women displayed dominance throughout, with Wang Rui
claiming the gold with 516.09 points and Hu Wei the silver with
465.54.
</P>
<P>
The bronze went to Kazakhstan's Vygouzova Irina, who scored a
total of 305.19 points.
</P>
<P>
In the men's action, Statsenko led 14 competitors from eight
countries in the semi-final. But Xu gained the lead in the final
with a dive featuring inward two and a half somersault.
</P>
<P>
Yu didn't jump ahead until the fifth round when he scored
the highest 92.40 points with a dive of reverse three and a half
somersault.
</P>
<P>
He anchored the title with a well-executed dive of back inward
three and a half somersault.
</P>
<P>
Walter, a highschool student, said she should have dove
better. "Normally, I don't do like that," she said.
</P>
<P>
But her coach Monika Dietrich attributed her failure to the
lack of practice. "After the Atlanta Olympic Games, she didn't
pratised a lot," Dietrich said. "But she is a promising diver and
will find her form again."

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Officials on Cooperation with HK, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will reform local commercial bank system so as to conform
to international practice after the country resumes the exercise
of its sovereignty over Hong Kong in mid 1997.
</P>
<P>
This represents part of its effort to strengthen cooperation
with Hong Kong and Macao in trade, customs, finance, and tourism
after 1997, according to today's "Nanfang (South China) Daily".
</P>
<P>
Xu Dezhi, director of the provincial committee of foreign
trade and economic cooperation, says that Guangdong will develop
external trade by taking advantage of Hong Kong's status as a
commercial, information, trade and transportation center, while
providing scientific and technological talents for Hong Kong to
develop high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wenjie, director of Guangdong Customs, notes that the
customs of the three places, though operating independently, are
expected to become more cooperative in protecting intellectual
property rights, dealing with smuggling and exchanging information
after mid 1997.
</P>
<P>
The three customs in Guangdong, HK and Macao have been
conferring on unifying and simplifying customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yunxiang, president of Guangdong Branch of the People's
Bank of China (PBC), remarks that the bank and its counterpart in
HK have set up a group to help bridge their payment system.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will introduce in overseas-funded financial agencies
and form a local commercial bank system to make it comply with
international practice, he says.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, "we will establish a system for personnel
exchange and send outstanding staffers for training in Hong Kong,"
he says.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weixiong, director of the provincial tourism bureau, says
that his bureau and its counterparts in Hong Kong and Macao, which
have worked in cooperation on an exploring basis since 1980s, will
join efforts to open a unique tourist route with varied flavors.

<HEADLINE> ADR Market Surging, Trade Volumes at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The market for American
Depositary Receipts continued its decade-long climb as trading
volumes reached record highs for 1996, said Citicorp, a research
group of Citibank of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
ADRs are U.S. securities that represent shares of a non-U.S.
company. They trade in the U.S. financial markets similar to the
way ordinary shares of U.S. companies do and their rise signals
the growing U.S. interest in foreign company investments.
</P>
<P>
The dollar value of ADR shares traded on three major U.S. stock
exchanges soared during 1996, reaching 345 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 26 percent increase over 1995's figure. The
total number of ADR shares traded also increased, jumping to 11
billion, an increase of 10 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Citicorp reported that growing investor appetite for foreign
equities also helped fuel a surge in new issuance of depositary
receipts by companies around the world.
</P>
<P>
ADRs were prominent components of some of the world largest
initial public offerings in 1996, including the privatization of
Germany's Deutsche Telekom, Venezuela's CANTV, Telefonica del
Peru, Russia's Rao Gazprom and State Bank of India.
</P>
<P>
The number of firms choosing to launch new depositary receipt
programs in the United States during 1996 increased 34 percent
over 1995. At year end, 252 companies from 48 countries had
launched new ADR programs. About 130, or 52 percent of these
companies, were from the emerging markets.

<HEADLINE> OAU Considers Formatlion of African Peace-Keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, the
Scretary General of the organization of African Unity (OAU), said
that his organization is considering the idea of creating a
peace-keeping force in the continent.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, the OAU chief said that
creation of an African peace-keeping force may take place in a
few months' time.
</P>
<P>
Salim, a Zanzibari, who has been in Tanzania for Christmas and
new year holiday, said that among the events which took place in
Africa last year, most disturbing and challenging ones are the
political conflicts. At its inception, the force in question
will require each OAU member country to train a number of troops
within its army to make the force ready to be called whenever and
wherever the need arose.
</P>
<P>
He described the U.S. proposal for Africa to have a
peace-keeping force as "positive".
</P>
<P>
But Salim said that OAU will not take in the whole of the U.S.
idea, but will look for practical points putting in mind that the
force can not become a source of problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
He cited lack of resources as contributive to the delay of the
creation of the force.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Increases in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. jumped by 1.9 percent in November, the sharpest advance in
eight months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
But spending on the single-family homes, the most important
part in the U.S. construction market, showed the third straight
decline.
</P>
<P>
The department said that residential, nonresidential and
government spending on construction totaled 592 billion dollars at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate last November, up from 581
billion dollars in October.
</P>
<P>
The increase was also the largest since a 2.3 percent jump in
March of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that government outlays rose by 2.5 percent in
November to a 150.3 billion dollar rate. Among them, spending on
school construction gained by 7.6 percent and spending on streets
and highways went up by 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spending on private, nonresidential buildings rose 1.5 percent
to 152.3 billion dollars, the fourth consecutive gain.
</P>
<P>
Residential spending also gained by 1.2 percent to 247.6
billion dollars. The increase reflected a 5.6 percent jump in
outlays for apartments and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
However, spending on single-family homes, more than 25 percent
of the total, fell by 0.3 percent, the third straight drop.
Some analysts said that it is signaling the continued cooling down
of the U.S. housing market.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S government reported earlier this week that the new
homes sales jumped by 14.2 percent in November and it likely will
spur residential building activity in the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Settlers Agree to Evacuate Mobile Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Jewish settlers, who
set up mobile homes on the hilltop of the Artis Hill in the
West Bank, left the site earlier this morning and agreed
to dismantle the mobile homes and remove them Sunday, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The settlers also said that they would meet with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is in charge of the
settlement issue in the Israeli cabinet, to discuss their
demand.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, seven mobile homes were brought to the
Artis Hill, adjacent to the Jewish settlement of Bet El, and
settlers said they set up the "new neighborhood" in memory of Bet
El residents Eta and Ephraim Tzur, killed by a drive-by shooting
attack several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
People in the mobile homes said they planned to spend the
Sabbath (Saturday) in their new homes in the new community called
"Maoz Tzur."
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly conflicts today between settlers and
activists of the left-wing Meretz Party, who came to the site to
protest against the settlers' actions.
</P>
<P>
The police separated the two groups, and senior Israeli army
and security officials arrived at the scene and demanded the
settlers to evacuate the site.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli oppositions have called on the government
to remove the settlers from the hilltop of Artis Hill, charging
the settlers with attempting to prevent the Hebron negotiations
between Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party member of the Knesset (Israel's parliament) Haggai
Merom said the settlers who set up the mobile homes are trying to
force the Israeli army not to carry out the long-delayed
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meretz Chairman Yossi Sarid has called on Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Mordechai to remove the settlers, who he
accused of breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Peace Now Movement has called the settlers'
actions illegal, saying they may cause the negotiations with the
Palestinians on Hebron to break down all together.
</P>
<P>
Following the death of Eta and Ephraim Tzur, the Bet El
community made a request to Netanyahu to permit the construction
of an additional 1,000 housing units on the Artis hilltop.
</P>
<P>
However, taking into account of rejection from the Palestinians and
the international community, the Israeli government turned down
the request.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Eager to Play Down New Tory Row on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind today strove to play down a new Conservative row on Europe
by insisting that the cabinet be united on its policy over Europe.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, who was commonly
regarded as a pro-European, broke the cabinet ranks Thursday by
calling on Britain to negotiate a new relationship with its
European partners.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports accused Dorrell of jockeying for position
ahead of the post-election Conservative leadership race by
adopting a tough line over Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio today, Rifkind was
quick to deny that Dorrell's call for a shake-up of the European
Union was at odds with government policy and said Dorrell's
intention was simply a restatement of the government policy over
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"He does not see the European Union purely as a free trade area
and it has to be more than a free trade area but never become a
European state," Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
"His position, as far as I am aware, is exactly the same as the
cabinet as a whole," he added.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say that the new row over Europe, a
long-standing time bomb within the Tory party, is expected to
further dampen Conservative prospects of winning the general
election to be held this spring.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Weakens UK Factory Orders in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Companies and factories in
Britain began to feel the effect of the pound's recent strength in
December, with their order books weakening and the manufacturing
sector's recovery slowing down.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers' index of the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply, which tracks the overall health of
industry, fell in December for the first time in six months from
54.2 to 52.5, the sharpest monthly decline seen for over a year.
</P>
<P>
Although the index showed growth for the seventh consecutive
month as any number above 50 indicates expansion, the pace slowed
down, suggesting some of the steam may be going out of the
recovery in a sector that was in a mini-recession until the middle
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the sharp drop of the index was largely due
to sterling's recent appreciation, as the strong pound led to
weaker growth in export markets for the second month running in
December.
</P>
<P>
Companies said that they were becoming increasingly dependent
on domestic consumers to keep their factories busy.
</P>
<P>
However, the effect of weaker export markets was compounded
last month by deliberate destocking by companies to meet year-end
inventory targets, as stocks of components and raw materials
showed their biggest one-month fall in four years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the figures may give Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke ammunition with which to resist a rise in
interest rates at his next monthly meeting with Governor of the
Bank of England Eddie George on January 15.

previous busiest year 1994.
</P>
<P>
The annual average daily volume rose to 661,183 contracts,
representing a nominal average daily value of 159.5 billion pounds
(263.2 billion U.S dollars), according to a statement released

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Students in New York City Lag in Reading, Math </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- In reading and math, students
in New York City schools lag behind those elsewhere in New York
State, according to the first school-by-school report compiled by
the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
The performance measures, compiled for all 4,098 schools in the
state, show that only 30 percent of third graders read at or above
grade level in New York City. Third graders in the city scored 3.4
percentage points behind their counterparts elsewhere on tests
given last spring.
</P>
<P>
The gap grew to six points in sixth grade reading and climbed
to almost 15 percentage points in high school English.
</P>
<P>
Rudy Crew, the New York City school chancellor, said Thursday
that the state findings provide strong new evidence that the
current system has done an inadequate job of preparing children in
the lower grades.
</P>
<P>
The report will be formally presented at a press conference
today as part of a broader effort by the Education Department to
raise standards and hold teachers and principals accountable for
producing results.
</P>
<P>
An analysis by the New York Times today suggested that poverty
is a greater influence on students performance in cities than in
small rural towns. It also showed that higher spending does not
necessarily translate into better performance by students.

<HEADLINE> US Gasoline Inventories Too Low, Says AAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Gasoline and crude oil stocks
in the United States continue to drop as the temperature goes
down, with oil industry inventories falling millions of barrels
below earlier years, according to the American Automobile
Association (AAA).
</P>
<P>
"Gasoline stocks at the refinery level are at 192 million
barrels, down 4 million barrels from a year ago and nearly 25
million barrels below 1994 levels," said William Berman, AAA's
director of energy and environment. "Refiners have dropped their
crude oil stocks below 295 million barrels, hitting their lowest
level since record keeping began in 1971, and nearly 45 million
barrels below 1994 levels," Berman said.
</P>
<P>
AAA pointed out that these inventories are the lowest levels
reached since the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, and combined with a
long and cold winter could cause even higher prices and potential
supply disruptions.
</P>
<P>
AAA's most recent price report in December showed the average
price for self-serve regular was 1.29 U.S. dollars per gallon --
17 cents higher than a year ago and the highest level since 1990.
The average monthly pump price for 1996 was higher than any year
since 1986.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) --A National Board of Higher
Education (NBHE) was launched in Tanzania today to maintain
educational resources and improve the country's statandard of
education.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony at which the board was launched,
Tanzanian Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education,
Jackson Makweta, said that several higher education colleges have
enough experts, but due to the lack of operational funds these
colleges have remained iddle. He named such colleges as Mbegani
in Bagamoyo, Kilombero and Kidatu in the Morogoro region.
</P>
<P>
He said that for many years tutors in higher learning
institutions have been teaching the same syllabus although they
are outdated.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Tanzania has made some steps ahead in
identifying different aspects on higher education, adding that
now Tanzanians can get information on colleges' programs and
courses and its significancy which can be conducted in and
outside the country through the government and privae companies.
</P>
<P>
Makweta named duties of the board as an organ to accredit
institutionals, control higher education programs, co-operate
with abroad institutions and advise the government on higher
learnings.

<HEADLINE> West African States Urged To Fulfill Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- West Africa's sub-regional body
today urged its member states to fulfil their pledges to
contribute additional troops to the peacekeeping mission in
war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Balarabe Balewa, special envoy of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), said the delay in the release of
the promised troops has weakened the capacity of the peacekeeping
force, the ECOMOG, to promote the on-going disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
Under the disarmament program, which began on November 22,
1996, about 60,000 factional fighters are scheduled to lay down
their weapons by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
At the request of ECOMOG Commander Victor Malu, five countries
including Burkina Faso, Ghana, Gambia, Mali and Niger, pledged to
jointly contribute additional 2,249 troops at last August's
ECOWAS summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The troops were meant to be available when the disarmament
process began. But so far none of the countries has released
their troops.
</P>
<P>
Although there is only less than one month to go, only 5,000
of the fighters have been disarmed, because the absence of the
additional troops has weakened the capacity of ECOMOG to perform
the disarmament, said the ECOWAS envoy.
</P>
<P>
The release of the troops will enable the force to create
security zones to speed up the disarmament process which could
end the seven-year old war in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
There are about 12,000 ECOMOG troops currently operating in
Liberia, including some 8,000 from Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> UK Construction Industry Forecast to Grow by 3 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The economic climate in Britain
now is right for construction companies to emerge from years of
recession and the outlook for athe UK's construction industry is
at its brightest for six years.
</P>
<P>
The Building Employers Confederation forecast Thursday that the
industry will grow at an annual rate of between 2 percent and 3
percent over each of the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Paul Shepherd, chairman of the confederation, said in a new
year review of the sector's prospects that recent output and order
figures published by the Department of the Environment showed the
industry was now out of recession.
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging trends were in the private housing market
as the number of homes sold is predicted to increase by 10-15
percent by Halifax and Nationwide, Britain's two largest building
societies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of new private houses started by building
companies was 20 percent higher in the three months to the end of
October than in the same period in 1995, Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
However, Shepherd remained concerned about decreasing
expenditure on construction in the public sector and said that
there were substantial cuts in planned capital spending on
construction projects last year.

LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is to deport on Saturday
68 Zaireans recently rounded up in the latest crackdown operation
on illegal immigrants in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency quoted Immigration Department spokesman
Catherine Poso as saying today that the number of prohibited
immigrants from Zaire was on the increase compared to previous
years.
</P>
<P>
She warned that her department would deal ruthlessly with
people entering the country without documents.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, many Zaireans have arrived in Zambia as
refugees to flee the strife in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of bandits has also entered Zambia from
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
As a result, social security has worsened in Zambia,
particularly in its Copperbelt Province bordering Zaire. The
Zambian authorities concerned are putting strict screening on
Zaireans entering Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects Palestinian Demand for Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today reiterated his objection to the
Palestinian demand for joint police patrol near the Tomb of
Patriarchs in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu repeated the
position that Israeli troops would retain sole security control
over the tomb, a holy shrine for both Jews and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
In the Hebron talks recently, the Palestinian Authority (PA)
is reportedly demanding for the joint patrol in order to protect
the Palestinian worshipers during prayer times. In February
1994, a Jewish settler shot and killed 29 Moslem worshipers in
the holy site.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Palestinian request for setting a date for
further Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank, Netanyahu
said that while he was committed to a date for beginning the next
redeployment, he would not obligate himself to any date for
finishing the process.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it seemed that setting the date for further redeployment
has become the sole stumbling block in clinching the long-delayed
deal on Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is making intensive efforts to
arrange a much-waited Arafat-Netanyahu summit to wrap up the
Hebron deal. He met with Netanyahu this afternoon before heading
for Gaza to meet with Arafat, who he met Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that if the two leaders could not hold
the summit Saturday, then the Hebron process will likely be held
up for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu denied media reports that he had
abandoned the requests on the PA's extradition of suspected
Palestinian murderers. A day earlier, Israeli Justice Minister
Tzahi Hanegbi threatened to vote against the Hebron deal if
Netanyahu bowed to the PA on the issue.
</P>
<P>
With the Hebron agreement approaching, Netanyahu is facing
increasing rebellion within the 17-member cabinet. Seven out of
the 18 ministers have stated that they would not vote for the
Hebron deal when it was brought to the cabinet for approval.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's meeting, the hawkish Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon said that the government should
acknowledge the need to change the Oslo process.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Waiver of Cuba Sanctions Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today suspended for another six months the so-called Helms-Burton
law that would allow Americans to sue foreign companies doing
business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Clinton initially imposed the suspension on July 16, 1996 and
faced a January 16 deadline for either waiving the provision or
extending it.
</P>
<P>
"I've decided to extend for another six months the suspension
of the right to file suit," Clinton said in a statement while on
vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands. "I would expect to continue
suspending the right to file suit so long as America's friends and
allies continue their efforts to promote a transition to democracy
in Cuba," he said.
</P>
<P>
The law, signed by Clinton last March, is mainly to deter
foreign investment in Cuba. It would punish foreigners who do
business on properties seized from Americans after the 1959
revolution in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The provision has been widely condemned by Canada and European
and Latin American countries, which argued that the United States
was trying to impose its anti-Cuba trade sanctions on them. A
number of countries have moved to enact laws to counter
Helms-Burton and filed trade complaints to the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Israel Links up With US Missile Early Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel today linked up with
the U.S. missile early warning satellite system in a move to
beef up its defense against missile threats.
</P>
<P>
The linkage was inaugurated at the Israeli Defense Ministry
in Tel Aviv. The warning system, operated by Israeli Air Forces,
would issue warning when missiles are launched against
Israel. It receives satellite data from the U.S. missile early
warning center based in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Today's move followed the December 12 inauguration of a
direct communications link between outgoing U.S Secretary
of Defense William Perry and his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
The linkage of missile warning system is also the result of
Mordechai's visit to Washington in October last year. The
minister will visit the U.S. again in the spring to discuss
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the U.S. are heightening military cooperation in
order to guard against the increasing missile threats posed by
Israel's neighboring Arab rivals, including Syria, and Iran.
</P>
<P>
For Israel, this is of special importance in light of the
rising tension with its neighboring Arab countries since the
hardline Likud government took power in June.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the closest military ally of Israel, is currently
providing an annual military aid of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars to
Israel and arming it with the most sophisticated weapons to
preserve its military superiority over its Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Admits Some Opposition Election Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government admitted
today that opposition parties had won some municipalities in the
November local elections.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Vienna-based Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic said that with respect to 13 municipalities mentioned
in the report of the OSCE fact-finding mission, the Zajedno won
and already constituted the local organs in the cities of Uzice,
Kragujevac and Zrenjanin.
</P>
<P>
In some other cities, including Pirot, Pancevo and Jagodina,
neither the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia nor the Zajedno won
the majority and the assemblies have not been constituted yet.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that the Zajedno won the majority in nine
municipalities in the capital city of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
However, the election results in Serbia's second largest, Nis,
were still unclear. "When competent authorities establish the
facts, the results of the elections (in Nis) will be known," the
official Tanjug news agency quoted the foreign minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE mission's report said Zajedno had won the vote in all
municipalities whose election results had been annulled by the
Serbian government. The OSCE delegation, headed by Spanish
politician Felipe Gonzalez, paid a two-day visit to Belgrade and
talked with both government and opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
The annulment of the election results has sparked off a series
of protests and demonstrations in Belgrade and throughout Serbia,
thus causing a political crisis in the country. The demonstrations
organized by Zajedno since November 19 have continued till today.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Milutinovic said Gonzalez's call that the will
of the people be respected was precisely his government's
position.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is obvious that all this should be established
within the legal institutions, on the basis of law and regulations
of the Republic of Serbia," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Boss Vows to Restore Peace in Liberia in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, today reiterated its
determination to restore peace in that war-torn country this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We will leave no stone unturned to ensure that peace is
returned to Liberia this year no matter the circumstances," said
ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu in a statement issued
in Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Malu, who is reported to be unhappy with the slow pace of the
voluntary disarmament of Liberia's 60,000 factional
combatants, warned that ECOMOG "will chase and disarm
fighters who might fail to disarm after the January 31 deadline."
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan signed last August in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, the disarmament program shall be completed between
November 22 last year and January 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
"I have the freedom to pursue you to the boundaries of Cote
d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Guinea untill ECOMOG recovers your
weapons" after that date, Malu said.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted one African diplomat as
saying that the disarmament process began "with great enthusiasm,
but it is becoming evident that factional leaders are now
reluctant to disarm."
</P>
<P>
This view, according to the report, is shared by United
Nations officials and ECOMOG authorities as well as the civilian
population of the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Roosevelt Johnson has accused the armed groups
of his rivals of carrying out "cosmetic disarmament and turning
in useless weapons."
</P>
<P>
Although there is less than one month to the end of the
disarmament program, only 5,000 of the fighters have been
disarmed, and most disarmament sites have not collected weapons
for several days.
</P>
<P>
The slow pace of disarmament is partly attributed to the delay
in the release of additional troops to enable ECOMOG to
monitor the exercise effectively, particularly in the hinterland,
according to Balarabe Balewa, special envoy of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to Liberia.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Maintain High Per Capita Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
would maintain its per capita income, which currently stands at
60,000 dihrams (16,393 U.S. dollars) in the next two years,
according to recent study obtained here.
</P>
<P>
The high per capita income would be supported by a projected
economic growth of 3.5 percent in 1997 and 1998, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures of the country's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and its population were published in 1995, when they stood
at 38 billion dollars and 2.3 million respectively.
</P>
<P>
The study also predicted that the country's GDP would reach 44
billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has remained one of the countries with the highest per
capita income over the past decade due to its large oil and gas
exports. Such exports bring the country an average of 13 billion
to 15 billion dollars a yea.

<HEADLINE> Donors to Meet in Brussels over Rebuilding Program in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) --Donor countries and
international agencies will meet next week to review the survey of
their efforts in 1996, decide on their priorities of rebuilding
program in Bosnia for 1997, the World Bank announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The donors' information meeting, to be held on January 9 and 10
in Brussels, will be co-hosted by the European Commission and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will lay the groundwork for a pledging conference
which is expected to take place before the Spring this year.
</P>
<P>
1996 has seen the first peaceful year in Bosnia after
three-and-a-half years of civil war. Of the more than 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars committed to reconstruction during the last 12
months, most of the money has been allocated to specific projects,
such as rebuilding bridges and power plants. In Sarajevo, heat has
been restored to 20,000 apartments in time for Winter and the
airport has re-opened to commercial traffic. Basic services such
as water, electricity and heating have either been restored, or
are in the process of being reconnected in most communities.
Housing repairs are underway.
</P>
<P>
Despite initial achievements, reconstruction needs in the
war-torn country remain vast while economic activity remains at
low levels. Industrial production is still only at 10 to 15
percent of its pre-war level and half of the labor force is
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, some sixty donor countries and international
institutions committed themselves to a 5.1 billion dollar
medium-term Priority Reconstruction Program, and by 1996, nearly a
third of this amount was allocated. Financing the next two years
of reconstruction is estimated at 2.5 billion dollars which would
allow some "catch-up" in donor support to Republika Srpska and
ensure a more balanced regional allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the specific requirements for 1997 are expected at
the up-coming donors information meeting so that they can work out
their individual contributions at the subsequent pledging meeting.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus on Verge of Armed Conflict: Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf
Denktas warned in Nicosia today that the present situation in
Cyprus could lead to an armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Speaking live on Turkish radio, Denktas said that the
relations between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots were so tense
that the slightest incident could trigger a clash.
</P>
<P>
"There is a fire burning in Cyprus. We should not pour petrol
over it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denktas also criticized the European Union (EU) for choosing
Greek Cyprus as a candidate for accession to the EU, saying it is
an ignorance of the Turkish Cypriots' rights stipulated in the
1960 agreements.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United Nations, Europe and the United States
to adopt a fair attitude in dealing with the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel today told a visiting
delegation of northern Cyprus in Ankara that his country was
determined to protect Turkish Cypriots on the island.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the purchase of offensive arms by Greek Cypriots
would only make the situation more complicated, warning that the
Turkish government would not allow any developments which would
threat the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cyprus is reportedly close to concluding a deal to buy
surface-to-air missiles from Russia to boost its air defense.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony for the signing of an economic
cooperation protocol between Turkey and northern Cyprus here,
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said that Turkey always
supports northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller said: "The armament of southern Cyprus does not make us
worry because we are powerful enough to protect northern
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed on the Mediterranean island and took
control of its northern third following an abortive coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the only country that has recognized northern
Cyprus which declared itself as "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Overcrowding Remains Unsolved in Schools Across </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Overcrowding has remained
unsolved in schools across the New York City, leading the City
Administration to order the Board of Education to correct the
problem by February 1, the start of the second semester.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the New York Times today, the City
Board of Education has been ordered to reduce the crowding in
1,500 classrooms in 42 schools in the city, rulings which are
considered the strongest impetus for change.
</P>
<P>
The situation is so dire in some schools that classes have been
removed into teachers' cafeteria, locker rooms, gymnasiums and
even into oversize supply closets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rulings, in response to complaints filed by the teachers
union in September, reflect the school system's worst overcrowding
in decades, with nearly 10 percent more students than schools can
accommodate.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 cases are part of a record flood of complaints filed
by the teachers union last year. The union filed 16,910 complaints
of overcrowding in September last year. Of those, 8,000 were
solved at the superintendent level. About 3,900 cases went to the
level of the chancellor. Of the 5,000 cases taken to arbitrators,
1,500 were ordered to be corrected by next semester.

<HEADLINE> Largest Icefish Farm In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Tanggu Huanggang Icefish
Farm in China's coastal city of Tianjin has become the country's
top icefish farm out of 14 breeding centers thanks to improved
breeding techniques.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, some 60 technicians in the farm have been engaged
in the artificial breeding of icefish, a small translucent food
fish which usually lives where rivers meet the sea that is
good-tasting and nutritious, and recently produced 230 million
icefish through artificial fertilization.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 million ova have been sold to northeast China's
Jilin Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Their export price went as high as more than 10,000
U.S. dollars per ton, however, because of industrial pollution in
Haihe River that runs through Tianjin City, where their numbers
were greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Honggui, head of the Tanggu farm said that icefish die
within a few minutes of being removed from water and can survive
for only a few hours at temperatures below zero centigrade. The
survival rate of transplants to other areas is about 50 percent
and they are rather costly, while the artificial fertilization
allows for a survival rate of over 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The best season for artificial fertilization in Tanggu is from
mid-December to mid-January, Zhang said. In most other Chinese
icefish farms, people usually put grown-up male and female icefish
in special ponds for breeding, and the fertilization rate is low,
he said.

<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' coconut industry
is expected to bounce back in 1997 with production projected to
rise to 2.7 million tons compared with last year's 2.2 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's coconut output in 1995 was three million tons.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) administrator Virgilio David
told a press conference today that the steep drop in production
last year was due mainly to typhoons that hit major coconut
producing regions in Luzon and the Visayas in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way to increase production to four million tons
by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israel Calls on Syria to Pursue Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today called on Syria to pursue peace with
Israel to end the current state of war.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai issued the call in an interview with the Arabic
service of the state-run Israel Radio. He urged Syria to resume
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The call followed the exchange of accusations between the two
neighbors over Tuesday's bus bombing in Damascus, which killed 12
people and wounded 44 others.
</P>
<P>
Syria blamed Israel for plotting the terrorist attack, terming
it as a result of escalating threats by Israeli officials recently.
</P>
<P>
But Israel vehemently denied any involvement in the bombing,
denouncing Damascus' accusation as "sheer nonsense." Echoing
Israel's statement, the U.S. government also ruled out any
Israeli relation to the incident.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been rising between Israel and Syria since
Israel's hardline Likud government took power in last June,
fuelling fears of a possible war.
</P>
<P>
Syria has rejected repeated calls from Israel for resuming
peace talks stalled since early last year, saying it would only
do so before the Israeli government agreed to return the occupied
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel took over the Golan Heights in the 1967 War, and
extended its self-claimed sovereignty over the strategic plateau
in 1981. The Likud government has vowed never to relinquish its
control over the Golan Heights, which is the crucial sources of
water for Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The newly-launched State
Quarantine Bureau has approved establishment of its Chengdu
branch, as part of its effort to implement the Law on Quarantining
Border-Crossing Animals and Plants, that goes into effect
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The branch in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, will be held responsible for quarantine of plants and
animals, as well as their products, which are imported to or
exported from Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
A major cereals-production base of the country, Sichuan boasts
abundant plant and animal resources. A dramatic economic boost has
kept agencies in charge of animal and plant quarantine busy in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 shipments of livestock and plants and their
products are quarantined by seven major ports of entries and exits
in Sichuan province each year.
</P>
<P>
The State Quarantine Bureau, which was established recently
according to the new law, is to conduct unified management over
the inspections and checks against the animals and plants crossing
China's borders.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Paralyzes Most of France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Many parts of France are looking
more like the Antarctic as sub-zero temperatures, heavy snowfalls
and icy rains have plagued the country for days.
</P>
<P>
And weather forecasters predict there's more to come as a new
cold wave from Siberia hits France next week.
</P>
<P>
The weather has brought traffic chaos to central, southern and
western regions of the country, paralyzing road and rail links and
causing death and injury.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and two hurt early today in a car
crash in icy rain on a highway near Grenoble, southeastern France,
the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 cars were trapped in snow and ice on Friday night
and early today in the west coast department of Charente
Maritime. Drivers were rescued and taken to shelters including
military barracks, schools and gymnasiums.
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern city of Bordeaux, several thousand train
passengers were stranded in railway stations early today for
several hours because of rail track disruptions caused by snow and
icy rain.
</P>
<P>
Roads between Bordeaux and Paris were impassable for some 200
kilometers overnight.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the situation was particularly treacherous in the
southwest Pays de Loire, in Normandy and in Vendee, where
thousands of people caught in the snow took shelter in rescue
centers.
</P>
<P>
The traffic information services said the highways linking the
cities of Nantes and Bordeaux, between Paris and Tours, and
between Paris and Mans were also paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, service was gradually resumed today for the
high-speed TGV trains on the lines between Paris and Marseille and
between Marseille and Nice, although the state railway company
SNCF said that passengers should check departures in advance.
</P>
<P>
Access to several skiing resorts in the department of
Hautes-Pyrenees in southern France was closed after warnings of
possible avalanches due to heavy snowfalls.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers, Red Cross workers, police, firemen and employees of
the highway administration struggled all night to dig some 5,000
cars out of a two-day standstill around the southeastern city of
Montelimar.
</P>
<P>
Officials said conditions on roads in the southeast were
beginning to normalize early today.
</P>
<P>
The SNCF said it was optimistic that traffic would soon be
normalized in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country,
but was pessimistic about the situation in the western part.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Makes Regulations to Promote Cooperation with Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A regulation on donations from
Taiwan compatriots, the first of its kind in China, took effect on
January 1 this year in Fujian Province, which is closest to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Song Jun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
provincial people's congress, says that Fujian plans to increase
social and economic co-operation with Taiwan by improving
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Song noted that the provincial people's congress and the
provincial government place great importance on the legislative
work and began working on it as early as July 1989, and since
then, a series of regulations on registering enterprises funded by
Taiwan compatriots, the berthing of boats from Taiwan, and the
protecting of Taiwan investment have been studied and approved by the
Standing Committee of the provincial people's congress.
</P>
<P>
Song praised the local regulations for playing an important
role in economic exchanges between Taiwan and Fujian, and noted
that the Standing Committee of the provincial people's congress is
scheduled to review a regulation about Taiwan students who wish
to study in Fujian in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Political consultative Group Calls for More Taiwanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal People's
Political Consultative Conference has issued a report urging more
investment from Taiwan for China's capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the first Taiwan-funded firm in
Beijing was set up in 1981, and there were 14 in 1987, which were
small in scale and registered in countries or regions other than
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese investment began to soar in 1990, and by 1993, the
number of companies was 495, and by 1994, there were 57 with more
than ten million US dollars in investment each.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the third quarter of 1996, there were 1,450 in
Beijing, involving 1.8 billion US dollars worth of contracted
investment, mainly in electronics, clothing, food, petrochemicals,
and machine-building.
</P>
<P>
Still, these companies involve an investment of only 810,000 US
dollars each on average, the report noted, and they are scattered
about and pursue short-term profits. It suggested that the
government place equal emphasis on all Taiwan-funded enterprises,
big or small, and give priority to some major hi-tech enterprises
in line with the city's industrial policy.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government was also urged to cut red tapes and
provide better and more efficient services, and to set up a
special office to administer investment from Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Upright Human In China Existed Two Million Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A human-like creature that
roamed the Wushan Mountains in the Three Gorges area some two
million years ago has been identified as China's earliest human
ancestor that walked upright.
</P>
<P>
Since they separated from gorillas and monkeys, human's
ancestors evolved from homo habilis to homo erectus to homo
sapiens, or modern man.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of Wushan Man marks a break from the traditional
view that the oldest homo erectus in China went back no earlier
than the 1.15 million-year-old Lantian Man found in northwest
China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
It was also thought that homo erectus in Asia, including
Lantian Man, was the offspring of two-million-year-old family
members from eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
This view was not strongly challenged until Chinese scientists
unearthed a human's tooth and a lower jaw bone with two teeth in a
cave in the Wushan Mountains in southwest China's Sichuan Province
in the late 1980s, where they also found human footprints, stone
ware, and fossils of 116 kind other mammals.
</P>
<P>
After years of study, experts identified the owner of the tooth
and lower jaw bone as a member of homo erectus. When the findings
were published in the British journal Nature it aroused great
interest among international paleontologists and was regarded as a
shake-up in the theory of human evolution.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Sell 68 Million Dollar Goods to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will get 68 million
U.S. dollars worth of vegetable shortening and soap from Egypt
soon under a deal signed in Baghdad, according to sources
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The multi-million contract, signed this morning between
Egyptian Company for Food Industries and the Iraqi General
Company for Foodstuff Trade, is the first deal Iraq struck with
an Egyptian food company since resuming oil exports, the Egyptian
MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the two countries had concluded a
one-million-dollar contract that allows Iraq to buy
tranquilizers, antibiotics and pain killers from Egypt starting
this month.
</P>
<P>
So far, 29 countries and districts have offered to sell food
and medicine to Iraq suffering from six years of international
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq has struck 13 contracts with about 20
companies for exporting oil under the UN arrangement, which
allows Iraq to export 2 billion dollars of oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will use 1.2 billion dollars to purchase food, medicine
and other daily necessities, which is much less than the 8
billion dollars it used to buy food and medicine every year
before the UN sanctions imposed after its invasion upon Kuwait in
1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 polluting enterprises in
Benbu City, in east China's Anhui Province have been shut down by
local authorities in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Five major enterprises in the city that discharge pollutants
into the Huaihe River, the longest river in Anhui, have also been
ordered to take effective and down-to-earth measures to cope with
their pollution.
</P>
<P>
The city, located on the middle reaches of the River,
discharges 115 cubic m of waste water into the river annually,
accounting for about 3.2 percent of the total in the river area.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to accelerate the pace for pollution control,
local authorities tracked 11 major pollutants and set up a data
bank about the pollution. After the closure of 13 polluting
enterprises in 1994 and 1995, local authorities shut down 53
similar enterprises last year.
</P>
<P>
Progress has also been made in the control of COD discharge. An
eighty million-yuan project, being under construction, is expected
to reduce the city's COD discharge by 24.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan for environmental protection worked out by
the municipal government in the next five years, Benbu is expected
to collect some one billion yuan for treating 40 major water
pollution projects. The city's pollution will be eradicated on the
whole after the projects are completed and become operational.

The bombing, which took place in the Syrian capital Tuesday,
killed 12 people and wounded dozens of others. Damascus alleged
that Israel was behind the blast.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Israel condemned the explosion and affirmed anew
that it was not involved. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said
the allegation was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
Amid worldwide condemnations, the United States has challenged
Syria to submit "tangible evidence" for its allegation.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian daily said that recent threats by Israel had proved
that the Jewish state perpetrated the criminal act. However, it
failed to provide details.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's involvement in the crime does not need a lot of
evidence to be proved," it added.
</P>
<P>
It fell in the context of the Israeli campaign to separate the
Syrian track of peace talks from the Lebanese one in order to
force Beirut to give in, the daily asserted.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. State Department Spokesman NIcholas
Burns said Friday that if the Syrian government, not
the press, affirms such an accusation, Washington awaits it to
submit evidence.
</P>
<P>
Following his statement, Syrian ambassador in Washington Walid
Al-Moalem has expressed anger at the U.S. attitude, calling it
"iresponsible."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian newspaper echoed that if the crime goes unpunished
more of such terrorist acts would happen.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist acts will fail to move Syria one inch from its
clear position and policy, it said.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has refused to resume its peace talks with Israel
unless the latter commits itself to returning the Golan Heights to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two sides suspended their negotiations last March following
a wave of suicide bombings inside Israel. After four years of
on-off bargaining, the two neighbors failed to find a solution to
their long-standing dispute over the 1180-square- kilometer-Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the strategic heights in 1967 and annexed it 14
years later. The previous Labor government offered to exchange the
golan for normalization of relations, but the present Likud-led
government refuses to stick to the point.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week mixed with
CPO and rubber higher and tin lower.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market ended the week higher on weekend short
covering activities following rumors that Indonesia may ban the
export of palm oil for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment was also very strong throughout the week as low
production due to heavy rain was expected to prevail from now till
February and this boosted prices, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The market, which was closed on Wednesday for the New Year, was
also aided by the high December export figures released by two
cargo surveyors -- Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) and
Caleb Bret.
</P>
<P>
SGS released an export figure of 717,000 tons for December
compared with 700,000 tons for November while Caleb Bret's figure
increased to 702,000 tons from 673,000 tons for its November
figure.
</P>
<P>
January South closed 25 Ringgit (about 10 US dollars) higher at
1,295 Ringgit (about 518 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week lower on
heavy offerings of the metal.
</P>
<P>
At the week's close, the metal fell 19 sen (about 7.6 US cents)
to 14.45 Ringgit (about 5.78 US dollars) per kg compared with last
week's closing of 14.64 Ringgit (about 5.856 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Transactions on the local market for the week were mainly
dominated by the European and local players.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week rose to 377 tons from 310 tons in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM price and that of the London Metal
Exchange narrowed to 55 dollars per ton from 175 dollars per ton
the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market ended the week higher in quiet
trading as players were yet to be back from their holidays.
</P>
<P>
The market was quiet throughout the week and is expected to be
active beginning next Monday when traders come back to the market,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Both International RSS One February and SMR 20 rose a sen each
to 316.00 sen (about 126.4 US cents) per kg and 310.50 sen (about
124.2 US cents) per kg respectively.
</P>
<P>
The market was closed on Wednesday for the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said the shortage of raw materials was expected to
boost rubber prices in the near future, especially as most
players, particularly the Japanese and European were on long
year-end vacation.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for January 2 was 242.16 Malaysia/Singapore
cents per kg against 241.57 cents on December 26.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 241.81 cents per kg versus
241.86 cents per kg previously.

the lead in the first run of the women's World Cup slalom in
Maribor, Slovenia, on Saturday.
</P>

Wiberg, 26, completed Saturday's first run in 53.00 seconds.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Austrian Elfi Eder, winner of last year's World Cup slalom
title, was in third position. Eder, who won three World Cup
slaloms last season, has had a slower start this year with a
fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Wiberg currently sits atop the overall World Cup standings, and
a victory here would put her well ahead of the pack.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches Healthy Lifestyle Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today started a
six-year long Healthy Lifestyle Campaign under different themes
with "Healthy Eating" being this year's theme.
</P>
<P>
Launching this year's Healthy Lifestyle Campaign here today,
Malaysian Health Minister Chua Jui Meng signed the "Healthy
Eating" Declaration to guide the public on what to eat to stay
healthy with a pyramid symbol.
</P>
<P>
In the pyramid, the public is advised to eat most cereals,
especially whole grain, cereal products and tubers, followed by
fruits and vegetables, and then milk, dairy products, meat and
finally sugar, fat and oil.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Department will set up a Nutritious Resource
Center for the convenience of cooks, food caterers and canteen
operators who could seek expert advice on preparing nutritious
meals for their patrons, Chua told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The center would also offer courses on preparing healthy and
more nutritious dishes.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a book entitled "Healthy Recipe, Wise Choice"
produced by food experts would be published next month.
</P>
<P>
The book contained traditional recipes which had been modified
to include healthy food without harming the taste and appearance
of the dish, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that next year's campaign would have the
theme "Exercise and Fitness," and "Safety (House, Workplace and
the Roads)" for 1999, "Family Health" for 2000, "Mental Health"
for 2001 and "Environmental Health" for 2002.
</P>
<P>
To implement the campaign, the government has approved a total
of 63.6 million Ringgit (about 25.44 million US dollars),
according to Chua.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies, non-governmental organizations,
universities and the private sector, particularly the food
industry, have been urged to help ensure the success of the
campaign.

<P>
TOKYO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- World champion Michelle Kwan of
the United States beat a world class field to take the lead after
Saturday's short program at the Honda Prelude Cup figure skating
event.
</P>
<P>
Russian amateur Ilia Kulik landed all three of his jumps
cleanly and also outshone the professionals in the men's
competition.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, 16, performed a near-perfect program to outclass many big
names.
</P>
<P>
Russian Irina Slutskaya placed second, followed by Japan's Yuka
Sato, who turned professional after winning the 1994 world
championship.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bonaly of France came in fourth place, while two-time
Olympic champion Katarina Witt of Germany fell on a triple toe
loop in her planned combination and placed fifth.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, world champion Todd Eldredge of the
United States made errors in the action and only finished fourth,
falling behind Kulik, Takeshi Honda of Japan and Philippe
Candeloro of France.
</P>
<P>
Two professionals competing, Brian Orser of Canada and Jozef
Sabovcik of Slovakia, placed fifth and sixth respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the pairs, last year's world championship pair of Russians
Marina Eltsova and Andrey Bushkov ranked first over Jenni Memo and
Todd Sand and their U.S. compatriots Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen.

Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France, another amateur pair.

<HEADLINE> Kohl to Meet Yeltsin Over European Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
arrived here today to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin for
talks on European security issues, Kremlin officials said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl will be the first Western leader to meet Yeltsin since the
Russian President's heart operation last November.
</P>
<P>
They will meet for three to four hours at Yeltsin's Rus
residence at Zavidovo park 100 kilometers west of Moscow, where
Yeltsin arrived on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss the new structure of European
security and the eastward expansion of NATO, which Russia strongly
opposes.
</P>
<P>
NATO has invited several Central and East European states to
its summit in Madrid, Spain, on July 8, to start negotiations on
their admission to the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
But Russia wants to see the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe not NATO as the main player in building
a new security structure in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kohl met three times in 1996 and have maintained
regular personal and telephone contact.
</P>
<P>
Kohl was the first Western leader to offer assistance of
cardiologists when Yeltsin's heart problem worsened.

NEW DELHI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- India is to launch its new
communication satellite, INSAT-2D, in April this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cairo Book Fair Tries to Feast Mind and Eye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Prominent Arab folk artists and
poets will grace the annual Cairo International Book Fair to be
opened on January 18.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the two-week book fair will have a glimpse
of the cultural and folk art from seven Arab countries, Oman,
Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Palestine at a series
of special soirees given by participants.
</P>
<P>
It could also become a rare meeting place for prominent Arab
poets who have been invited to recite their latest poems to the
visitors at the book fair.
</P>
<P>
Three decades ago, Cairo originated the book fair in a bid to
present local people with the latest Egyptian and foreign books,
encyclopedias, dictionaries and reference books at moderate
prices.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the fair has grown into the second largest and
most important in the world, with many publishing houses
competing to get a pavilion at the fair.
</P>
<P>
About 2,400 publishers from 80 countries will display 4
million books in 27 pavilions, according to the Egyptian General
Book Organization, the organizing authority. For the first time,
Holland, Albania and Qatar will take part.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the varieties of intellectual fodder, seminars and
cultural events held on the sidelines
will add more flavors to the annual fair, drawing a stellar
cluster of Egyptian intellectuals and Arab thinkers to heated
discussions about thorny issues facing the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee this year's fair a success, the organizer has
formed an organizing committee to shape the outlines of the
cultural program.
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting, the committee said the majority of
seminars and discussions will be centered on future prospects of
Egypt, the Arab world and the international arena on the
threshold of the 21st century.

<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts predicted that
the amount of direct foreign investment in China this year is
expected to be 15 percent more than the 1996 figure, "Economic
Information News" reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of investment in central and western region of the
country will continue to rise with many overseas investors
planning to put additional investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland will
give an impetus to the flow of overseas funds to the Chinese
mainland from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The scale of many foreign-funded enterprises are expected to be
expanded, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in real estate will be increased, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures provided by the State Statistical Bureau
showed that a total of 48 billion US dollars worth of foreign
capital were actually used in 1996, with 40 billion in direct
foreign investment, up by seven percent over the previous year.

HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The HSBC (Hong Kong Shanghai
Banking Corporation Limited) Bond Index increased in December to
121.83, a 0.37 percent rise from November, according to the latest
release by HSBC Markets.
</P>
<P>
The sub-index for Hong Kong government papers increased by 0.32
percent and for non-Hong Kong government papers by 0.40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the level at the end of December 1995, the
overall index was 6.9 percent higher, while the sub-index for Hong
Kong Government papers increased by 6.6 percent and for non-Hong
Kong Government papers by 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by profit-taking and the squaring of year-end positions,
the US Treasury witnessed consolidation in December. The
30-year-long bond reversed gains made in the previous month and
its yields rose to 6.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the local debt market had a bumpy year as it followed
closely its US counterpart and the direction of Japanese capital
fund flows will likely have a significant impact on the United

The HSBC Markets Hong Kong Bond Index measures the performance

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Bourse: Confusion Over Why, How </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has come
under further pressure to rescue the capital market as the Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell to a 52-month low of 787.47
points in thin trading on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the only two trading days so far this year, the SET
index has fallen a total of 44.10 points.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the first day of trading in 1997, the SET index
ended 28.44 points lower than the previous trading day to close at
803.13. It lost a further 15.66 points on Friday, falling well
bellow the 800-mark for the first time in more than four years.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the SET index has lost about 39 percent of its value
from its close of 1,280.81 points at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently Finance
Minister Amnuay Virawan said the government would not intervene to
shore up the ailing bourse.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said the sharp fall was due to tight liquidity resulting
from the high interbank rate -- the rate banks are charged when
they take out an overnight loan.
</P>
<P>
He said he would discuss lowering interest rates with the
central bank soon, adding that hopefully this will benefit the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, officials of other departments saw the matter
differently and gave different explanations.
</P>
<P>
Siri Ganjarerndee, assistant governor of the Bank of Thailand,
argued that liquidity was not the key reason for the freefall,
which, he said, could be attributed to low earnings of listed
companies and on-going problems in the exchange itself.
</P>
<P>
Several stock brokers said they were waiting for the government
to announce concrete economic measures, which should include the
precise size of the budget cut and the implementation of a tight
fiscal policy to accommodate the easing of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, analysts say that as the country's economic
problems continue there is a possibility for investors to further
offload shares, which would further damage the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Others blamed the adverse impact of foreign share markets.
</P>
<P>
Since Thursday night, Amnuay's key advisers have held urgent
meetings separately with officials of the board of the Stock
Exchange of Thailand, the central bank and the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), in a bid to stem the share market
plunge.
</P>
<P>
The three institutions were asked to explain the current
condition of the market and to urgently implement measures under
the Finance Ministry's action plan, in a hope that these measures
will help to revive the stock market.
</P>
<P>
These institutions were given three months to complete their
individual action plans.

<P>
However, when the exact reasons for the SET's freefall have not
been pinpointed and each financial institution offers different
explanations and says it itself is not to blame, remedies are hard
to find and no one is sure what to do to stop the slide.
</P>
<P>
Although the three key financial institutions have been given
deadlines to take action, analysts are not sure for how long the
share market can hold on before a bottom-out.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) ended the week higher.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index ended 1996 at the year's high but it was
the second board that dominated the beginning of the new year.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index closed the week 22.45 points higher at
1,231.45 despite profit-taking that occurred in the first two days
of trading this year.
</P>
<P>
The all main board share Emas Index rose 5.88 points to 346.50
and the Industrial Index gained 39.29 points to 2,353.04.
</P>
<P>
The Second Board Index, which was strongly bullish last year,
soared 29.12 points to 592.83.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied to 1,237.96 on the New Year's Eve on what
dealers described as "window dressing" but the gains were quickly
erased as the market re-opened for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Investors then re-focused their interest on small capitalized
stocks of the second board and selective main board stocks which
were not affected before the sudden New Year rally.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said this week's market volume was thin as most fund
managers were still away on their holidays while some were
sidelined on lack of new incentives.
</P>
<P>
They are eagerly awaiting for next week, which was anticipated
to go on upward bias as fund managers were expected to make
serious commitment in the market.
</P>
<P>
They expected the Composite Index to improve on the back of
expectations of favorable economic performance for the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more new and encouraging corporate announcements to
be revealed next week were expected to boost the market's
activities, especially in the finance sector.
</P>
<P>
The main board ready turnover for the week increased to 375.071
million shares worth 2.410 billion Ringgit (about 964 million U.S.
dollars from 227.834 million shares valued at 1.385 billion
Ringgit (about 554 million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover was 168.921 million shares worth
1.873 billion Ringgit (about 749.2 million dollars) from 151.730
million shares valued at 1.576 billion Ringgit (about 630.4
million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted to 175.705 million shares worth 1.192
billion Ringgit (about 476.8 million dollars) from 85.227 million
shares valued at 729.034 million Ringgit (about 291.6136 million
dollars) last week.

<HEADLINE> Ghali Meets With Mubarak Upon Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today met with former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali
who returned home late last night, ending a five-year term at
helm of the world body.
</P>
<P>
Prime minister Kamal al-Gazouri will give a reception in
honor of the former UN chief today.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, during his stop in Paris on Friday, said that he was
coming back home to meet Muabrak and Ganzouri to inform them that
he is at Egypt's disposal.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he will never quit politics, the former UN top
official said he needed some time to compile his diary since he
had completed a new book entitled "Agenda For Democracy," which is
about the Egyptian-Israeli peace negotiations and the peace
initiative in November 1977.
</P>
<P>
Ghali's expected 10-year reign was cut in half after his
renomination for a second five-year term was vetoed by the U.S.,
while the other 14 members of the Security Council supported
him. Undersecretary-General Kofi Annan of Ghana replaced him on
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, held the rank of deputy prime minister for foreign
affairs in 1991 after more than 13 years as minister of state for
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
He accompanied the late President Anwar Sadat on his historic
trip to Jerusalem in 1977. He then played a key role at the Camp
David talks that led to the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and
Israel. He became the first secretary-general appointed in the
post-cold war era in 1992.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's 1996 Trade Deficit Exceeds 20 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit last
year amounted to 20.4 billion U.S. dollars, 13 billion dollars
more than the initial estimation of 7 billion dollars and almost
double the 1995 figure of 10.06 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary figures released today by the
International Trade and Industry Ministry, the country's exports
edged up 3.8 percent from 1995 to 129.8 billion dollars in 1996,
while imports soared 11.2 percent to 150.2 billion dollars,
resulting in a yearly trade gap of 20.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exports of semiconductors stagnated at 17.87 billion
dollars last year, a whopping 12.83 billion dollars less than the
initial projection of 30.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aside from semiconductors, other exports items fared better,
posting an overall annual increase of 8.8 percent, higher than the
8.1 percent projected at the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that due to the lackluster activities
in the export sector, imports of capital goods, such as
manufacturing system, increased just 9.3 percent, but those of
consumer goods rose 20.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, South Korea's exports to the United States and Japan
fell by 10 percent and 6.9 percent respectively, while those to
such developing regions as Eastern Europe and Latin America showed
respective increase rates of 56.3 percent and 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official said that South Korea's trade deficit for 1997 is
unlikely to narrow from the 1996 level, citing the dwindling
import demands at South Korea's major markets, like those of the
U.S. and Japan, the country's rising energy demand as well as its
high-cost, low-efficiency industrial structure.

</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Taiwan, which has daily flights to

<HEADLINE> Kohl to Meet Yeltsin Over European Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
arriving here today to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin over
European security issues, Kremlin officials said.
</P>
<P>
They will meet at Yeltsin's Rus residence at the Zavidovo park
100 kilometers west of Moscow, where Yeltsin arrived on Friday
awaiting Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Kohl will fly by helicopter to Zavidovo immediately after his
arrival in Moscow, and the meeting will last for three or four
hours, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss the new architecture of European
security and the eastward expansion of the NATO, which Russia has
been strongly opposing, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
NATO has invited some Central and East European states to the
NATO summit on July 8-9 in Madrid, Spain, to start negotiations on
their admission to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Russia insists on making the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe instead of the NATO a key player in building
security architecture in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kohl met three times in 1996 and have maintained
regular personal and telephone contacts.
</P>
<P>
Kohl was the first Western leader to offer assistance of
cardiologists when Yeltsin's heart problem exacerbated. Kohl
stopped off in Moscow on November 2 to wish Yeltsin successful
recovery from the cardiac operation he was then facing.
</P>
<P>
A week after the operation, on November 12, Yeltsin had a
telephone conversation with Kohl to thank him for sympathy and
backing and for pre-operative consultations of German experts.
</P>
<P>
It is stressed here that Kohl will be the first of the Western
leaders to meet Yeltsin after the operation. The only foreign
leader to meet Yeltsin earlier was Chinese Premier Li Peng, who
paid a two-day working visit to Moscow in late December.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq Busy on Renewing Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Senior Jordanian and Iraqi
officials aided by technical experts are now busy working on
details of renewing an oil agreement between the two countries,
Information Minister Marwan Muasher said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, under which Iraq is expected to increase by 7
percent its oil supplies to Jordan, will be signed when Minister
of Industry and Trade Ali Abul Ragheb visits Baghdad, probably
in this week, Muasher said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Hashem Dabbas and
Minister of Finance Marwan Awad returned home late Thursday
after four days of talks in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there was any problem in renewing the
agreement, Muasher said, "not as far as I know," adding that
"certain technical details" remained to be sorted out in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Technical experts from the two sides are working on the
details," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other officials said Abul Ragheb, accompanied by Minister of
Transport Nasser Lawzi, is scheduled to visit Baghdad for a
meeting of the Joint Jordanian-Iraqi Economic Commission on
January 6.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Jordan and Iraq are also expected to renew
their annual trade protocol, which is tied with the oil
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed agreement, Iraq will provide Jordan 4.5
million tonnes of crude oil and oil products in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the gulf war, Iraq has been meeting Jordan's
oil needs by trucking 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil
and 20,000 to 25,000 bpd of fuel oil to the country's only
refinery at Zarqa.
</P>
<P>
But Baghdad now owes Jordan 1.3 billion U.S. dollars,
representing debts accumulated in the 1980s as well as the
unsettled payment of part of the Jordanian exports to Iraq,
Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Jordan, citing the mounting Iraqi debts, cut the
annual trade protocol by about half to 220 million
dollars. Officials here have said that the amount is unlikely to
be increased in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Issues related to the outstanding Iraqi debts to Jordan and
replacement of the present trucking system to pump Iraqi oil to
Zarqa by the 500-kilometer pipeline are also expected to be
discussed during the talks of Dabbas and Awad with Baghdad
officials.

Since the end of the gulf war, Iraq has been meeting Jordan's
oil needs by trucking 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil
and 20,000 to 25,000 bpd of fuel oil to the country's only
refinery at Zarqa.
</P>
<P>
But Baghdad now owes Jordan 1.3 billion U.S. dollars,
representing debts accumulated in the 1980s as well as the
unsettled payment of part of the Jordanian exports to Iraq,
Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Jordan, citing the mounting Iraqi debts, cut the
annual trade protocol by about half to 220 million
dollars. Officials here have said that the amount is unlikely to
be increased in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Issues related to the outstanding Iraqi debts to Jordan and
replacement of the present trucking system to pump Iraqi oil to
Zarqa by the 500-kilometer pipeline are also expected to be
discussed during the talks of Dabbas and Awad with Baghdad
officials.

<HEADLINE> Diesel, Kerosene Price Hike Inevitable: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Petroleum Ministry officials
are reported to have told the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) that
an increase in the prices of petroleum products is inevitable if
the ballooning oil pool account deficit is to be checked.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil pool account deficit has crossed 100,000
million rupees ( 2816.90 million us dollars), the Petroleum
Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Ministry officials are said to have told an
emergency meeting convened by the PMO that in case the oil pool
account deficit is allowed to go unchecked, it would be difficult
for oil companies to muster resources for continuing their
operations.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Ministry is said to be in favor of raising the
prices of both kerosene and diesel which have so far been kept
highly subsidized.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of the low price of kerosene are not reaching the
poorer sections and that subsidized kerosene is being increasingly
used for adulterating diesel, Petroleum Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Prime Minister's Office is said to be in full
agreement with the Petroleum Ministry on lifting the price of
petroleum, some constituents of the 13-party united front
government are opposed to a second hike in six months.

<HEADLINE> India's GDP Growth Likely to Increase 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite a slowdown in
industrial production and a lull in investment activity, India's
gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 6 percent
against a target of 6.5 percent for 1996-97, experts said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that this year's growth will be led by
agricultural production which would jump to 4 percent or more from
2.4 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
While industrial growth largely paved the way for surpassing
the target of 6.5 percent in 1995-96, this year the farm sector
will take the lead, said economist Ashok Gulati of the National
Council for Applied Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Ministry officials said that the outlook for food
grain production in 1996-97 is bright and the output is likely to
reach 197 million tons compared with 185 million in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
S.P. Gupta, director of the Indian Council for Research on
International Economic Relations said, "The slowing down of
economic reforms and industry will make it difficult to achieve a
GDP growth of over 6 percent."

<HEADLINE> Another Moderate Snow in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijingers woke up to see a new
scene this morning: snowflakes coming down and rested on trees,
roads and buildings, with the city wrapped in white mist.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Center
said that almost every part of Beijing and its suburban areas
began to see the snowfall at the small hours of the day and it has
become moderate snow this afternoon, with snowfall in some parts
of Beijing equivalent to three millimeters of rain.
</P>
<P>
For Beijingers, the snowfall is the second of this winter and
the largest in recent years, noted the official.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the meeting of transient cold weather and
warm and damp air mass, which is comparatively active this winter,
has brought about the two snowfalls, which are bound to bring down
the temperature in the Beijing area.
</P>
<P>
Countless Beijingers, who enjoy two days off, swarmed into the
city's gardens and tourist sites, taking pictures and their kids
piling up snowman.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the city's traffic said that, despite
the comparatively heavy snowfall, the capital's three expressways
are not closed, with more policemen posted on the major
intersections of the city.
</P>
<P>
Another city official said that a large number of Beijingers
began to clean snow off the streets voluntarily this morning when
the snowfall was rampant, and more are expected to join the work
when the snowfall gradually comes to a halt later today.

<HEADLINE>   Palestinian Officials: No Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- After two weeks of
expectation that an agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment
in Hebron was about to be signed, Palestinian officials now said
that they do not think a Hebron deal is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior Palestinian official as saying
that essential differences between Israel and the Palestinians
remained to be solved.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, PNA planning and international cooperation
minister said Friday night that the major dispute holding up a
deal was Israel's refusal to commit a time-table for further
withdrawal of its troops from the West Bank, in accordance with
the Agreement signed between them previously.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, for the last two
weeks, had been saying that agreement of the Hebron redeployment
was around the corner, but now it appears that it is not going to
be reached as expected.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Israel has blamed the Palestinians for holding
off reaching an agreement, saying the accord could have been
signed long ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that Egypt, who wanted to show that an
accord could not be made between Israel and the Palestinians
without its mediation, was also behind the delay.
</P>
<P>
US special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross, who has been
intensively shuttling between the Israelis and the Palestinians
for the last two weeks, is due to hold another round of talks
with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat in Gaza tonight.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who had brokered a summit meeting between Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Arafat last month, also met with
Netanyahu and Arafat respectively Friday.
</P>
<P>
The US State Department said that Ross will continue his
Middle East mission on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
Following Friday night's meeting between Ross and Arafat,
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that
there is still no deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He rejected suggestions that the Palestinians were to blame
for the failure to conclude the Hebron deal, saying that it took
two to tangle, and that he would not blame Israel or the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nabil Sha'ath, PNA planning and international
cooperation minister, has accused the US of bias in Israel's
favor during its mediations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after PNA weekly cabinet meeting Friday night,
Sha'ath said the US often displays a similar position to Israel,
which, he said, makes reaching agreement more difficult.

<HEADLINE> UN Helps Jordan Modernize Income Tax Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has recently pledged 216,000 U.S. dollars in
aid to the Income Tax Department of Jordan to help modernize
its functions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordanian government will contribute 530,000
dollars to the project to help the department raise work
efficiency, upgrade employee training and streamline departmental
operations and services, the local daily Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP grant will also finance and upgrade the
department's computer system.
</P>
<P>
Including this batch of grant, the UNDP has allocated a
total of 419,000 dollars in 1996 for various development
projects in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the UNDP announced that it would provide the
Queen Alia Fund for Social Development with 103,000 dollars
for projects dedicated to alleviating poverty and an additional
100,000 dollars to finance such projects in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995 World Summit on Social Development in
Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, the UNDP declared that
poverty eradication was its main objective.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agencies in Jordan estimated that about 15 percent
of the country's families live under the poverty line,
which indicates that the income tax system needs an urgent
adjustment.

<HEADLINE> Repatriation of Vietnamese Refugees Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of the last
batch of some 280 Vietnamese boat people in Thailand has been
delayed due to Vietnam's rigorous screening and the United States'
reluctance to accept more of them, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Many of these boat people have to remain at Sikhiu camp in
Nakhon Ratchasima province until the Vietnamese authorities
recognize them as bona fide Vietnamese eligible for repatriation,
the Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese authorities believe that 90 of these boat people
are not Vietnamese nationals, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 140 of the boat people who have been cleared
for repatriation to Vietnam wish to resettle in the United States,
but the U.S. authorities would accept no more than 16 recognized
as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Those Vietnamese boat people still in Thailand are expected to
be repatriated as soon as possible, the newspaper quoted UNHCR
representatives in Hanoi as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Maritime Safety Agency is
trying to contain the spread of oil leaked from a
Russian-registered tanker which sank in the Sea of Japan on
Thursday, reported Kyodo news service today.
</P>
<P>
The agency believed that about 3,700 tons of oil have leaked
from the tanker, forming several oil slicks with one of them three
kilometers wide and 53 kilometers long.

<P>
It is studying measures for collecting the spilt oil which
seems to be drifting toward the Japanese western coast from the
13,157-ton Nakhodka.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, with some 19,000 tons of fuel oil loaded, was
apparently broken into two pieces and sank some 110 kilometers
northeast of the Oki Islands in Shimane Prefecture, western Japan,
said agency officials.
</P>
<P>
The accident could become the second worst oil pollution
following the accident in 1974 when 7,900 tons of oil leaked from
a fuel oil tank at a coastal refinery operated by Mitsubishi Oil
Co. in Okayama Prefecture, western Japan, said officials.
</P>

TEGUCIGALPA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 150 children were
found in 1996 to have cancers in Honduras, where the disease has a

Medical authorities in the Central American country said today

It is deplorable that the costs of cancer treatment are beyond

<HEADLINE> Germany Sees Reduction in Immigration in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of legal immigrants
into Germany was down 40,000 from that of 1995 to reach a total of
over 177,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said all the immigrants are of German
origins, most came from the former Soviet Union and more than
5,400 from East European nations.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials predicted that the number of immigrants
would continue to reduce in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was attributed to the economic slowdown on the
German part that provides less job opportunities, and the failure
to pass language test on the part of would-be immigrants.
</P>
<P>
New immigrants often settle down in underdeveloped areas in
Germany, therefore could experience extra problems in adapting
themselves to the German society, officials said.

BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's two-way trade with
Indochina and Myanmar was valued at 35.76 billion baht (1.4
billion US dollars) during the first nine months of 1996, down 2.1
percent from the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Farmers Research Center, Thailand's trade
with Myanmar and Cambodia in the period fell by 16 percent and 18
percent in value respectively compared with the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's trade value with Laos and Vietnam was up 7.7 percent
and 22.2 percent respectively in the period, but the center
indicated that the growth rates are much lower than those achieved
in the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export value to Indochina and Myanmar during the

dollars), an increase of 13.7 percent from the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The center said that the increase was pushed by strong Thai
exports of chemicals, rubber and plastic products to the region,
although Thai exports of motorcycles, bicycles and parts, fabrics,
iron and steel, and sugar to the region declined.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's imports from the region, which comprises Laos,

ROME, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano said today that investigators were using all resources
to find the perpetrators who assaulted Jewish tombs last week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the repair of the Jewish
cemetery, the minister said that "my presence here represents the

with the utmost seriousness and tenacity to find those responsible
for this brazen defamation and provocation and to make sure these
groups of fanatics cannot strike again."

<P>
He also expressed the hoped that the investigations would have
results soon.

The attackers tore down Star of David images from tombstones,
removed the temporary identification cards from new graves and
hung four swastika symbols on a tomb.
</P>
<P>
Rome's head rabbi Elio Toaff, who also attended this morning's
ceremony, said that he did not rule out a link with the recent
mass held in Rome in support of ex-Nazi captain Erich Priebke, the
mastermind of the Ardeatine Caves massacre in which 335 men and
boys were killed.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Watches Malaysia's Action on Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai security and labor
officials are closely watching Malaysia's planned crackdown on
illegal immigrant workers for fear that the move may lead to an
influx of foreign workers to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is reportedly preparing to deploy 3,000 security
personnel on a nationwide sweep for an estimated 1.2 million
illegal immigrants, following the midnight expiry of a six-month
amnesty on Tuesday, December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Malaysia deported 1,500 illegal Indonesian
immigrants to clear detention camps ahead of an intensive search
for more than a million illegal workers believed to be in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Khachadpai Burutpat, chief of the Thai National Security
Council, said the Malaysian action might drive illegal aliens
across the border into Thailand and complicate Thailand's efforts
to curb the illegal immigrant problem.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has about 700,000 illegal foreign laborers, 85 percent
of whom are from Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the move could also affect an estimated
12,200 Thais who work in Malaysia without work permits. Of these
people, most are natives from provinces along the Thai-Malaysian
border.
</P>
<P>
About 22,800 Thais are working legally in Malaysia, according
to a Thai employment promotion department official.

<HEADLINE> Spain: U.S. Suspension of Helms-Burton Act Insufficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
decision to suspend part of the Helms-Burton Act for another six
months is a temporary move therefore the European Union (EU)
should not lower its guard, Spain's foreign ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for this EU member nation's foreign ministry said
the U.S. government's extension of the waiver is "an encouraging
gesture but insufficient," and the anti-Cuba law remains "a sword
of Damocles hanging over international relations."
</P>
<P>
The Provision III of the law, enacted by U.S. Congress last March
but forced into a six-month suspension by international resistance
since last June, allows Cuban Americans to sue in U.S. federal
courts against companies doing business on their properties
confiscated by the Cuban government after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
Under the law designed to step up isolation against the Cuban
government, the United States imposed sanctions on Canadian mining
firm Sherritt International and Mexican telecommunications company
Grupo Domos last year.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government, which took a leading role in
mobilizing an international coalition against the Helms-Burton
Act, said it is "disappointed" that the U.S. announcement shows
"no progress has been made" as the law remains a threat to
business.

<HEADLINE> Canada Disappointed With U.S. Decision on Anti-Cuba Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said
today it is disappointed with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
decision to suspend part of the Helms-Burton Act for another six
months rather than repeal the law completely.
</P>
<P>
"The act still creates long-term uncertainty, however, and we
are disappointed," Canadian International Trade Minister Art
Eggleton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision postpones but does not eliminate the threat
to Canadian companies, Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government "should not be continuing to hold this
sword over other countries and the legitimate business of other
countries," he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"It continues to be unacceptable behavior by the United States
in foisting its foreign policy upon Canada and other countries and
threatening Canadian business, threatening anyone who wants to do
business legally with Cuba," he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada is also very concerned about other provisions within the
act, such as continuing entry restrictions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced his decision today to renew the six-month
waiver that suspends the right of U.S. companies to sue under the
Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time he suspended the key part of the law
that seeks to punish foreigners who do business on Cuba properties
allegedly confiscated from U.S. owners.
</P>
<P>
The suspension shows that Clinton "got the message that
Helms-Burton really undermines the whole trade system and
seriously impairs commercial trade relations with other
countries," said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"Although this announcement is helpful in the short term, the
government of Canada is concerned about the continued application
of extraterritorial measures," Axworthy noted, adding that "we are
hopeful that our continued opposition to the act will eventually
result in the repeal of the Helms-Burton legislation."
</P>
<P>
To counteract the effects of Helms-Burton, the Canadian
government has amended its Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act,
which came into effect on the first day of this year.
</P>
<P>
Canada also announced that it would participate as a third
party in the European Union's challenge against the Helms-Burton
at the World Trade Organization.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico reiterated today its
rejection to the Helms-Burton Act while welcoming the
U.S. decision to delay for another six months the implementation
of the anti-Cuban law.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced earlier in the day a
further half-year suspension of the provision of the law, which
has been antagonizing the rest of the world ever since its
enactment in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Foreign Ministry, in a statement, described the
U.S. administration's decision as an effort to hear the critical
opinion of the international community against the unilateral
legislature on the part of U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Mexico reiterates its rejection to the extraterritoriality of
the Helms-Burton Act which go against international law and the
fundamental principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs
of other states, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government reaffirms the need to solve any
international differences through an open and respectful dialogue
not tainted by unilateral and confrontational measures, it added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that Mexico will take advantage of all
the negotiation spaces to prevent that law from affecting the
overseas interests of Mexican citizens and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law, named after their initiators at U.S. Congress,
establishes the possibility of legal actions against persons "who
traffic with U.S. assets" expropriated after the victory of the
Cuban revolution in the late 1950s.

<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Housing will become more
affordable this year thanks to government removal of various
charges that lift realty prices, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission(SPC) and the Finance Ministry
publicized a joint circular yesterday that ordered the cut of 48
kinds of charges from the prices of construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Construction and land departments waived 29 charges in
administration of approval, supervision, registration,
certification and transfer of rights.
</P>
<P>
The rest on the list of cancelled items approved by the State
Council are mostly concerned with supporting facilities,
environmental management and public security supervision and
involve 12 other government departments.
</P>
<P>
Various extra charges besides the construction cost of
marketable housing projects make up 20-30 percent of housing
prices, according to local surveys. The proportion is even higher
in some large cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of residents fleeing
Indonesia's West Kalimantan district of Sanggau Ledo, Sambas
Regency, hit by ethnic tension which killed five Monday, increased
Friday to almost 5,700 people, "the Jakarta Post" newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The general atmosphere in the district was one of anxiety and
fear. As of last night, 5,678 people of the Maduran ethnic group
had fled to Singkawang, some 70 kilometers west of the district,
up substantially from 2,680 on Tuesday, the report quoted a
resident source as saying.
</P>
<P>
But there have been no more casualties or damage to property
since the violent clash broke out Monday, the source said.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how many Madurans who originate from Madura
island in East Java, had been involved in the clash with the
native Dayak people. On Thursday, thousands of Dayak men went on a
burning and looting rampage against Maduran houses and other
property.
</P>
<P>
The source also reported that the number of women and children
seeking refuge at the Sanggau Ledo air force base had increased
from 471 to 606, adding to the approximately 500 existing
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an estimated 600 troops were still deployed in
Singkawang, and in the districts of Samalantan, Bengkayang,
Sanggau Ledo and Ledo, to maintain security and prevent further
unrest.
</P>
<P>
The curfew between 9:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., imposed earlier
remained effective Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that 90 homes were burned in Sanggau Ledo,
Marabu village, Kampung Jawa and Jirak village.
</P>
<P>
The riots were sparked by a brawl, over a woman, between two
group of youths. In the incident at a local music concert, a
Madura man reportedly stabbed two Dayak tribesmen in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
The communities in the West Kalimantan cities have a long
history of feuds between the Dayak and the migrant Maduran ethnic
groups.

<HEADLINE> China Sticks to Tight Policy on Fixed Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite its successful economic
"soft landing" in 1996, China will continue applying its
moderately tight monetary policy to fixed assets investment and
keep control over investment capital this year, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The authorities aim to lower the radio of fixed assets
investment in the nation's gross expenditure budget from 33-34
percent in 1996 to ensure the momentum of China's healthy economic
development for three straight years, said Zhang Hanya,
vice-director of the investment research institute under the State
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Fixed assets investment is expected to reach 2,650-2,900
billion yuan (319-349 billion US dollars) in the new year, up
about 17 percent from the 2,380 billion yuan (286.7 billion US
dollars) in 1996, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Fixed assets investment this year will be employed primarily
for water conservancy construction and technical renovation of
state-run enterprises, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
A greater proportion of the investment will be used for
large-scale infrastructure facilities, basic projects of its
pillar industries, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Also, special construction funds will be established for some
key industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China will emphasize fortifying, perfecting and
implementing reform measures concerning fixed assets investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will speed up the implementation of investment
law, while strengthening investment returns and optimizing
investment structure, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Silver Medalist Dives For Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- With an American novel on
romance in hands, Atlanta Olympics silver medalist Annika Walter
of Germany rested herself in a chair beside a pool in which her
rivals were diving to win the China FINA Diving Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
When it was her turn, she climbed to the 10-meter platform and
finished her routine compositions, which left her sixth at 443.88
points.
</P>
<P>
"I do not care about the result," said the beaming schoolgirl
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Unlike her Chinese rivals, who trained six to eight hours a
day, Walter, from Rostock, said she took less than two hours one
day in diving.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese divers are always the best, but sometimes they don't
have enough joy," the 21-year-old Walter said. "I dive just for
fun."
</P>
<P>
She managed to finish ninth in the semifinals, squeezing into
the final with the last berth. In the finals, Chinese girls showed
their prowess, with Wang Rui claiming the gold at 516.09 points
and Hu Wei the silver at 465.54.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coaches were shocked by Walter's dives. "We could not
believe our eyes that was the performance of a Olympic silver
medalist," said Chinese coach Yang Zhuliang.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the German diver could not match any of China's
national divers in terms of skill. "It was really a surprise,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Walter once said the Olympic silver was an extra present to her
when she was looking for fun.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really expect a silver medal," Walter said in
Atlanta. "In fact, I didn't think I would win any medal or get in
the top five. It's incredible!"
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt that hard work could turn out fruit.
</P>
<P>
"Annika trained very hard for the Atlanta Olympics. She was
angry as she did not do her first dive as well as she can," said
German National coach Yrsula Klinger after Walter rose to the
podium in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Her coach Monika Dietrich also attributed her failure in
Beijing to the lack of hard training.
</P>
<P>
"After the Olympics, our divers had a long free time and had
not enough workouts," Dietrich said. "We began our training only
three weeks ago. We need practice now."
</P>
<P>
The German coach pointed that supeior techniques and hard
trianing helped China become a diving superpower in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Their take-off are very, very good, their entry -- very strong
,very fast -- was the best," she said. "Germany has invited a
Chinese coach to teach German divers, and we learned a lot from
him."
</P>
<P>
Speaking high of Walter and placing great hopes on the
promising Olympic silver medalist, Dietrich said she wished her
disciple could achieve good results in the World Championships in
1998 and even the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But Walter was not sure whether she could compete in the 2000
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Four years is a long time especially for diving. It's hard to
say now," Walter said in the chair, continuing to read her
American novel beside the splashing pool.

<HEADLINE> Ramos, Cabinet Approve Interim Budget For 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and his Cabinet have approved an interim budget totaling 449.7
billion pesos (17.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Budget and Management Secretary Salvador Enriquez said the
approval was an offshoot of a budget review undertaken during
Friday's Cabinet meeting to assess how many funds were available
for government operations in 1997, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"President Ramos instructed us not to wait for congressional
action on the pending budget measure and immediately release
available money to begin the implementation of projects slated for
1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives and the Senate are still trying to
resolve their differences in the proposed 1997 budget in the
bicameral conference committee. They failed to pass the budget
before Christmas even after they held a two-day special
conference.
</P>
<P>
Due to the impasse, Enriquez said that last year's budget "is
still deemed reenacted and in effect" until the 1997
appropriations measure is approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the bulk of the interim budget amounting to 312.7
billion pesos (11.9 billion U.S. dollars) represents available
funds from the 1996 measure.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government has no budget crisis and the
funding of government operations will remain smooth despite the
delay in the congressional approval of the 1997 budget proposal.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Registers 52-Year Low Annual Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentina registered an
annual inflation rate of 0.054 percent in 1996, the lowest in the
last 52 years, said the Economy Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
A ministry communique says the inflation index is the lowest
since 1944, when a 0.3 percent deflation occurred.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show the cost of living registered a 0.3
percent deflation last December, promoted by a 0.8 percent drop in
the prices of food and beverages, mostly vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The lowest cost of living in Argentina's history was recorded
in 1931, with a 13.9 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
As of the last month of 1996, price reductions were also
reported in sectors such as housing, clothing, home appliances,
and goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices dropped 0.1 percent and the cost of
construction in the country's capital city of Buenos Aires
diminished 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The deflation of wholesale prices was the result of a 0.1
percent drop in the prices of national products, as well as a 0.8
percent drop in the prices of imported goods.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Oil Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China will import more foreign
oil for domestic refineries to process while increasing domestic
production of natural gas to cope with growing domestic demand,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Refineries under China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) processed
20 million tons of imported oil in the past year, 20 times the
amount processed in 1988, said a senior oil official.
</P>
<P>
"The 20 million tons make up 20 percent of the total amount
processed," said Sinopec President Sheng Huaren.
</P>
<P>
He said these firms will process more overseas oil in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Surging demand for finished oil and relatively stable supply
of onshore oil have forced refineries to look into overseas
markets," Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
China's oil production stood at an average of three million
barrels per day in 1995, and is expected to reach 3.3 million
barrels per day by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, demand for finished oil amounted to an average of 3.04
million barrels per day, and is expected to hit 3.9 million
barrels per day by 2000.
</P>
<P>
China imported 18.4 million tons of oil in the first ten months
of last year, up 63 percent from the previous year. It is expected
to import more in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country plans to double its annual natural gas
production capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by 2005, as one of
its strategies for developing energy resources, said a senior
official with the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
China is expected to verify additional onshore gas reserves of
1,000 billion cubic meters by the end of the century, with the
cumulative total hitting 2,000 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas production capacity will be
increased by ten billion cubic meters, with the total topping 25
billion cubic meters.

BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Relief for China's disaster
victims totalled a record 6 billion yuan (722 million US dollars)
last year, as a higher than usual number of droughts, floods and

<HEADLINE> Olympique Marseille Officials Diverted U.S. dlrs 19 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- French investigators say European
champions Olympique Marseille diverted 19 million U.S. dollars to
throw matches at home and abroad, a newspaper reported in its
Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
When scandal-ridden sports tycoon Bernard Tapie managed the
club, Marseille used "all means .... to buy certain matches,
approach certain players or corrupt certain referees," said a
report by investigative Judge Pierre Philipon.
</P>
<P>
From 1987-1993, Tapie pursued those means "believing that the
club's success would mean his personal success and would allow him
to win the mayorship of Marseille," said the four-year, 250-page
report cited by the respected daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
In order to influence matches or buy star players, "Olympique
Marseille had to divert a very considerable amount of funds,"
which totaled 101,410,266 francs, Philipon said.
</P>
<P>
The measures, which helped run the team into the ground
financially, included fake loans, bogus receipts and false billing
for offshore companies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign matches Tapie tried to rig included ones with AEK
Athens, Spartak of Moscow and the Belgian team in Bruges, Le Monde
said, citing new testimony from the report.
</P>
<P>
The report comes ahead of a trial set for May, in which 20
people have been charged, including Tapie and most of the former
club officials during 1987-93. Charges include fraud, abuse of
confidence and abuse of company assets.
</P>
<P>
The press office at Olympique Marseille declined to comment
Friday on the report.
</P>
<P>
Tapie has already been convicted of taking part in trying to
buy Valenciennes players in a match that preceded Marseille's
European Champions Cup victory over AC Milan in 1993. His case is
on appeal.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Marseille was stripped of its French champion
title in 1993 and relegated to second division in 1993-94.

<HEADLINE> Suleymanoglu Undecided about Quitting Weightlifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion weightlifter
Naim Suleymanoglu on Friday denied reports that he had quit the
sport.
</P>
<P>
"Those reports suggesting that I quit don't reflect my final
decision," Suleymanoglu told Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news
agency. "I haven't made my decision yet."
</P>
<P>
"I have considered quitting weightlifting several times and I
want to quit at my best performance," Suleymanoglu said. "But now
I am not injured and I am leaving everything to time."
</P>
<P>
Some Turkish newspapers said Thursday that Suleymanoglu had
decided to quit weightlifting at the age of 29 after his victory
in last year's Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The 1.52 meter Suleymanoglu, known as "Pocket Hercules", became
the only weightlifter in the world to win three gold medals in
three successive Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
He has also broken more than 60 world records in his career to
date.

MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine President Fidel Ramos and his Cabinet have
approved an interim budget amounting to 449.7 billion pesos (17.2
billion U.S. dollars) due to the failure of Congress to approve
the 1997 version totaling 476.2 billion pesos (18.2 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal
</P>
<P>
-- House Speaker Jose de Venecia Friday belittled the chance of
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa to run for the presidency in
1998 under the banner of the ruling Lakas-NUCD coalition.
</P>
<P>
Today
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines' exports continued its slow but steady
recovery, growing by 17.9 percent from January to November of 1996

in the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Times
</P>
<P>
-- The government is supporting moves to amend the
Constitution, urging the Supreme Court to let the people decide

<HEADLINE> Henman Makes Doha Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- British rising star Tim Henman
defeated Magnus Gustafsson in straight sets to reach the last four
of the Qatar Open tennis tournament in Doha on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Henman, ranked 29 in the world, won through 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to
set up a semi-final clash -- his eighth in the past year on tour
-- with Morrocan Hicham Arazi. Arazi, 23, booked his passage with
a nailbiting 7-6, 7-6 win over Magnus Larsson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Henman breezed through the first set after
breaking number five seed Gustafsson, whom he also defeated on his
fine run to last year's Wimbledon quarter-finals, in the fourth
game to love.
</P>
<P>
And once the Briton -- yet to reach an ATP tour final -- had
staved off a deuce on his own serve in the seventh game to go 5-2
up, the outcome of the opening set was never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
In the second, Gustafsson fought back gamely and might have
levelled had he converted any of four break points in the fourth
game. But Henman, despite a poor run of first serves, held on.
</P>
<P>
The Swede came back once more to find himself with three set
points at 6-5, but Henman saved them all to force the tiebreak.
And he polished off the match after motoring into a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final sees former World No. 1 Jim Courier of the
United States take on Sergi Bruguera, twice a French Open winner.
</P>
<P>
Courier, seeded eight, beat top seed Thomas Muster of Austrian
6-3, 7-5, while Bruguera ousted an off-colour Petr Korda of the
Czech Republic 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.

WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic bomb suspect
Richard Jewell is considering to sue Cable News Network over its
coverage of the investigation into last summer's bombing at the
Atlanta Olympics, a Jewell attorney said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wood, one of two attorneys retained by Jewell to handle
libel suits against the news media, said he has met with CNN

The Wall Street Journal reported in an article on Friday that
Jewell's attorneys had spoken to CNN about a possible out-of-court
settlement. The talks followed a deal with NBC valued at more
than 500,000 U.S. dollars, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In New York, NBC declined to comment on the reported settlement
figure. "We're not confirming that number," NBC spokeswoman Beth

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Investigate Match Fixing Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- An official Cypriot commission is
to investigate allegations of match fixing in a World Cup
qualifier between Cyprus and Bulgaria on December 14, a Cyprus
Football Association official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commission is to be appointed by the Cyprus Sports
Association (KOA), which is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on
its responsibilities, an F.A. official said.
</P>
<P>
"The F.A. has decided to assign the investigation to KOA
because it wants a completely independent inquiry," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The allegations, reported extensively by the local media,
suggest players on the island's national team placed considerable
bets for Cyprus to lose to Bulgaria in the match, played in the
southern coastal town of Limassol.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus lost 3-1 to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The reports do not mention any specific player, but football
authorities admit the sums bet on the match - up to 10 times the
normal - were enough to arouse suspicion.
</P>
<P>
F.A. officials have publicly stated that up to 64,000
U.S. dollars was placed on the game.
</P>
<P>
Bookmakers even rejected bets because the sums placed made them
suspicious. The F.A. has asked for a government inquiry into
bookmakers' accounts to ascertain who and how much money was
actually bet.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Parliament Convenes, Cabinet Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The first session of Bosnia's
post-war parliament convened Friday in Sarajevo, in which the
Council of Ministers (the cabinet) was approved by the parliament
members.
</P>
<P>
The 42 members of the House of Representatives, of whom one
third are Serbs and the rest Muslims and Croats, sat for the first
time together in a small room of Sarajevo's National Museum for
the joint session.
</P>
<P>
"Now the real work must start," Michael Steiner, deputy to the
international High Representative overseeing reconstruction in
Bosnia, told the deputies in a speech.
</P>
<P>
The President of the three-member Presidency, Alija
Izetbegovic, called for the deputies to fullly implement the
Dayton peace accords which ended the three and half year civil war
in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of the joint presidency,
said Bosnia could survive "if we work hard to ensure all three
nations and both entities feel equal and secure."
</P>
<P>
Serb deputies had boycotted an inaugural session of parliament
in October, presenting safety and disagreement over meeting venue
as the reason for absence.
</P>
<P>
The three ethnic officials have recently agreed that the venue
for government meetings alternates between the two entities --
Serb republic and Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 15-member upper chamber, the House of Peoples,
also convened for the first time in the Sarajevo suburb of
Lukavica in Serb-controlled territory Friday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Envoy to Continue to Mediate for Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department on
Friday said its mediator Dennis Ross will continue his Middle East
mission in an effort to help reach a final agreement between the
Israelis and Palestinians on the pullout of Israeli troops from
the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news briefing
that there were some progress made over the last week, "but not
sufficient progress to complete an agreement on the redeployment
of the Israeli Defense forces from Hebron... there still is no
deal between the Palestinians and the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
"Dennis is taking his sojourn out there on a day-to-day basis.
He's going to have to assess on a day-to-day basis how useful it
is for him to be there," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the conclusion of the agreement, expected to be
reached on the eve of the New Years, was delayed because "this is
the endgame" of a difficult negotiation with political and
religious import. Hence, he said, such negotiations "often -- and
in this case certainly have -- become much more difficult and much
more intensive."
</P>
<P>
Burns rejected suggestions that the Palestinians were to blame
for the failure this week to conclude the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with it... I don't think it's accurate based on
my knowledge of these negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It takes two to tango, and both are responsible. So we're not
pointing the finger at the Palestinians or at the Israelis and
saying that one or the other has more responsibility than the
other to make an agreement," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Waiver of Cuba Sanctions Provision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today suspended for another six months the so-called Helms-Burton
law provision that would allow Americans to sue foreign companies
doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Clinton initially imposed the suspension on July 16, 1996 and
faced a January 16 deadline for either waiving the provision or
extending it.
</P>
<P>
"I've decided to extend for another six months the suspension
of the right to file suit ...," Clinton said in a statement while
on vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands. "I would expect to
continue suspending the right to file suit so long as America's
friends and allies continue their efforts to promote a transition
to democracy in Cuba," he said.
</P>
<P>
The law, signed by Clinton last March, is mainly to deter
foreign investment in Cuba. It would punish foreigners who do
business on properties of Americans nationalized in Cuba after the
1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
The provision has been widely condemned by Canada and European
and Latin American countries, which argued that the United States
was trying to impose its anti-Cuba trade sanctions on them. A
number of countries have moved to enact laws to counter
Helms-Burton and filed trade complains to the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Bus Bombing in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
condemned the bomb attack on a Damascus bus this week after the
Syrian government lashed out at it for failing to do so and for
dismissing Syrian accusations that Israel was behind the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns this terrorist attack against
innocent people, and there's every reason to believe that these
were innocent people on that bus, civilians, who ought not to have
to fear for their lives when they travel around the city of
Damascus," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a
news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Burns comment came hours after the Syrian Foreign Ministry
issued a statement blasting him for his reaction to the bomb
attack on the bus, that killed nine people and injured 44.
</P>
<P>
At thursday's briefing, Burns, without expressing any
condolences to the Syrian government for the people killed in the
attack, warned Syria against accusations of Israeli agents for
the bomb attack, saying: "It is a very serious charge for one
state to accuse another of actually sponsoring bombings in its
capital... it's a wild and irresponsible charge if in fact it is
not backed up by evidence."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to burns' Thursday remarks, the Syrian statement
said: "We noted the absence of any condemnation for this terrorist
attack in the statement of the spokesman Burns, and of any human
sympathy with the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"His statement was immediately volunteering to acquit those
behind the terrorist action without taking into consideration the
feelings of the Syrian citizen."
</P>
<P>
Burns, however, did not back down from his previous warning
against Syria's accusations of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It is not wise for any government to accuse another government
of an act of terrorism without a foundation of evidence to support
it," he reiterated.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Jump Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average continued to charge back today, rallying more than 101
points higher to erase the remaining damage from a two-day slide
on inflation worries.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also rallied, led by technology issues, which
helped boost the Nasdaq market to its second-biggest point gain
ever.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which actually started its rally late Thursday by
wiping out most of a 95-point drop, finished within 17 points of
last Friday's record high, rising 101.60, or 1.6 percent, to close
at 6,544.09. It plunged 101.10 points Tuesday, the last session of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Computer-related bellwethers led the day, with Intel soaring 8
points to 138 U.S. dollars as the most active Nasdaq issue after
Salomon Brothers raised its rating on the big chipmaker.
</P>
<P>
On the NYSE, Compaq and IBM also advanced markedly. In Nasdaq
trading, Dell Computer and Microsoft rose.
</P>
<P>
The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index rose 29.98, or 2.3
percent, to 1,310.68, its second largest one-day point gain after
a 33.18-point jump on July 17 last summer.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 452.97 million
shares, slightly slower than Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 11.02 to 748.03; the
NYSE composite index rose 4.53 to 394.06; and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 3.29 to 572.45.
</P>
<P>
Stocks got some early support from bonds, which rose early in
the day despite a Commerce Department report saying construction
spending shot up 1.9 percent in November, the steepest advance in
eight months. The data compounded worries from some surprisingly
strong reports in recent days on new home sales, consumer
confidence, and manufacturing activity.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The FBI is extending its
investigations into letter bombs by asking its legal attache in
Egypt to provide help while sending bomb specialists to the
country where the letter bombs were said to have been dispatched.
</P>
<P>
There were seven letter bombs discovered in the United States
on Thursday, which were said to have been sent from the Egyptian
city of Alexandria. Among them, four were addressed to the
Washington, D.C., bureau of al Hayat, a Saudi-owned Arabic
newspaper, one, also sent to the newspaper, was found at a post
office, and the other two were sent to the federal prison at
Leavenworth, Kansas.
</P>
<P>

outside the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokeswoman on Friday said the United States has a legal
attache in Cairo, "we've reached out to that office and have asked
that they go into Alexandria to conduct the investigation."
</P>
<P>
"We are not only conducting the investigation in the United
States, but also are reaching out to friendly foreign intelligence
sources to see if they have anything that might be of interest,"
spokeswoman Susan Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FBI bomb specialists are heading to Egypt in
search of clues into the series of the letter bombs.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Salemeh, convicted for his role in the 1993 bombing of
New York's world Trade Center, is jailed at Leavenworth, where are
also imprisoned Victor Alvarez, convicted with nine others for
plotting to blow up United Nations headquarters and other New York
targets. Three of Alvarez's co-defendants were from around
Alexandria, Egypt
</P>
<P>
An attorney with knowledge of the prisoners said Alvarez wrote
letters from prison to people all over the United States and
overseas about his case, including many to the editor of prison
network newsletter.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said the FBI was reviewing debris from four devices found
at Al hayat's offices. the devices were "disrupted" safely by
Washington bomb squad.
</P>
<P>
The other letter bombs, meant to explode when opened, were also
intercepted before they went off, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said on Thursday there might be more such bombs in the
mail and urged Americans to be alert for the devices.

The Zajedno leaders sharply criticized the letter sent on
Friday by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic to the OSCE,
in which Milutinovic admitted that the opposition coalition had
won municipal election in three cities and in nine wards in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition has claimed it won 14 out of 18 biggest
cities in Serbia in the November 17 local elections.
</P>
<P>
The former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez headed an
OSCE delegation to Belgrade on November 21 on a fact-finding
mission to the election dispute. He submitted a report to the OSCE
chairman on December 27 which confirmed that the opposition won 13
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's protest rallies, the Zajedno leaders also called on
Belgrade citizens not to stay at home listening to independent
Radio B-92 but to attend the opposition rallies in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leader of the Radical Party "Nikola Pasic", Sinisa
Vucinic, urged on Friday the unity of all parties, organizations
and the entire Serb people in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Vucinic said not all opposition
parties took part in street protests but "leaders of three
opposition parties who have turned a part of their members into
the fifth column."
</P>
<P>
Authentic opposition parties have remained constructive and are
ready to cooperate both with other opposition parties and with the
ruling party which concerns interests of the Serb people in the
Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro, he said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Criticizes US Remarks on Damascus Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Syria expressed astonishment
this evening at the remarks of a U.S. State Department spokesman
on the bus bombing which killed nine people and wounded 44 others
here Tuesday
</P>
<P>
The remarks, according to a Syrian official, neither condemned
the incident nor expressed sympathy with the victims and their
families.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spokesman warned Syria Thursday against leveling
accusations at Israel without evidence. "The accusation of
carrying out an explosion in the capital of a certain country is
an extremely serious one," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official, who asked to be anonymous, noted that
the U.S. spokesman showed in his remarks an immediate tendency to
exonerate those behind the incident without taking into account
the feelings of the Syrian and Arab people.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. spokesman ought to verify the Syrian accusations, but
he rashly deemed them 'reckless and irresponsible,'" the official
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. spokesman had to recall the statements of
many Israeli officials, including Ori Loubrani, of the Mossad,
who said last week that Israel would back terrorist acts against
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The statement triggered angry reactions from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official concluded by saying "those who stand
behind such terrorist acts will make mistake if they think that
their criminal acts are able to force Syria to back down on its
claim for restoring fully its occupied territories as a condition
for establishing fair peace in the Middle East."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
all bounced back and recovered half of Tursday's heavy losses on
Friday, boosted by Wall Street's own revival.
</P>
<P>

as many dealers were still on holiday and market sentiment was
still cautious. However, the FTSE 100 index managed to finish up
32.1 points at 4,089.5, but still 1.5 points lower on last week.

Today's November UK consumer credit figures, though
stronger-than-expected, had little impact on the market.

<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed the session slightly higher,
with the DAX-30 index up 10.51 points at 2,859.28, a rise of 6.4
points on the week, supported by interest from German domestic
fund managers and a strong performance of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that German current account figures released
earlier today had little impact.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also followed US shares higher, staging modest
gains as the market struggled to overcome a weak domestic bond
market, with the CAC-40 index ending 25.79 points up at 2,282.76,
still 24.19 points down on last Friday.
