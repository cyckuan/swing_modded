YANKEES 7, INDIANS 1

   CLEVELAND _ Like superpowers in the baseball world, the Yankees
and the Cleveland Indians are wary of each other, their resources
and abilities comparable, their recent history tense. Before the
Yankees even earn a chance to win the World Series and establish
themselves as one of the greatest teams of the 20th century, they
are probably going to have to beat Cleveland in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how many games the Yankees win in the regular
season, the Indians present a major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   But not Tuesday night. Behind the pitching of Andy Pettitte and
a lusty 12-hit outbreak that included six for extra bases, the
Yankees were 7-1 winners over Cleveland to give them a split of the
two-game series at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed just six hits in improving to 12-5, and Chuck
Knoblauch, breaking out of a recent offensive funk, had two hits,
including his sixth home run.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland assumed an early lead after Jim Thome, their most
productive hitter, was hit by a Pettitte fastball on the right
wrist in the first inning. Thome was forced to leave the game; An
X-ray revealed no fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman's subsequent sacrifice fly scored Vizquel. But
Ricky Ledee doubled home Chad Curtis in the Yankee second, and in
the third, Tino Martinez laced a single off Cleveland's Dave Burba
(10-7) to snap the tie. Martinez doubled to open the sixth inning,
then scored when Darryl Strawberry followed with a double.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Strawberry was replaced by a pinch-runner, the
strongest indication to date that the Yankees are growing more
concerned with the condition of his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who had singled in the third, drove his home run
leading off the seventh. Knoblauch, whose average dipped to .259
last Thursday, has hits in his last five games and has consistently
hit the ball hard.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte retired 12 consecutive batters at one point, and
cruised to his fourth complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' record of 66-21 matches the best mark in the 20th
Century after 87 games. They are on a pace to win 123 games and to
shatter both the major league mark of 116 victories by the 1906
Chicago Cubs and the American League mark of 111 victories, set by
Cleveland in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   If the playoffs were to start today, the Yankees would play the
A.L. West leader in the first round, while Cleveland would play
Boston. If Cleveland slumps a bit, the Yankees may again play the
Indians in the first round.

CLARIFIES RIPKEN STREAK AT 2,572
</HEADLINE>
 
Ripken's stats off, but The Streak goes on 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The All-Star break was a bleak time for the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the highest payroll in baseball was 261/2 games
out of first place. There were rumors and stories of dissension in
the clubhouse and in the front office, and owner Peter Angelos was
said to be ready to start trading potential free agents, including
Rafael Palmeiro and Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   But most notable, from a historical perspective, the debate was
raging once again: Should All-Star third baseman Cal Ripken, having
a substandard offensive season, take a day off and end his
magnificent streak of consecutive games played?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seemed to have an opinion, especially in the news
media. Some were calling it the most selfless streak in history.
Others called it the most selfish. However, the two whose opinions
matter most continue to defend the streak, and Ripken is in the
Orioles' lineup indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Cal has on any given day is good enough for me,''
Orioles manager Ray Miller told Baltimore reporters before the
break. ``I have a tough enough time getting guys to play two weeks
in a row, let alone every game.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that if Ripken asked for a day off, he
would get one. But he has no intention of doing so, and the streak
is at 2,572 games before tonight's Orioles-Rangers game tonight at
The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep perspective and the simple approach,'' Ripken
said at the All-Star Game. ``I'm considered the everyday third
baseman for the Orioles, and my job is to come out and help us win.
If the manager is making his lineup, thinking I can be one of those
guys that can help us win, I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's mediocre offensive numbers invite debate.
</P>
<P>
   He is hitting .257 with seven home runs and 37 runs batted in.
His .371 slugging percentage on the day the American League
All-Stars were announced was lowest on the team, lower than even
defensive-minded shortstop Omar Vizquel. The Orioles' .359 slugging
percentage from their third basemen, usually considered a power
position, is third-lowest in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if your performance is down, I'd rather have people
talk about your performance, rather than the streak,'' Ripken said.
``Taking a day off is not going to help your performance. Actually
working hard and correcting your hitting will correct your
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Every major-league player is prone to slumps. But when Ripken
goes through them, there is an immediate tendency to blame the
streak.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in 1990, when Ripken's batting average dropped to
a career-low .250 with 21 home runs, 78 runs and 84 RBI, relatively
low numbers for him. The streak was blamed, but Ripken responded
the next year by hitting .323 with 34 home runs and 114 RBI, good
enough to be named the AL Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   However, he isn't getting younger. Ripken will be 38 next month,
an age when many players contemplate retirement, being a designated
hitter or a platoon situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak itself can be analyzed, dissected, opinions can be
formed in all different directions,'' Ripken said. ``But I don't
worry about that kind of stuff. I worry about the thing that
matters most, my approach to the game. It's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   He has staunch defenders, including Rangers first baseman Will
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who say he needs to take a day off don't realize
how hard it is to go out there and play every day,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Florida manager Jim Leyland: ``Cal Ripken is a great player
and still a very productive player. If Cal Ripken is healthy, he's
like any other great player _ you want him in the lineup. I'll
never believe that Cal Ripken is hurting his team by playing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Twins' Paul Molitor had to go on the disabled list for
the 14th time in his career after getting hit in the ribs by a
pitch, he wondered aloud why such things don't happen to Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, he'd probably be playing tomorrow,'' Molitor said.
``He'd probably hit left-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans seemed to weigh in with an opinion at the All-Star
break. A sellout crowd at Coors Field gave Ripken a standing
ovation in pregame introductions equal to that given Mark McGwire
and Rockies hometown favorite Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the streak ends, it will take care of itself,'' Ripken
said. ``The situation will present itself, which will make sense,
and it will happen. I can't tell you how it would happen, but it's
not going to go on forever.''

<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ Walking back from a water cooler near the
third tee at the Wykagyl Country Club on Tuesday, Nancy Lopez
handed Se Ri Pak a cup of water. ``Here, let me buy you a drink,''
Lopez said with a big smile. Smiling back, Pak took the cup and
thanked her playing partner.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many lighthearted moments between the 41-year-old
Lopez and the 20-year-old Pak in a practice round for this week's
JAL Big Apple Classic that provided a merging of two generations of
golfing sensations: the most charismatic women's golfer over the
last two decades, and the young South Korean player who has stunned
the golf world with her electrifying and record-breaking play in
the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my idea,'' Lopez said later. ``I asked Se Ri at the
Jamie Farr tournament if she would play a practice round with me
here at Wykagyl. We played together the last two days of the LPGA
Championships, but this was much more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans who missed them Tuesday will get another chance later
this week, under more competitive circumstances. Lopez and Pak will
be paired together, along with Hiromi Kobayashi, in the first two
rounds of the tournament on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with Pak and Lori Kane of Canada, Lopez constantly
flashed the smile that has endeared her to millions of fans during
her tenure as one of the sport's most popular ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Lopez patted Pak on the back and elicited smiles
from the South Korean, who over the last two weeks has won the U.S.
Women's Open and the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic; in the latter, she
shot a round of 61 that was the lowest score ever in the Ladies
Professional Golf Association, and finished at 23 under par, tying
the tour record.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez knows what that kind of breakthrough is like. In her
rookie year of 1978 she won nine tournaments, including five in a
row, the third of which came at Wykagyl. She has won 48 tournaments
over all in her storied career, but has struggled recently, missing
the cut in her last three outings. They included the U.S. Open, in
which she has finished second four times but has never won. It's
the most significant omission from her Hall of Fame resume.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no professional jealousy evident Tuesday as Lopez
walked and talked with Pak, although Lopez admittedly did most of
the talking. ``I told her to have fun like I did when I was her
age,'' Lopez said. ``And I think she will because she's got a great
attitude and she's giggly like me. She's very relaxed and smiles a
lot between shots, but then she's all business when she gets ready
to hit her shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Lopez offer any advice to Pak?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I did tell her not to let the media and others take up
too much of her time,'' Lopez said. ``I told her that can burn you
out. But mainly I told Se Ri to enjoy herself and to laugh a lot,
which she does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked if she could compare her meteoric start in 1978 to Pak's
overnight success this year _ she has also won a second women's
major tournament, the McDonald's LPGA Championships in mid-May _
Lopez said: ``I think it's tougher for her, coming from another
country and not understanding or speaking English very well. But
she seems to handle the pressure very well. And I think she's great
for women's golf because we seemed to have hit a lull until Se Ri
came along.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak, wearing a white baseball cap and wraparound sunglasses,
admitted that playing the practice round with Lopez was both
relaxing and fun. ``She's so nice to people, and I want to be like
her,'' Pak said. ``She's always smiling and always seems to be
having fun. And she's such a nice person. She told me that I have
many years ahead of me and just to play my game and not to push
myself. And she told me to be happy and to have a good time when
I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pak needed a role model for how to endear herself to the
fans, then she could have no better playing partner. Lopez, who has
not played in the JAL Big Apple since 1996, frequently stopped to
sign autographs and to chat with spectators during the practice
round.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, whose two consecutive victories have vaulted her to the top
of the LPGA prize money list with earnings of $645,170, said she
became a big fan of Lopez three years ago. ``I just started playing
golf at 14,'' she said in halting English, ``and when I was 17 I
was watching a women's tournament at home and saw Nancy Lopez. She
was always smiling and seemed to be having a good time. And I
decided then I wanted to be like her.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the 5-foot-6-inch Pak has done a good job in
emulating Lopez's game in her prime. Oddly enough, she has had only
three top-10 finishes, all of them tournament victories.
</P>
<P>
   The age differential of 21 years seemed to be lost on both Pak
and Lopez Tuesday. But Pak alluded to it later, saying, ``She was
winning tournaments before I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lopez won her first professional event in 1978, a few
months before Pak turned 1. But she was runner-up in her first U.S.
Women's Open in 1975 at the age of 18, two years before Pak was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her parents, Pak also brought her pet 10-week-old beagle
to Wykagyl. The dog's name?
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy,'' Pak said with another smile.
</P>
<P>
   An apt description for Pak and her practice partner on Tuesday.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEELS KEEP SPINNING AFTER BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets, through no fault of their own, are giving a
whole new meaning to the term ``sandwich generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets still haven't found a way to be as veteran, as skilled,
as wise or successful as the Atlanta Braves, the perennial National
League East leader and the game's standard setter for the better
part of a decade. That much was clear when the second-place Mets
opened a two-game series with the Braves at Shea Stadium on Tuesday
night knowing that only a sweep could get their 11{-game deficit
down to single digits. That is now impossible in the wake of a
listless 4-2 loss to John Smoltz, the Mets' fourth loss to the
Braves without a victory in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Mets in the National League East stand
the Philadelphia Phillies, a team that appears ready and able to
wrench the tag of most precocious from the Mets. The Phillies, who
come to Shea for a four-game series beginning Thursday night, won
on Tuesday night and are in a virtual tie with the Mets for second
place. They are a new threat in the already crowded field of
wild-card contenders.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets look at the Phillies, they undoubtedly see spunk
and talent. In essence they see themselves two or three years ago.
Such is the fate of a crowned prince growing a little long in tooth
when it comes to great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   So who can blame the Mets if all they feel in the heat of July
is the frustration and exhaustion of a chase that never seems to
end. The Braves, as designed by General Manager John Schuerholz and
Manager Bobby Cox, rarely allow teams to shed their apprentice
mind-sets or to stop emulating an organization that refuses to be
caught.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the public perception is that the Braves have proved little
because of only one World Series victory among an unprecedented six
straight division titles. And yes, the mercenary Florida Marlins
did manage to buy their way past the Braves and into a World Series
title before disbanding.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you'd better believe that the teams that have done the
bulk of the chasing understand and appreciate the special nature of
the Braves' consistency. The Braves, neither smug nor sufferers of
false modesty, certainly do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everybody who is on the verge of a potential
breakthrough is designed either to beat us or keep up with us,''
said Tom Glavine, one of the many stars in the Braves' radiant
galaxy of Cy Young-caliber pitchers. ``Every time somebody makes a
move, you hear `in order to win we've got to beat the Braves.'
That's a huge compliment to this organization and what we've been
able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a huge headache for the club most relied upon to stop
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last four and a half years, that task belonged
more to the Mets than to any other team. It was a challenge picked
up but ultimately unmet by the old-school manager, Dallas Green. It
was a mission avidly sought but unfulfilled by the resurgent
general manager, Joe McIlvaine.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets are in the second season under their new-age
manager, Bobby Valentine, and McIlvaine's assistant turned
replacement, Steve Phillips. Their moves have been plentiful, some
inventive, even daring _ witness the trade for the all-star catcher
Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for all their trying the Mets still only know two
constants: their ever-changing look and the Braves' refusal to be
caught.
</P>
<P>
   When you are forever the speck in the rear-view mirror, the
frustration tends to wear. Or as Valentine plaintively said on
Tuesday: ``We know we can play with them. To win games, you just
have to play well, to make a break or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, of course, have had precious few breaks, especially
while being swept in three games in Atlanta before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   That flogging pushed the Mets 12{ games out, a devastating
turnaround considering that they had pulled to within five games of
the Braves on May 31 after winning nine in a row, including
Piazza's first seven games with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets are farther out than they were when Piazza was
obtained May 22, when the deficit was nine games. The trade,
intended to rock the N.L. East race, turned out to be just another
dust-up on the periphery of the Braves' universe, a passing fancy
that neither dislodged the Braves nor changed the fortunes of the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still 11 games back, not 3 or 4,'' the veteran Mets
reliever John Franco said with a sigh. ``They've maintained their
level and we still have, not a long ways to go, but without a
doubt, a ways to go.'' &QL;

BONILLA TRIES TO MAKE BEST OF TOUGH YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Today is the two-month anniversary since Bobby
Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich joined
the Dodgers as part of the big Mike Piazza trade.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Bonilla had just his third two-RBI game since
joining the club. But it was the sharp single he had in the seventh
inning that the team hopes is a better indicator of his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily look at the little things, I'm just
concentrating on how I feel,'' said Bonilla, who came off the
disabled list July 3 after missing two weeks with an intestinal
infection. ``Right now, I'm just trying to keep more things from
breaking down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, 35, had 97 RBI last season for the Florida Marlins. But
after undergoing offseason surgery to repair his left wrist and
left Achilles' tendon, Bonilla never has gotten going this year.
When Bonilla went down with the intestinal problems, he also was
checked for colon cancer, which proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people forget all that I've been through,''
said Bonilla. ``They just look at the numbers. There is a lot more
to it than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like making the switch to left field to accommodate rookie third
baseman Adrian Beltre. Most in the organization thought he was too
big and too slow to change positions, but so far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first concern was having him go back on balls,'' said Manny
Mota, who is helping Bonilla work on defense. ``That is the biggest
test for his heel. He moves well side to side. So far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Like reliever Jeff Shaw, Bonilla is eligible to demand a trade
at the end of the season because he came to the Dodgers in the
middle of a multiyear contract. But unlike Shaw, who is certain to
get a raise with that leverage, Bonilla is staying put. He has two
years left at $6 million per season, part of the lavish deal he
received from Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga. He knows he couldn't
get it again on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where am I going?'' Bonilla said. ``The best thing I can do is
stay healthy and help this team get back in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Strangest sight of the day: Dodgers GM Tom Lasorda
giving a motivational speech in center field Tuesday afternoon to
youngsters at the baseball camp of former longtime coach Mark
Cresse, who Lasorda fired late last month. Cresse arranged to use
the field before he was let go.... The last three Giants shortstops
played with the Chicago Cubs earlier in their careers _ Rey Sanchez
(1997), Jose Vizcaino (1991-93) and Shawon Dunston (1995).

FORMER MEXICAN POLICE CHIEF COOPERATES WITH U.S. DRUG PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 10th graf adding material about Mexican effort to
prosecutie Ruiz-Massieu)  (bl)  
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After years of blocking U.S. efforts to investigate
corruption in their ranks, Mexican law-enforcement officials have
allowed the jailed former head of their national police to travel
secretly to the United States to testify about drug payoffs at high
levels of the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   In what U.S. officials described as a ground-breaking
collaboration between the two countries, former Police Director
Adrian Carrera Fuentes told a federal grand jury in Houston in June
that he collected nearly $2 million in drug bribes in 1993 and 1994
and turned the money over to a former colleague, Mario Ruiz
Massieu, two officials familiar with the testimony said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators said Carrera's account could be the evidence
they have long sought in what has been a frustrating effort to
prosecute Ruiz Massieu, who was arrested in New Jersey three years
ago, or extradite him to Mexico to face charges there.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials took the case so seriously that they agreed to
let Carrera travel to the United States in the midst of an angry
dispute over the Clinton administration's failure to alert them to
a huge U.S. undercover operation to stop money laundering by
Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are hopeful that the testimony of Carrera and
other new witnesses may eventually prompt Ruiz Massieu to testify
himself about allegations of corruption in the inner circle of
former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The discovery of more
than $130 million that was deposited in Swiss banks by Salinas'
elder brother, Raul, has led to corruption investigations in
Europe, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials said Mexico's decision to allow Carrera to
testify here was probably most important for the precedent it sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely important to the relationship,'' one U.S.
law-enforcement official said. ``When you have as much cross-border
crime as we and Mexico have, the ability to share these witnesses
is a significant breakthrough for our ability to prosecute.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ruiz Massieu, Cathy Fleming, said that Carrera's
reported testimony contradicted previous sworn statements he had
given. She said, ``If he tells the truth now, Mario will have no
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The two governments have traded court witnesses and confidential
informants many times before. But Carrera is the first witness to
reach the United States from the upper ranks of the Mexican
government after taking advantage of a new law that has modernized
that country's justice system by allowing prosecutors to protect
cooperative witnesses and plea-bargain with criminals.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance is also notable because Mexican officials said
they might yet try again to extradite Ruiz-Massieu to face drug or
corruption charges in Mexico. Ruiz-Massieu's former secretary,
Maria Dolores Mota, has also begun to cooperate with the Mexican
authorities after spending more than three years as a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Carrera, 55, held senior posts in Mexico's prison system and
police force during most of the six years Salinas was president. He
also worked closely with Ruiz Massieu, who served twice as a deputy
attorney general and who, during six months in 1994, supervised
federal police and anti-drug operations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Ruiz Massieu fled Mexico in early 1995 and was arrested at
Newark International Airport, Carrera was charged in Mexico City
with having helped him to cover up the role of Raul Salinas in
ordering a political assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities never made a case against Carrera at
that time, he was arrested again in late March during a raid by the
new Organized Crime Unit of the police force he once led.
Confronted with what was by then considerable evidence of his
involvement in drug trafficking and other crimes, he opted to
become the new squad's most important cooperating witness to date.
</P>
<P>
   Carrera is now serving a a four-year prison sentence as part of
his plea bargain. In court proceedings this year in Mexico City, he
has confirmed much of what U.S. officials long suspected about him.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as the warden of the Mexico City prison where he
is now being held, Carrera told a Mexican court, he met several
major drug traffickers as inmates. Shortly after he took over as a
commander in the Federal Judicial Police, one inmate, Amado
Carrillo Fuentes, had been released and summoned him to a safehouse
in a stylish Mexico City neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   According to a summary of Carrera's testimony reported in the
Mexico City newspaper Reforma, ``He asked whether he would be given
protection to continue in his drug-trafficking activities. Adrian
Carrera told the trafficker he would dispatch police agents to
guard him and he promised not to persecute him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrera said he met Amado Carrillo again in 1993, and repeated
that he would not to bother him in Mexico City. The trafficker
handed Carrera an attache case containing more than $300,000 in
cash, and, he shouted to one of his lieutenants to buy the police
official a new Cadillac _ ``the most luxurious one there was.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrera was also quoted as saying he earned a commission of
$1,500 for every kilogram of cocaine he allowed to move freely to
the United States through Mexico. If true, that account would
underscore how payoffs to Mexican officials exploded in the early
1990s after traffickers there began to demand a cut of as much as
half the cocaine they smuggled for Colombian cartels. Until then,
the Colombians had typically paid their Mexican partners between
$1,000 and $2,000 for each kilo transported north; thereafter, the
Mexicans began to earn as much as $10,000 a kilo by selling their
shares of the cocaine directly to U.S. distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Carrera's account appears to conflict with U.S.
intelligence reports compiled even before he took over as head of
the federal police.
</P>
<P>
   According to several officials, one such report quoted an
informant as saying that Carrera had been Amado Carrillo's honored
guest at a ranch south of Mexico City in July 1993. Another report,
a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, states that
Carrera ``allegedly took bribes from the drug cartels to protect
their drug shipments and appoint Mexican Federal Judicial Police
comandantes working for the drug lords.''
</P>
<P>
   At their own initiative, Mexican law-enforcement officials
arranged to bring Carrera to Houston, where he testified June 3 to
a federal grand jury that was just starting to hear new evidence
against Ruiz Massieu compiled largely by investigators from the
U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony had already been scheduled when a diplomatic
uproar broke out over revelations that Customs agents had operated
undercover in Mexico as part of a huge money-laundering sting
called Operation Casablanca. Still, U.S. officials said they were
surprised and relieved when Mexican law enforcement officials
apparently decided it would serve no purpose to postpone or cancel
Carrera's scheduled visit to Houston despite the furor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a civil proceeding last year, the same U.S. attorneys won the
forfeiture of some $8 million that they said was bribe money from
narcotics traffickers that Ruiz Massieu had stashed in Texas banks.
</P>
<P>
   Until now investigators have not been able to make a criminal
case against him in the United States. He has also overcome four
attempts by the Mexican government to win his extradition from New
Jersey, where he was first jailed on Customs charges, then held
under house arrest on immigration charges case and is now awaiting
the outcome of a deportation case against him.
</P>
<P>
   According to two officials familiar with Carrera's secret
testimony in Houston, he told the grand jury that in 1993, Ruiz
Massieu learned that Carrera was growing rich on the traffickers'
bribes and was angry that he was being left out.
</P>
<P>
   That was a problem for Carrera because Ruiz Massieu was his
direct superior at the attorney general's office and because both
Ruiz Massieu and his elder brother, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu,
had helped Carrera win his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrera said his relationship with Ruiz Massieu was
deteriorating because Ruiz Massieu was not getting a piece of the
action,'' said one official, who like others, spoke on the
condition he not be named. ``So he took affirmative steps to
correct that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Between November 1993 and August 1994, Carrera delivered six
cash payments of about $300,000 each to Mario Ruiz Massieu, he was
quoted as having testified. The timing coincides closely with cash
deposits that court records show Ruiz Massieu having made in his
Texas accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it remained somewhat unclear from Carrera's
testimony what if anything Ruiz Massieu might have done in return
for the money. But Carrera said he collected the cash from a couple
of federal police commanders in the provinces who were being paid
directly by the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   According to police intelligence reports from both countries,
one of the two commanders whom Carrera named, David Grajeda Lara,
was the central figure in the diversion of some eight ons of
cocaine that was seized by Mexican highway police officers after it
was flown to the remote airstrip of a mining company near the
northern town of Sombrerete in August 1993. Mexican and U.S.
officials said Grajeda, who later reportedly died of a heart
attack, seized the confiscated cocaine on behalf of the Federal
police and then sold it back to the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu was later in charge of an investigation into the
reported diversion. His inspectors found no evidence of wrongdoing,
but U.S. agents later seized part of the shipment as it came across
the border. Grajeda Lara was promoted to the federal police command
in Monterrey, the most important city in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican officials have hinted that in debriefings with the
Organized Crime Unit, Carrera has provided incriminating
information against not only Ruiz Massieu but also against Raul
Salinas and others close to the former president. Raul Salinas
remains in jail in Mexico on charges of ordering the murder of Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, and officials in Switzerland said they will
soon confiscate more than $132 million that Salinas deposited in
banks there, asserting that it came from drug traffickers' bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican officials cautioned that although Carrera was
apparently close to Carlos Salinas' private secretary, Justo Ceja _
another secret U.S. intelligence report made available to The New
York Times quotes an informant as saying that they attended the
Super Bowl together in Atlanta in 1994 _ his contacts with the
Salinas family were still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, U.S. investigators did not hide their hope that if Ruiz
Massieu is faced with the prospect of going to jail on money
laundering or drug-conspiracy charges, he might finally agree to
testify about his own knowledge of the former president's closest
associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now he has held out pretty well,'' one law-enforcement
official said of Ruiz Massieu. ``We'll see how it goes if he gets
indicted.''

   Age took its time &QL; 
in catching Nicklaus
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN Joe Lunchbucket quits his job, he is considered in a state of
grace if he gives his boss two weeks' notice. Jack Nicklaus gave
the fans _ the only boss he ever really had _ two years. If we work
it right, two years will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   You don't adjust overnight to the idea of the PGA Tour without
Nicklaus. Of course, he won't just drop through a trapdoor and
disappear. He will play in the occasional Open Championship, and a
few Senior events, picking his spots. No one ever more fully earned
that right.
</P>
<P>
   He has given himself plenty of time to arrange his exit and to
do it gracefully, a Nicklaus trademark. Two weeks ago, he withdrew
from the British Open because of a bum hip. He hadn't missed a
British Open _ or any of the last 154 majors _ in 36 years. So a
decision he had circled before now became firm. At 58, in less than
perfect health, he knew it was time to rejoin his age group. The
transition will be a gradual one. He will not play again in 1998
after he competes in the U.S. Senior Open in late July.
</P>
<P>
   When the historians rank Nicklaus among the icons of golf, it
won't be his endurance that they praise. He will be cherished for
his consistency, his precision, his gift for winning the big ones.
He was touched by the starlight. If the fans loved him any less
than they loved Arnold Palmer, their affection for Jack grew with
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Master of the majors
</P>
<P>
   He won 18 majors, including the Masters six times, the last at
46. His prime was as prime as it gets. This was one Jack who went
up the hill and never really came down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the fact that he was winning at 46 didn't make him
immortal. At roughly the same age, George Foreman was boxing for
millions. Satchel Paige pitched in a World Series. George Blanda
came off the bench to throw a touchdown pass. Gordie Howe slammed a
rival into the boards and slapped home a goal. Jerry Lee Lewis
married a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Jack didn't climb the Himalayas or wrestle an alligator. So what
did he do that made him so special? Simply this: He played his game
better, in his 40s, than anyone else had ever played theirs. Now, a
dozen years later, the news of his departure from the tour still
has the capacity to sadden his fans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the week he won his sixth Masters, everyone wanted a
piece of him. He was virtually out of radio contact with Planet
Earth. I surveyed friends and strangers, wondering, If you could
ask Jack Nicklaus one question, what would it be?
</P>
<P>
   The best one was, ``What does a person do with six identical
green jackets?'' The obvious answer was that he waits each year
with great enthusiasm for St. Patrick's Day. To my surprise, Jack
said it was no problem, mainly because the lords of Augusta
National never gave him another after the first one. At the time,
Jack weighed 220 pounds, and his coat was from Pudge City.
</P>
<P>
   If the jacket doesn't fit ...
</P>
<P>
   He shed 25 pounds, and at the ceremony after his second victory,
the coat no longer fit. The club officials borrowed one that had
belonged to a distinguished member, now deceased, Tom Dewey, the
former governor of New York who lost the historic 1948 presidential
election to Harry Truman. In the end, Jack had a coat tailored for
him by Hart, Schaffner and Marx. It was a 42 regular and still
hangs today, alone, in his locker at Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Jack came within two strokes of leading the 1998
Masters before finishing in a tie for sixth. He does not get the
length on his drives that he once did. But now and then, he can
reach back and find the power of old. The past few years, he worked
harder on his short game. He had never really needed one.
</P>
<P>
   He never lost his competitive edge, or his mental edge. His
concentration was so total, said his fellow pros, that a 747 could
crash two blocks away while he was putting and he wouldn't hear it.
</P>
<P>
   It may or may not be generally known, but Nicklaus has always
been nearsighted and colorblind. At Augusta, they put up the
numbers in green and red, and Jack never knew where he stood. When
he started his own tournament, they painted the scoreboard in red
and black, so he could see who the leaders were. In hundreds of
tourneys, for more than 40 years, his name was often among them.
</P>
<P>
   Golf opened the doors that made Jack a multimillionaire. In a
sense, he turned the American dream on its head. Most middle-aged
men hope they become rich so they can play golf and escape the
pressures of their 9-to-5 lives. But Jack enjoys the time he spends
in his office, checking out the Nicklaus empire. Today, he plays
business. It is his escape from golf.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he and we will find out how much the world of golf will
miss having Nicklaus as a client and a patron.

L.A. MAYOR SERVES SHIFT AS EDITOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Mayor Richard Riordan, every politician's
dream came true Tuesday: He got to run a newspaper his way.
</P>
<P>
   As editor for a day at the Daily News, Riordan couldn't complain
about the outcome. Working with Publisher Ike Massey and Editor
David J. Butler, the mayor good-naturedly participated in the
process of deciding some of the content of today's paper.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he took his role seriously, from discussing editorial
stands _ He called one editor at 10:50 a.m. to vent about a story _
to selecting news stories, photos and design for the front page and
even helping to make the call on the top headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Riordan said after his 90-minute stint. ``It
gives you a better appreciation of what is required, and I was
impressed with the give and take of editors and how they stand up
for their positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he was impressed with how Riordan ran the news
meeting and made decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed an appreciation for the issues that matter to our
Valley readers, and he understands what is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday's news meeting turned out like most others: debate,
discussion and pretty much a consensus among the editors about what
should be on the front page,'' Butler said. ``The mayor listened,
piped right in and offered good ideas and asked good questions.
With a little practice, he could become a good headline writer,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation was extended to give the mayor, who has taken on
a variety of jobs in his five years in office, an opportunity to
learn what goes into publishing a daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan asked pointed questions of different editors and made
suggestions _ and some speeches _ about issues on which he has
strong feelings.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested possible follow-up stories on everything from the
economy and home sales to city and school issues.
</P>
<P>
   With the mayor in the newsroom, there was a side benefit for
reporters: He was even more readily available than usual for
comments.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps to the dismay of editors, Riordan dismissed the
challenge of being an editor. ``It was easy. I like to make quick
decisions. It's what I do best.''

BALDWIN TELLS COURT HE FEARED FOR FAMILY'S SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actor Alec Baldwin testified that a rough-and-tumble encounter
with a ``wild-eyed'' tabloid photographer in 1995 has forced him to
fear for the safety of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cameraman Alan Zanger is suing Baldwin for assault in a scuffle
outside Baldwin's Woodland Hills house in October 1995. At the
time, Baldwin and his wife _ Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger _
had just returned from the hospital with their newborn daughter,
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is countersuing Zanger for invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident with Zanger changed everything in our lives,''
the star of ``Hunt for Red October'' told jurors in Van Nuys
Superior Court on Tuesday. ``It changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin testified that his relationship with the press and
public generally has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' he said, ``your problems begin when people stop
asking you for your autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance Tuesday filled the courtroom with reporters. The
40-year-old actor tried _ unsuccessfully _ to avoid photographers
and cameramen by using a secret entrance, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the scuffle, Zanger had been hiding inside his
truck to videotape the famous couple, and he says Baldwin fractured
his nose. Baldwin was acquitted of misdemeanor battery charges in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said his home in Woodland Hills, a Los Angeles suburb,
now has a large security gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we live in Woodland Hills is that people
wouldn't expect us to live in Woodland Hills,'' the actor said,
adding that he had ``never, prior to this incident, had anybody
hiding in a car in front of my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin testified that Basinger had just given birth through a
Caesarean section, was ``almost doubled over in pain'' and ``in no
mood to be photographed or videographed.''
</P>
<P>
   A bodyguard also suggested the couple could prevent a possible
kidnapping by making sure no one photographed or videotaped their
child, Baldwin testified.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple arrived home from Cedars Sinai Medical Center,
Baldwin noticed a truck with tinted windows parked by his home. He
knocked on the windows but no one responded, so he sprayed shaving
cream on the truck's windows to cut off the view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the nonconfrontational solution to my problem
at the time,'' the actor testified.
</P>
<P>
   Zanger got out and continued filming, despite Baldwin's
``polite'' requests to stop, the actor testified. Baldwin said
Zanger then tried to hit him with the camera, at which point he
knocked the camera into Zanger's face in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trial, Zanger testified that Baldwin charged him,
punched him in the face and kicked him _ all without provocation.
Zanger contends the run-in left him with dizziness and other
physical ailments, causing his income to drop from $276,000 in 1995
to just $78,000 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is scheduled to resume his testimony today.

 GRIFFEYUS 2 HOMERS POWER SEATTLE (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.1998 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; P &QR; SEATTLE Q With one swing of the bat, Rangers shortstop Kevin
Elster brought
hope to a team that looked tired and listless last night.
 &QL; P &QR; Minutes later, Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. crushed
that hope
with one more lethal swing of his bat.  &QL; P &QR; GriffeyUs two-run homer
in the seventh inning, his second of the night,
brought a Rangers comeback to a grinding halt and carried Seattle
to a 6-3 victory at the Kingdome.  &QL; P &QR; The two home runs gave Griffey
39 for the season, one fewer than St. Louis
first baseman Mark McGwire and four more than Chicago Cubs
outfielder Sammy Sosa in their three-way pursuit of Roger MarisU
home run record.  &QL; P &QR; RHeUs a good player. Those things are going to
happen,S Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. RSometimes you just have to tip your cap to a
player like that.S  &QL; P &QR; Meanwhile, Juan GonzalezUs pursuit of Hack
WilsonUs record of 190 runs
batted in has come to a standstill. He is stuck on 101 after not
driving in a run on the six-game road trip.  &QL; P &QR; The Rangers finished
the trip with a three-game losing streak. They had a
chance to move back into first place in the American League West
but instead remain one-half game behind the Anaheim Angels, who
lost to Oakland. The Rangers return home tonight to play the
Baltimore Orioles, who are riding a six-game winning streak.  &QL; P &QR; The
Rangers managed two hits through six innings against Mariners
starter
Jeff Fassero. They trailed 4-0 going into the seventh before
Gonzalez led off with an infield single. After he was forced at
second by Ivan Rodriguez, Will Clark doubled to right-center field,
putting runners on second and third.  &QL; P &QR; Mike Simms struck out, but
Elster golfed a 2-1 pitch over the right-center
field fence, cutting the Mariners lead to 4-3.  &QL; P &QR; It was obvious
that the MarinersU seventh would be crucial. They had Alex
Rodriguez, Griffey and Edgar Martinez coming up against Rangers
starter John Burkett. If the Rangers had stopped them, the top of
the order was coming up in the eighth and a rested John Wetteland
was waiting in the bullpen.  &QL; P &QR; RCertainly, when you get back to
within 4-3, youUd like to have a 1-2-3
inning,S Oates said. RIt didnUt work out that way.S  &QL; P &QR; Rodriguez
hit BurkettUs first pitch on the ground through the middle for a
leadoff single. Oates assigned left-hander Scott Bailes the task of
dealing with Griffey. One night earlier Bailes was asked to do the
same thing and got Griffey to hit a grounder to first.  &QL; P &QR; This time
he smashed a two-run blast into the right-field bleachers. The
Rangers never recovered.  &QL; P &QR; Burkett took the loss, dropping his
record to 5-10 with a 5.72 earned-run
average.  &QL; P &QR; RI thought Burkett threw the ball pretty good against a
pretty good-hitting
ballclub,S Oates said. RBut we didnUt get anything going except for
the one inning.S  &QL; P &QR; The Mariners struck quickly against Burkett in
the first with the help of a
mental mistake by Rangers third baseman Fernando Tatis when Joey
Cora hit a 1-2 pitch on a line into the right-field corner. Cora
went for a triple and should have been out. But Tatis took a strong
relay throw from second baseman Mark McLemore too far in front of
the bag, allowing Cora to slide around the tag. He scored on
RodriguezUs ground out.  &QL; P &QR; The Mariners added three runs in the
third inning, the first coming on
GriffeyUs home run into the right-field seats. Martinez singled to
center, David Segui doubled off the top of the wall in right-center
field and Jay Buhner smacked a two-run single up the middle, giving
the Mariners a 4-0 lead.

GRIFFEY'S 2 HOMERS POWER SEATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With one swing of the bat, Rangers shortstop Kevin
Elster brought hope to a team that looked tired and listless last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. crushed
that hope with one more lethal swing of his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's two-run homer in the seventh inning, his second of the
night, brought a Rangers comeback to a grinding halt and carried
Seattle to a 6-3 victory at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The two home runs gave Griffey 39 for the season, one fewer than
St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire and four more than Chicago
Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa in their three-way pursuit of Roger
Maris' home run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player. Those things are going to happen,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``Sometimes you just have to tip
your cap to a player like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Juan Gonzalez's pursuit of Hack Wilson's record of
190 runs batted in has come to a standstill. He is stuck on 101
after not driving in a run on the six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finished the trip with a three-game losing streak.
They had a chance to move back into first place in the American
League West but instead remain one-half game behind the Anaheim
Angels, who lost to Oakland. The Rangers return home tonight to
play the Baltimore Orioles, who are riding a six-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers managed two hits through six innings against
Mariners starter Jeff Fassero. They trailed 4-0 going into the
seventh before Gonzalez led off with an infield single. After he
was forced at second by Ivan Rodriguez, Will Clark doubled to
right-center field, putting runners on second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Simms struck out, but Elster golfed a 2-1 pitch over the
right-center field fence, cutting the Mariners lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious that the Mariners' seventh would be crucial. They
had Alex Rodriguez, Griffey and Edgar Martinez coming up against
Rangers starter John Burkett. If the Rangers had stopped them, the
top of the order was coming up in the eighth and a rested John
Wetteland was waiting in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, when you get back to within 4-3, you'd like to have
a 1-2-3 inning,'' Oates said. ``It didn't work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit Burkett's first pitch on the ground through the
middle for a leadoff single. Oates assigned left-hander Scott
Bailes the task of dealing with Griffey. One night earlier Bailes
was asked to do the same thing and got Griffey to hit a grounder to
first.
</P>
<P>
   This time he smashed a two-run blast into the right-field
bleachers. The Rangers never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett took the loss, dropping his record to 5-10 with a 5.72
earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Burkett threw the ball pretty good against a pretty
good-hitting ballclub,'' Oates said. ``But we didn't get anything
going except for the one inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners struck quickly against Burkett in the first with
the help of a mental mistake by Rangers third baseman Fernando
Tatis when Joey Cora hit a 1-2 pitch on a line into the right-field
corner. Cora went for a triple and should have been out. But Tatis
took a strong relay throw from second baseman Mark McLemore too far
in front of the bag, allowing Cora to slide around the tag. He
scored on Rodriguez's ground out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added three runs in the third inning, the first
coming on Griffey's home run into the right-field seats. Martinez
singled to center, David Segui doubled off the top of the wall in
right-center field and Jay Buhner smacked a two-run single up the
middle, giving the Mariners a 4-0 lead.

THE COLD, HARD FACTS ABOUT ROYAL BIRKDALE 
BY BRUCE JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Behold the sand lizard, the marsh pennywort
and the common toad. They know many things. Proprietors of the sand
dunes at Royal Birkdale, they scoff at your ski hats and overcoats.
It is summer, they say. Come take a refreshing dip in our 41-degree
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   I am inside the press tent at the British Open golf tournament,
which will begin Thursday, allowing that the players can keep their
feet. The wind outside is howling, freezing, unforgiving. The skies
are leaden and the forecast is for ``Get inside, laddie, you'll
catch yer death o'cold.''
</P>
<P>
   And it couldn't be more perfect. The Masters is a warm, still
afternoon at the cathedral. The U.S. Open means gorgeous layouts
and elaborate clubhouses. The British Open is a stark, flat course
in the middle of nowhere, with your hat blowing off and your ball
about two feet deep in a patch of reeds. There isn't much reward
afterward, either, although the Brits don't need much _ just a
scotch without ice or a lukewarm beer.
</P>
<P>
   To find this place, you take the three-hour train ride from
London to Liverpool, where you resist the temptation to find
Michael Owen's place or the Beatles' old hangouts. Pressing on
southward, make a hard left at Bootle, continue earnestly through
Old Roan, and stop when you hear the cheery tune of the willow
warbler. If he's in concert with the coots and mute swans, all the
better. The first hole can't be far away.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of Birkdale _ aside from some of the richest
golf lore of modern times. It doesn't have that brown, bone-dry
look you associate with St. Andrews or Royal Troon. It is
spectacularly green, thanks to the heavy rains of spring. ``I've
never seen it so green,'' marveled Mark O'Meara yesterday. ``The
course is in incredibly great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The fairways may be gorgeous, but the thick, absurdly high rough
makes the Olympic Club's look like your bedroom carpet. Thursday's
first round can't come soon enough for the players, because they're
fresh out of balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit it 30 yards off line and the wind blows it over
some sand dune and you can't even see where it lands, there's no
point in even looking for it,'' said U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen,
who ought to know. He lost five balls in a practice round (not to
be outdone, Tom Lehman lost six). And it's not just the search that
unnerves these guys; they get to freeze along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think even par could win the tournament,'' Janzen said.
``And I'll be amazed if somebody gets through it without a
double-bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   The course is noted for its exotic, carefully preserved
wildlife. As the lizards and toads could tell you, there are two
categories of British Open winners around here: those who
completely lost it afterward, to the point of giving up the game,
and those who were flat-out the best players in the world at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The first category is occupied solely by Ian Baker-Finch, who
won the 1991 tournament and then suffered the strangest golf
breakdown anyone could recall (see the British Open notebook).
</P>
<P>
   The other list would be Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino,
Johnny Miller and Peter Thomson, the great Australian player who
won two of his five British Open titles here in 1954 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In a tournament in which everything is done just so, in the fine
British tradition, Thomson caused a scandal in '54 when he casually
backhanded his final putt into the hole. The notion was somewhat
cavalier, as he won it by just one stroke, and British TV
commentator (and former Ryder Cup player) Peter Alliss called it
``the confidence, stupidity or arrogance of youth.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing compared to the Palmer sensation in '61. In
a single weekend, Palmer made the Open fashionable for American
players and hit the greatest golf shot of all time. That's what
they say around here, anyway. It was the essence of Arnie, that's
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Welchman Dai Rees by a stroke on the final day,
Palmer drove deep into the right rough on 15, about 120 yards from
the green. It was raining, the wind was up, and the ball had
settled beneath a bush, and it was an uphill lie. The only
conceivable play was a little wedge to safety. Instead, Palmer
pulled out a 6-iron and addressed the ball like a man trying to
pummel a rattlesnake. Photographs show a huge chunk of Lancashire
earth being uprooted by the swing _ and the ball came to within 15
feet on a small, plateaued green. Two putts and three holes later,
Palmer had won the tournament. By one shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits are not given to overstatement, but they broke all the
laws here. They actually mounted a plaque to commemorate that shot,
a flat piece of stone with Palmer's name and the date engraved. As
the modern-day players passed by yesterday, they stopped out of
curiosity. Surveying the situation, imagining themselves as Palmer,
they could only laugh, out of sheer respect.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Birkdale is where Lee Trevino outdueled Liang Huan Lu, a
gentleman from Taiwan, in 1971. Trevino was hot, the way only a
natural-born hustler gets hot, having already won the U.S. and
Canadian Opens. While Mr. Lu, as they called him, politely doffed
his porkpie hat to the crowd, Trevino was a fountain of wisecracks.
``We put down my bag to hunt for the ball,'' he'd say after driving
into the thick rough. ``Found the ball, lost the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the course on which Johnny Miller shot a final-day 66 to
win what seemed like his 418th golf tournament and a lot of blond,
mop-haired kids said to themselves, ``That looks easy. Could I do
that?'' (Answer: No.) It was 1976, a tournament that also marked
the arrival of 19-year-old Spaniard Seve Ballesteros, who hit an
astonishingly creative and difficult bump-and-run shot between two
bunkers to birdie the 18th hole and tie for second with Jack
Nicklaus. With full grasp of the moment and what it meant to
European golf, Miller putted out ahead of Ballesteros to allow this
exciting kid the final stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The next Royal Birkdale episode was 1983, when Tom Watson hit
the second greatest shot of all time. By local standards, of
course. In the third round, Hale Irwin had a cinch tap-in at the
14th hole and simply fanned, missing it completely with a
left-handed swipe. ``The only thing worse,'' said Irwin, ``would be
to lose by one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, thanks to Watson, is exactly what happened. Needing a
par-4 on No.18 to secure the victory, Watson lined up a two-iron
from 213 yards on his second shot and drilled it to the heart of
the green. The shot of his life. ``The shot I'll take to the
grave,'' he has often said.
</P>
<P>
   That was Watson's fifth British Open title, leaving him one
short of the record held by British legend Harry Vardon and others.
He has not won one since, but he keeps coming back. The tradition
and all that. I suspect he misses the pennywarts as well.

ANGELS OUT OF CONTROL AS A'S, ROGERS CRUISE 
BY NANCY GAY
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Terry Collins' face said it all, the pained
expression of a frustrated man simmering in his own stomach acid.
It became clear in the opening inning Tuesday that his first-place
Angels were bent on self-destruction, as soon as shortstop Gary
DiSarcina launched a routine putout throw to first base that almost
sailed into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get beat, you get beat. You can't give away runs,''
Collins, the Angels manager, concluded in a huff. And that about
sums it up.
</P>
<P>
   Three messy errors spelled three unearned runs Anaheim could not
afford. All the while, the A's were getting in their licks _
finally _ enough to give a shaky Kenny Rogers the early cushion he
needed and more than enough for an impressive 6-2 victory before
10,231 sun-splashed spectators at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rogers surrendered only four hits and three walks in
earning his ninth win, he left the game after six innings with a
stiff left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs didn't feel good from the beginning and I could feel
it tightening up in that (sixth) inning,'' said Rogers, whose
earned-run average dipped below 3.00 (2.92) for the first time
since April 8. ``I just wanted to finish the inning. Give it a few
days and it'll be OK. I won't miss a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, too. After the three-game implosion against the
Rangers, the A's have done an admirable about-face, much of it
because of fine starting pitching. Until Rogers departed early, A's
starters had tossed at least seven innings in each outing since the
All-Star break, and they have allowed only three earned runs in 43
innings during that span.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has been under fire, but a flicker of life appeared
in the form of Tim Worrell. The right-handed reliever, picked up
Sunday from Cleveland for a player to be named, made his A's debut
and got his new team out of a huge jam in the eighth, when Anaheim
mounted its only real threat.
</P>
<P>
   With two runs in and Garret Anderson on second with one out,
Worrell fell behind 3-1 on catcher Phil Nevin before recovering to
strike him out. Worrell then got pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro to
fly out to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job, getting those last two outs for us. It was
nice for him to get his feet wet,'' said A's manager Art Howe, who
can't help but feel energized by the way his A's are tackling the
division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They were 1-for-11 against the Angels in 1997, and had lost 14
of their past 15 against them before an ego-building three-game
sweep at Anaheim to end the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's five in a row against the AL West front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team's exciting. We have a lot of confidence right now,
and we know we're in the middle of things,'' said Matt Stairs, who
drove in Rickey Henderson with a single to left in the three-run
first and hit a two-out RBI single in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people take us lightly, we're gonna catch people in this
pennant race,'' Stairs said.
</P>
<P>
   Sense the change? There's some swagger in the A's clubhouse, and
it's about time. As they scurry toward the .500 mark, the A's are
realizing that the deficit between third place and first may be as
few as seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to where we were before the break, and we've got a
chance to go forward,'' Howe said. ``Seven out _ that's only a week
of work.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly has not been a good week for the Angels, who have
dropped four of their past six games since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we owe them a lot,'' Stairs said. ``They kind of
embarrassed us last year _ not kind of, they did; I mean, they
kicked our ass last year. So this is revenge. We wanted to come out
and play well, get to them early and we did.'' &QL;

NIGHTMARE OVER FOR BAKER-FINCH 
BY BRUCE JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN NOTES-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ As he walked up the 18th fairway, he swore
he could hear applause in the distance. It was just a weekday round
at Royal Birkdale, nobody in the stands, but for Ian Baker-Finch,
nothing in golf can be ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   This was a month ago, the first time Baker-Finch had played the
course since his spectacular British Open victory in 1991. He shot
a 29 on the front nine that day, finished with a 66, and further
established his reputation as one of the world's best players.
</P>
<P>
   And then he fell apart _ in ways even the most brutal hackers
couldn't understand. Baker-Finch went from a first-rate pro to a
guy who was lucky to shoot 85. He missed 32 straight cuts on the
PGA Tour. He hit a ball at St. Andrews, in the 1995 British Open,
that went 170 yards dead to his left. He went through dozens of
coaches, psychologists, hypnotists; nothing worked. In fact, it got
worse. In last year's British Open at Royal Troon, he shot a 92 _
the worst score by a past champion in modern times. He was gaunt,
hollow-eyed and terrified, at one point hitting a pitiful little
dribbler on what was supposed to be a lofty pitch shot.
</P>
<P>
   And the week after that tournament, he played a casual round
with a friend on his home course, Sanctuary Cove on the Gold Coast
of Queensland, Australia. He shot a 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to do,'' he said, ``is be able to change my
name, come back in a different body, and go play without the
pressure of being Ian Baker-Finch.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of his problems has never been fully explained.
Friends say Baker-Finch is a man of great humility and simply isn't
comfortable with the pressure of competing in majors. It is well
established that while his game is a disaster in public, he plays
beautifully in private _ and he's comfortable with that. Now
retired from the Tour at 37, with a life in broadcasting and course
design, Baker-Finch will be at Royal Birkdale this week as a member
of the ABC television crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relaxed,'' he said before his departure from the United
States. ``I'm really enjoying life again.''
</P>
<P>
   They have always welcomed Baker-Finch around here. They remember
the tender scene of his acceptance speech in '91, the big smile on
his face and the sight of his young daughter, Hayley, happily
tossing sand in a nearby bunker. And then knew he was coming last
month. That  &LR; was  &LR; applause Baker-Finch heard, because club
officials had rigged up loudspeakers to play a tape of him walking
up the 18th in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Baker-Finch said. ``The staff had all
gathered at the windows of the clubhouse, and they were applauding.
It was a marvelous moment, one I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ON SECOND THOUGHT: A trip overseas gives you a new perspective
on things _ the recent U.S. Open at the Olympic Club, for instance.
In the Sunday Telegraph, sportswriter Derek Lawrenson described
Olympic as a ``tricked-up'' course that eliminated the use of the
driver. He called the tournament ``utterly wretched'' and quoted
Irish golf architect Pat Ruddy as saying, ``It was like turning up
to watch a piano concerto, only to find that the pianist is playing
with half the keys missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players, particularly those outside America, hold the
British Open in the highest regard. ``You obviously take any major
that comes along,'' said Ernie Els, ``but the British is (begin
ital) the (end ital) Open championship. The crowds are much larger,
and when you see those stands and feel the atmosphere, all the
history _ it's just different from any other tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   MISCELLANY: Don't miss Tiger Woods if the wind's at his back. He
hauled out his driver in a gale during Monday's practice and hit a
457-yard drive on No. 8. . . . Woods is still playing with four
bodyguards, just as he did at Royal Troon last year. Some feel it
isn't necessary, in light of the polite British crowds, but ``I
feel it's justified,'' he says. ``I don't know how many players get
death threats, or stuff of that nature, but I do.'' . . . Els, who
played the U.S. Open against his physicians' advice, is still
having problems with his back. He plans to take a one-month layoff
after the British Open. . . . No Michael Jordan or Pete Sampras in
big-time golf. The last 15 majors have been won by 15 different
players.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are waning for Colin Montgomerie, who has missed four of
the last six British Open cuts despite being the leading player in
Europe for five years. Trying to be a nice guy, Montgomerie injured
his ankle tripping over a stone as he attempted to sign autographs
during the recent Irish Open. . . . Jack Nicklaus' son, Gary, had a
shot at qualifying at nearby Hillside until he bogeyed the last
three holes, fell into a seven-way playoff and saw a single
qualifying spot go elsewhere. . . . Nick Faldo, battling a nasty
case of golfer's elbow, says he won't know until Thursday morning
if he can play. In practice rounds, he has been putting with one
hand, setting up fairway shots on a tee, or not hitting the ball at
all, just visualizing a shot and walking to where he believes it
would have gone. A Guardian headline called it ``Virtual Faldo.''

 Summer and sports gut-punch England (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ A spot of bother.
</P>
<P>
   A bloody shame, too.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the eve of one of England's most revered athletic
tournaments, the Open (not the British Open, mind you; it's the
Open, and only ninnies from America call it anything else), British
athletes have had some lamentable times lately on the playing
fields, be it Eton or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, of course, was the early departure from the
World Cup. It wasn't that England was a pre-tourney favorite. But
the fact that subsequent results showed no team was clearly
dominant, coupled with the fact that the Brits were ousted from
their national passion by the hated Argentines on a dreadful
shootout, has created a sour regret among Her Majesty's subjects.
</P>
<P>
   As Oliver Holt, London Times columnist, put it, ``It is now
clear they could have beaten them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the blasted French won the thing. British fans and press
have given their Channel brothers a perfunctory salute, but the
politeness hardly hides the sneering contempt the limeys feel
toward the bloody frogs.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers were filled with haughty dismissals of the
laissez-faire attitude of the French toward futbol until the host
country suddenly in the last week found it fashionable to exult
publicly over the appearance in the finals of ``Les Bleus.''
</P>
<P>
   The French, of course, maintain the only contributions to soccer
made by the English in the 32 years since they last won the Coupe
du Monde have been ``les hooligans.'' So pass the champagne, Clive,
and shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Brits had a nice ride at Wimbledon with a
fresh-faced youngster named Tim Henman, who reached the semifinals,
where an Englishman has not won almost since Stonehenge was merely
an idea sketched in Bronze Age mud.
</P>
<P>
   But Henman lost, too. Again, ``Rule Britannia'' stayed stuck in
the throat.
</P>
<P>
   The story was the same for what is known as motorcar racing. The
annual British Grand Prix for Formula One cars was held at
Silverstone on Sunday in a wretched storm that wiped out all but
nine of the 22 entrants.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was German Michael Schumacher, who mastered the mud
far better than the three entrants from the United Kingdom, where
mud was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Another wheeled sport gave hope, however. The Super Bowl of bike
racing, the Tour de France, began Sunday in Dublin, of all places,
where the first day was won by a Brit, of all people.
</P>
<P>
   The tour organizers thought it would be tres chic to put the
prologue segment in a different country every year to help with
hype. It worked brilliantly Sunday because Chris Boardman,
Britain's 1992 Olympic cycling gold medalist, won the segment as
well as major face time on TV and in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Boardman took a header into a concrete wall that
split open his helmet, knocked him cold, sent him to the hospital
and ended his tour. He's OK, which is more than can be said for the
British sporting psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes perhaps the final chance for international sporting
redemption. Starting Thursday, the British specialty of stiff upper
lips will be of tremendous value, because it might be the only
weapon of consequence against elements straight out of an Irish sea
chantey.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that Opens are almost always wind-whipped and
frost-nipped, the 127th annual version that begins Thursday at the
Royal Birkdale Golf Club holds all the allure of an NFC playoff
game in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The club is on the shoreline outskirts of this semi-tony
Lancashire resort town about 40 minutes north of Liverpool. It is
neither the most glamorous nor historic site for this tourney, but,
hard by the Irish Sea in the middle of Britain's most wretched July
since 1980, it could become the most ghastly in terms of damage to
par.
</P>
<P>
   The winds that nearly wrecked the Grand Prix on Sunday were
recorded at 55 mph here among the grass-covered sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the winds calmed some Tuesday, Tom Lehman went out for a
quick nine holes of practice at Birkdale and had to quit after
eight. He ran out of golf balls. Lee Janzen and David Duval lost
five balls each.
</P>
<P>
   The last major tourney before golf's big-timers come to the
Northwest for the PGA next month might be cause for so much
exasperation that it might seem a pleasure to slam a tee shot 30
yards into the heart of a big Douglas fir.
</P>
<P>
   For the locals, the saving grace in this imminent tale may well
be found in the person of Lee Westwood, the precocious 25-year-old
Brit who is playing about as well as anyone in the world right now.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 270 days Westwood has won tournaments in Spain,
Japan, Australia, Germany and the United States. Saturday in
Scotland, in conditions similar to what will be found here this
week, Westwood won the Loch Lomond World Invitational tourney by
four strokes.
</P>
<P>
   As fellow islander Colin Montgomerie put it last week at Loch
Lomond, ``Lee has become the man to beat at every tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   That could well be true. Then again, he's British. That's not a
good sign this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's not been a summer, either, which is an even
worse sign.

PAULBALL: SEAHAWKS SPARE NO EXPENSE IN BUILDING INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sam Adams glares into the camera and bellows, ``We're
alive and kicking. What's up? Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   This eye-bugging challenge by the Seahawks' fifth-year defensive
tackle is the most-lasting image of the club's new $1.5 million
advertising campaign. Adams and 10 of his teammates are featured in
TV and radio spots intended to rejuvenate interest in a franchise
that has been floundering for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the latest indication of how much life has changed
under the do-it-now and damn-the-cost ownership of Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do good things, quality things and do it the right
way,'' club president Bob Whitsitt said yesterday. ``Right now,
we're very excited about what's going on. But we know we have a lot
of work to get the community excited and aware and educated. This
is just one more example of trying to create that excitement and
that awareness that's important to get a focus on football.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Allen had just exercised his option to purchase the
Seahawks from Ken Behring after voters passed a ballot measure to
fund a new football stadium. NFL owners did not approve the sale to
the billionaire co- founder of Microsoft until late August.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months of almost constant change and unprec- edented
upgrades have followed.
</P>
<P>
   The club has hired 30 new employees _ from vice presidents, to
assistant coaches, to ticket sellers, to a new mascot. The team's
headquarters is in the early stages of what will be a
multi-million-dollar renovation and eventual expansion. And for the
second straight offseason, Allen allowed club management to spend
freely in acquiring free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added a lot of people, but we're bringing it to Paul
Allen's standard of operation,'' vice chairman Bert Kolde said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear when Allen's group took control of the club was that
most longtime employees would be fired. Only a handful have been
asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the emphasis has been on creating a marketing
department and bolstering a ticket-sales staff that weren't needed
when the Seahawks were attracting sellout crowds in the late 1980s
and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Seahawks had three vice presidents _ Randy
Mueller, Gary Wright and Mickey Loomis. Now there are eight,
including Harry Hutt, senior VP/marketing and operations; Duane
McLean, VP/ticket sales; Scott Patrick, VP/corporate sales; and
Nathaniel ``Buster'' Brown, VP/chief financial officer, who
replaced Loomis in May.
</P>
<P>
   This is a franchise that deteriorated under the tight- fisted
ownership of Behring and saw its fan base erode during too many
seasons of poor on-field performances and too many off-field
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of characterize it as, we've transformed the
franchise,'' Kolde said. ``We did some marketing research a couple
of months ago and what it showed was that the general perception of
the Seahawks as a franchise was very mediocre, kind of moribund, no
personality or attitude or aggressiveness. We decided to try and
adjust all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV ads are helping _ with ticket sales and in projecting the
players as people. Last week, 450 new season tickets were sold,
Whitsitt said. That pushes the total to almost 42,000 _ still a far
cry from the 61,500 that used to be the norm, but also a
significant improvement from the all-time low of 37,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good look. It gets the Seahawks out there,'' Whitsitt
said of the slick spots that feature players running through the
streets of Seattle. ``It lets the fans know our players a little
bit as people. It's a lot of fun. I'm really happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Publicis in less than two weeks, the campaign is one
of the largest efforts in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widmaier, director of corporate communications for the
NFL, said the league does not chart costs of advertising by its
teams, but the Seahawks' budget is ``an --------------------
impressive figure'' and clearly among the highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said all along, and we meant it, `If you've got Paul
Allen to be an owner, you'll get a lot more than you bargained
for,''' Whitsitt said. ``He will over-deliver and do things
right.''

DODGERS BEAT GIANTS IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After three and a half months and eight and a half
innings, Dodger Stadium finally was rocked to its core.
</P>
<P>
   It happened Tuesday night as Raul Mondesi scored on a wild pitch
by San Francisco's closer Robb Nen that gave the Dodgers a 2-1
victory and a crowd of 41,513 a chance to let loose.
</P>
<P>
   It happened because they realized that regardless of how
disappointing this season has been, the Dodgers have shaved 3{
games off the Giants' wild-card lead in the past six games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it seems they have more to come back for today than
Orel Hershiser's first start here since leaving the Dodgers in
1994. They still trail division-leading San Diego by 12{ games but
are only 4{ back of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi reached base after doubling off the glove of a diving
third baseman Bill Mueller. Giants reliever John Johnstone (2-5)
then intentionally walked Gary Sheffield before giving way to Nen.
Eric Karros struck out and pinch hitter Matt Luke should have ended
the inning with a ground ball to short. But Rey Sanchez bobbled the
ball in a hurried attempt to get a force at second.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie third baseman Adrian Beltre was next and got ahead in the
count 1-0. Nen's next pitch was a breaking ball away and ticked off
the glove of catcher Brian Johnson. The ball rolled 15 feet from
home plate, but it was enough to score Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked in the victory was Scott Radinsky, who blew
away the Giants in the final two innings for his fourth victory in
eight decisions. Radinsky, who had six blown saves during two
months as the Dodgers' closer, was brilliant in holding down the
Giants after Charlie Hayes tied the game at one in the seventh with
an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky struck out five overall and held off the Giants until
Nen's wild pitch scored Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   For six innings, the only run was a fifth-inning homer by
catcher Charles Johnson, who looks like he might be climbing out of
one of his painful-looking batting slumps. Johnson entered the game
just 2 for 19 on this homestand, but he lined a sharp single to
left to open the third.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Johnson who went hitless in 35 at-bats after
reaching base on his first at-bat as a Dodger. He broke that slump
with a May 28 home run against Cincinnati. Tuesday, he came up
again in the fifth with two outs and drove a 1-0 fastball from Mark
Gardner 433 feet into the left-field stands for his 12th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who was shelled for seven runs and nine hits July 4,
the last time he faced the Dodgers, pitched the sixth, then gave
way to Steve Reed. He retired all six batters he faced before
turning the game over to Johnstone.
</P>
<P>
   For six innings, Chan Ho Park looked like the big-game pitcher
of a year ago when he was 5-0 in July and finished tied for the
team lead with 14 victories. He entered the game with a 5-0 record
at Dodger Stadium and was undefeated here in his last 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time he cruised, striking Hayes to end the second,
Brian Johnson to end the fifth and Sanchez to end the sixth. And
though he has been receiving 7.53 runs support per outing, Park
looked like he could make Charles Johnson's home run stand up. One
reason was his control. Park did not walk a batter until he reached
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But he walked Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent to open that inning.
Park appeared to make the play of the night when he fielded J.T.
Snow's tapper to the mound and fired to second to begin a double
play. Stan Javier was next and Park walked him after getting ahead
in the count 1-2. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   As Park walked off, he did not acknowledge the crowd and when he
reached the dugout, he fired his glove at the back wall.
</P>
<P>
   One batter later, the Dodgers' lead was gone. Antonio Osuna took
over and Hayes drove an 0-1 fastball into left field for a base
hit, scoring Bonds. Osuna then hit Brian Johnson on the top of the
right shoulder. Johnson hit the ground and for a moment it looked
serious. But Johnson got up and walked to first.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers stuck with Osuna. They wanted to keep Radinsky
for left-handed hitters Bonds and Darryl Hamilton for the eighth
inning. Osuna struck out pinch hitter Mueller to end the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky came on for the eighth and did allow a single to
Sanchez. But he struck out Hamilton and Bonds. Kent, who hit a home
run Monday, was next and Radinsky struck him out to end the inning.

ANGELS' JULY NO JUNE BLOOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital) Streams of unconsciousness while wondering how much
pocket cash Michael Eisner carries with him: (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the suits in charge of Disney Sports, the guys at the
top of the Angels' food chain, not Bill Bavasi or Terry Collins:
</P>
<P>
   Those things on the floor at the bottom of your feet are the
arms of your pitching staff. They've actually been falling now for
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't exactly take a baseball purist to recognize that the
Angels' June boom was one of those kismet-like moments in time.
Despite a staff that was half-injured and half-humble, the Angels
won 22 games in June.
</P>
<P>
   This was gravy. This was a blessing from the baseball gods for
Collins and his players. The Angels' upper echelon, however, looked
at it and decided that all was well and that there was no need or
hurry to spend some bucks and acquire an extra arm.
</P>
<P>
   Now, naturally, the same no-names and retreads who rescued the
team in June are having problems in July. This was predictable.
Omar Olivares was cut loose by Seattle, a team as shorthanded as a
renaissance-era statue. Jarrod Washburn is a rookie. To think they
would keep going like the Eveready Rabbit was incredibly
short-sighted.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the market has been empty. There are eight or nine
teams that would be happy to accept cash and/or an A Level prospect
in exchange for a 30-ish pitcher who can give the Angels some
innings and their current rotation some rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have let Texas get back into the A.L. West race. The
Rangers have already had their slump, and in general they are a
better team than the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   If management can't spring the bucks for another pitcher right
now, it might as well forget about it until 1999. ...
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda acknowledged this week, for the first time, that
his age is a factor in his staying on as the Dodgers' general
manager, both in terms of what's good for him as well as the club.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if the Foxies and Dodgers president Bob Graziano
wanted to keep him on, he would welcome having an assistant G.M. to
handle some of the paper workload.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he's sensitive to some fan and media concerns that
he's only interested in what the Dodgers do today, and not
tomorrow. ``I want to get this team to the point where it is
competitive for the next five years and beyond,'' said Lasorda.
``No one cares more about what happens to this franchise as I do.''
...
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon, the pitcher acquired from the Mets to fill the
Dodgers' fifth spot in the rotation, allowed three home runs in
Sunday's loss to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   His next start? Friday in St. Louis against Mark McGwire. Maybe
Busch Stadium fans in left field should be equipped with flak
jackets. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Who's Who nature of the U.S. basketball team headed to the
world championships six of the 15 players played in the CBA last
year stands in contrast to the pace of NBA veterans and rookies
currently dropping by the FILA Summer Pro League at the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Mason played Tuesday, on the heels of Lamond Murray, the
O'Bannons, and a variety of other former UCLA stars. The NBA Stars
and NBA Rookies teams play in tonight's doubleheader starting at 5
p.m., with Jalen Rose and Tracy McGrady among those scheduled to
play. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think it's safe to say that Bob Davie's reign as the football
coach at Notre Dame will end after his second year.
</P>
<P>
   The age discrimination trial currently under way in South Bend
has underscored exactly what kind of person Davie is. Joe Moore,
the former line coach who filed the suit, testified that Davie was
at the core of former Lou Holtz assistants who undermined Holtz at
the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And in response to the suit, Davie testified that he didn't fire
Moore because he was old, but because he struck players and didn't
wash his car often. Well, one of those players Davie said was
struck testified in the case for Moore. All this supports a bunch
of stories about Davie that circulated before he was hired.
</P>
<P>
   It's both ironic and comforting to know that the only college
football program more screwed up than USC is Notre Dame. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's one vote for the Mighty Ducks to hire Butch Goring as its
new coach. The former King center and why hasn't his jersey been
retired? lasted slightly more than one season as the Bruins' head
coach in the mid-80s. He's since put in many good years in the
minors perfecting his craft.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if any coach can win given Disney's spending
restraints, but I'd love to see Goring get the opportunity. ...
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how many of those people newly infatuated by soccer
during the World Cup will now start attending Galaxy games?
</P>
<P>
   Not many. The one aspect of the World Cup that has made me tune
in every four years, and tune out soon thereafter, is the
understanding that this is the best tournament on the planet played
by its best talent.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Z.Z., Ronaldo and the Laudrop brothers, how am I
supposed to ratchet down my expectations for the MLS, with its
over-the-hill imports and handful of American headliners, or any
visiting club teams from Mexico and South America?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: I won't. I will wait for the next World Cup.
...
</P>
<P>
   True story. Late in the second half of the Brazil-Netherlands
game, my 6-year-old son came into the house and demanded control of
the TV remote.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if he would watch the end of the soccer game with me
before returning to Nickelodeon. He agreed, reluctantly. I spent
the next few minutes trying to explain the game and that these were
two of the best teams in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they call time outs?'' Chris asked me as the medics
ran on the field with a stretcher. I tried to explain penalty time,
but gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the clock running the wrong way?'' my son asked a few
moments later. Not having a clue myself, I advised him to watch the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes passed. Three. Four. Five. Finally, my son sighs and
says, softly, ``This is pretty boring.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, you just can't fool kids.

SEATTLE GOLF SCENE HAD NICKLAUS' STAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were one of his first dates. Before he became a certifiable
golf legend, unbelievably wealthy or even the Golden Bear, Jack
Nicklaus and Seattle were an item.
</P>
<P>
   But his hip hurts now, forcing him to skip next month's PGA
Championship at Redmond's Sahalee Country Club, as well as this
week's British Open. His record 146 consecutive majors played, 154
total, is history. End of era.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say what's more disconcerting: That Nicklaus, at
58, is finally showing his age; or the realization that the game's
greatest player likely has swung his last competitive club in our
neighborhood, fueled by his announcement that he won't play past
2000 in any major or regular tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Once he steps out, we will have to rely on memories when we
think of Jack Nicklaus. Ours are superior to most. In Seattle, we
saw him at his best and _ few people can make this claim _ his
worst.
</P>
<P>
   He sampled our fairways in 1962, 1963 and 1965, competing in the
Greater Seattle Open. On his first trip here, the 22-year-old tour
rookie got Tiger Woods treatment. Curious stares, overflow
galleries, the golf messiah label. Every move and word was
recorded. Nicklaus Will Check In Today, declared one P-I headline.
</P>
<P>
   He did not disappoint. Three months after recording his first
pro victory at the 1962 U.S. Open, he collected his second win at
Broadmoor Golf Club. He shot 67, 65, 65 and 68 for a 15-under-par
265 total to beat the late Tony Lema by two strokes. Nicklaus was
rewarded with $4,300 and breakfast at the Space Needle, at the
height of the World's Fair. He shared his golf vision, one that
would prove unwavering.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Broadmoor press corps, Nicklaus mesmerized his
audience with his disarming honesty and confidence. ``Sure, I'm
going for titles and records, the same as Arnie (Palmer) and Gary
(Player),'' he said. ``The money and the other good things come
with the titles. It's a little early for me to be thinking about
records yet, but I'm sure going to go after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, the Nicklaus message remains unchanged.
At the U.S. Open in San Francisco last month, he was asked to
reflect on his magical career and said simply, ``I came along and I
got to be king of the hill. I think it's important to get to the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   What was different at Broadmoor and Inglewood was his appearance
and nickname. He was chunky and wore a crewcut. He would not become
the Golden Bear, a dashing figure, until later touring Australia,
when a Melbourne sportswriter decided the visiting golfer resembled
``a cuddly, golden bear.''
</P>
<P>
   At Broadmoor, Nicklaus drew a number of labels that didn't
stick. Baby Beef. The Baby Bull of the Buckeye State. Ohio Fats.
The Fat Kid from Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   His immense popularity was obvious from the start. Wrote late
P-I columnist Royal Brougham: ``When Jack Nicklaus larruped one of
his 300-yard drives straight down the middle of the fairway in
Wednesday's warmup, the roar from the gallery made you think Roger
Maris had just hit a home run in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Nicklaus only fouled them off. He had a bad case
of the hooks and four-putted his first hole at Inglewood Country
Club. He shot 77 and 72, and missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   His despair was captured in a P-I front-page headline: Nicklaus
11 Strokes Behind. He had gone 28 tour events before missing his
first cut, and an injury was responsible. After Inglewood, he
wouldn't miss another cut for two years. But to the dismay of
organizers of the 1963 Greater Seattle Open, he had bombed.
</P>
<P>
   After apologizing to the tournament committee for his lackluster
performance, Nicklaus faced reporters. Making no excuses, he scored
points with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry I couldn't have played better,'' he said. ``I
always enjoy coming to the Northwest to play and I wanted to do
everything I could to help the tournament. I'm just hitting the
ball so bad and I couldn't make a putt from eight inches. But I've
had 77s before and I'll probably have them again. It's just one of
those things and there's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus also promised he would return to Seattle and redeem
himself in 1964, when the tournament shifted back to Broadmoor. He
never made it, taking the week off instead.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years before Nicklaus re-entered the Greater Seattle
Open, which had returned to Inglewood. He was hardly on a mission.
Once in the area, he went fly-fishing and relaxed. Little was made
of his earlier failure at the Kenmore course. In fact, the P-I
picked him to win the 1965 event. There were no arguments from the
rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Nicklaus is the best golfer who ever lived,'' golfer Doug
Sanders said on the eve of the event. ``He's going to stay at the
top as long as he wishes. Who's better? He can murder you with his
tee shots, is a master of the wedge and a fine putter. Jack might
as well throw his irons away. With his woods, who needs an iron?
He's young and he's strong. Nicklaus has overtaken Arnie Palmer and
nobody will ever catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tournament, at least 16 guys did, including Sanders.
Nicklaus shot 69, 74, 72 and 70 for a 3-under 285 and $1,407
payday. He finished in a seven-way tie for ninth place; Sanders
lost in a playoff to Gay Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus bypassed the 1966 Greater Seattle-Everett Open, the
last showing before the event was disbanded and a 32-year tour void
set in. He returned in 1981 and 1984 to play in fund-raising
exhibitions, drawing big crowds at Seattle Golf Club and Sahalee,
but it wasn't quite the same. He set the course record at Sahalee,
shooting 5-under 67, a mark that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the PGA Championship headed for the Redmond course
this summer, Nicklaus felt no special tug to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played it once, and I don't hardly remember it,'' he said
candidly in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, however, is doing his part to re-establish the tour in
the Seattle area. He has designed the Snoqualmie Ridge Tournament
Players Course, now under construction and expected to host a
late-summer PGA stop, possibly as soon as next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need something in the Pacific Northwest,'' he said. ``It
certainly has a lot of people who like to play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, a significant number of them took up the game after
watching a chubby kid with a flattop and big swing march down our
fairways.

<P>
   America West Airlines has agreed to pay the largest fine in the
history of U.S. aviation to settle allegations of lax maintenance
and operations violations.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 million civil penalty involves 26 planes, one-quarter
of the Phoenix-based carrier's fleet, the Federal Aviation
Administration said Tuesday. Safety officials found, among other
things, that 17 of America West's Airbus A320s flew without
``significant structural inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   America West officials characterized its problems as procedural
oversights and maintained that the airline is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best safety record in the industry over the past
15 years,'' said America West Chief Executive Officer &UR; Richard
Goodmanson. ``In all our discussions, safety never came up.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA settlement totals $5 million, but federal regulators
agreed to waive half of that if the carrier meets various
maintenance terms of the settlement over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a big deal here that's going to require
quite an effort by the air carrier,'' said Tom Stuckey, the FAA's
acting deputy director of flight standards.
</P>
<P>
   America West flew more than 41,000 hours over two years in
violation of Federal Aviation Regulations. The airline ignored at
least some of the requirements, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it was an inadvertent omission,'' Stuckey
said. ``But after we pointed out problems, there were some
additional flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carrier did not feel that those inspections needed to be
accomplished, &UR; or they were devising a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department
of Transportation and a critic of the FAA's safety record, agreed
that the airline has a good safety record. It ranks second best,
behind Southwest Airlines, for its rate of accidents and incidents,
she said in a telephone interview from her home in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the fine is evidence of a tougher FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Schiavo said the $5 million fine, even if only half of it is
collected, is ``phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's settlement does not clear America West from stepped-up
safety surveillance instituted in June.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, federal regulators will be watching the nation's
ninth-largest carrier more closely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that . . . this is a brand new program tells you this
would be the safest airline to fly, not the other way around,''
Goodmanson said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement centers on 26 of America West's 104-aircraft
fleet. The FAA singled out 17 Airbus A320s, which flew without
visual structural inspections; eight Boeing 737s, which were
missing cargo netting; and one Boeing 757, which was missing an
elevator actuator, which controls the jetliner's tail flap for
ascent and descent.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring those inspections could be disastrous in the worst
case, Schiavo said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, America West was cited for failing to inspect the
fuselage skin around the cargo and crew doors of 17 Airbuses. These
inspections can turn up cracks, which, left untended, could be
deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cracks in the fuselage are not like dings in the paint,''
Schiavo said. ``They have literally brought down planes.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened in 1988, when an Aloha Airlines jet's top peeled
back, sucking a flight attendant out to her death.
</P>
<P>
   If cargo netting isn't properly installed, bundles and bags can
shift about in flight, throwing a plane off balance. In 1987, Fine
Airlines crashed in Miami when a cargo load shifted on takeoff,
sliding to the back of the plane and tilting the plane's nose
upward. The plane crashed, killing the crew and several people on
the ground, she said.
</P>
<P>
   America West noted that although one of the actuators for the
tail-flap mechanism was not working, the backup was. But, Schiavo
said, redundancy is the key to airline safety, and without a
backup, the critical tail unit was at risk. The tail allows a plane
to climb, descend and maintain flight.
</P>
<P>
   America West operates 27 Airbus A320s, which it began flying in
the early '90s. The carrier also operates 64 Boeing 737s and 13
Boeing 757s.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA settlement made no mention of the 737-100 used to
shuttle the Phoenix Suns basketball team to and from games. The
jetliner, one of the oldest in its fleet, had problems with its
turbulence-controlling yaw damper. The airline also failed to keep
up on maintenance of the aircraft by failing to respond to
airworthiness directives from the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonsense, complete nonsense,'' Goodmanson said. ``The
plane has virtually been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be totally confident to put my wife and kids on the plane
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   America West has five days to pay the fine. Goodmanson said the
airline, which reported revenue of $1.9 billion and a profit of $75
million last year, won't have a problem paying the amount.
</P>
<P>
   If America West doesn't meet the requirements of the settlement,
it will have to pay the full $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants said they felt vindicated by the FAA's action
since it was clear that the problems stemmed from inspection
lapses, not labor troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, America West officials blamed the FAA's heightened
scrutiny, in part, on its ongoing labor negotiations with pilots
and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's Stuckey said the labor dispute flagged regulators to
potential problems, but was not the cause of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McGlashen, president of Council 66 of the Association of
Flight Attendants, said Tuesday's move ``dispels any misconception
that the airline's troubles with the FAA are the result of
protracted negotiations with its flight attendants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' McGlashen said. ``We don't negotiate
safety. We don't use safety issues as a way to gain negotiation
leverage. It never has been or will be in our plan. We don't
conduct concerted plans to call the FAA.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants are scheduled to sit down next month with
company officials and a federal arbitrator to discuss compensation
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Steinman, head of the airline's pilot union, said the
settlement shows that the FAA's allegations must be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged that steps have already been taken, but I would
urge our management to exceed the regulatory requirements,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the largest fine ever agreed to by an airline. While
higher fines have been assessed, they have all been negotiated to
smaller amounts. For example, Eastern Airlines was fined $9.5
million but settled for about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said the only penalty larger than the America West
sanction was a $5 million fine against a company that wasn't an
airline _ Chrome Alloy, a repair company based in Illinois. &QL;

DODGERS BEAT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After three and half months and eight and a half
innings, Dodger Stadium finally was rocked to its core.
</P>
<P>
   It happened Tuesday night as Raul Mondesi scored on a wild pitch
by San Francisco closer Robb Nen that gave the Dodgers a 2-1
victory and a crowd of 41,513 a chance to let loose.
</P>
<P>
   It happened because the fans realized that regardless of how
disappointing this season has been, the Dodgers have shaved 3{
games off the Giants' wild-card lead in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it seems they have more to come back for today than
Orel Hershiser's first start here since leaving the Dodgers in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was electricity in the air in the ninth inning,''
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``It just seemed something good
was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory didn't change the Dodgers' place in the National
League West. They trail division-leading San Diego by 12{ games.
But by handing the Giants their fifth consecutive loss since the
All-Star break, the Dodgers moved to within 4{ games of the top
wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losing streak isn't planned,'' said Giants manager Dusty
Baker, who dropped three to Colorado to start the second half.
``I'm bewildered why we lose to teams in the West. Concerned, yes.
Worried, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi reached base after doubling off the glove of diving
third baseman Bill Mueller. Giants reliever John Johnstone (2-5)
then intentionally walked Gary Sheffield before giving way to Nen.
Eric Karros struck out and pinch hitter Matt Luke should have ended
the inning with a ground ball to short. But Rey Sanchez bobbled the
ball in a hurried attempt to get a force at second.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie third baseman Adrian Beltre was next and got ahead in the
count 1-0. Nen's next pitch was a breaking ball away and ticked off
the glove of catcher Brian Johnson. The ball rolled 15 feet from
home plate, but it was enough to score Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked in the victory was Scott Radinsky, who blew
away the Giants in the final two innings for his fourth victory in
eight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky, who had six blown saves during two months as the
Dodgers' closer, was brilliant in holding down the Giants after
Charlie Hayes tied the game at one in the seventh with an RBI
single against Antonio Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky struck out five overall and held off the Giants until
Nen's wild pitch scored Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I saw great velocity and a lot of confidence,'' said
pitching coach Charlie Hough, who played with Radinsky on the
Chicago White Sox. ``When he came off the mound, you could see in
his eyes that the confidence was back.''
</P>
<P>
   For six innings, the only run was a fifth-inning homer by
Dodgers catcher Charles Johnson, who looks like he might be
climbing out of one of his painful-looking batting slumps. Johnson
entered the game just 2 for 19 on this homestand, but he lined a
sharp single to left to open the third. This is the same Johnson
who went hitless in 35 at-bats after reaching base on his first
at-bat as a Dodger. He broke that slump with a May 28 home run
against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he came up again in the fifth with two outs and drove a
1-0 fastball from Mark Gardner 433 feet into the left-field stands
for his 12th home run.
</P>
<P>
   For six innings, Chan Ho Park looked like the big-game pitcher
of a year ago when he was 5-0 in July and finished tied for the
team lead with 14 victories. He entered the game with a 5-0 record
at Dodger Stadium and was undefeated here in his last 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time he cruised, striking out Hayes to end the
second, Johnson to end the fifth and Sanchez to end the sixth. And
though he has been receiving 7.53 runs support per outing, Park
looked like he could make Johnson's home run stand up. One reason
was his control. Park did not walk a batter until he reached the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked three, setting up Hayes' game-tying single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I could pitch well tonight,'' Park said. ``But
even better was that we won the game as a team.''

GRIFFEY HOMERS TWICE AGAINST RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Normally, reaching the 3,000-hit plateau is an
achievement to cherish because of its historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Ken Griffey Jr., though, to make getting halfway
there just as memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey picked up his 1,500th and 1,501st career hits Tuesday
night in the same manner he's engaged baseball _ with power, grace
and plenty of oohs and aahs.
</P>
<P>
   His second home run of the game _ a two-run shot in the seventh
inning _ propelled the Mariners past the Texas Rangers 6-3 at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it so many times. He's the best player in the
game,'' M's manager Lou Piniella said. ``He can beat you many ways.
... Junior is Junior. What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   For as much as the Mariners' two-game sweep of the Rangers was
the Griffey Show, they also can talk of how much better the club is
playing. Tuesday night's victory was the latest in an installment
of Mariner baseball that's featured timely hitting, solid defense
and strong pitching.
</P>
<P>
   M's left-hander Jeff Fassero (9-5) earned his fourth straight
victory. He struck out six and allowed just five hits through eight
strong innings. Mike Timlin pitched the ninth for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been too bad after the All-Star break. So we'll
see,'' said Fassero, who helped the M's creep to within 11 games of
first-place Anaheim in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been throwing the ball well and I've been getting some
runs, which help. . . . Right now, we've got to go one team at a
time. We've got to get over Oakland first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners remained at the bottom of the division _ four games
behind Oakland. However, the M's have hardly looked like a club
floundering in the cellar of late.
</P>
<P>
   They completed a critical six-game stretch with a 4-2 record
(2-2 against Anaheim and 2-0 vs. second-place Texas). Optimism
around this team is like a pimple on an adolescent boy.
</P>
<P>
   It won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good to see. You've got to start somewhere. We've got
to build on this. But things are looking more positive,'' Piniella
said, pointing out the Mariners have five games left on this
11-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're starting to realize that if we can do certain
things, we have a chance,'' Timlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora got the Mariners off to a fast start. He opened the
first inning with a triple and scored moments later. Then,
Griffey's first homer opened the door for a big third inning.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Griffey smacked Texas starter John Burkett's
fastball deep into the right-field bleachers. Leading 2-0, Edgar
Martinez promptly singled and David Segui doubled. Jay Buhner
knocked in Martinez and Segui with a sharp single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners led 4-0 that quickly and Fassero kept the Rangers
at bay through six innings. His hard slider kept batters off
balance, and Fassero kept his fastball down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when he gets through the first few innings, he's going
to have a good night,'' M's catcher Dan Wilson said. ``He got
through the first three without any damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero allowed just two runners to get in scoring position
until the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and two runners on base, Fassero fell behind Kevin
Elster. Then, Fassero watched his 2-1 pitch sail over the
right-center-field wall. Elster's three-run homer cut the Mariners'
lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why (Junior's) second (homer) was the greatest,''
Fassero said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners finally chased Burkett in their half of the seventh
after Alex Rodriguez's leadoff single. Texas manager Johnny Oates
immediately called upon left-hander Scott Bailes to face Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Bailes, though, lasted only as long as Griffey's fourth at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey launched Bailes' offering down the right-field line. It
was Griffey's 39th home run this season, increasing his American
League-leading total and pulling him within one of St. Louis
slugger Mark McGwire for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has 87 RBIs after his fourth two-homer game of the
season and 31st of his career.
</P>
<P>
   After Griffey's homer, Dan Patterson came on and ended the
Mariners' seventh-inning barrage. Burkett (5-10) gave up nine hits
and five earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes good contact,'' Timlin said of Griffey. ``There are
times when he swings and you say `What's he swinging at?' Then, he
hits one out on the next pitch. He's incredible.''

Ugly 9th Does In Skidding Giants  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    LOS ANGELES _ The Giants had failed in so many ways on this
horrific road trip to start the second half, but the one fate they
dodged was a ninth-inning suicide.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything in due time, friends. Everything in due time. The
losing streak hit five Tuesday night when closer Robb Nen, pitching
for the first time since he gave up three runs in the All-Star
Game, threw a wild pitch with the bases loaded and two out in the
bottom of the ninth. Raul Mondesi scored from third for a 2-1 Los
Angeles Dodgers victory, to the surprise and delight of 41,513 at
Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   But things never should have gotten that far. After Nen relieved
John Johnstone and fanned Eric Karros for the second out,
pinch-hitter Matt Luke hit a routine grounder to short. Extra
innings, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez booted the ball, picked it up and tried to flip it
to Jeff Kent at second for the force. The throw was a little wide,
and Kent dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases now loaded on Sanchez's error and .170-hitting
rookie Adrian Beltre at the plate, Nen tried to throw a 1-0
fastball down and away. It was too far down, and too far away.
Catcher Brian Johnson tried to backhand the ball, but it flew past
him to the backstop. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw it hard, but I've gotten that pitch before,'' Johnson
said. ``My responsibility is to knock the ball down, but I didn't
do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Nen could have pointed a finger toward Sanchez, whose error
extended the inning, but he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game. It's going to happen sometimes,'' Nen
said. ``This was my fault. I blame myself. I tried to keep the ball
away and it got too far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone took some blame himself for allowing the one-out
double to Mondesi that got the rally started. Mondesi hit a shot
that third baseman Bill Mueller deflected toward the left-field
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get my end of it done,'' Johnstone said. ``I threw a
bad pitch and Mondesi hit a double. I don't know how Billy even saw
it. Mondesi roped it down the line. I've got to be better than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That should become the Giants' slogan as this nine-game
nightmare of a trip wears on.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have not won since June 5, and the five-game losing
streak matches their longest of the season. They fell eight games
behind the first-place San Diego Padres in the National League
West. Perhaps more significant, their lead in the wild-card race
shrank to a half-game over the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the third-place Dodgers climbed within 41/2 games
of the Giants in the West. The Giants are 2-9 on the road against
their West Division rivals, the only victories coming in the
season's first week at expansion Arizona. They are 0-2 here, 0-3 at
San Diego and 0-3 at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers are not the name of the game for the Giants right
now. The only equation they must solve is how to win again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy to be eight games out and we're not happy with
the way we've started the second half,'' Johnson said. ``The
biggest key for us is to get our house in order. We're not playing
well as a team. We must play well if we want to be in the pennant
race. We're going to see in the next few days, the next week, what
this team is made of.''
</P>
<P>
   The ugly ninth inning marred what had been a picturesque game.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitchers Chan Ho Park and Mark Gardner engaged in a
who-blinks-first display of terrific pitching until Dodgers catcher
Charles Johnson put the first run on the board in the bottom of the
fifth. With two out, he pulverized a first-pitch breaking ball high
into the left-field pavilion, 435 feet from the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants tied the game at 1-1 in the seventh on a two-out RBI
single by Charlie Hayes off reliever Antonio Osuna, who had just
relieved Park. The inning began with Park walking Barry Bonds and
Kent, but J.T. Snow stunted the rally by checking his swing on a
3-1 pitch and bouncing it to Park, who threw to second to start a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   As they used to say in the Roger Craig era, the Giants' daubers
have to be getting down a bit. They are not botching game after
game with silly mistakes, nor are they stepping to the plate
without a clue. Yet they are still not winning, which takes a toll
on the psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every loss can gnaw at you,'' Johnstone said. ``It's tough,
especially with the position we're in, us chasing the Padres and
the Dodgers chasing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Never this season has the chase for a single victory seemed so
futile. &QL;

D.C. SIGHTSEERS FLOCK TO STARR GRAND JURY COURTHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Along Pennsylvania Avenue, the television satellite
trucks lined up outside the E. Barrett Perryman Federal Courthouse
stand as monuments to the capital's appetite for scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Tour buses slow as they pass the courthouse, so guides can tell
visitors from around the world that this is where a grand jury is
listening to evidence about President Clinton and a 24-year-old
former intern. Dozens of television cameras capture the comings and
goings at five entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Though no longer regarded as ominous a threat to the Clinton
presidency, l'affaire Lewinsky remains a fixture on the Washington
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Networks dutifully show pictures of witnesses summoned by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Questions about sex are a
routine part of Mike McCurry's daily White House press briefing.
Republicans regularly cite the controversy as a wild card that
could help them in the November elections. The Internet boasts at
least eight Web sites dedicated to Monica Lewinsky, as well as a
search engine that provides nothing but information about her.
</P>
<P>
   Even if most of America has tired of the once-titillating sex
scandal, those inside the beltway suggest there is no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting on an escalator,'' Brookings Institute
presidential scholar Stephen Hess said. ``Once you get on, you
can't just turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's investigation enters its seventh month, the buzz
inside Washington is that he is reaching the end, and the
developments of the next few weeks may determine whether the
scandal becomes an important chapter of American history or merely
an asterisk on Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is eagerly _ or fearfully, according to some _ awaiting
a report from Starr that could set off impeachment hearings by the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is so ripe that Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., recently told Republican colleagues not to stray too far
from the Capitol during the August recess.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton's allies say they can imagine nothing
that Starr might present that would persuade members of Congress to
go after a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is basically over as far as the American people are
concerned,'' said former White House attorney Lanny Davis, who said
he was speaking for himself and not for the administration.
``They've already assumed the worst case . . . and they've already
decided it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans may have no appetite for a politically
gut-wrenching process that could have the unintended effect of
elevating Al Gore to the presidency shortly before the next
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office has refused to discuss the timing or the
substance of its report or, for that matter, whether it will submit
a final report at all. Starr's representatives refused to return
repeated phone calls Tuesday, but a spokesman for the office
recently told the Los Angeles Times that the team would not be
pressured to rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the need to get this done as quickly as possible,''
said Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly. ``We have taken the brunt of
complaints that this is taking a long time, but that's a hit we
have to be prepared to take to fulfill our oath to carry out the
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings inside the courthouse are off limits to the
public, but dozens of journalists outside keep close tabs on who
has testified.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, the former White House employee who secretly
recorded 20 hours of conversations with Lewinsky, spent her fifth
day before the grand jury Tuesday, and is expected back for at
least another day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom is that Starr has few witnesses left to call
_ except for Lewinsky and Clinton, although Starr surprised
observers when it was revealed Tuesday that he had subpoenaed Larry
Cockrell, head of the Secret Service's presidential detail, and
several other agents.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has been negotiating with Starr since January and is
apparently still at odds over what she is willing to share with
prosecutors. Starr will soon have to decide whether to grant
Lewinsky immunity to compel her to testify or indict her and head
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the Tripp tapes, Lewinsky's value to Starr is
uncertain. In the event that she does testify, the president's
lawyers will no doubt bring up her deposition in the Paula Jones
case, in which she denied under oath that she ever had a sexual
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been asked several times to testify and declined,
according to several reports, which presents Starr with another
quandary. It is not clear that he has the legal authority to compel
Clinton to testify, although Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Sunday
that Clinton's refusal to honor a subpoena could be grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And so Washington waits, really without any idea what will
happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even want to venture a guess,'' said Republican
National Committee spokesman Mike Collins. ``Truth is, no one
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you when it will definitely be over,'' said Michael
Barone, Washington editor of Reader's Digest and the author of the
Almanac of American Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two and a half years. That's when (Clinton's) term ends.''

DAMS TO BE TORN DOWN TO HELP SAVE SALMON  
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BARNUM  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NELSON, Calif. _ Winding through rice fields and almond
orchards, Butte Creek seems an unlikely spot for a salmon
restoration effort that has captured the imagination of
environmentalists and drawn the attention of the highest levels of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few months, the last of four small irrigation dams will
be torn down just outside this town, and a 20-mile stretch of Butte
Creek, which has the largest remaining population of spring-run
salmon in the state, will be restored to unimpeded flows for the
first time since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In a state long wracked by divisive conflicts about water, the
$9.5 million dam-removal project is being heralded as a model of
collaboration among farmers, urban water districts and government
agencies to protect an imperiled species.
</P>
<P>
   ``This demonstrates the possibility of finding a new equilibrium
on the landscape,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt told a crowd
of 100 gathered beside McPherrin Dam Tuesday. ``It is a message
that needs to be held up to the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he stepped onto the concrete structure and, surrounded by
TV cameras, took a few symbolic whacks at it with a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and many environmentalists also view the removal of dams
along Butte Creek as part of a blossoming national movement to
reassess the need for structures that were once thought to be a
permanent part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Like busy beavers, Americans have constructed roughly 75,000
large dams and 2 million small dams along the country's waterways.
And to be sure, there is still talk, particularly among farmers
here in the Central Valey, of building new ones to meet the demands
of a growing population.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time of heightened concern about the environmental
impact of damming rivers, whether it is to generate electricity or
to supply water, small- to medium-size dams are coming under new
scrutiny by federal agencies and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20, mostly small hydroelectric dams, have been
destroyed in recent years or scheduled for destruction. The largest
of those is a 160-year-old dam along the Kennebec River in Maine
that federal energy regulators decided last fall should be taken
down.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, the operating licenses of 250
hydroelectric dams, including 146 in California, will expire. And
as part of the relicensing of those facilities, federal regulators
will invite debate over whether the environmental costs of the
structures outweigh their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a new era,'' said Rebecca Wodder,
executive director of American Rivers, an environmental group.
``Federal agencies had viewed dams as a fixture. There is now a
recognition that dams can have a finite life cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   And there may be no better example of that recognition than
Butte Creek, said Marc Reisner, the author of ``Cadillac Desert,''
the best-selling account of Western water wars, and a consultant on
restoration projects along Butte Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most actively deconstructed river in the country
right now,'' Reisner said. ``There are more dams coming down on
this than any other river.''
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for tearing down dams along Butte Creek was the
plight of the spring-run salmon, once the most abundant of four
runs of chinook salmon in the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The spring run once migrated by the hundreds of thousands far up
the Feather, Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers each spring. Adult
fish would hold over during the summer months in the cold water
near Mount &UR;  &LR; Shasta and Mount Lassen, and spawn from August to
October.
</P>
<P>
   But Shasta and Oroville dams have confined the fish to the lower
reaches of the Sacramento and Feather rivers, where they are forced
to share a spawning habitat with fall-run chinook salmon and are
losing their unique genetic identity.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the spring run could soon be listed as an
endangered species by both federal and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four Sacramento Valley streams that still support a
genetically distinct spring run population, Butte Creek is the
largest, with 7,500 fish returning in 1995. The removal of dams
will open up an additional 20 miles of Butte Creek to salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Canal Water District, which supplies water to farms
in Butte and Glenn counties, had used the dams to move water from
irrigation canals on either side of Butte Creek. Without the dams,
the district had to find a way to move the water.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the solution, the district constructed a diversion
that takes water under the creek. The cost of construction was
shared equally by the water district, government wildlife agencies
and urban water districts, including the Metropolitan Water
District in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great project,'' said Richard Golb, executive director
of the Northern California Water Association, which represents
farmers. ``A couple of years ago, doing something like this would
have been taboo. But there is a different ethic in this region
about environmental stewardship.''
</P>
<P>
   But some local farmers are wary, saying the new system is still
untested. Moreover, they are skeptical that the solution that has
worked here could be as successful elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the salmon, but we still have to make it work,''
said Laverne McPherrin, a second-generation rice farmer who owns
1,800 acres just east of Butte Creek and whose McPherrin Dam is one
of those coming down in coming months. ``We'll see.''

RIDING ON GREED AND ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL SENTIMENT

<P>
   Back in the '40s, a person learned that to ride the rails
successfully, he must be quick and quiet lest a railroad bull crack
his skull and toss him off the moving freight. Quick and quiet are
also the hallmarks of a rider successfully attached to an
appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 appropriations bills that will be signed into law
by the end of September in order to keep the government open for
business.
</P>
<P>
   They're sure bets.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that must be passed _ like an appropriations or a highway
spending bill _ is called ``A train'' in the vernacular of those
who work the halls and floors in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A rider attached to a ``must pass'' bill doesn't go through the
usual hearing process that a proposed piece of legislation faces.
</P>
<P>
   The normal legislative process is designed to be deliberative.
Passing a bill into law takes time. Hearings are held. Concepts and
language are debated. Those who object to the proposed legislation
are purposely brought into the debate. A bill may successfully pass
through subcommittee hearings, then full committee debate, and
finally to a floor vote in one of the houses of Congress and yet be
defeated because of inherent weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate can each pass a separate version of a bill.
A compromise bill is then hammered out and voted on again.
</P>
<P>
   Other versions of an unsuccessful bill may come back the
following year, and the year after that _ until it has eventually
accommodated some of the criticism, ideas and language of those who
opposed it. Or it may be dropped altogether. It often takes five or
six years to create an effective piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative process is supposed to allow time for debate in
both houses of Congress. The process responds to special interest
groups and watchdog organizations. Most importantly, it allows time
for the public to let its feelings be known. Dialogue is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for riders. They may not face any debate, merely a
cursory vote.
</P>
<P>
   Throw a rider onto a fast moving train. An appropriations bill
moves relatively quickly. Many riders aren't subject to any
scrutiny _ either by the public or by our elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriations bills are huge, hundreds of pages long _ a rider
can be easily secreted.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason that some of these riders are kept hidden from
the public _ they smack of smarmy deceit. They couldn't stand up to
open debate; they'd shrivel up like snails in a salt storm.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the House GOP leadership pushed to attach an anti-gay
rider to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, and later
attached a rider to the agricultural spending bill that would block
the Food and Drug Administration from using federal funds to test,
develop, or approve any drug that would induce an early abortion,
including the French pill, RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these riders concern issues that should have been
debated on their own merits and been introduced in the proper
committee where hearings could be held. The riders bypassed the
more democratic pathway.
</P>
<P>
   Public scrutiny was sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee attached a rider to the
Interior Appropriations bill that will delay new federal and Indian
oil valuations regulations until Oct. 1, 1999. The regulations
would help ensure that the American taxpayer receives a fair market
value for oil taken from federal lands. This little tactic _ unless
the rider is stripped from the bill _ will cost the taxpayer more
than $66 million per year in royalty payments and cost state public
school systems a large portion of that. Indian tribes will lose an
estimated $4 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   The oil valuations rider was proposed by Sens. Kay Bailey
Hutchinson, R-Texas, and Pete Domenici, R-N.M., _ both receive a
huge hunk of their campaign contributions from the oil and gas
industry. They pocket the dough; our children's schools suffer. The
Interior's Minerals Management Service estimates that Wyoming
public schools will lose $770,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Avarice rides again. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., attached a rider
to the Interior bill to halt the review of current hardrock mining
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   It would effectively delay mining reform. No surprise: Reid
receives a large chunk of his campaign funds from the mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are stealth legislation. No debate. No time for the
public to react. No time for those who oppose the rider to mobilize
their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes riders are attached to a bill at 4 in the morning.
Who's watching our elected representatives at that hour? The rider
process can be intentionally, resolutely anti-democratic.
</P>
<P>
   A peek at the 20-plus anti-environmental riders attached to
either the House or Senate Interior Appropriations bills shows no
real surprises.
</P>
<P>
   It's deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's entire congressional delegation, Sens. Frank Murkowski,
Ted Stevens, and Rep. Don Young, are once again attacking the
Tongass National Forest, wilderness and wildlife refuges in their
state with road construction, helicopters, timber sales and
giveaways of federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., attached a rider that would block
the reintroduction of grizzly bears into the Selway-Bitterroot area
of Idaho and Montana _ an important species recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., is once again attacking American
Indian tribal sovereign immunity and self-determination. Sen. Mike
Enzi, R-Wyo., is once again pushing to limit a tribe's right to
establish gambling on its lands. And Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla.,
is using a rider to force tribal governments to pay state and local
sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Stream beds are sensitive to grazing cattle. One rider forces
the Bureau of Land Management to automatically renew grazing
allotments in 1999 whether or not poor land-use practices cause the
destruction of fish habitat, or riparian areas.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of these riders reveals a congressional leadership
driven by anti-gay, anti-Indian, and anti-environmental sentiment.
They leave the president with no choice but veto.

A 50-YEAR TREK THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 19)  
 (JT ) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ ``He just thought it was awful,
nowheresville,'' William Burroughs said of Edmonton, the boyhood
home of his great friend and collaborator Brion Gysin. Indeed, when
a 16-year-old Gysin boarded a cattle car and headed east, he left
behind this land of his ``exile'' and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   But the memories remained. As Gysin emerged as a creative force,
he invoked, as if haunted, the vast horizons of the Canadian
prairie in his early Surrealist paintings and later desertscapes of
the Sahara and in his prose works, perhaps most significantly his
autobiographical novel, ``The Process.'' Gysin died in Paris in
1986 at the age of 70, the places of his childhood by then no more
than fragmented dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton is no longer nowheresville. The cattle town of 58,000
that Gysin fled in 1931 has exploded into an urban center just shy
of one million, brimming with oil wealth and maintaining a sturdy
intellectual life. And though Gysin shunned this ``wrong place''
that pummeled away at his psyche, the city is embracing Gysin as a
native son with the first major North American retrospective of his
works, at the Edmonton Art Gallery through Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Brion Gysin: I Am That I Am,'' examines the output
of a painter, writer, sound poet (in which works are chanted), tape
composer, lyricist and student of magic who became a cult icon not
so much for the impact of his works as for the scope of his ideas.
The exhibition traces Gysin's career over 50 years: his involvement
in Surrealism in Paris in the 1930's, his painting in Tangier in
the 1950s, his development of the ``cut-up process'' with Burroughs
at the ``Beat Hotel'' in Paris, his calligraphic abstractions in
the 1960s and later his photo and text collages, which he laid over
grids created by a rubber roller. Nestled among the 200 works is a
Dreamachine, a device that when viewed with the eyes closed is
reputed to produce alpha waves that hit the optic nerve and induce
visions. On the back wall of the main gallery hangs the show's
undisputed centerpiece, ``Calligraffiti of Fire,'' an enormous
calligraphic painting in the style of a Japanese makemono, or
folding book, which is read from right to left across 10 canvases.
It was Gysin's last work; Burroughs wept at the sight of it.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Bruce Grenville, a curator originally with the
gallery and now with the Vancouver Art Gallery, and Jose Ferez
Kuri, an independent curator who also works with William Burroughs
Communications in Lawrence, Kan., the exhibition borrows heavily
from the collections of the Musee d'Art Moderne, the Pompidou
Center and the Galerie de France in Paris, as well as the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art and the Spencer Museum of Art at the
University of Kansas in Lawrence. It is scheduled to travel to
galleries across Canada; negotiations are also under way for venues
in Mexico City, Los Angeles and New York.

</P>
<P>
   The seed for Gysin's repatriation was planted by John Geiger, an
Edmonton writer who first came across Gysin's name _ and an
allusion to Alberta _ in 1991 while bingeing on works by Burroughs
and Paul Bowles. Stunned by his discovery, Geiger confirmed the
Edmonton connection through a friend, Chris Cran, a painter from
Calgary and a Burroughs fan himself. Geiger then contacted James
Grauerholz, Burroughs' companion and manager, hoping simply to
acquire a piece of Gysin's art. By the end of the conversation, he
had been persuaded to write Gysin's biography and invited to meet
Burroughs, who gave the project _ and Geiger _ his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger is the author, with the anthropologist Owen Beattie, of
``Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition'' and ``Dead
Silence,'' both of which deal with fatal Arctic explorations, and
for him there was an obvious link to Gysin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a connection, I think, between these `strange and
dangerous voyages' and the explorations to unknown places
undertaken by Burroughs and Gysin,'' Geiger said. ``All the
geographic places on the earth have already been visited, so the
only places left to explore are those places in the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gysin, born in England to Canadian parents in 1916, returned
with his newly widowed mother to her parents' home in Ontario at
the end of World War I, eventually journeying to Edmonton in 1921.
His mother, a dominating woman with aristocratic pretensions,
fretted about her son's literary interests, fearing them to be
``the breeding ground for atheism'' and concluding that ``his only
hope of salvation was the English Catholic atmosphere.'' She
arranged for him to spend two years at Downside, an English public
school. Gysin became an artist upon graduating in 1934. That same
year he moved to Paris, where he was an associate of Picasso, Dali,
Duchamp, de Chirico, Man Ray and Max Ernst, who were all dabbling
in Surrealism at the time. But he also kept company with Gertrude
Stein, Natalie Barney and Alice B. Toklas, whom the Surrealist
power broker Andre Breton disdained. The drawings Gysin contributed
to an important Surrealist group exhibition at the Galerie aux
Quatre Chemins in 1935 were removed, on the orders of Breton _ and
without explanation _ the day of its opening. Gysin always
suspected that Breton had reacted against Gysin's homosexuality.
The expulsion was the first of many disappointments that followed
Gysin throughout his career and, for the developing artist, it had
the effect of a curse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After receiving a Fulbright scholarship for ``The History of
Slavery in Canada,'' which he wrote while in New York, Gysin moved
to Morocco in 1950 at the invitation of Paul Bowles. He stayed
there for parts of the next 23 years, seduced by the ``wild west of
the spirit'' and intrigued by the magic of Middle Eastern folk
religions. He transferred this mysticism to his paintings, which he
overlaid with Arabic script and Japanese calligraphy to form a sort
of cabalistic grid that had the look of language. It was a conceit
that he would use throughout his life, eventually inscribing the
grid on a rubber roller and using the design as a unifying
background _ rather than foreground _ upon which images and texts
were laid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, while cutting a mount for a drawing, Gysin sliced
through a pile of newspapers and, piecing together the fragments at
random, invented what would come to be known as the ``cut-up
process.'' He applied the technique first to a mass of essays that
were to become Burroughs' groundbreaking novel, ``Naked Lunch.''
Later he used it with ``The Third Mind,'' an ambitious
collaboration intended as an exploration of the cut-up method and
an expansion on the idea that when two minds work together, a third
mind results. Other Beat writers followed Gysin's lead, and cut-ups
soon became a sort of manifesto for the abandonment of the literal,
the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, Gysinmania had set it in. The man seemed to be
everywhere _ planted in Room 703 of the Chelsea Hotel in New York
with the poet John Giorno, whom he introduced to sound poetry and
LSD; showing the Rolling Stones around Morocco; immersed in
conversation with his close friends David Bowie and Iggy Pop;
touring with Patti Smith and her band in Amsterdam. Twelve years
after his death, Gysin's influence is palpable in the works of a
new generation of artists and musicians who have transmuted his
ideas into inventions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a ventriloquist of ideas,'' Geiger said. ``He planted
these radical, experimental ideas with others, and then they were
the ones who would write the songs and paint the pictures and write
the books. You get all these people who are Brion's children in a
sense.''

A SPOOF KEEPS PACE WITH BROADWAY'S EXCESSES AND EGOS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gerard Alessandrini sat quietly in his seat at the
Minskoff Theater, ruminating on the strange spectacle before him.
``Into the fire!'' sang a swarm of English aristocrats, prancing
madly around the stage in ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.'' Alessandrini
studied the scene with the focused air of a junkman scrutinizing
the wreck of a 1959 Plymouth and wondering what it might be worth
if broken down for parts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he turned and shrugged. ``I don't know,'' he said
slowly. ``I might be able to do something with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alessandrini, 44, has been Broadway's premier parts collector
for a long time. Since 1982 he has been presenting a series of rude
yet ultimately affectionate cabaret-style satires on the Broadway
scene under the moniker ``Forbidden Broadway,'' which he created,
writes and directs. At one time, he also performed in it.
</P>
<P>
   The current incarnation, the year-and-a-half-old ``Forbidden
Broadway Strikes Back!,'' will be replaced by a new edition at the
end of September, and Alessandrini is on the prowl for fresh
material and new cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time to put another one out there,'' he said. ``But
we're not sure of the title yet. Maybe `Bride of Forbidden
Broadway.' Or we're thinking perhaps `FB2000,' to get us in on this
millennium thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alessandrini had taken in the performance of ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' during its previews last fall, part of the constant
round he makes of musicals. Who can say what shows will emerge as
fodder for satire?
</P>
<P>
   A few months later he sat in on a rehearsal in the ``Forbidden
Broadway'' performance space, the Stardust Theater, in the basement
of a Broadway-themed diner next door to ``Cats'' at the Winter
Garden. Upstairs, waiters were slinging burgers around the
retro-style coffee shop while, down a stairway to the right of the
entrance, the ``Forbidden Broadway'' ensemble was trying to figure
out a way to get Leonardo DiCaprio into the ``Titanic'' number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbidden Broadway,'' which gets under way at 8:15 most
evenings, is performed in a two-tiered, L-shaped basement space
that has been painted black and pink and strung with lights and
sound equipment. The stage fills one wall, a piano positioned to
one side of it, for the show's musical director, Matthew Ward. Rows
of tables feed out from the stage and line the second tier, where
patrons can order drinks and, if they wish, dinners before the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we might be able to do something with Leo spitting
off the side of the ship,'' Alessandrini called out from his seat
at one of the tables. This was greeted with glee by the cast
members, who immediately began to compete in distance spitting.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Alessandrini said, was that a scene from the Broadway
musical ``Titanic'' would be interrupted by an actor pretending to
be DiCaprio, who is ``filming a movie on the other side of the
ship.'' Lori Hammel, playing one of the elderly Victorian
passengers on the ship, would then cast off her old-lady gown and
become the young, ravishing Kate Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about this?'' she asked, turning toward the room with an
ecstatic look on her face and raising her arms high behind her head
in a parody of Ms. Winslet hanging off the ship's prow in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's perfect!'' Alessandrini shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' musical had become little
more than the occasion for a brief song by a dandy who is ridiculed
for his ornate costume by Rosie O'Donnell (played by Christine
Pedi). But Alessandrini still had hopes of bringing the show some
larger presence in the revue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find my Julie Taymor!'' yelled Ms. Hammel from
backstage. An understudy was practicing walking on all fours, with
a wooden-handled plumber's helper in each hand, turning him into
something that looked not unlike a giraffe for ``The Lion King''
parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of this show is cut and paste,'' Alessandrini said.
``If the composers knew what we did with their songs . . . Well,
it's pretty informal. We kind of do it like summer camp around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind each edition is to capture the current Broadway
Zeitgeist and to poke fun at the state of the theater by adding
new, rude, sometimes bawdy lyrics to the music from the shows. The
subject matter is calibrated to be inside enough for regular
theatergoers and broad enough for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Cabaret'' parody, a somewhat rude one, was about how the
musical had been turned into a ``porno show,'' with the ``Forbidden
Broadway'' cast members dancing suggestively around the stage in
leather briefs.
</P>
<P>
   A second consideration is to look at the personalities involved
in Broadway shows, particularly if they have become controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each edition, the tone of Broadway seems to have changed and
our show takes on that tone,'' Alessandrini said. ``The last time
we did it, everything was so influenced by `Rent' and all of
Broadway seemed to have a youth feel to it, so that came across in
the show. We'll see what happens this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of the revue over the years have closely paralleled
those of Broadway, he added. When Broadway was in the doldrums,
people didn't seem all that interested in trudging uptown (the
company was then on West 72d Street) to see a satiric revue about
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time for us now, perhaps the best time we've ever
had,'' Alessandrini noted. ``And artistically, we're a better show
now because there are so many more musicals to choose from. Never,
since `Forbidden Broadway' started, have we had a period where we
had to change the show as frequently as we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes this both to Broadway's current production boom
and to the company's move a year ago from the Triad Theater on 72d
Street to its new home in the heart of the theater district.
</P>
<P>
   The revue has a cast of four _ in addition to Ms. Hammel and Ms.
Pedi, Neal Mayer and William Selby _ with two understudies. ``We're
a shoestring operation,'' Alessandrini said. ``You can sometimes go
backstage and find producers sewing buttons onto costumes.''
</P>
<P>
   The director started ``Forbidden Broadway'' when he was two
years out of the Boston Conservatory of Music, not far from his
hometown of Needham, Mass. ``I really did want to be a legitimate
writer of musicals, and I still want to do that,'' he said. ``But I
haven't been working on it as much as I'd like. This isn't the
season for it. It's too busy, too many shows, too much work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alessandrini will spend time this summer directing a new
musical, ``In the Beginning,'' at the Maine State Summer Theater in
Brunswick. Based on the early books of the Bible, it is a project
that he and the composer Maury Yeston have been working on.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he wants to add a few new skits to ``Forbidden Broadway
Strikes Back!'' this summer _ perhaps even one from ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel,'' which was nominated for three Tony Awards this year,
including one for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a number that I'd really like to use,'' Alessandrini
said, based on the song ``Into the Fire'' that he had heard all
those months ago at the preview.
</P>
<P>
   He looked hopeful. ``You see, instead of heading into the fire
of the French Revolution, we could have our cast dressed up in
fancy clothes and singing about how certain Broadway books and
scores should be thrown into the fire.'' He was grinning happily.
``I think we can make that work.''

A QUIET NEW BREED OF AMERICANA BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 19)  
 (JT)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scene was a salesroom at Christie's in New York
on June 18, the prize an 18th-century Newport chest signed, labeled
and dated by one of America's greatest cabinetmakers, John
Townsend. At first, hands and paddles shot into the air as 10
people swiftly bid the masterpiece up to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But then an air of secrecy descended on the room as the
telephones took over: five unidentified bidders, then three, then
two competed until the hammer fell on the last bid, for $4.7
million. It was the second-highest price ever paid for a piece of
American furniture and the third highest paid at auction for any
piece of furniture. (The costliest American piece was a Newport
desk that was sold for $12 million in 1989; a year later, an
Italian cabinet brought $15 million.)
</P>
<P>
   In one stroke, the sale underscored two trends now in evidence
at auction houses: a surge in prices for Americana, and a growing
demand for anonymity by a new generation of wealthy collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the buyers bidding at Christie's last month fit the
picture of these collectors: largely self-made millionaires in
their 40s and 50s who have reaped their fortunes in industry, on
Wall Street or in real estate and who do their buying discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   Things were different a decade ago when buyers like Eddy
Nicholson set the tone at auctions. A New Hampshire-based
industrialist and investor, Nicholson, who often paid $1 million or
more for tables, chairs and chests, would signal his bids with
folded arms or a nod from where he stood at the back of salesrooms.
(He sold his collection in 1995.) Today it is a rare auction when
major buyers like the oil heir Robert Bass, the computer magnate
Anthony Wang or the Tour de France champion Greg LeMond are seen
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Why the secrecy?
</P>
<P>
   John Hays, who heads American furniture sales at Christie's,
attributes today's covert style to a more competitive market.
``There are many more players in the field than there were 10 years
ago,'' he said. ``The old guard has not disappeared, and there are
new buyers at every sale. So you never know who might come from
left field and bid against you.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple who bought the Newport chest agree, up to a point. In
a telephone interview, the wife, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that she and her husband, who are both New
Englanders in their early 50s, are more concerned about security
and privacy than competition.
</P>
<P>
   And they have a passion for Americana, she said. The couple have
been collecting Americana for 20 years, focusing mostly on New
England furniture, and the Townsend chest, because it is so rare,
offered a ``once in a lifetime opportunity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trophy piece,'' she said. ``My husband loves the
chunky feeling of 18th-century pieces, the turned legs, the ogee
bracket feet. And I love the gunkiness on the underside; that
remains basically untouched.'' The raw wood on the base of the
chest, made in 1792, shows 200 years of dust, glue and insect
marks, revealing, she said, ``the life of the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they buy furniture, ``we first have to love the object,''
she continued, ``and our response has to be instantaneous.'' Then
they study everything known about a piece and compare it with
others at museums to better understand why different materials were
used, who had to be employed to make the piece, how it had fit in a
household and who had owned it.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to be discovered about Townsend, his work and his
role in Newport, R.I., society in the late 18th century. And that
may now happen. Morrison Heckscher, the curator of American
decorative art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who is an expert
on John Townsend, says the museum plans to do an exhibition on him
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no better craftsman in 18th-century America,'' he
said. ``And there are more signed and documented pieces by him than
any other American cabinetmaker of the period.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum owns 3 of the 25 pieces signed by Townsend _ a chest,
a table and a clock _ as well as others attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to bring together most of the documented pieces
so that people can see the breadth and quality of his work,''
Heckscher said. ``And it would be important to answer some of the
big questions that haven't been asked yet: for whom was this
furniture made and why was there a market for such pieces for so
long _ 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hays of Christie's hopes more Townsend pieces surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying a great piece of American 18th-century furniture is
like collecting a rare baseball card of Mickey Mantle or even Tom
Seaver, the ultimate when I was 12,'' he said. ``When you have a
chance to complete the set, to get the best of the best _ you go
for it.''

LLOYD WEBBER STILL HAS TROUBLE WHISTLING DIXIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 19)  
 (JT)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For some while now, Andrew Lloyd Webber has been
planning what he calls a ``continuation'' of ``The Phantom of the
Opera.'' But isn't that what his new musical, ``Whistle Down the
Wind'' at the Aldwych Theater, could be said to be?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the two shows' settings could not be more different:
a gilt-edged fantasia of the Paris Opera House, as opposed to a
rural Louisiana backwater, circa 1959, where the new show takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, however, Lloyd Webber's interest lies in
rewriting the primal tale of beauty and the beast: the outsider
shunned by society who is redeemed by young love (and a soaring
soprano).
</P>
<P>
   ``Whistle Down the Wind'' may take as its source the Mary Hayley
Bell novella that inspired the beloved (in England, anyway) 1961
Bryan Forbes film starring Hayley Mills and Alan Bates. On this
hearing it is about a haunted man _ known, indeed, as The Man and
portrayed by Marcus Lovett, an American veteran of several Lloyd
Webber musicals _ in none too sublimated thrall to a virginal
girl-woman, the impressionable teen-age Swallow (Lottie Mayor).
</P>
<P>
   But here, ``the music of the night,'' as the ``Phantom'' lyric
puts it, has been supplanted by what a Jim Steinman lyric terms
``the nature of the beast.'' ( Steinman, who has been with the
project from the beginning, was in fact approached by Lloyd Webber
more than a decade ago to be his collaborator on ``Phantom'' but
declined because of recording commitments.)
</P>
<P>
   What, then, of the nature of ``Whistle Down the Wind''? Lloyd
Webber was not pleased with an earlier incarnation directed by
Harold Prince in Washington in late 1996. That explains why the
London production boasts a fresh cast, book, creative team (headed
by Gale Edwards, the director) and even, with its three new songs,
score.
</P>
<P>
   The result, though, poses obstacles beyond the burden of a
levitating set (by the usually estimable Peter Davison) that looks
like a cheesy knockoff of John Napier's monstrously dazzling manse
in ``Sunset Boulevard.'' For one thing, it is asking a lot to
expect a cast of mostly Britons to inhabit Southern Gothic terrain
that often recalls Tennessee Williams at his more rabid.
</P>
<P>
   All the best efforts of the dialect coach, Joan Washington,
never convince us that Ms. Mayor's affectingly sung if wanly acted
Swallow _ the oldest of three children to mistake Lovett's
muscle-bound convict for Jesus _ has been any nearer a Bible Belt
of God-fearers and snake wrestlers than, say, Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is at too many removes from an approach that seems
pretty inauthentic to begin with, as the show's view of race
relations unnervingly makes clear: a mixed-race crew of sprightly
tots cavort about, making a mockery of the civil rights struggles
that were still to come.
</P>
<P>
   The score, much of which a surprisingly unmusical cast can't
really sing, amounts to faux rock-and-roll. What is absent is the
melodic revelation of character that has distinguished this
songwriter in happier form. ``With One Look,'' Norma Desmond's
opening volley in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' could only belong to a
narcissist nearing madness: the song is at once macabre and witty
and comes with built-in bravura. But most of the new show's
would-be anthems, greaser numbers and forays into scorching pop
truly sound as interchangeable as Lloyd Webber's detractors are
forever claiming all his work is. The exception: ``When Children
Rule the World,'' a song guaranteed to make a despot out of any
adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whistle Down the Wind'' boasts no shortage of Big Themes _
death, guilt, innocence and blame, among them. But the book, by Ms.
Edwards, Lloyd Webber and Patricia Knop, rarely rises above the
likes of ``The world is a confusing place sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the line, ``Everyone dies, even the cat.'' Wait a
minute. Weren't cats supposed to be ``now and forever''?

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about Raisa Gorbachev's Club, a civic
group that has been active for almost a year. It was created by me
and a number of wonderful women: authors, journalists, some members
of the State Duma and women who are social scientists. We aren't an
elite club for socializing and not a political club either. We are
a discussion forum to debate the urgent issues.
</P>
<P>
   We are focussing now on an important problem that has not been
properly addressed by government, so we are looking for support
from other people to try to address it: the plight of Russia's
homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the streets of
Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that today
the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and creating a
kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and mistreating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

<TEXT>

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or

other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did

 &HT;    Florida Atlantic University up for promotion
 &HT;    By Don Horine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This could be the week that Florida
Atlantic University in Boca Raton gets the title of research
university, allowing it to expand its graduate programs, compete
for grant money and eventually collect higher tuition from
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan being considered by Florida's Board of Regents,
FAU would be one of three schools in the second tier of Florida
research universities. The first tier _ the University of Florida,
Florida State University and the University of South Florida _
would be classified as national research universities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan proposed by Chancellor Adam Herbert pleases FAU
President Anthony Catanese and other FAU officials. They see the
school's continued growth as a state-designated research university
as good for Palm Beach County because it would fuel economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   But can Florida afford to have six public research universities?
And what would be the effect on undergraduate students, who make up
77 percent of FAU's 20,000 students?
</P>
<P>
   These two questions haven't been discussed by regents since
Herbert made his proposal in May. The regents, meeting in
Tallahassee through Friday, have indicated they like the proposal
and will incorporate it into their five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert's proposal assumes that students benefit by attending a
research university. Consequently, if the legislature approves,
tuition will go up 5 percent for schools like FAU and 10 percent at
schools such as Florida and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty research, according to conventional wisdom, expands the
frontiers of knowledge and helps professors keep abreast of
developments in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   But a commission appointed by the Carnegie Foundation concluded
in January that most undergraduate students at research
universities receive a poor education. That's because these schools
emphasize research at the expense of teaching by keeping top
instructors from the classroom, leaving undergraduate students to
take classes from graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   When commission Chairwoman Shirley Strum Kenny outlined the
criticisms at a regents meeting in May, Florida's public university
presidents said little. Later, it became evident why. They don't
believe that Florida universities have the faults cited by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more than 31,000 undergraduate students,'' said John
Lombardi, president of the University of Florida. ``I'm going to
overlook them?''
</P>
<P>
   Catanese said he thought Florida universities were doing a
better job with undergraduate education than other universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Kenny's) using too broad a brush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the more research that a Florida public university does,
the more likely it is that its undergraduate students will be
taught by graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   At FAU, graduate students teach 11 percent of the undergraduate
classes. At UF, it's 19 percent. At the University of West Florida,
one of four ``comprehensive universities'' in Herbert's plan, it's
just 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Catanese called the proposed lineup of research universities ``a
fair assessment of where everybody is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But having three national research universities in Florida, none
of them in South Florida, bothers Mitch Maidique, president of
Florida International University in Miami, and Regent Jon Moyle of
West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Moyle has proposed that Florida set up four national research
centers _ in Tallahassee, Gainesville, along Interstate 4 and in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Moyle's proposal hasn't gotten any support. Catanese notes that
FAU, FIU and University of Miami officials are forming a
consortium, called the I-95 high-tech corridor, to work together to
seek federal and state support for research that would attract and
spawn high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Catanese said, FAU might climb to the national
research level, but he's willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   FAU officials believe a research university designation will
help FAU attract even more research grants, which already bring in
close to $25 million a year. It also will strengthen FAU's case for
expanding its graduate education program, which now offers 15
doctorate and 47 master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the roughly $15 million FAU takes in each year in
federal research grants comes from its ocean engineering
department. That department received $5.8 million in 1996-97 from
the Office of Naval Research, most of it to build small automated
submarines to look for underwater mines and gather other
information useful to the military.
</P>
<P>
   FAU's two other large recipients are brain researcher Scott
Kelso, whose Center for Complex Systems received $1.1 million in
1996-97, and communications researcher Bill Glenn, who received
$839,390 to work on new high-definition television technology.
</P>
<P>
   Catanese has talked for years about his vision of creating
another Silicon Valley here. He and other FAU officials contend
that if FAU is allowed to expand its graduate programs, high-tech
companies will come because they want advanced training available
for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our region has a population that has a high demand for
graduate education programs,'' said FAU Vice Provost Nathan Dean,
who oversees graduate studies and research. ``It's a critical
factor in the economic development of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   FAU's research park already has attracted several small
high-tech companies. When the 52-acre park is completed in a year,
it will employ about 1,000 people in high-tech jobs, according to
director Jerry Merckel.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study done for the Business Development Board of Palm
Beach County acknowledged that the lack of a research university in
the county hurts the area's ability to attract high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the study by SRI International's Center for Economic
Competitiveness in Arlington, Va., found that what the county most
needs to compete is more trained technicians _ training that is
primarily done by high schools and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   FAU is scarcely mentioned in the report. In fact, the report
recommended that an engineering school be encouraged to set up a
satellite campus in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   FAU already has a fairly large graduate engineering program,
offering doctorate degrees in seven fields (computer science,
computer engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical
engineering, mathematical sciences, ocean engineering and physics)
and master's degrees in four others. FAU has a priority request to
the regents to offer doctorates in two other technical fields:
chemistry and biology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear from FAU,'' said Larry Pelton, the business
development board's president, who said no one from the university
sits on the group's 34-member board. ``FAU is not going to attract
the industries by themselves. It's a whole equation. They need to
partner with us and industry. Maybe the two of us ought to be
talking about this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wiesenfeld, dean of the College of Science, says FAU's
graduate program is the most important factor in the county's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to compete for basically low-level industrial
jobs, you've got to realize you're competing with Malaysia, Latin
America and a lot of other regions, and you're competing by and
large on the cost of labor,'' he said. ``You want to compete where
it's not how fast you are, how many components you can turn out.
You want to compete in how smart you are.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q. Did any of the pilots who flew in the Berlin Airlift win any
medals or commendations for their efforts?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. In fact, provided they qualified in terms of time and
duty, everyone who participated in the airlift was eligible to
receive a Humane Action Medal and/or a Berlin Airlift Device, said
Joseph Studak of the Berlin Airlift Veterans Association in Austin,
Texas. In all, some 28,000 people in all duty specialties in the
Army, Navy and Air Force were honored, said Studak, a retired Air
Force lieutenant colonel. To qualify for the Airlift Device (worn
with the Army of Occupation Medal), a person had to serve at least
90 consecutive days in direct support of the airlift, which took
place June 26, 1948, to Sept. 30, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In baseball, a K is used as a symbol for a strikeout. How did
that come about?
</P>
<P>
   A. When Henry Chadwick invented a scoring system in 1861, he
came up with a series of letter symbols, primarily for ease and
speed in recording the action: A for a putout at first base, B at
second, and C at third; F for a caught flyball; S for a sacrifice;
and, because he already had used F, L for a batter who had fouled
out (L from the last letter of ``foul''). Chadwick picked K for
struck out and in 1883 explained the decision: ``It was the
prominent letter of the word strike, as far as remembering the word
was concerned.'' Over time, Chadwick's system was superseded by
elements of other scoring systems, but the K remained.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any record showing how much money distillers and
brewers of alcoholic beverages contribute to national political
candidates in both major parties?
</P>
<P>
   A. The most recent information available about beer and liquor
campaign funding, as reported by the Encyclopedia of Congressional
Money and Politics, is for the 1994 elections. These were the top
10 contributors: National Beer Wholesalers Association, $1.24
million; Anheuser-Busch, $335,470; Joseph E. Seagram &AMP; Sons,
$216,770; Wine &AMP; Spirits Wholesalers of America, $191,460;
Brown-Forman Distillers, $149,475; Gallo Winery, $141,708; Wine
Institute, $136,710; Heublein, $89,970; Florida Distillers Co.,
$89,940; and Smirnoff/Inglenook Distributors, $77,150.
</P>
<P>
   Top Senate recipients: Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), $108,134;
Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), $66,450; Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas),
$60,250; Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), $53,704; and Richard Bryan (D-Nev.),
$44,430. Top House recipients: Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.), $121,950; Vic
Fazio (D-Calif.), $56,050; Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), $51,000; Sam
Gibbons (D-Fla.), $41,750; and Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), $40,250.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $4.36 million donated by the beer, wine and liquor
industries, it was almost an even split to Democratic candidates
($2,184,493) and Republicans ($2,173,360).
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour'' on PBS used to be one of my
favorite news programs. It's now ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.''
What happened to Robert MacNeil?
</P>
<P>
   A. He's still involved with MacNeil-Lehrer Productions in
Arlington, Va., in which both men have been active for 15 years,
said company publicist Susan Trabucchi. But the former ``NewsHour''
anchor generally keeps a low profile, rarely accepting speaking
engagements or appearing before a camera. His primary focus of late
has been writing, Trabucchi said, with a novel, ``Breaking News,''
expected to be published by Doubleday in late October.
</P>
<P>
   He also is planning two programs for PBS, one a sequel to his
broadcast, ``The Story of English,'' about 11 years ago. The sequel
will examine the American language. The other series is the
nine-hour-long ``Shakespeare,'' which MacNeil described as an
examination in a contemporary manner of ``why this 400-year-old
dead, white male, so anachronistic in many ways, remains the
world's supreme and best-loved author and, recently, Hollywood's
No. 1 screenwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil has children in Denver, Boston and London, as well as
brothers in his native Nova Scotia, so he and his wife travel
frequently. New York is their permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does it mean when someone tells you to ``mind your p's
and q's''?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are numerous theories, but Facts on File Encyclopedia
of Word and Phrase Origins narrows them down to what it calls the
three top contenders:
</P>
<P>
   (1) Children learning to write English are told to be careful
not to reverse the knobs on the letters and make p's look like q's,
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   (2) In the days of lead type, apprentice printers were told to
be careful in picking out type, especially since a typesetter had
to read letters upside down and backward.
</P>
<P>
   (3) British tavernkeepers had to be careful when figuring up
customers' monthly bar bills not to confuse p's (pints) and q's
(quarts).
</P>
<P>
   Q. How were DNA samples taken from the remains of the body of
the former U.S. Unknown Soldier killed in Vietnam? Testing enabled
the military recently to identify the remains as that of Air Force
1st Lt. Michael Blassie.
</P>
<P>
   A. Genetic samples were extracted from bones in the Tomb of the
Unknowns. To make the match, those samples then were tested against
DNA samples from family members of seven of nine American soldiers
shot down near An Loc in South Vietnam in mid-1972. Blassie's
family had pushed the Defense Department to disinter the remains
and perform the genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do military jets, including those reconfigured from
commercial aircraft, fly so much higher than commercial jets?
</P>
<P>
   A. Except for high-performance aircraft, they don't, says Lt.
Col. Steven Brown of the Air Force military liaison to the Federal
Aviation Administration in Atlanta. The normal cruising altitude of
military planes is between 28,000 and 35,000 feet, or whatever is
assigned by air traffic controllers at the time. Those military
planes that are derivatives of commercial planes actually are
structurally identical, with only the interiors reconfigured, so
their altitudes and other performance capabilities are the same.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, such as the SR-71, which can fly much
higher, Brown added. Needless to say, there's no commercial
derivative of the SR-71.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are raw potatoes safe to eat? I'm concerned because of all
the news about E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   A. Raw vegetables and fruit that come in contact with the feces
of animals harboring E. coli 0157:H7, or with feces from unclean
hands of infected workers, could be a source of this organism, said
Judy Harrison of the University of Georgia Department of Foods and
Nutrition. Like any other raw agricultual commodity, potatoes could
be contaminated with types of bacteria or bacterial spores, but the
risk is minimal, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison advises handling potatoes just like any other fresh
fruit or vegetables: wash them under fresh, running tap water; use
a clean vegetable brush, if you wish; and peel them if you want to,
since that can help remove surface contamination. But peeling will
eliminate a source of fiber from your diet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the qualifying stages of the World Cup (as opposed to the
finals recently played in France), all countries are entitled to
enter their national team except for Great Britain, which enters
four separate teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. In soccer, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
always have been separate entities, instead of coming under the
U.K. banner as they do in the Olympics. For various reasons, most
of them political and turf-related, they have fielded separate
teams and there have been few public calls to merge. Each has its
own federation and professional league.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity isn't as bad now as it has been historically, but
Scottish fans still indulge in a familiar chant, ``Stand Up If You
Hate England.'' England and Scotland, which played the first known
international match in 1872, discontinued their annual match in
1989. Their last meeting was a 2-0 win by England in the 1996
European Championships, and the all-time record between the two is
fairly close: England leads 44-40, with 24 ties.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This year's was the 16th World Cup. Of the 15 played
previously, the countries in this year's cup account for 13
champions: Brazil, 4; Italy and Germany, 3 each; Argentina, 2; and
England, 1. Who won the other two?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uruguay won twice, in 1930 (defeating Argentina, 4-2) and in
1950 (defeating Brazil, 2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Q. A recent Q&AMP;A mentioned female FBI special agents. What are
the qualifications necessary to become one?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a good time for qualified women (and men) to apply
because ``the FBI is hiring,'' said agency spokeswoman Celestine
Armstead. Those with at least three years of skilled professional
experience, in such fields as engineering or computers, and those
proficient in foreign languages, especially Spanish, are
particularly in demand.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for training as a special agent, an individual, male
or female, must be a U.S. citizen, or a citizen of the Northern
Mariana Islands, and have reached his or her 23rd _ but not 37th _
birthday. Candidates must be completely available for assignment
anywhere in the FBI's headquarters or field offices; pass a
polygraph examination, a drug test and a color vision test; and
must hold a degree from an accredited college or university. Other
eligibility requirements also apply.
</P>
<P>
   Details are available from FBI field offices.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does the A&AMP;W of A&AMP;W Root Beer stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A. A(llen) &AMP; W(right). Roy Allen mixed up his first batch of
root beer in June 1919 in Lodi, Calif., selling a mug for a nickel.
Frank Wright, an employee from Allen's original Lodi location,
became his partner in 1922 and they combined the initials and
formally named the beverage A&AMP;W Root Beer. In 1924, Allen bought
Wright's share of the business to actively pursue a franchise sales
program and had the name A&AMP;W Root Beer, and the A&AMP;W logo, legally
trademarked.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Mom rates Meijer a mortal sin
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you grew up in Catholic schools in the '60s,
sins had letter values: N, V and M, short for ``no sin,'' ``venial
sin'' and ``mortal sin.'' I pored over my rate-that-sin
assignments, scribbling N, V or M next to the sin described.
</P>
<P>
   Watching The Lawrence Welk Show, for instance, would merit an N.
Stealing your brother's Beatles lunch box would be a V, and
skipping Sunday Mass to catch a matinee of The Valley of the Dolls
would definitely be an M, maybe a double M.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years my mother has made an addendum to litany of
mortal sins: shopping at Meijer.
</P>
<P>
   When the 201,000-square-foot behemoth opened at East Stroop Road
and Wilmington Pike in 1991, Mom vowed she'd never shop there. She
didn't like the size of it, and she hated the thought of Meijer
squeezing out the smaller grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Mom knew she could never go back to the kind of mom-and-pop
store she grew up with: Amann's grocery store at Tacoma Street and
Carlisle Avenue in the East Dayton neighborhood now known as Linden
Heights. During the Depression, the Amanns gave families a break by
charging by the month. The kindly Bud Amann kept accounts in a
spiral notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those days are long gone,'' Mom concedes. We all know the
mom-and-pop store _ heck, anything short of Cub Foods _ is headed
for the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't blame Mom for not wanting to shop in a place with all
the ambience of a dirigible hangar. I became a Fulmer convert.
Everyone was friendly, and you could browse its homey 33,000 square
feet without feeling dizzy and disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   The store was bustling Tuesday afternoon _ busier than usual,
alas _ with shoppers taking advantage of the 20 percent
stock-reduction sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this store closing?'' a woman asked, looking disheartened
at the news. ``This was a nice store.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the times. In the end even Mom has been forced to
sin occasionally. ``They're the closest store, and they have the
cheapest cat food,'' she explained, in tones reserved for the
confessional. For the most part, she still patronized the smaller
Kettering groceries. One by one, they closed. Bob's Food Warehouse.
IGA Foodtown. Groceryland. Wilmington Heights Market. They weren't
Amann's corner store, but still the kind of places where you could
order Jim's secret-recipe ham salad, and be recognized as a
regular.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, during a dinner at my parents' house, Mom greeted
us with the doleful news: ``I've shut down my fifth grocery
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Black Widow of South Dayton supermarkets has struck
again. Fulmer Supermarket in Beavercreek, where she has shopped
seven years, is going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Mom's sure it happened because of competition from Meijer and
the new Kroger at Woodman and Dorothy Lane. We suspected another
culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they should put up wanted posters, 'Do not let this
woman shop here,' '' Debbie said.
</P>
<P>
   My husband jumped in: ``The manager could get on the PA system
and announce, `Vera McCarty, you are not authorized to shop in this
store. Return to your vehicle immediately.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Where should Mom shop now? Dot's? Lofino's? Dorothy Lane Market?
(Gasps all around the table.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Do those guys a favor,'' Dad admonished, ``and don't shop
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Mom's going to have to face facts: If she wants to torpedo
Meijer, her only recourse is to become a regular customer

 &HT;    Heaven on American Frontier
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ While helping a friend move a fortune in antique
guns this past Independence Day weekend, I concluded that America's
western
</P>
<P>
   expansion would have been the best time to be alive. Actually, I
had that thought when I first read Zane Grey and Jack London as a
boy. But handling guns that were actually owned and used by
pioneers, outlaws and lawmen on the western frontier brought it all
back.
</P>
<P>
   Those guns were the everyday, indispensable tools of men and
women who settled this nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the guns that fascinate me about this period of history
_ it's the freedom, challenges and opportunities of the western
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women on the frontier survived on their wits and
skills. Those who couldn't cut it either died or they returned to
the protective
</P>
<P>
   embrace of land already settled.
</P>
<P>
   Even those Americans who failed to settle on rich farm land,
establish big ranches or strike gold must have lived a life of
adventure that more
</P>
<P>
   than compensated for frontier hardships.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest Americans who moved into the western wilderness
lived without government rules, regulations, taxes or laws. There
were no
</P>
<P>
   traffic laws, no disturbing the peace laws and no product
liability laws.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, for the earliest pioneers, there were no laws at all.
Therefore, there were no law enforcement officers, lawmakers,
lawyers or
</P>
<P>
   judges. It wasn't civilization, but it might have been heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I can't envision heaven as a place where angels are
required to wear seat belts, where St. Peter writes tickets for
jaywalking and where
</P>
<P>
   clouds have tags that warn ``Do Not Remove Under Penalty of
Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As America's western settlers began to clump together in
frontier towns, they had to decide what behavior was intolerable.
Stealing a
</P>
<P>
   man's horse or shooting someone in the back who didn't deserve
it were generally sufficient reasons to permanently exile the
wrongdoer to Boot Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier justice was short and sweet. Law-abiding townsfolk
would have thought it insane to support a convicted killer for 20
years worth of
</P>
<P>
   legal appeals. Then again, they also probably executed a few
innocent folks.
</P>
<P>
   It's also interesting to recall the priorities of frontier
settlers when they established a new town. Businesses were
established by
</P>
<P>
   entrepreneurs. The town's residents provided their own shelter.
The first tax-supported employee was a teacher or a marshal. The
first
</P>
<P>
   tax-supported building was either a school house or a jail.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of a frontier town might come together to build a
church, but the preacher was expected to support himself.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, of course, but the quality of a city's
police and schools probably remains a good gauge of a community.
</P>
<P>
   Members of America's Libertarian Party also must believe that
the period of America's western expansion was the best time to be
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Libertarians believe in a world where individuals live without
government interference.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement of principles, Libertarians say they believe
``that all individuals have the right to exercise sole dominion
over their own
</P>
<P>
   lives, and have the right to live in whatever manner they
choose, so long as they do not forcibly interfere with the equal
right of others to
</P>
<P>
   live in whatever manner they choose.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the tricky part, of course. Laws are needed to establish
rights and law enforcement is needed to prevent the strong from
exploiting the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization requires government, rules, regulations and laws.
There's no way around it.
</P>
<P>
   But the early settlers of America's West enjoyed a brief period
of real freedom, although this also was a time when Native
Americans lost freedoms.

<P>
   Q. I'm from Ohio, and our family always thought Roy Rogers was
born in Portsmouth, on the Kentucky border east of Cincinnati. But
articles after Rogers' died said he was born in Cincinnati. Can you
shed any light?
</P>
<P>
   A. Leonard Franklin Slye (Rogers' birth name) was born Nov. 5,
1911, in Cincinnati. He later would write jokingly that his birth
site was visited each spring by one million people, because the
modest brick tenement that was his first home stood on what later
would be about second base of Riverfront Stadium (now Cinergy
Field).
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to the story, and it may be the light you're
looking for. When Leonard was a small child, his father, Andrew
Slye, who worked in the Cincinnati factory of the United States
Shoe Co., became impatient with life in the city and moved his
family by houseboat to Portsmouth, on the Ohio River. They lived
there for several years before moving again, in 1919, this time to
a farm in Duck Run, Ohio. When Leonard was 17, the family moved
back to Cincinnati, and in 1930 they moved again _ this time to
California.
</P>
<P>
   After a time working as a seasonal migrant fruit picker, Len
Slye, as he called himself, turned to singing, and later to movies.
He was known briefly as Dick Weston, then Roy Rogers. You know the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can fans send cards to Dale Evans to express sorrow
about the death of her husband, Roy Rogers?
</P>
<P>
   A. The address: 15650 Seneca Road, Victorville, CA 92392.
</P>
<P>
   Q. With all the publicity about the Volkswagen Beetle coming
back, and the announcement by Volkswagen of a fund to pay laborers
who worked for the company under the Nazis in 1944-45, I'm
wondering if it's true, as I have heard: Did Adolf Hitler play a
prominent role in introducing the original VW Bug?
</P>
<P>
   A. While in prison in 1924, Hitler read the biography of Henry
Ford and became fascinated with the idea of a car every worker
could afford. You might say the germ of the VW story dates to 1933,
when Hitler became Germany's chancellor. Among his Depression
projects was a network of superhighways, the autobahns. To
complement these new roads, he asked German auto manufacturers to
build a small car with specific requirements: It had to accommodate
a family of four or five, be low in initial cost, and be able to
cruise all day at high speeds on the autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Ferdinand Porsche, an automotive engineer who ran his
own consulting engineering company, was commissioned to design the
automobile. He already had developed a design for the NSU company,
so he used that as the basis for the Hitler car. In 1938, a factory
was started in Wolfsburg, Germany. Hitler wanted to call the car
the KdF-wagen (from Kraft durch Freude, or ``strength through
joy''), but the public quickly dubbed it the People's Car, or
Volkswagen, and the name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Of the murders committed in the United States, what are the
most commonly used weapons (guns, knives, poison and so on)?
</P>
<P>
   A. The most recent statistics, released Sept. 28, 1997, are for
1996, and are from the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation publication Crime in the United States (1996). They
show that of 15,848 murder victims, these were the weapons used,
the number of victims, and their percentage of the total: firearms,
10,744, or 67.8 percent; knives or cutting instruments, 2,142,
13.5; personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, which includes
pushing), 939, 5.9; blunt objects (such as clubs, hammers), 733,
4.6; strangulation, 243, 1.5; fire, 151, 1; asphyxiation, 92, .6;
narcotics, 32, .2; explosives, 14, .1; and poison, 8, .1. Of the
remaining victims, the weapon was ``other'' or not stated, and
includes drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When John Tyler ran for president, his slogan was ``tippy
canoe and Tyler, too.'' What did that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. The first part of the slogan, which was the rallying cry of
Whigs in the presidential campaign of 1840, was Tippecanoe. It
referred to the victory by Gen. William Henry Harrison in 1811 over
an Indian uprising headed by the Shawnee chief, Tecumseh, at the
Tippecanoe River in Indiana. Harrison was the one running for
president, and Tyler was his running mate. Tyler became president
when Harrison died shortly after his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the latest on the disappearance of Madalyn Murray
O'Hair, the atheist?
</P>
<P>
   A. O'Hair, along with son Jon Murray and adopted granddaughter
Robin Eileen Murray O'Hair, have been declared ``incapacitated'' by
a probate judge in Austin, Texas, where the family lived. Austin
police say their file remains open. The three disappeared in August
1995, and it isn't known whether they are dead or alive. If alive,
O'Hair would be about 80 now.
</P>
<P>
   Theories about their fate range from kidnapping, robbery and
triple homicide to the belief that O'Hair went to San Antonio to
die and that Jon and Robin are in hiding _ possibly overseas _ and
living off money siphoned from accounts of atheist organizations
controlled by the Murray O'Hairs. One of those organizations has
reported more than $600,000 missing.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development is that the O'Hair family's five-bedroom
house in Austin is for sale. Ali Hassibi, a renter of the house,
said he thought he could buy it at a bargain price, given its
notoriety. Wrong, he says he discovered; the house is listed for
$267,500. Because of the family's disappearance, any sale must be
approved by two courts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which island in the Azores was affected by the earthquake
July 9? News reports have not been specific.
</P>
<P>
   A. The hardest-hit of the archipelago's nine volcanic islands
was Faial, where authorities said about 500 homes were destroyed,
with damage initally estimated at $64 million. Eight people were
killed in rural villages on Faial's eastern coast, said Helena Vaz,
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service. The magnitude
5.8 quake was centered in the Atlantic Ocean 12 miles off Faial.
Other Azores islands rocked by the quake included Pico, Sao Jorge
and Terceira, where the U.S. Air Force has a base. The islands are
about 800 miles west of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I thought people born between 1917 and 1924 were the
so-called Social Security ``notch babies.'' But Q&AMP;A recently
reported the years as 1917 through 1921. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A. The dictionary (Random House Unabridged) defines ``notch
baby'' as ``a person who was born in the U.S. between 1917 and 1921
and as a retiree received lower cost-of-living increases in Social
Security than others after Congress readjusted Social Security
benefits in 1977.'' The American Association of Retired Persons
says the notch is 1917-21, as does the Social Security
Administration. That is the period when a transition formula was
applied to those receiving benefits, said agency spokeswoman Patti
Patterson, who added that ``anyone born after 1916 is affected by
the change in the way benefits are figured.'' Although several
advocacy groups have extended the years ``as a way to involve more
people and make their case stronger,'' there's no direct reason to
do so, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The TREA Senior Citizens League of Washington, which refers to
individuals born from 1917 through 1926 as forming the notch,
apparently is one such group. It supports a cost-capped solution to
what it calls the ``inequity of benefits,'' and endorses HR 3008,
which proposes to provide a $5,000 lump-sum payment or increased
monthly benefits through 2002 to those born in the notch _ whatever
it is defined to be.
</P>
<P>
   As Q&AMP;A pointed out previously, members of Congress have
introduced 118 pieces of notch-reform legislation since 1981. None
has been passed into law.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did any of the pilots who flew in the Berlin Airlift win any
medals or commendations for their efforts?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. In fact, provided they qualified in terms of time and
duty, everyone who participated in the airlift was eligible to
receive a Humane Action Medal and/or a Berlin Airlift Device, said
Joseph Studak of the Berlin Airlift Veterans Association in Austin,
Texas. In all, some 28,000 people in all duty specialties in the
Army, Navy and Air Force were honored, said Studak, a retired Air
Force lieutenant colonel. To qualify for the Airlift Device (worn
with the Army of Occupation Medal), a person had to serve at least
90 consecutive days in direct support of the airlift, which took
place June 26, 1948, to Sept. 30, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In baseball, a K is used as a symbol for a strikeout. How did
that come about?
</P>
<P>
   A. When Henry Chadwick invented a scoring system in 1861, he
came up with a series of letter symbols, primarily for ease and
speed in recording the action: A for a putout at first base, B at
second, and C at third; F for a caught flyball; S for a sacrifice;
and, because he already had used F, L for a batter who had fouled
out (L from the last letter of ``foul''). Chadwick picked K for
struck out and in 1883 explained the decision: ``It was the
prominent letter of the word strike, as far as remembering the word
was concerned.'' Over time, Chadwick's system was superseded by
elements of other scoring systems, but the K remained.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any record showing how much money distillers and
brewers of alcoholic beverages contribute to national political
candidates in both major parties?
</P>
<P>
   A. The most recent information available about beer and liquor
campaign funding, as reported by the Encyclopedia of Congressional
Money and Politics, is for the 1994 elections. These were the top
10 contributors: National Beer Wholesalers Association, $1.24
million; Anheuser-Busch, $335,470; Joseph E. Seagram &AMP; Sons,
$216,770; Wine &AMP; Spirits Wholesalers of America, $191,460;
Brown-Forman Distillers, $149,475; Gallo Winery, $141,708; Wine
Institute, $136,710; Heublein, $89,970; Florida Distillers Co.,
$89,940; and Smirnoff/Inglenook Distributors, $77,150.
</P>
<P>
   Top Senate recipients: Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), $108,134;
Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), $66,450; Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas),
$60,250; Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), $53,704; and Richard Bryan (D-Nev.),
$44,430. Top House recipients: Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.), $121,950; Vic
Fazio (D-Calif.), $56,050; Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), $51,000; Sam
Gibbons (D-Fla.), $41,750; and Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), $40,250.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $4.36 million donated by the beer, wine and liquor
industries, it was almost an even split to Democratic candidates
($2,184,493) and Republicans ($2,173,360).
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour'' on PBS used to be one of my
favorite news programs. It's now ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.''
What happened to Robert MacNeil?
</P>
<P>
   A. He's still involved with MacNeil-Lehrer Productions in
Arlington, Va., in which both men have been active for 15 years,
said company publicist Susan Trabucchi. But the former ``NewsHour''
anchor generally keeps a low profile, rarely accepting speaking
engagements or appearing before a camera. His primary focus of late
has been writing, Trabucchi said, with a novel, ``Breaking News,''
expected to be published by Doubleday in late October.
</P>
<P>
   He also is planning two programs for PBS, one a sequel to his
broadcast, ``The Story of English,'' about 11 years ago. The sequel
will examine the American language. The other series is the
nine-hour-long ``Shakespeare,'' which MacNeil described as an
examination in a contemporary manner of ``why this 400-year-old
dead, white male, so anachronistic in many ways, remains the
world's supreme and best-loved author and, recently, Hollywood's
No. 1 screenwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil has children in Denver, Boston and London, as well as
brothers in his native Nova Scotia, so he and his wife travel
frequently. New York is their permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does it mean when someone tells you to ``mind your p's
and q's''?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are numerous theories, but Facts on File Encyclopedia
of Word and Phrase Origins narrows them down to what it calls the
three top contenders:
</P>
<P>
   (1) Children learning to write English are told to be careful
not to reverse the knobs on the letters and make p's look like q's,
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   (2) In the days of lead type, apprentice printers were told to
be careful in picking out type, especially since a typesetter had
to read letters upside down and backward.
</P>
<P>
   (3) British tavernkeepers had to be careful when figuring up
customers' monthly bar bills not to confuse p's (pints) and q's
(quarts).
</P>
<P>
   Q. How were DNA samples taken from the remains of the body of
the former U.S. Unknown Soldier killed in Vietnam? Testing enabled
the military recently to identify the remains as that of Air Force
1st Lt. Michael Blassie.
</P>
<P>
   A. Genetic samples were extracted from bones in the Tomb of the
Unknowns. To make the match, those samples then were tested against
DNA samples from family members of seven of nine American soldiers
shot down near An Loc in South Vietnam in mid-1972. Blassie's
family had pushed the Defense Department to disinter the remains
and perform the genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do military jets, including those reconfigured from
commercial aircraft, fly so much higher than commercial jets?
</P>
<P>
   A. Except for high-performance aircraft, they don't, says Lt.
Col. Steven Brown of the Air Force military liaison to the Federal
Aviation Administration in Atlanta. The normal cruising altitude of
military planes is between 28,000 and 35,000 feet, or whatever is
assigned by air traffic controllers at the time. Those military
planes that are derivatives of commercial planes actually are
structurally identical, with only the interiors reconfigured, so
their altitudes and other performance capabilities are the same.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, such as the SR-71, which can fly much
higher, Brown added. Needless to say, there's no commercial
derivative of the SR-71.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are raw potatoes safe to eat? I'm concerned because of all
the news about E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   A. Raw vegetables and fruit that come in contact with the feces
of animals harboring E. coli 0157:H7, or with feces from unclean
hands of infected workers, could be a source of this organism, said
Judy Harrison of the University of Georgia Department of Foods and
Nutrition. Like any other raw agricultual commodity, potatoes could
be contaminated with types of bacteria or bacterial spores, but the
risk is minimal, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison advises handling potatoes just like any other fresh
fruit or vegetables: wash them under fresh, running tap water; use
a clean vegetable brush, if you wish; and peel them if you want to,
since that can help remove surface contamination. But peeling will
eliminate a source of fiber from your diet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the qualifying stages of the World Cup (as opposed to the
finals recently played in France), all countries are entitled to
enter their national team except for Great Britain, which enters
four separate teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. In soccer, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
always have been separate entities, instead of coming under the
U.K. banner as they do in the Olympics. For various reasons, most
of them political and turf-related, they have fielded separate
teams and there have been few public calls to merge. Each has its
own federation and professional league.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity isn't as bad now as it has been historically, but
Scottish fans still indulge in a familiar chant, ``Stand Up If You
Hate England.'' England and Scotland, which played the first known
international match in 1872, discontinued their annual match in
1989. Their last meeting was a 2-0 win by England in the 1996
European Championships, and the all-time record between the two is
fairly close: England leads 44-40, with 24 ties.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This year's was the 16th World Cup. Of the 15 played
previously, the countries in this year's cup account for 13
champions: Brazil, 4; Italy and Germany, 3 each; Argentina, 2; and
England, 1. Who won the other two?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uruguay won twice, in 1930 (defeating Argentina, 4-2) and in
1950 (defeating Brazil, 2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Q. A recent Q&AMP;A mentioned female FBI special agents. What are
the qualifications necessary to become one?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a good time for qualified women (and men) to apply
because ``the FBI is hiring,'' said agency spokeswoman Celestine
Armstead. Those with at least three years of skilled professional
experience, in such fields as engineering or computers, and those
proficient in foreign languages, especially Spanish, are
particularly in demand.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for training as a special agent, an individual, male
or female, must be a U.S. citizen, or a citizen of the Northern
Mariana Islands, and have reached his or her 23rd _ but not 37th _
birthday. Candidates must be completely available for assignment
anywhere in the FBI's headquarters or field offices; pass a
polygraph examination, a drug test and a color vision test; and
must hold a degree from an accredited college or university. Other
eligibility requirements also apply.
</P>
<P>
   Details are available from FBI field offices.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does the A&AMP;W of A&AMP;W Root Beer stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A. A(llen) &AMP; W(right). Roy Allen mixed up his first batch of
root beer in June 1919 in Lodi, Calif., selling a mug for a nickel.
Frank Wright, an employee from Allen's original Lodi location,
became his partner in 1922 and they combined the initials and
formally named the beverage A&AMP;W Root Beer. In 1924, Allen bought
Wright's share of the business to actively pursue a franchise sales
program and had the name A&AMP;W Root Beer, and the A&AMP;W logo, legally
trademarked.

notoriety. Wrong, he says he discovered; the house is listed for
$267,500. Because of the family's disappearance, any sale must be
approved by two courts.

<P>
   Q. Which island in the Azores was affected by the earthquake
July 9? News reports have not been specific.
</P>
<P>
   A. The hardest-hit of the archipelago's nine volcanic islands
was Faial, where authorities said about 500 homes were destroyed,
with damage initally estimated at $64 million. Eight people were
killed in rural villages on Faial's eastern coast, said Helena Vaz,
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service. The magnitude
5.8 quake was centered in the Atlantic Ocean 12 miles off Faial.
Other Azores islands rocked by the quake included Pico, Sao Jorge
and Terceira, where the U.S. Air Force has a base. The islands are
about 800 miles west of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I thought people born between 1917 and 1924 were the
so-called Social Security ``notch babies.'' But Q&AMP;A recently
reported the years as 1917 through 1921. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A. The dictionary (Random House Unabridged) defines ``notch
baby'' as ``a person who was born in the U.S. between 1917 and 1921
and as a retiree received lower cost-of-living increases in Social
Security than others after Congress readjusted Social Security
benefits in 1977.'' The American Association of Retired Persons
says the notch is 1917-21, as does the Social Security
Administration. That is the period when a transition formula was
applied to those receiving benefits, said agency spokeswoman Patti
Patterson, who added that ``anyone born after 1916 is affected by
the change in the way benefits are figured.'' Although several
advocacy groups have extended the years ``as a way to involve more
people and make their case stronger,'' there's no direct reason to
do so, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The TREA Senior Citizens League of Washington, which refers to
individuals born from 1917 through 1926 as forming the notch,
apparently is one such group. It supports a cost-capped solution to
what it calls the ``inequity of benefits,'' and endorses HR 3008,
which proposes to provide a $5,000 lump-sum payment or increased
monthly benefits through 2002 to those born in the notch _ whatever
it is defined to be.
</P>
<P>
   As Q&AMP;A pointed out previously, members of Congress have
introduced 118 pieces of notch-reform legislation since 1981. None
has been passed into law.

 &HT;    Picture this: Web cams proliferating
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse and Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Homer Ramby credits the ``WayneCam'' with an
extra big turnout for this year's Wayne Twp. Volunteer Fire
Department Fish Fry.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, perched atop a telephone pole at Miami and Main
streets a block from the firehouse, uploads an image of downtown
Waynesville onto the Internet every 20 minutes, where it can be
seen by anyone sitting at a computer from Switzerland to Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good publicity,'' said Ramby, a 57-year-old volunteer
firefighter who set up the cam site
(www.interaxs.net/pub/wtfd/livecam.htm) in August. ``You can check
24 hours a day and see what downtown Waynesville looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   If that prospect doesn't thrill you, then try the late-night
scene at the Walnut Hills Bar on Dayton's Brown Street
(www.walnuthills.com), where patrons may be sampling one of the
tavern's 100 brews or listening to alternative rock music. ``It
feels like you're in the bar, and that's the idea,'' said co-owner
Dennis Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   From small towns to hip urban watering holes, web cam sites are
proliferating on the Internet faster than the most voracious
cyberspace voyeurs can double-click. Communities, businesses and
not-so-private people are linking camera views to computers with
the aim of promoting, advertising or, in some cases, exposing
themselves for 15-megabytes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ringley, whose Jennicam page (www.jennicam.org) is the
best-known of all the web cam sites, lures half a million viewers a
week who are either bored, or lurid, enough to watch her putter
about her Washington, D.C., apartment and occasionally step out of
her shower undressed.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of web cam sites capturing everything from
building construction (like Wright State University's new academic
building at www.media.wright.edu/raidercam.html) to live births,
from toilet stalls (don't ask) to college dorm rooms, from mundane
business offices to dramatic water falls
(www.fallsview.com/falls.html).
</P>
<P>
   What's perhaps more amazing is that so many techno-peepers are
tuning into so little, said Bryan Pfaffenberger, an Internet
historian at the University of Virginia and author of Protect Your
Privacy on the Internet (John Wiley, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the whole web cam site phenomenon puts its finger on
some sort of need that computer users have to extend their
perceptions to far-away locales _ even if what they see is
completely boring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a trend that's certain to accelerate as the price of
cameras continues to tumble and software becomes even easier to
install, experts say. Two years ago, the equipment and software for
a web cam site cost as much as $5,000. Today, you can set up a site
for less than $200. The smallest cameras, some as cheap as $50, are
now about the size of colored markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cameras are only going to get smaller and cheaper. I think
every kid is going to get one _ and sneak it into his big sister's
room,'' quipped Jim Sterne of Target Marketing, an Internet
marketing consultant firm based in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At the Walnut Hills Bar in Dayton, which launched its web site
two weeks ago, a sign is going up to warn patrons that their suds
sipping and socializing may be viewed 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as my parents aren't surfing the Net, it's fine with
me,'' said Greg Cassimatis, a 23-year-old regular who often shares
a table in full view of the bar's web cam.
</P>
<P>
   The candid shots at Walnut Hills, which change every two
minutes, are part of a new web page that includes a menu, a jukebox
list, a beer page, a chat room, links to The Grateful Dead websites
and a Dear Abby knock-off authored by bartender Mike Altomare,
dubbed ``Ask Big Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Walnut Hills Bar has alway been a pretty hip place, and
this is hip,'' Stewart said. ``This crowd is into computers,
tattoos and alternative music.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart admits he still doesn't know what purpose is served by
turning his barroom into a fishbowl, but he's fascinated by the
creative possibilities. ``We're kids playing, is what we are,'' he
said. ``We're just having fun with it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Waynesville, where town officials tend to be very
serious about their WayneCam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are curious about Waynesville,'' said Village
Manager Kevin Harper. ``We have a reputation for being the antiques
capital of the world, and I think people like to get on our website
and see what they're getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   During the town's annual Sauerkraut Festival, an extra cam is
mounted atop the Sauerkraut Ball trailer, alternating views every
10 minutes with the WayneCam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be hundreds of miles away and be able to see
hundreds of thousands of people having a good time,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a publicity tool, Sterne says, web cam sites are only as
effective as the advertising and Internet search engines that
promote them. Otherwise, he says, it's like having an unlisted
phone number in the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing that, if you build it, they will come,''
he said. ``You have to tell people (your web site) is there.''
</P>
<P>
   It might also help to give viewers something to watch. The
WayneCam, for instance, shows a two- or three- block stretch of
Main Street, where only the cars and ant-like pedestrians change
every 20 minutes. To protect privacy, the camera is far enough away
that faces and car licenses can't be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Boring? Maybe, but Ramby says the site has had more than 28,000
``hits'' from computer users in 39 countries, including Switzerland
and Germany. ``We had one person say it looked like such a nice
town they were thinking about moving here because of the cam,''
Ramby said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Ely, a spokeswoman for Wright State University, wasn't
sure why anyone would want to watch the web cam trained on
construction of the school's new academic building. ``We never
looked at this thing until you called,'' she said. ``Who would want
to watch them construct a building?''
</P>
<P>
   But then she and her staff discovered a movie at the same web
site (www.media.wright.edu/sitecam/movies/crane2.mov) that records
a crane accident at the building site. ``Then we were all in there
watching the crane fall over _ and over and over and over,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaffenberger said Wright State may have the makings of a
world-class web cam site. ``You really start to get a lot of hits
on your site, it seems, if it's especially and exquisitely
pointless,'' he said.

 &HT;    HMO dispute less than expected
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Consumers apparently aren't as upset with the
treatment they get from health maintenance organizations as some
thought they were.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after Texas started a landmark independent review
program for consumers who want to dispute HMO treatment denials,
only 147 complaints have been filed with the Texas Department of
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Department officials had predicted they would see
4,400 complaints by the end of the year _ about 30 times the number
of complaints that have been filed to date.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, not one lawsuit has been filed alleging medical
malpractice by HMOs in the first year that Texans were permitted to
do so
</P>
<P>
   The Texas program, through which arbitrators give binding,
independent reviews of HMO and insurance company treatment denial
decisions when consumers complain, is one of the first in the
country. Reacting to consumer complaints, lawmakers approved the
program in 1997 and it went into effect in November.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Department officials said Monday they could not
provide a breakdown of complaints by company.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, said the numbers show that
problems about HMOs aren't as bad as some have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would have to say all the talk by the HMOs last
session about how the sky was going to fall was exaggerated,''
Sibley said. ``And I'm happy for them. The whole purpose of what we
did last session was to have physicians and patients make the
decisions, not HMO bookkeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the first 147 cases filed, the independent review by doctors
of the Texas Medical Foundation upheld the HMO in 67 cases and the
patient in 52 cases. The remainder are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The slim number of complaints ``makes a lot of folks wonder
whether there were the serious problems that everybody alleged that
there were,'' said Jeff Kloster, general counsel for the Texas
Association of Health Plans, which represents HMOs and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason there may be so few medical malpractice suits is
because suits must involve allegations that occurred after
September 1, 1997, which limits the number of cases that can be
filed, Kloster said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HMOs may be ``more conscientious'' in resolving
issues before they reach the independent review stage, said Lisa
McGiffert of Consumers Union in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the numbers are rising, however: By May 15,
about 70 complaints had been filed; since then, the total number
has more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another reason why the number of complaints is relatively
low is simply that consumers don't know about the program, even
though HMOs are supposed to notify consumers about it.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer is preparing to send
bulletins to HMOs and health insurance companies reminding them
that patients should be informed of the independent review process
if a decision by the HMO goes against them on a treatment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Have a dispute with your HMO over treatment?
</P>
<P>
   If a patient or a patient's doctor disputes denial of treatment
by an HMO or health insurance company, he or she may appeal the
decision orally or in writing to a company representative.
</P>
<P>
   The company representative must include the reasons of the
outcome of the appeal. The consumer must also be notified of the
right to seek review of the denial with an independent review
organization under the Texas Department of Insurance program. A
decision by the review organization is binding on both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Further information on the process is available by calling the
Texas Department of Insurance at 322-4266 or (800) 578-4677.

 &HT;    Colonia conditions across Texas
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KYLE, Texas _ Eight-year-old Tracema Castillo got the shot. So
did schoolmates Jose Camputo, Erika Vega, Christopher Chavez and
John Leafty. ``It didn't even hurt,'' said Justin Heiman, 7.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, almost 100 students in the first and second grades
at Tom Green Elementary School in northern Hays County were
vaccinated against hepatitis A one day in April.
</P>
<P>
   Why? They live in neighborhoods with leaking septic systems and
poor drainage. That means an elevated risk of contracting the liver
disease, which, although rarely fatal, causes yellowing of the skin
and eyes, nausea and vomiting. Seven cases have been reported in
that area of Hays County since October, prompting county officials
to sponsor the vaccination program.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Substandard sanitation is not confined to the
border with Mexico. Look no farther than Central Texas. In fact,
more and more subdivisions with ramshackle housing, leaking septic
systems and muddy roads are springing up all around the state,
especially in rural areas beyond the regulatory reach of cities.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these subdivisions are not eligible for
relief under a $479 million government program that finances
construction of water and sewer systems in the state's poorest
areas. That is because the program focuses on subdivisions built
before 1989 and located primarily in the border region and a few
other areas with high unemployment and low incomes.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for the spread of substandard housing is that
counties, unlike cities, have few powers under state law to
regulate development.
</P>
<P>
   Their authority was constrained even more by a 1995 court
decision in a case involving Travis County and a bank in Elgin.
Under the ruling, which hinged on the meaning of the word ``and,''
developers do not have to file subdivision blueprints if they are
not building streets or other public areas.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has prompted more and more developers to build
subdivisions without streets. They do so by carving their tracts
into parcels that look like a flag atop a pole. The house or mobile
home occupies the flag section of the lot, while the pole section
is a driveway leading to an existing public road. Such subdivisions
have numerous closely spaced and parallel driveways leading to the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The flag-lot approach allows developers to avoid the cost and
delay associated with building streets and preparing subdivision
blueprints and maps, known as plats.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Hays County and elsewhere oppose the practice
because it leaves them unaware of the subdivisions until they take
shape, making it difficult to oversee drainage, water service,
septic-system plans and other matters. Such subdivisions sometimes
end up with inadequate septic systems, poor drainage and dirt
driveways that serve as streets and become impassable by school
buses and emergency vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling that allows flag-lot development does not apply
to areas subject to a city's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Different rules also apply in the border region. The state
Legislature has granted those counties much broader regulatory
duties in an effort to curb the spread of substandard developments,
known as colonias. For example, developers may not sell residential
lots without water and sewer hookups, drainage and roads _ a
requirement that does not apply in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected ordeal
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the state's buyer-beware policy on rural
land development took Janet Williams, Amy Norwood and other
residents of the 35 South Ranches subdivision by surprise. The
subdivision is a flag-lot development of about 60 mobile homes in a
former pasture five miles east of Kyle and 20 miles south of
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 34, a vendor of office products and toys, bought a
five-acre lot in November 1996. Norwood, 34, a junior high school
journalism teacher, bought a seven-acre lot.
</P>
<P>
   The developer informed them and other buyers that each would be
responsible for building a private driveway. But the buyers had no
idea how much time, work and money it would take to tame the black
clay soil east of Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood estimated that she has spent more than $3,000 on gravel,
tractor rentals and fuel. She and a friend did the work themselves.
The job is only half finished. Still, her driveway, which is more
than 1,000 feet long, is far superior to the rutted paths leading
to her neighbors' mobile homes. Norwood has also excavated a
channel across her yard to divert runoff that was eroding the drain
field of her septic system.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' car has become mired in mud several times when rain
made her driveway impassable. That has caused her to miss work.
Norwood, whose driveway runs next to Williams', has given her
neighbor permission to use the better route. Other neighbors are
using it too.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen households in the subdivision have problems with
their septic systems, in some cases as a result of improper
installation by the developer, according to the Hays County
Environmental Health Department. Erosion gullies have formed in
drain fields, and the soil is often damp and foul-smelling,
residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked out there one day last summer and I sank up to my
knees,'' Williams said. ``It just swallowed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said odors come and go. ``On some days you can smell it
up through the drains in the house, like when you brush your
teeth,'' she said. ``I bought this place because it was going to be
my dream home. It hasn't turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel almost embarrassed that I allowed myself to
be taken advantage of. But if there were other laws and
regulations, maybe it wouldn't happen to somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   A question of costs
</P>
<P>
   The developer, William Swinney of Del Valle, who also installed
the septic systems, could not be reached for comment. His lawyer,
Lamar Hankins, said it was not Swinney's fault that homeowners have
failed to build driveways that stand up to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the developer pays the costs up front and recoups the
costs in the sale of lots, or you develop in this fashion and the
homeowner is responsible for taking care of drainage issues and
driveway issues,'' Hankins said. ``Mr. Swinney did this to save
money.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the septic systems, Swinney denied that any were failing
when he testified in December before Hays County commissioners,
who, in a rare exercise of judicial power, issued a subpoena
compelling him to appear.
</P>
<P>
   However, Swinney later agreed to make improvements and offered
to relinquish his state license as a septic tank installer,
according to records at the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission. The agency investigated following a complaint by Hays
County authorities.
</P>
<P>
   One county's challenge
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen subdivisions in Hays County have similar
problems. During a recent tour, County Commissioner Jeff Barton
drove his pickup past shacks, dilapidated mobile homes and
sewage-tainted roadside ditches.
</P>
<P>
   Green Pastures, developed in the 1970s, is a jumble of 760
mobile homes, many with leaking septic systems. Drugs, gangs and
poverty are endemic. The county is gradually paving the roads at
taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Central Texas you have counties willing to take on
regulatory obligations, yet the state won't give us the same
authority border counties have to stop the problem before it gets
extreme,'' Barton said. ``It's scandalous, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag-lot approach keeps officials in the dark until it is
too late to manage growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find out about it when houses are on the ground and people
are living there and they apply for a septic tank permit,'' Barton
said. ``That's a pretty uncomfortable position if they're in a
flood plain or the lot's too small for a septic tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Hays is one of the state's fastest-growing counties, with a
population that soared from 65,000 in 1990 to nearly 100,000 today.
The population is projected to rise as high as 165,000 by 2010,
with most of that growth occurring outside cities' jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Hays County commissioners have adopted the boldest set of
development and subdivision rules of any county in Texas in an
effort to prevent flag lots and other substandard development. But
with counties lacking clear legal authority, the rules rest on thin
legal ice, Barton acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Substandard development is also a problem in more than two dozen
other counties near metropolitan areas, according to the Texas
Conference of Urban Counties.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide trend
</P>
<P>
   County commissioners and ordinary citizens have complained about
shoddy development in widely scattered areas outside Lubbock,
Houston, San Antonio and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flag lots are popping up all over the place,'' said Donald
Lee, executive director of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly where or how many, Lee said, because the
developers must file only a metes-and-bounds description of the
lots _ confusing and thick with legalese and surveyors' references
to trees, fences and other landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Without a map of the subdivision, it's tough to plan government
services. For example, the new households are not automatically
added to the 911 emergency system for police, fire and medical
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you get a phone call and the computer doesn't know where
the phone call is coming from,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, emergency vehicles sometimes cannot navigate the
substandard driveways. Residents typically start using a common
driveway _ a road by any other name _ that they then expect the
county to maintain, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of `and'
</P>
<P>
   The trend can be traced to a deceptively simple court ruling in
a case called Elgin Bank of Texas vs. Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   The bank wanted to sell parts of a 150-acre tract without filing
a subdivision plat with the county. The county balked.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals in Austin sided with the bank, which
intended for each lot to have direct access to an existing road.
The court, pointing to the wording of the state's local-government
legislation, ruled that such a blueprint is required only when the
landowner is dividing land ``to lay out lots . . . and to lay out
streets'' or other public areas.
</P>
<P>
   The county had argued that the word ``and'' should be construed
as having the same meaning as the word ``or.'' The court ruled that
this could be done only to prevent an absurd result but that no
such result arose from the ordinary reading of ``and.''
</P>
<P>
   Most counties are urging the Legislature to revise the law to
close what they are calling the Elgin Bank loophole. A smaller
number, including Hays, want lawmakers to grant broad land-use
controls to counties, or at least powers equivalent to those
already given to border counties.
</P>
<P>
   The counties' efforts failed during last year's legislative
session, but a new push is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate and building industries don't want counties to
get too much power, contending that some areas of the state should
remain off-limits to stringent land-use controls. Industry
officials say the number of developers who build shoddy
subdivisions is small and the vast majority practice sound
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Association of Builders would go along with requiring
platting in almost all cases. But the trade association wants an
exception for lots bigger than five acres. Such lots are already
exempt from platting requirements when they are in cities'
jurisdictions. The association opposes granting all counties the
broader authority held by border counties.
</P>

   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ It was like getting a message from a tree -- a
historic and greatly beloved tree. My son and I couldn't find the
Caroline Avenue oak when we were in Mobile, Ala.,driving blindly
around streets no longer familiar. When we saw a big stump, we
decided disaster had come to Mobile's most famous tree, also called
the Duffee oak, and stopped looking. It's funny how a tree can
bring people together. (Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ If you grew up in Catholic
schools in the '60s, sins had letter values: N, V and M, short for
``no sin,'' ``venial sin'' and ``mortal sin.'' In recent years my
mother has made an addendum to litany of mortal sins: shopping at
Meijer. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ While helping a friend move a
fortune in antique guns this past Independence Day weekend, I
concluded that America's western expansion would have been the best
time to be alive. Actually, I had that thought when I first read
Zane Grey and Jack London as a boy. But handling guns that were
actually owned and used by pioneers, outlaws and lawmen on the
western frontier brought it all back. (Nethaway, Waco

   GMAC-RFC Picks Campbell Mithun
</P>
<P>
   GMAC-RFC in Bloomington, Minn., the investment arm of the
General Motors Acceptance Corp., which issues car loans and leases,
said Tuesday that it had named Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis
to handle its marketing account, which had been handled in-house.
Billings were estimated at $8 million to $10 million. Campbell
Mithun, which is majority-owned by the Interpublic Group of
Companies, was awarded the assignment after a four-month review
that had been narrowed to that agency and one other finalist,
Clarion Marketing and Communications Group in Greenwich, Conn.,
part of MacManus Group.

handles the creative duties.

   New Jersey Sees Fall In Jobless Rate &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Even as unemployment rose nationally in June,
New Jersey's jobless rate fell to the lowest point in eight years,
4.8 percent, the State Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Employers in the state added 3,700 new jobs in June, pushing the
unemployment rate down two-tenths of one percent. The service
sector grew by 5,000 jobs, but the number of manufacturing jobs
declined by 900, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, New Jersey is on a pace to create 65,000 to 70,000
jobs in 1998. In 1997, 80,000 jobs were created, the most in 12
years, said Joseph Seneca, chairman of the New Jersey Council of
Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the unemployment rate rose 0.2 percent in June, to
4.5 percent

<P>
   HMV to Enter Harlem
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ HMV Worldwide plans to open Harlem's first music
superstore next year, on West 125th Street next to the Apollo
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The store will have 15,000 square feet of retail space and will
employ over 100 people, the company said Tuesday. Groundbreaking
will be held on Monday, and the store is expected to open in the
middle of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   HMV Worldwide, which is based in London and has its North
American headquarters in Toronto, is the world's largest music
retailer with 270 stores. Sixteen of them are in the United States,
including four superstores in Manhattan at Herald Square, Fifth
Avenue, 8th Street and Lexington Avenue and 72d and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem store will be part of the Harlem USA development, the
long-delayed entertainment-retail complex that will occupy most of
the block bounded by 124th and 125th Streets and Eighth and St.
Nicholas Avenues. Other businesses scheduled to open there include
the Gap, Chase Manhattan Bank, Radio Shack and Watch World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is a good commercial opportunity _ it's not just a
neighborhood, it's a big city in its own right,'' said Stuart
McAllister, the chief executive officer of HMV's chief executive.
``And not to sound too altruistic, but we think it's important to
give something back to the community that has sponsored one of the
greatest art forms to come out of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Casino Firms Settle Fight
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Las Vegas-based casino operators settled their legal
differences Tuesday and agreed to jointly develop a hotel-casino in
Atlantic City's marina district, an official of one of the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The $750 million project by the two companies, Mirage Resorts
Inc. and the Boyd Gaming Corporation, will include a 1,200-room
hotel and 100,000-square-foot casino on a 25-acre parcel, said
Ellis Landau, Boyd's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will contribute $150 million apiece to the
project, Landau said, although Boyd's contribution will be all in
cash, while Mirage's share includes the land, valued as $90
million, plus $60 million in cash. He said the remaining $450
million would be financed by loans or possibly bonds. A name has
not been chosen for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to break ground in September 1999 and open by
2002 provided the necessary approvals are granted, including a
decision by the United States Army Corps of Engineers on a $330
million road-and-tunnel project linking the marina district to the
rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The companies originally agreed to a slightly smaller project in
May 1996, but Boyd sued Mirage in February after Mirage terminated
the deal. Yesterday's agreement does not address a suit in which
Circus Circus Enterprises of Las Vegas also accused Mirage of
backing out of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Roffman, a gambling analyst with Roffman Miller
Associates in Philadelphia, said yesterday's deal was a step toward
transforming Atlantic City into a destination resort to better
compete with Indian-owned casinos in Connecticut and destinations
like Las Vegas. But, Roffman cautioned, ``None of this is going to
happen until 2002 anyway, and by then we could be in a severe
recession.''

WESTWOOD FAVORITE OF PLAYERS IN OPEN; KUCHAR PONDERS TURNING PRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Asked to pick a favorite for this year's
British Open, many players have named Lee Westwood, who has won
three times in his last four starts on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   At age 25, Westwood has risen to No. 7 in the world ranking, and
the native of Worksop, England, will be a crowd favorite when the
tournament begins Thursday at Royal Birkdale Golf Club, about a
two-hour drive from Westwood's home. But if Westwood is having
trouble handling growing expectations, he refuses to show it. He
has talked as confidently as he has played, and he is driven to be
the world's best player.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other people expect doesn't really bother me,'' said
Westwood, who is coming off last week's victory at the Standard
Life Loch Lomond Invitational in Scotland. ``I'm not afraid of
winning. I won't be nervous coming down the stretch if I'm winning.
That is my ultimate aim, to be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons have been made between Westwood and Tiger Woods, one
of the contenders Westwood hopes to beat this week. Westwood
admitted that Woods' emergence as a force in professional golf
helped inspire the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get sort of a rivalry anywhere, it brings the
whole bunch on,'' Westwood said. ``There are so many good players
in Europe and around the world under 30, it can't help but spur
everybody else on. I don't think it's any coincidence that with
Tiger winning the Masters last year, you've seen a big improvement
in my game, David Duval's game, Justin Leonard's game, Ernie Els'
game. When one does something, it drags everybody else along. I
think it can only be good for the game worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar, the 1997 U.S. Amateur champion, is torn between
returning for his junior year at Georgia Tech, or turning
professional. After strong showings at both the Masters (tied for
21st) and the U.S. Open (tied for 14th), Kuchar has thought more
about leaving school, and he is eager to see how he fares at the
British Open. Kuchar will make a decision about his status later
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm dead in the middle,'' said Kuchar, of his
decision on whether to turn professional or return to school. ``It
seems to be all I think about. It is hard to get focused on playing
golf when everybody wants to know what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, I really can't get away from it. The phone doesn't
stop _ agents are calling, sponsors are calling. It seems that's
what everybody wants to talk about. There are so many positives
about going back to school, and so many positives about going pro.
I don't know what's going to happen.'' Faldo Is Planning to Play
</P>
<P>
   Unless he suffers another setback before Thursday, Nick Faldo
plans to play in the British Open. Faldo's injured right elbow has
responded well to treatment, and he was upbeat following today's
practice round.
</P>
<P>
   ``My elbow is feeling great,'' said Faldo, a three-time British
Open champion. ``It must be the 200 autographs I'm signing warming
it up.''

TRADES NOT ALWAYS AS THEY SEEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Get past the newfangled purples and teals of today's
uniforms and Major League Baseball is pretty much the same game on
the field as it was 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the field, however, the game has little resemblance to
its forerunner in the 1950s. For that matter, working in a front
office now isn't even close to what it was just 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A general manager can get burned now if he isn't on top of every
intricacy of a player's contract. For that matter, any GM must know
even the simplest of rules or he can look foolish.
</P>
<P>
   As an example we offer Los Angeles' interim GM Tommy Lasorda,
who could end up with some ugly, runny egg on his face after his
Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes for Jeff Shaw trade with Cincinnati
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was unaware that because Shaw was traded in the middle
of a multiyear contract he can demand a trade or become a free
agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   So while Lasorda was bragging about how cheap he had landed Shaw
for the next two years, plus an option season, he had no idea that
he can lose his new closer outright after this season.
</P>
<P>
   In order to save face and justify giving up Konerko and Reyes,
the Dodgers will have to renegotiate with Shaw, whose salary will
probably jump from under $3 million to over $5 million next
season. &QL; 
The trading deadline without requiring waivers is quickly
approaching. Between now and 9 p.m., July 31, several trades should
take place, most within the final 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The usual trading will take place, where contending clubs, or
those believing they can, will swap young talent for a veteran for
the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary, the contending clubs will try and low-ball
while the clubs near the bottom of the standings will hold out for
more value. The Diamondbacks, who have several players who could
help a contender, are in an enviable position.
</P>
<P>
   They can sit back and wait on offers, sifting through the bad
ones and trying to up the ante from the serious clubs. The players
who have generated some talk include center fielder Devon White and
catchers Jorge Fabregas and Kelly Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondback who has created the most fuss is left-hander
Brian Anderson, who had a 1.80 ERA in 10 postseason innings last
year. But the Diamondbacks have no desire to deal Anderson, who at
26 could be a vital part of Arizona's pitching staff for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's front office will hold out for the most trade value.
The Diamondbacks are in such a desirable position, they don't have
to make a move. They can play out the season and keep White and the
others if they feel another club is trying to screw them.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks can hold out because they are one of the big
players in the majors. They have money rolling in by the bushel and
don't need to pare payroll in order to keep the profit margin
high. &QL; 
Not so fast &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is where trading in the 1990s is so different from just a
decade ago. Time was when a low-end club would trade for the simple
reason of acquiring young talent for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The wretched Atlanta Braves of 1987 dealt veteran starter Doyle
Alexander to Detroit for a Double-A pitcher named John Smoltz.
Alexander wound up going 9-0 in 11 starts and the Tigers ended up
winning the American League East by one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to a time when you'd pick up a phone, call someone,
make a deal and boom, that was it,'' Diamondbacks assistant general
manager Sandy Johnson said. ``It was done and both parties were
happy. It's all different now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you have clubs trying to move expensive mistakes they may
have made a year or two earlier. Small-market clubs also try to get
something for star players who are eligible for free agency,
players they know they might not be able to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Like the impending monsoons, the trading season is around the
corner. Get ready, it could be a wild time. &QL;

Apple's new widens range of peripherals 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The iMac, Apple Computer Inc.'s ballyhooed economy
computer, represents a big step toward the mainstream of personal
computing for the company that prides itself on making computers
for an elite minority, industry experts said Thursday at the
Macworld Expo.
</P>
<P>
   That step is the connection for devices such as printers,
scanners and joysticks, which are known as peripherals. In using
just the Universal Serial Bus, the iMac will be able to connect to
a much wider range of peripherals than previous Macintosh models.
</P>
<P>
   By abandoning proprietary connections such as its Apple Desktop
Bus and Macintosh modem and printer ports, and switching to the USB
technology, Apple essentially allows iMac owners to buy
off-the-shelf peripherals that are made for machines from IBM, Dell
Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. The USB, technology is one
of three commonly used connections throughout the much larger
IBM-compatible industry. The others are parallel ports and serial
bus ports. USB also replaces Apple's proprietary connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``USB is an emerging industry standard,'' Apple's interim chief
executive Steve Jobs told an audience of about 3,000 Mac users
Wednesday at Macworld Expo in the Jacob Javits Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of peripherals will be available for the Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that in the future all Macs will accommodate
only the USB technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of software titles available for those PCs, the
peripherals do not readily work on the Macintosh operating system.
The system incompatability and Apple's tiny 4 percent share of the
computer market have drastically limited the choices of software
and hardware available to Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of the switch to USB connections, that hardware
incompatibility vanishes with a relatively simple software change
that allows the equipment and the Mac operating system to talk to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that accommodates a non-specific Mac interconnect is
an improvement for Mac users,'' said Steve Dube of Wasserstein &AMP;
Pirella in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dube also disagreed with a manager from one of Apple's key
peripheral suppliers, who said Thursday that Jobs' has taken a
major gamble by limiting iMac to only one type of connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think USB is not a wild bet for Apple,'' he said. ``That's
probably going to be a standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Apple depends on hardware companies to invest the money
on programming that will let their products work with Macintosh
machines. Mindful of that, Apple brought a dozen or so of them
together Thursday in the Jacob Javits Convention Center to talk
about their products.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few months warning about Apple's plans for USB,
Hewlett-Packard Co. rushed into production a chip-carrying adapter
so iMac customers can use any of five HP 670C- or 690C-series
Deskjet printers when the computer is shipped in the middle of
August.
</P>
<P>
   Those printers cost $199 to $249. The $79 adapter is a cable
connection between the iMac USB port and the printers' serial port,
but HP will put USB connections directly on future printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a transition product,'' said Hugh Amick of HP. ``We plan
to come up with a printer that provides out-of-the-box
connectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more talked about peripheral products at the
semi-annual Macintosh show is the SuperDisk from Imation.
</P>
<P>
   Built for the iMac and selling for $179, SuperDisk is a
floppy-disk drive with a USB connection. Imation, an Oakdale,
Minn., company that was spun off from 3M a few years ago, has high
hopes for the product because Apple's iMac has no floppy disk
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding it cut costs on the iMac, which at $1,299 already is
priced well above sub-$1,000 entry-level products from Compaq, HP
and others. Apple also justified the decision by noting that floppy
discs traditionally have been used to back up files and to transfer
work between computers.

 Wheeling and Dealing PCs

<TEXT>
<P>
   No down payment. Low monthly payments. Trade it in for a new one
after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like financing for a car, but in fact it's a
ground-breaking program by Gateway that lets consumers get a new
personal computer without having to spend $1,500 to $2,000 up
front.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway's move, along with a program by Dell Computer that lets
consumers lease new PCs instead of buying them, are being
scrutinized by the rest of the industry as companies seek new ways
to attract first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Gateway, the second- and fourth-largest PC-makers in
the United States, sell systems directly to consumers by phone and
over the Internet. They don't have to deal with middlemen or retail
stores, making it easier for them to introduce novel financing
plans.
</P>
<P>
   With trade-in options and different types of leases, they hope
to entice consumers who are reluctant to shell out big bucks for
something that is guaranteed to become obsolete in just a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new financing programs are designed to appeal
to buyers who don't have a lot of cash but can manage payments of
less than $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The affordability coupled with obsolescence protection is
striking a chord with consumers,'' said Bart Brown, vice president
of home marketing for South Dakota-based Gateway. ``The program has
been successful beyond our wildest forecasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Your:)Ware financing program _ promoted through a
slick TV advertising campaign _ seems to have invigorated Gateway.
Since the program was announced at the end of May, Gateway's stock
has soared 44 percent. It closed yesterday at $61.88, up $2.13.
</P>
<P>
   The Your:)Ware program lets you finance a new multimedia PC over
two, three or four years, at interest rates as low as 14.9 percent.
For $49.95 a month, over four years, you can get a Pentium II 300
megahertz PC with 32 megabytes of memory, a five gigabyte hard
drive, a DVD drive and a 15-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The total price of the system, including financing, comes to
just under $2,400, which is a lot to pay for those specifications.
But the deal also gives you unlimited free Internet access through
Gateway's own Internet service. Based on an average cost of $20 a
month, that works out to $960 worth of Internet access over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Any time after the first two years, you can trade in your system
for a new one and get a trade-in allowance equal to the blue book
value of your computer (typically less than one-third of its
original price).
</P>
<P>
   Dell's Personal Lease program works just like a car lease. For
example, you can get a Pentium II 300 system that retails for
$1,699 for $64 a month over three years. That comes to a total of
about $2,300. At the end of the lease you can either return the
system and walk away, lease a new one, or buy the computer you were
leasing for 15 percent of the original purchase price (in this case
$255).
</P>
<P>
   Dell started its leasing program last August, but at that time
only offered a two-year lease and required an initial payment equal
to the first-and last-month's payments. In March, the company
eliminated the up-front payment and added a 36-month option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we came up with the modifications we've seen a doubling
of customers, and it continues to grow month over month,'' said
Mike Watt, chief operating officer for Dell Financial Services, the
company's financing arm.
</P>
<P>
   One recent customer, C.D. Rowsell of Hayward, said he decided to
lease a Dell Dimension computer after checking out the company's
leasing plan on the Web. And he's happy he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a state-of-the-art machine (with a 400 MHz Pentium II),
the monthly outlay isn't huge, and it was easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see the programs, especially Gateway's, as a way for
PC-makers to establish long-term relationships. In addition to
gaining repeat business through trade-ins, the company can use the
Your:)Ware program to sell upgrades and new services, such as
customized technical support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that PC companies want to turn their
customers into annuities,'' said analyst Scott Miller of Dataquest.
``They don't want to have to resell people every three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said it's ``exceptionally important to watch how Gateway
does with this. It's a complicated undertaking, and I'm not
convinced that this model is where the industry will end up. But
they're moving in the right direction.''

 Apple's Grand Design  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Apple Computer, which popularized the phrase, ``The
computer for the rest of us,'' says its future growth and survival
hinge on the consumer market it all but shunned the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs _ looking fresh despite a red-eye
flight from the West Coast _ told a gathering of 2,500 yesterday at
the Macworld Expo trade show that Apple's new iMac home computer
will fuel sales during the next six months, contributing to a
recent resurgence at the Cupertino company. He also announced that
Apple will record a third-straight quarter in the black next
Wednesday, but he declined to say how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple (recently) had failed in the consumer market, but the
iMac will change that,'' said Jobs, who was greeted with a
thunderous, 30-second standing ovation from the partisan crowd.
``It is a kick-ass consumer product.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 million installed Macs in the world, 10 million are
home computers, but Jobs said Apple hadn't made compelling products
for that market _ until the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs announced that some 177 consumer applications _ from
companies including America Online, Adobe Systems, Quicken,
Symantec Corp. and Mattel _ have been designed for the iMac in the
two months since it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   He then trotted out Richard Wolpert, president of Disney Online,
who said the Magic Kingdom has developed a Macintosh version of
Blast, its online service for kids. (Rumors of an Apple-Disney
partnership were rife this week, but many erroneously thought
Disney would announce that it was installing thousands of iMacs in
its hotels around the world.)
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, which was announced in May and doesn't ship until
August 15, already has created a buzz among Mac fanatics. Industry
observers estimate that 400,000 units will ship by the end of
September, making it one of the most popular Macintosh models ever.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said the iMac will closely weave in Web browsing and will
come with a 56K modem, faster than the 33.6K modem initially
expected.
</P>
<P>
   A laptop counterpart to the iMac is due in the first half of
1999, according to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs and other Apple executives said the company's consumer bent
is the final piece of a five-step plan that Jobs jokingly compared
to Abraham Maslow's theory on the hierarchy of needs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Apple's ``hierarchy of skepticism,'' the company first
needed to convince computer shoppers, investors, analysts and the
press that it would shake out of its ``death spiral,'' Jobs said.
It did so, he said, by putting in place a new management team and
board of directors and striking a development deal with Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Apple had to stabilize business by whittling down its
unwieldy product lines, from 15 to two (consumer and professional).
The company also focused on strongholds in the education and
desktop-publishing markets. ``We needed to protect the business
before we could grow,'' ClentRichardson, Apple's senior director of
worldwide developer relations, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Apple forged business relations with hardware-and
software-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, developers were hopping mad at Apple,'' Jobs said.
``Our deal with Microsoft drew boos (from Mac fans last year), but
it brought other developers aboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple also may have created goodwill among developers by footing
part of the bill on some companies' trade show booths. One
developer said he wouldn't have attended if not for Apple defraying
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple first had to show the discipline to get its internal
house in order. Its consumer strategy is dead-on for future
growth,'' said Louis Mazzucchelli Jr., vice president of Gerard
Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. in New York. ``If they had tried this a year
ago, it wouldn't have worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for Apple's comeback isn't complete, however,
unless the company succeeds in increasing year-over-year sales and
improving its market share, its critics argue. In its most recent
quarter, Apple registered $1.4 billion in sales, compared with $1.6
billion the previous year. Meanwhile, its market share hasn't
budged from 4.1 percent a year ago, according to Dataquest Inc., a
San Jose-based market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   That's where iMac, and its potential for a boost in sales, comes
in, Apple executives say.
</P>
<P>
   So far, potential customers like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a great consumer product that combines software,
modem, memory and a big screen,'' said Pamela Steffen, who traveled
from Boston to get her first glimpse of the roundish, aqua
marine-colored computer. ``The younger crowd will especially love
it since it looks like a beach ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Cingone, standing nearby in front of an iMac display at
the Apple booth, said she is buying the $1,299 machine for her
college-bound daughter. ``It's a winner. I've been waiting for a PC
like this Apple for a long time.''

MOM'S AND DAD'S EASY-PC ADVENTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Personal computers are a lot easier to set up and use than they
used to be, according to the monolithic industry that builds and
sells them. But as anyone without a degree in computer science will
tell you, they're not easy enough.
</P>
<P>
   In order to use a PC so it becomes a pleasure rather than a
hassle, users still need to know the basics of how it works. For
example, they must understand the concepts of where files are
stored in order to be able to retrieve something downloaded from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers say their current crop of machines, combined
with Microsoft's new Windows 98 operating system, is easier to use
than ever. I decided to put that to the test, but I needed some
help. I've set up and tested so many PCs that it's hard for me to
really know what novices will think. I needed a newbie's
perspective; so I called upon two people who have helped me out
time and again throughout my life: dear old mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   My parents are not completely computer illiterate, but they're
close. They've had a hand-me-down PC that uses an older 80486 chip
for about 18 months. They know how to turn it on, get onto the
Internet via America Online, send e-mail to family members, play a
few simple games and browse through CD-ROM-based encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many novice users, they don't understand the plumbing
of the Windows 95 file system. They don't snap to the difference
between America Online's content and that of the Internet. When I
tell them to launch the AOL browser, they say, ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   They aren't dumb. It's just that the vagaries of the personal
computer are not second nature to them, which is the case with many
who have not grown up with PCs omnipresent in the home and
workplace. They don't want to know how the damn thing works _ they
just want it to work, period, and be easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. agreed to be the technology guinea pig in
a little experiment with my parents. The Houston company just
launched a new line of consumer PCs, which the company claims is
its friendliest yet, with pushbuttons on the keyboard for launching
Internet services and favorite programs. The Presarios come with
software that makes it easy to download updated drivers and other
software for keeping the PC in top shape.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is loaning them one of these machines for about a month.
They are trying out a Presario 2254, the lowest-end system, and a
14-inch MV400 monitor. I took the system to their home in Corpus
Christi over the Fourth of July weekend and watched as they set it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, not ``they,'' but he. My mother had no interest
in assembling the thing. Now, my father, who is in his late 60s, is
as mechanically inclined as they come. I remember watching him
restore a Triumph TR3 sports car when I was a child, and the week
before I drove down there he designed and built an all-wood patio
cover over his back porch.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted being intimidated about setting up a new PC,
just because it was a computer. ``I'm always intimidated by
something I'm not in complete control of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2254, which sells for just $899, is aimed at novice users
who don't want to spend a lot of money on a system, but don't want
to be stuck with a slow, out-of-date machine. It is not fancy, but
it's more than adequate, with a 233-megahertz Advanced Micro
Devices K6 processor; 32 megabytes of memory; a four-gigabyte hard
drive; a 56K fax modem; and a 64-bit 3-D graphics card. It comes in
a desktop, rather than a mini-tower case.
</P>
<P>
   As with most consumer PCs, it comes with a poster that uses
pictures to show how the PC should be assembled. Also, most of the
connections that need to be made are color-coded _ for example, the
green keyboard plug goes into a socket on the back of the unit
that's rimmed in green. Both of these features were a great help to
my father.
</P>
<P>
   But there were three points at which his progress came to a dead
halt. If I had not been there, he would have given up and called
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved hardware. The speakers that come with the
monitor must be joined together, and then connected to the back of
the PC. The poster just showed the cable from one speaker linking
with the other, but didn't show the connections, which are standard
RCA male-female stereo jacks. My father's not into stereo systems,
so he didn't recognize the plugs, and relying on the poster left
him baffled.
</P>
<P>
   The second snag came when he installed the drivers for his
printer. Windows 95's setup routine wanted to look in a particular
folder on the hard drive where other drivers are kept. My father
kept clicking on the OK button, only to be told the driver couldn't
be found.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't realize that you had to tell Windows to look in a
different place _ the floppy drive, which is A: _ to find the disk
he'd just inserted. Although he's used that 80486 machine for some
time, he's seldom had to use the floppy, and it didn't occur to him
from what he saw on the screen that he needed to direct Windows'
attention to it. He also didn't know that it's drive A:. I suspect
a lot of novices get stuck at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The final problem involved America Online's software, which came
with an old list of modems that did not include the high-speed, new
Presario model. We could not get the modem to connect to the
high-speed dialup number in Corpus Christi for AOL, and had to fall
back to a lowly 14.4K line just to connect. Once we signed on, AOL
downloaded a set of updated modem information and the software then
worked as it should. But again, if I had not been there, my parents
would have had to suffer with AOL's tech support line before
figuring out to fall back to the slower dialup number.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the real test, with the machine in place. My parents
will live with this system for a month, and I'll report back on how
they did. I figure letting them use a system designed for novices
is the ultimate test of any PC's user-friendliness.

GETTING ATTACHED TO E-MAIL PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My husband cannot send photos (not dirty ones)
from America Online 4.0 to people with older versions of AOL.
What's up with that?
</P>
<P>
   _ Perfectly Innocent
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INNOCENT: Hey, it's not up to me to judge what's dirty and
what isn't _ as long as I get a copy, purely in the interest of
scholarly research, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   The new AOL software gives you two ways to send pictures. You
can embed photos in the body of your letter or you can attach them
to the E-mail, which is the way most of the world already operates.
If hubby mailed somebody an embedded picture of you dusting the
crystal chandelier, the recipient can only see it if he has AOL 4.0
or a really good imagination.
</P>
<P>
   If the photos are attached as separate files, just about anybody
should be able to see what a great housekeeper you are.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: We have Win95 on our PC. We just purchased a
notebook with Win98 installed. Some games will not load in Win98.
Is this the Evil Empire's way of ensuring we are going to retire
broke and have to eat dog food because we must keep buying new
software?
</P>
<P>
   _ Alpo Gourmet
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GOURMET: It's so easy to sit back and blame Big Bill for
every little thing that goes wrong in your pathetic little life,
isn't it? Bill isn't evil. He's a guy just like you or me who
happened to be in the right place at the right time. Do you think
he can't still feel your pain?
</P>
<P>
   Geez, of course not. What were you possibly thinking? This guy
is worth $51 billion, and you're about as important to him as a
gnat is to an elephant. He could buy you, sell you and forget you
in a heartbeat, and the only thing about our lonely existence he
confirms is that a good haircut must cost $52 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But, just this once, it's probably not his fault. Windows 98
shouldn't make that big a difference when it comes to games. It is,
after all, just a spiffed-up version of Win95. My guess is that
your games have some particular hardware requirements _ most likely
video or memory _ that the notebook just isn't up to.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just bought a refurbished laptop from
somebody for $700. It has Word Perfect and ProComm already loaded.
If this guy can provide software that cheaply, why can't the big
manufacturers do the same and lower prices?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bargain Hunter
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BARGAIN: And I suppose you got certificates of authenticity
and original documentation with all that cheap software? No? I'm so
surprised. Congratulations on your bootlegs. You'll be happy to
know I forwarded your mail to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding! They already had your name and address anyway. As
for the guy you bought the stuff from, sleazebuckets like that
ought to be locked up. You don't steal books from the library or
tapes from Blockbuster. Don't steal from software publishers
either.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My clock keeps perfect time when the PC is on,
but not when it's off. A technician suspects the motherboard is
about to go. Am I being snowed?
</P>
<P>
   _ Complete Novice
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOVICE: Like Aspen in December. Most PC clocks keep time
about as well as what you get at Free Watch Night at the ballgame.
When you turn on the PC, Windows gets the time from the clock, then
takes over timekeeping and does a much better job. You should get a
time synchronization program from someplace like www.tucows.com to
reset your clock any time you're on the Net. You should also go to
Free Bat Night, then have a serious talk with your technician.

IF GAMING GRABS YOU, CHECK THESE TITLES OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL SAUNDERS   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eyes that feel sandblasted. A persistent dull throb in the mouse
hand. Laundry collects in a corner that is on its way to being
declared a domestic Superfund site, and come to think of it, you're
getting pretty ripe, too.
</P>
<P>
   These are the unmistakable signs of a serious addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But what games are good enough to trigger that I-gotta-play
response, the kind of yearning that makes some game fanatics blow
off dates and forget other important things, like eating and work?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I've been getting grainy eyed over real-time strategy
games. I was strung out on Total Annihilation for a while,
determined to rack up victories against the evil Core. It didn't
help that Cavedog Entertainment just released an expansion pack
with more missions, maps, and new machinery. Dark Reign fed my
temporary need for interplanetary domination with its excellent
sound and graphics; it, too, has an expansion available, and
Activision promises even more versions of this award-winning game.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is often an addiction unto itself, with its surplus of
minutiae and useless facts that blur the line between jockdom and
geekhood. Baseball games torque the geek quotient up several
notches, as in the case of Microsoft's 1998 edition of Baseball 3D
and the forward-looking All-Star Baseball 99 for the Nintendo 64
system.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a stat-freak's dream, player and team performance
broken down into several hundred categories. This is definitely a
game to warrant buying several extra memory modules to hold all
that data. Baseball 3D is among the best-looking sports games on
the market, with accurate renderings of all major-league stadiums
and detailed high-polygon player models that do everything except
adjust their cups at the plate. According to the box, all this
realism requires a system with a Pentium 133 chip or better, 16
megs of RAM, and a 2 meg 3D card. We ran it on a P-166 with 16 megs
and found the action sequences annoyingly choppy. A P-200 with 32
megs handled the game nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Between bouts of galactic conquest and attempted triple plays,
it has been hard to escape the Play-Station game N2O: Nitrous
Oxide. This is a pure fast-twitch fiber workout; the only strategy
is to stay alive while spiraling through the iridescent gut canal
of some huge beast. (OK, maybe they're just tunnels, but indulge my
little ``Fantastic Voyage'' fantasy.) While your skimming
hovercraft is blasting nasty intestinal flora and fauna,
high-energy dance beats from the Crystal Method pump out of the
speakers. This game sounds amazing routed through a home theater
sound system.
</P>
<P>
   After having gone through a Final Fantasy VII binge when the
game was released for PlayStation, I expected the new PC version to
collect dust in the ever-expanding in-basket. Cloud, Barret, Tifa,
and the rest of the crew still offer some of the most engaging
gameplay ever designed for any format, and the PC version's
graphics approach console quality. The heart of the game is the
rich storyline, which remains unchanged, so this game might trigger
more people to find out what the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC;  Call it what you will _ the Evil Empire, maker of Windoze,
foister of Internet Explorer upon hapless millions _ but when
Microsoft wants to do something right, it usually gets it done.
</P>
<P>
   Our uncharacteristic largesse was prompted by the high-wow
factor of Microsoft's site terraserver.microsoft.com, which, in
typically low-key Microsoft fashion, claims to be the world's
largest online database. With 1.01 terabytes of info harnessed on
linked hard drives (about 100,000 copies of ``Moby-Dick,'' if you

   Conspiracy or bad choice of words? An Internet service provider
in Vancouver, British Columbia, says an error message in
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 is advising his customers to take
their business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The message appears in a dialogue box that pops up when
something goes wrong. It says, ``You might want to try selecting
`other Internet provider' from the list of Internet service
providers.'' The error message affects only certain Explorer users
who have built Web pages with Microsoft's Front Page Express.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, customers of MDI Internet Inc. are calling the
company's customer service line for help. The messages ``just
totally confuse your customers into believing there's got to be
something wrong with your company and to choose a different one,''
says Shiloh Costa, MDI's senior system administrator.
</P>
<P>
   What it also means, he said, is that Microsoft is trying to get
his company to move from the Unix operating system to Microsoft's
Windows NT and its server software.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Adam Sohn, conceded that the message was
confusing but insisted it was an innocent mistake. ``It was never
our intention to advise people to go out and find another ISP,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to issue software to fix the problem on its
Web site and will change the message in future versions of Internet
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sohn said, the message is not even referring to
Internet service providers like MDI but to the transmission
protocol used for sending and receiving data. He said the company
would change the wording to ``Please choose another transmission
protocol'' or something like it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes the mistake was so innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its an old trick,'' said Ken Wasch, president of the Software
Publishers Association in Washington. Microsoft, he said, has in
the past included error messages in its applications that encourage
users to take certain actions that promote other Microsoft
products, like error messages saying a product is not compatible,
when it is.

   Chat Software Company Joins America Online
</P>
<P>
   Decisions of the digital age: What do you do when your small
technology start-up is bought by America Online for $287 million?
The founders of Mirabilis, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, know. They
flew the entire staff to New York for a weekend-long celebration.
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, 68 Israeli software developers filled the back of
Lot 61, a nightclub on West 21st St. in New York, doing in real
time what users of their product do on line: chat.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis, in its two years of existence, has developed a
formidable following for its chat software, called ICQ _ short for
``I seek you.'' The company says 14 million people have downloaded
the free software, a figure that surely piqued the interest of
America Online, the biggest Internet service provider in the United
States, which has about an equal number of members and a much
larger marketing budget.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of Mirabilis with America Online has raised the
eyebrows of the company's faithful. To counter concerns that its
essence would disappear under the America Online umbrella,
Mirabilis has posted a letter on its Web site at www.mirabilis.com
assuring users that the company's staff, spirit and free
distribution will remain the same.

<P>
   The Mac Is Out; The Mac Is Back
</P>
<P>
   Just as Steve Jobs was taking the stage in New York to flaunt
Apple Computer's financial upturn and sing the praises of the
company's new consumer strategy, Wells Fargo Bank was busy
informing its online banking customers that it would no longer
support the Macintosh version of Quicken, the leading
financial-software program from Intuit Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In their announcement, bank representatives said that users of
Mac Quicken amounted to only about 1 percent of their online users,
or 7,000 customers. As of Aug. 7, they would no longer be able to
log on, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently, 7,000 customers wield a lot of clout. By the end
of the week, the bank had received so many complaints _ more than
700 of them _ that it reversed its position and said it would
continue to support the Mac product. Quicken users on the Mac will
continue to be able to download statements, pay their bills and
view the status of their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the Mac's small market share among its customers,
other components of the bank's online strategy had priority,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Macintosh users prevented
Quicken from getting the ax. In the spring, Intuit also cited a
shrinking market share when it said it would stop developing a new
Macintosh version of Quicken. In that case, a direct appeal from
Jobs persuaded Intuit to reverse its position.

   ``As auditors, they will have to express an opinion on something
that they did,'' said Itzhak Sharav, who teaches accounting at the
Columbia Business School. ``That is a conflict, and that is a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bayless, associate chief accountant at the SEC, said the
commission was concerned about any instances in which auditors
audit their own work.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the SEC, which raised concerns about these issues
last year in a report to Congress, has taken few steps to limit the
firms' consulting work. And, the federal rules defining what
auditors must avoid to remain ``independent'' from the companies
they audit are little changed from 10 years ago when most of these
potential consulting conflicts did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the SEC did create an eight-member group, called the
Independence Standards Board, to review whether the rules should be
updated to protect investors. The board includes the chairmen of
three of the Big Five firms, including Laskawy, as well as the
president of the American Institute of Certified Accountants and
four members appointed by the SEC who are not accountants.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Siegel, the board's director and a former partner
with Price Waterhouse, said that the board had other issues to
address before it could take up the software consulting. He said
that the SEC had long known that the firms were expanding their
consulting practices but had let them continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make it right,'' he said, ``but there is plenty
going on, and the SEC hasn't questioned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many public companies are now scrambling to buy software
packages created by such developers as SAP, Oracle, Peoplesoft and
Baan, which sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. The
companies want to upgrade their computer systems before Jan. 1,
2000, when many existing systems are expected to malfunction when
they do not recognize the new date.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, tailoring software to the buyer's needs requires an
army of consultants, and experts estimate that the companies must
spend between two and five times the software's cost on
consultants, who do everything from fine-tuning computer programs
to training the company's workers to use the new system. Each
consultant can bring his or her employer about $300,000 in revenue
a year, according to estimates.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent to 30 percent of companies needing to upgrade
their computer systems choose their audit firm's consultants to
help them put in the new software, said Vinnie Mirchandani, a vice
president at the Gartner Group, which does research on the software
consulting industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CEO says go with this firm because I have known this firm
for many years,'' Mirchandani said. And yet, the auditors
themselves may not feel comfortable about the role of their
consultant colleagues. ``The audit partners don't always want the
consulting side to do the job,'' he said, ``because they're worried
of problems and a black mark.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the software and hardware companies covet
connections to the Big Five firms because of the firms' access to
the executives and decision- makers at the thousands of companies
that they audit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Microsoft and Netscape struggled for
KPMG Peat Marwick's allegiance, both wanting to supply the
accounting firm's computer-networking software. Microsoft
ultimately won by offering to pay KPMG millions of dollars if the
firm would use its product. As part of the deal, KPMG agreed to set
up a subsidiary that would market consulting services to
corporations adopting Microsoft's Windows NT networking software.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firms, meanwhile, say that the new computer
systems they help install can strengthen a company's controls over
financial information and, therefore, should reassure investors
rather than worry them. And the consulting work, they insist,
actually helps them conduct better audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know about a company,'' Laskawy said, ``the
better the audit you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharav, at Columbia, notes that the SEC's rules say that
auditors should avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
interest. ``Somehow,'' he said, ``they have gotten around that.''

COMPUTER CONSULTING BY ACCOUNTANTS STIRS CONCERN

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: A graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.

 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal securities regulators have grown increasingly concerned
that the accounting industry's lucrative expansion into computer
consulting may be creating conflicts with the accountants' role of
being watchdogs for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants from the Big Five accounting firms are now
installing complex software packages at hundreds of companies.
While the computer consulting is not new for the accounting firms,
the business is so hot now that it is growing at annual rates of up
to 50 percent. That growth, in turn, is drawing the attention of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations prohibit close ties between accountants and
the companies they audit because auditors are expected to give an
unbiased opinion on the accuracy of companies' financial
statements. But because of the sudden consulting boon, never have
the accounting firms been so involved in the day-to-day operations
of some of their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Peoplesoft, a California software company whose
products help automate a variety of vital corporate tasks, warned
investors in its annual report this spring that sales could suffer
if it could not find enough consultants skilled at installing its
wares. The company's outside auditor, the accounting firm Ernst &AMP;
Young, appears to be doing its best to help.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young not only gave Peoplesoft a clean bill of financial
health, but is also a key partner of Peoplesoft's sales force. As
many as 1,000 of the accounting firm's employees install
Peoplesoft's products at other businesses around the world, many of
them also Ernst &AMP; Young audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a recent case that raised some investors' eyebrows,
Ernst &AMP; Young's Dutch affiliate audited the books of Baan Co. for
years even as the accounting firm had hundreds of consultants
installing the software that Baan produces. The Ernst &AMP; Young
consultants were so good at their software work, in fact, that Baan
gave them its first ``global gold award'' as one of its most
``successful implementation partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was only this spring, after forcing Baan to change some
questionable accounting practices, that Ernst &AMP; Young decided to
resign the auditing account to pursue what Baan described as a
``business relationship'' with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young's computer consulting work is the biggest piece of
an overall consulting practice that has grown to an expected $3.6
billion this year from $300 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ernst &AMP; Young has one of the fastest-growing computer
consulting practices, all of the Big Five firms have a rising
number of potential conflicts because of such work.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Price Waterhouse Coopers, the new name of the
accounting firm formed in the recent merger of Price Waterhouse and
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, audits the books of the Denver-based software
publisher J.D. Edwards &AMP; Co. even as its consulting side searches
for potential recruits skilled in working with J.D. Edwards
software.
</P>
<P>
   As Isaac Hunt Jr., a commissioner at the SEC, warned in a speech
to accountants, the growing number of relationships between
auditors and their clients ``calls into question the ability of
auditors to be independent when carrying out their statutory
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But the accounting firms argue that they have only loose
alliances, and not contractual relationships, with the software and
hardware companies that they audit. And the firms say that they are
qualified to continue with audits of those companies even though
they may be earning hundreds of millions of dollars by installing
the companies' wares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much separate the work we do in consulting and the
work we do in auditing,'' said Philip Laskawy, chairman of Ernst &AMP;
Young. ``We just do not believe that this is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Peoplesoft, Laskawy said that Ernst &AMP; Young was
hiring consultants trained in that company's software because the
product was in demand. ``We aren't hiring people to help
Peoplesoft,'' he explained. ``We're hiring people because they have
a product that our customers want.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ernst &AMP; Young was not marketing Peoplesoft's
products, only helping other companies to install the software.
</P>
<P>
   Laskawy said Ernst &AMP; Young's relationship with Baan while the
firm performed the audit was similar to the firm's relationship
with PeopleSoft and did not cause a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen, which audits SAP, a German software company
that plans to sell stock in the United States this year, now has
about 400 Andersen consultants installing SAP software. Recently,
its consultants toured the nation with SAP sales representatives,
making presentations to interested companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's partners say that its consultants are not allowed
to actually promote SAP software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a very workable system in place that allows us
to stay independent from the hardware and software companies that
we audit,'' said Michael Travis, a partner in charge of Arthur
Andersen's SAP consulting practice in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the possible conflicts arising from such consulting work do
not end with the software companies. The questions extend to the
hundreds of public companies for which the accounting firms are
both installing the computer systems and auditing the books. Ernst
&AMP; Young consultants, for example, are now helping install a $300
million information system at Coca-Cola, a company whose books the
firm has long audited.
</P>
<P>
   Although no major problems have yet come to light in such cases,
some accounting experts say the accounting firms' double duties
raise many uncertainties. For instance, will an accounting firm
that is being paid $100 million to install software be willing to
disagree with company executives on a controversial accounting
issue and demand they correct the financial statements if they fear
they could anger management and lose the consulting job?
</P>
<P>
   Or, will an auditor who works for the same firm that installed a
company's information system raise questions about flaws in that
system when it was the accounting firm's consultants who installed
it? Such undisclosed flaws could be significant to the financial
statements, since today's software packages are so far-reaching
that a warehouse clerk can update accounting records from a
computer on the loading dock.

<P>
   Rick Brown did not set out to be anyone's hero. Simply wanting
to learn a little more about the Internet, he signed on two years
ago with Geocities, a service that gives people free space to
publish their own pages on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some people use their Geocities sites to show the world their
children, their poetry or their model train collection. Brown built
a tribute to Monty Python, the British comedy troupe.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site started slowly, but Brown, 34, a grocery store
merchandiser who lives in Bridgeport, Conn., kept adding Python
memorabilia, sound clips, scripts and pictures. Soon the site took
on a life of its own, and Geocities began promoting it as one its
``landmark'' pages.
</P>
<P>
   By June, when he had a falling-out with the service over a
promotion effort, his site had attracted more than 100,000
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's experience exemplifies the paradox of Geocities: The
service is attracting an impressive and growing number of members
and visitors, yet as it moves toward a public stock offering, it is
struggling to formulate a credible image as a viable business.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Geocities, David Bohnett, says that the sheer
scale of the service's operation and popularity would have been
unimaginable when he started experimenting with the Internet in
1994. As of June, more than 2 million members had created personal
Web sites consisting of more than 15 million pages on nearly every
imaginable topic.
</P>
<P>
   Organized into 40 virtual ``neighborhoods'' at
www.geocities.com, these sites add up to the third-most-visited
domain on the Web, attracting 14 million viewers in April, the most
recent month for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for Geocities has been growing at twice the speed
of the average Web site, according to Media Metrix, which measures
traffic on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., is going public.
The investment bankers promoting the initial public offering hope
investors will be drawn to the potential of Geocities' vast
audience and to the low overhead of publishing a site created by
millions of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope that investors will not be discouraged by
financial statements that suggest only the weakest vital signs of a
going concern.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the company begins its road show over the next few
weeks, it will probably talk of many plans to build its audience,
to sell more advertising and to extract fees from at least some
members for certain services.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whether the service can build its business
without alienating its members. For example, it was a promotional
effort known as a watermark that set off the feud with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The watermark is a translucent image of the Geocities logo that
hovers in the lower right hand corner of the pages of its members,
like the ``ghost'' logos that identify television channels. The
watermark's purpose is to encourage people entering one Geocities
site to try other sites on the service.
</P>
<P>
   But many Geocities members complained that the watermark made
their pages load more slowly on visitors' browsers, cluttered their
screens and obfuscated links.
</P>
<P>
   So using the very tools that Geocities had given them to build
their Web sites, some members created anti-watermark pages, chat
rooms and mailing lists. When Brown turned the front page of his
Monty Python site black in protest, Geocities stopped featuring his
page. Other members got wind of this and turned his case into a
rallying point for the anti-watermark campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The whole situation, Brown said, reminds him of Monty Python's
sketch in which a pet-store patron tries to return a dead parrot.
``The customer has a valid complaint, and the management uses every
trick available to avoid facing that fact,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the promise and the peril that come with trying to
build a business by giving a megaphone to millions of people.
Geocities is one of a growing number of ``online communities'' _
sites or services that allow people to publish Web pages and
communicate with one another by chatting, sending e-mail and so
forth. Such community sites now make up six of the 20 most popular
sites on the Web. Geocities is the largest, followed in descending
popularity by Tripod, Anglefire, Hotmail, Switchboard and Xoom.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers are wary of placing their product next to chat
that as likely as not will turn sexual _ or on a page that today is
an affable tribute to Monty Python and tomorrow is a diatribe
against the host service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives us a nervous twitch is the fear that if a user has
a bad experience they will think negatively on our clients,'' said
Jonathan Adams, a media buyer for Ogilvy One, the online agency for
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. ``Even if 99.9 percent of the sites are squeaky
clean, it's that tenth of 1 percent that will wind up in the CEO's
lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohnett, who has championed the right to free expression of
minorities as a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation, says that playing censor in chief for 2 million
people weighs heavily on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I'm doing has to do with being gay and part of a
minority that has not had an equal voice in society,'' Bohnett said
in an interview in March. ``But we have to balance freedom of
expression with commercial viability. Otherwise all of this will go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohnett has declined to comment on the watermark or any other
matter recently because Geocities is in a required ``quiet period''
related to its planned stock offering. In May, Bohnett hired Thomas
Evans, publisher of U.S. News &AMP; World Report, to be Geocities'
chief executive. Bohnett remains chairman.

   Bernard Meyerson, a research scientist, came prospecting for
ideas, especially from the summer interns. ``You bet I expect to
get something out of this,'' he said. Meyerson recalled how a young
Egyptian graduate student from MIT walked into his office a few
years ago and proceeded to question long-held assumptions about the
speed at which electrons can travel through silicon. The student
proved to be correct, and his insight helped Meyerson's work.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt, burly Meyerson, 44, has become a kind of in-house
poster boy for how much things have changed within IBM research. In
the 1980s, he and a group of IBM scientists developed
semiconductors that used standard silicon with germanium, an
element that is so efficient at conducting electricity that it can
drastically reduce power consumption in devices using such chips.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Meyerson had hoped the chip design could be used in
mainframe computers. When IBM decided to overhaul its mainframes
with another chip technology, Meyerson was advised to fold up his
silicon germanium project. He did not. With the help of his
research superiors and a few believers in IBM's microelectronics
division, Meyerson set about channeling his orphaned project toward
a new market _ fast, cheap chips for use in cellular phones and
other wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   IBM recently began large-scale production of its silicon
germanium chips, and the company believes this could become a
$1-billion-a-year business within five years. Today, Meyerson is
part scientist and part entrepreneur, building a business. He deals
with chip production problems, scouts for acquisitions and makes
sales calls to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign of semiauthorized guerrilla warfare within IBM, he
said, would have never been allowed to flourish in the old days.
``Now, the attitude is: If you've got a great idea, do it,''
Meyerson said. ``I never would have been allowed to do this five or
six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   To the college interns, Gerstner's message that research must
make its way to the marketplace is a sermon to the converted.
Indeed, their main reservation seems to be that even the new IBM
moves too slowly for their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make products and make money,'' said Anit Agarual, a
junior at Cornell University. ``A lot of the things done here take
five years to get out of the labs or never make it into the
marketplace at all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM's famed research division, like so many parts of the
company, has been reshaped and refocused since Louis V. Gerstner
Jr. took over as the chairman of IBM Corp. five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's research unit had long been an unrivaled engine of
innovation for the computer industry. Its labs produced the Fortran
programming language, relational databases, the D-RAM memory chip,
the RISC chip design, token ring computer networks and five Nobel
laureates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the business criticism of IBM's research efforts had been
that its labs were too insular, too ivory tower with too little
payoff for IBM. Indeed, an internal analysis at the start of the
1990s found that only 2 percent to 5 percent of the research
division's work went toward products and services for IBM
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The doors of IBM's labs are far more open today. IBM researchers
spend about 25 percent of their time with customers. Collaborative
work with leading universities has been stepped up. More outsiders
have been recruited, both to work full time and for brief stints.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach at IBM was evident last week when researchers,
summer interns and executives including Gerstner gathered for a day
for an exercise in free-range futurism _ unfettered discussions of
where technology may be heading by the year 2020. ``A real example
of the new IBM,'' Gerstner observed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the change has been an attempt to tackle an increasingly
important challenge for technology companies in particular: How to
foster innovation and then translate new ideas into new products,
services and profits.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, there are some encouraging signs that its performance on
that front is improving markedly. Its data-storage research, for
example, is behind the company's rise in the business of disk
drives for laptop computers, a higher-profit market in which IBM
now has a 40 percent share. Its researchers have also designed
low-cost, high-speed chips for use in cellular phones and other
wireless devices, which could open up a big new market for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM always had the knock of not commercializing its
research,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.
``That's not really true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The company as a whole has rebounded remarkably from 1993, the
year Gerstner arrived, when the work force was slashed and IBM
reported an $8 billion loss. Last year, the company earned $6.1
billion on revenues of $78.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive comeback. But if IBM is to generate strong growth
for the future, its research labs must pave the way. And to make a
difference in a company the size of IBM, that means producing some
real winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is to come up with revolutionary technology
that blows away the competition as its labs once did in the
mainframe-computer era of 1960s and 1970s,'' said David Yoffie, a
professor at the Harvard Business School. ``It's not clear that IBM
can really do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the business necessity of investing for the future,
Gerstner spared the research unit from the deep cuts absorbed by
some company operations. Last year, the research unit's budget
reached $600 million and its payroll increased to 2,785 people,
both figures higher than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has valued and invested in its research operations even in
difficult times for the company,'' said Charles Kruger, dean of
research at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   To try to prod people to think big and commercially, IBM invited
an eclectic collection of 1,200 researchers, executives and summer
interns to a series of one-day sessions last week at the company's
seven research labs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   IBM often organizes so-called brainstorming meetings, but it had
not done anything as large before. It was an effort to put people
with different perspectives together, spark some original thinking
and impress the interns _ mainly computer science students _ that
IBM might be a good place to work someday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the gatherings was at IBM's research
headquarters, the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights,
N.Y. The morning began with a short talk by Gerstner emphasizing
that technology's highest purpose is to solve real-world problems.
``I want this to be something more than brilliant irrelevance,'' he
told the group. ``I want something substantive to come out of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day consisted largely of a series of mind-stretching games,
played in teams of a dozen or so. Questions were prompts: What will
a day in the life of a child be like in 2020? How will technology
change the look and operation of a home? What will be the most
far-reaching applications of ``deep computing,'' best known for its
use in IBM's chess-playing supercomputer Deep Blue, which beat
Garry Kasparov last year?
</P>
<P>
   Just what will come out of such sessions remains to be seen. The
musings, debates and product ideas were all recorded, and the
research staff will later pore through the record over the next
couple of weeks, panning for nuggets. ``We're looking for a few
themes we can cull out, perhaps prompting us to think about things
slightly differently in research,'' explained Paul Horn, senior
vice president of research.

PATENTS: STOPPING BABIES FROM CRYING; ELECTRONIC SCHEDULER; 
PREVIEWS FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS; TALKING DOORBELL; PATENT INFORMATION ON
THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's summer, and the living is supposed to be easy. For new
parents, Donald Spector's recently awarded patent could ease the
wails of a crying baby.
</P>
<P>
   Spector, who lives in Union City, N.J., invented a
voice-activated sound-and-light box that attaches to a crib. Or
rather, it is cry-activated. When a baby wails, a sound-activated
switch turns on a light inside the box. The light shines through a
semireflective mirror on the box's front. Behind the mirror is a
slot for a picture. The box also has a recording and playback
system.
</P>
<P>
   Spector's idea is that new parents will slip a photo of Mom into
the picture slot, and Mom or Dad will record a soothing message for
the baby. Thus, when the infant cries, his wails light up the box
and start the playback. The child sees Mom's picture, hears her
voice, and, Spector hopes, stops crying. Spector received patent
5,774,861.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Calendar Do the Scheduling
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people go on vacation in summer, making it difficult to
schedule work meetings. Gregory Fitzpatrick and Marvin Williams,
two Texas inventors working for IBM, have patented a solution _ an
electronic calendar that monitors other electronic calendars,
detects when dates are available and fits in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The invention uses electronic calendars that are part of a
networked system of computers. First, the person initiating the
meeting enters the date, time and duration of the proposed meeting
into his electronic calendar. If a conflict exists for any of the
expected participants, the software notifies the person who entered
the request.
</P>
<P>
   It then monitors the electronic calendars of the other
participants, detecting when the conflicting events are rescheduled
or canceled. When that happens, the electronic calendar schedules
the proposed meeting on the agendas of everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick and Williams received patent 5,774,867, which was
assigned to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a Picture of a Picture
</P>
<P>
   Photo-taking increases in summer as people spend more time with
their families, outdoors or on vacation. Minolta hopes to make
taking snapshots easier with a camera that lets photographers
preview their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Ootsuka, a Minolta employee from Toyokawa, Japan,
invented a camera that has conventional controls for film speed,
shutter speed and exposure. A photographer can set those controls
and then check to see whether the photo he is about to take will
really look the way he expects.
</P>
<P>
   The camera picks up the image of the intended photograph and
displays it on a monitor. The photographer can examine the proposed
picture and change the camera's setting if desired. The camera then
takes up the role of a conventional camera, recording the image on
film. Ootsuka received patent 5,774,754, which was assigned to
Minolta.
</P>
<P>
   A Doorbell With a Voice
</P>
<P>
   Barbecues in the back yard and picnics in the park take people
out of their homes in summer. What if friends or neighbors stop by?
With Todd Housely's invention, when they ring the doorbell, they
won't hear a chime. Instead, they'll get a voice message. When a
visitor pushes the doorbell, a signal is transmitted to a
programmable doorbell controller. The controller contains a
recording of a voice message. When the signal is received, the
controller activates a playback of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Housely also designed a recording system that lets a visitor
leave a message. The visitor presses a recording button installed
near the doorbell, and an adjacent microphone picks up the spoken
message and transmits it to the controller, where it is encoded and
stored. Housely received patent 5,774,039.
</P>
<P>
   Coming Soon: Patents on the Web
</P>
<P>
   The Patent and Trademark Office has announced that it will make
patent and trademark data available free on its Web site before the
end of the year. The agency says that the full text of trademarks
will be posted on the site in August. Drawings from trademarks and
the full text of 2 million patents issued since 1976 will be added
in November. The drawings included with patents will be available
next March.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the agency's site, www.uspto.gov, offered only
abstracts _ the brief description of an invention that appears on
the first page of a patent. But the agency has offered free access
to the full text of AIDS-related patents since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

MAJOR STEPS FORWARD FOR STREAMING TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The streaming technology that allows music and video to be sent
over the Internet to personal computers is still a curiosity as a
medium and a puzzle as a business.
</P>
<P>
   But Real Networks Inc., the leader in streaming software, is
making announcements Monday that represent steps toward developing
both the medium and its business model further, industry analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The company is releasing a test, or beta, version of its desktop
and network server software that employs a new standard for
streaming technology, Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language,
or SMIL (pronounced smile.)
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, the hope is that the new format, recommended by
the World Wide Web Consortium, a nonprofit arbiter of technical
standards for Internet software, will open the way for a flood of
streaming-media programming _ as did agreement on Hypertext Markup
Language, or HTML, the document format for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   SMIL should allow Web programmers to put video, audio, text and
charts into an integrated presentation that can be broadcast live
or on demand to Internet-connected personal computers. Until now,
streaming technology has tended to be used to send standard radio
or television programming over the Internet, like video of a sports
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Real Networks' deployment of SMIL is an important step
toward moving streaming technology to become a real new media,''
said Jae Kim, an analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm
in Carmel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks' latest version of its desktop software for
receiving streaming media, Real Player G2, has ``channels'' to link
users to Internet broadcast sites of more than 60 media companies
including CNN, ABC, Fox, ESPN, CBS Sportsline, Sony CMPnet and The
Wall Street Journal. Real Player is distributed free from the
company Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The channel feature is the Seattle-based company's effort to
become a gateway, or portal, for steering users to other
programming. The steering strategy, if successful, will bring in
added revenues and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks software is used on more than 80 percent of the
Web pages with streaming media, and Real Networks said it had more
than 26 million registered users, up from 7 million in April 1997.
``After the Web browsers, we have by far the largest base of
users,'' said Rob Glaser, chairman of Real Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. bought a 10 percent stake in Real Networks last
July, before the company went public in November. Under securities
law, Microsoft has to hold onto its shares for a year, meaning it
can sell at the end of this month. Glaser declined to comment on
whether Microsoft, whose Netshow product competes with Real
Networks, might sell off its holding.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks' stock closed last week at $34.75 a share,
compared with its initial public offering price of $12.50. The
company will lose $10 million on revenues of $54 million this year,
estimated David Readerman, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities. By 2000, he projected, the company will earn $12
million on revenues of $100 million.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: JUSTICE DEPT. VS. THE BELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Multibillion-dollar mergers are the most glamorous events in the
telecommunications business. But potentially the most important
development in the industry continues to be the legal battle
between the Bell local phone companies and the Justice Department
over the soul of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The battlefront last week was in New Orleans, where the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the government's appeal
of a December decision that would give the Bells what they most
desire: immediate entry into the $80 billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, issued mere hours before the end of the year by
Judge Joe Kendall of U.S. District Court in Wichita Falls, Texas,
never went into effect. For now, the Bells must wait for approval
from the Federal Communications Commission before selling
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells' case may well end up before the Supreme Court and
remain unresolved for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But for communications regulators, carriers, investors and
customers the case will remain critical. That importance could be
seen in the identity of the lawyers who made the main arguments on
Thursday: Laurence Tribe from Harvard University for the Bells and
Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells, led by SBC Communications Inc., have made a shrewd
argument. Basically, they contend that the U.S. Constitution does
not allow Congress to act as if it were a judge, namely U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Greene supervised the breakup of AT&AMP;T in the 1980s into a
long-distance company, now named AT&AMP;T Corp., and seven Bell local
phone companies. The split was part of a consent decree that the
old AT&AMP;T agreed to in an antitrust settlement with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree and Greene's rulings gave the Bells legal
monopolies on local phone service in their regions. The catch was
that the Bells were not allowed to sell long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   A main goal of the 1996 telecommunications act was to foster
competition in local phone markets. But the Bells had to be enticed
to give up their monopolies and to open their networks so that new
companies could come into the local market without rewiring
buildings across. So Congress provided a way for the Bells to get
into the long-distance arena.
</P>
<P>
   But the path is not easy. The law said that once a Bell had
convinced the FCC that it had opened its network, the Bell would be
allowed to sell long-distance service. (No Bell has yet passed that
test.)
</P>
<P>
   As the telecommunications bill became law, Greene vacated the
consent decree. So the Bells basically traded a regulatory regime
governed by the consent decree and Greene for one governed by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   That trade gave the Bells an opportunity, one they have
exploited. When the consent decree and Greene's orders were keeping
the Bells out of long distance, they had little real argument.
After all, through their former parent company, AT&AMP;T, they had
agreed to a court-supervised settlement that made their independent
existence possible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bells are arguing that the telecommunications act
unfairly singles them out. Barring the Bells from the long-distance
market until they satisfy the FCC is a punishment, they argue, and
Congress has punished the Bells without a trial. When a legislature
(like Congress) punishes someone without a trial, it is known in
legal parlance as a bill of attainder, and bills of attainder are
specifically barred by the Constitution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Very few people expected SBC to succeed when it first made that
argument. After all, the Bells seemed to support the act at its
passage. And everyone knew the Bells were a special regulatory
case, right? Wasn't that the whole reason they were under the
consent decree?
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall agreed with the Bells that as a matter of law, the
history was irrelevant. The consent decree had been vacated. He
agreed with the Bells that it was fundamentally unfair that
Congress had allowed non-Bell local phone companies like GTE Corp.
into the long-distance market without restriction while the Bells
were forced to pass severe regulatory tests.
</P>
<P>
   Klein argues that the long-distance restrictions are not a form
of punishment, but rather a sort of regulation. With their sheer
size and geographic concentration, the Bells merit especially close
attention from Congress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SBC is sparing no opportunity to paint itself as the
champion of constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never want a situation where Congress can single out for
penalties any single group,'' said James Ellis, the company's
general counsel. ``If it can happen to us, they can do it to
less-advantaged groups.''
</P>
<P>
   A difference, of course, between the Bells and less-advantaged
groups is that the Bells are one of the most formidable lobbies in
Washington. With employees and local ties in hundreds of
congressional districts across the country, they wield an influence
that by many accounts surpasses that of the long-distance giants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Kendall's ruling holds up on appeal, it will let
the Bells rush into long distance without necessarily giving up
their grip on local markets. They would take billions of dollars in
revenue directly away from the likes of AT&AMP;T and MCI.
</P>
<P>
   And they would be happy with no glamour at all.

ADVERTISING: AD GIANT FORMS INTERACTIVE DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A giant agency is forming a division to specialize in
interactive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is Ammirati Puris Lintas, one of four worldwide
networks owned by Interpublic Group of Cos. Ammirati Puris, with
billings estimated at $4.4 billion, has opened a division named APL
Digital, which will seek to harness the new media ``to bring brands
closer to consumers,'' said Martin Puris, the chairman, chief
executive and chief creative officer at Ammirati Puris in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Internet began to assume prominence along Madison
Avenue three or four years ago, it would not be surprising if
people were to ask, to paraphrase a line from an old commercial,
``Ammirati Puris, what took you so long?''
</P>
<P>
   An in-house group, Ammirati Puris Lintas Online, has given the
agency ``interactive capability since the beginning of 1995,'' said
Brian Cauley, president at APL Digital, ``so it's not as if we've
just discovered it.''
</P>
<P>
   But about three weeks ago, he added, the Ammirati Puris
worldwide operating board decided ``to formally set up an Internet
capability and subbrand it as APL Digital.''
</P>
<P>
   APL Digital is the ``first subbrand ever for the Ammirati Puris
Lintas network,'' Cauley said. ``That's an indication of how
important this move to digital communications is.''
</P>
<P>
   APL Digital has 140 employees in offices in Hong Kong, London,
New York and Sydney, Australia; plans call for offices to be opened
in additional cities before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of APL Digital is indicative of the growing ardor
among traditional agencies to stake a claim to cyberspace. But many
involved in interactive advertising, electronic commerce and the
Internet continue to disparage the digital efforts of the Madison
Avenue mainstays, asserting that they are not as nimble or skilled
as the crop of fledgling independent agencies that were founded
recently to specialize in digital communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's baloney,'' Cauley said. ``We all know what the Web is
about: commerce, customer service and a more efficient distribution
of information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the game is who's going to do those things better,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Puris took issue with the widespread belief that Madison Avenue
is, to quote the headline on an article last month in the trade
publication Brandweek, ``Missing the E-Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it represents a fundamental change,'' Puris said.
``And we've been in pitches with the independents _ and we've
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cauley acknowledged, ``there is some truth'' to
assertions that more than a few traditional agencies had tarried in
dedicating resources to the interactive realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work in new media are always a little bit
`Come on, let's move faster,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   APL Digital is doing worldwide work for two clients, Compaq
Computer Corp. and Iridium LLC. In this country, the interactive
unit is handling assignments for Aetna Inc., Ameritech Corp., Lego
Group, the Nickelodeon cable television network owned by Viacom
Inc., Unilever and United Parcel Service of America.
</P>
<P>
   In a staff memo last week announcing the promotion of Cauley,
39, to president at APL Digital from executive vice president and
managing director, Puris projected the unit's revenue at $10
million; Cauley estimated billings at $20 million to $30 million.

   Cauley, as part of his promotion, joins the New York management
committee of Ammirati Puris and the worldwide operating board.
Other top officers of APL Digital include Mark Avnet, senior vice
president and director for production and technology; Lynn Bolger,
senior vice president and media director, and Bruce Ledbetter,
principal technical strategist.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of what APL Digital does ``is hard-core Web
site development,'' Cauley said. Examples include a 12-language
site for Iridium (www.iridium.com) and an e-commerce initiative for
Compaq (www.directplus.compaq.com). The remaining APL assignments
are centered on ads for Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement of the formation of APL Digital
came a month after Compaq, a big technology account of Ammirati
Puris, moved the creative and media portions of its account, with
billings estimated at $250 million to $300 million, to DDB Needham
Worldwide in New York, part of Omnicom Group. Ammirati Puris
retained the direct marketing and interactive parts of the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Internet clients at Compaq tend to be different from our
advertising clients,'' Cauley said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever manner in which interactive marketing is handled, Puris
said, one verity remains: ``You still have to go on the Internet
with an idea. Without one, it doesn't work any better than a
billboard outside of La Guardia Airport.''

Big wedding generates news, gossip, photos 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good bet that the new wife of James Brolin, aka Barbra
Streisand, will probably not change her name. For the uninformed,
the celebrated singer and actress, wearing (what else?) a Donna
Karan wedding dress, tied the knot last week with longtime
boyfriend Brolin.
</P>
<P>
   If, by chance, your invitation got lost in the mail or your
helicopter was in the shop that day, you can find plenty of Barbra
wedding news and info on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine has the exclusive story and pictures of the big
day at http://www.pathfinder.com/people/sp/streisand/index.html.
The site is short on photos, but more are scheduled to come soon,
with the approval of the Brolins themselves. But in the meantime,
you can read a blow-by-blow, minute-by-minute account of who was
there, what they wore and what they ate (appetizers included sushi,
pizza, and roasted small potatoes filled with caviar, creme fraiche
and dill). The People site is just filled with juicy gossip, info
and tidbits that both the rabid fans and the merely curious will
adore.
</P>
<P>
   But will the couple live happily ever after? People has set up
message boards for visitors to voice their opinions. Fans of the
couple can also see if the couple's astrological signs are
compatible (Streisand's a Tauras, Brolin's a Capricorn) at
http://astrozine.com/preview002/feature4.html.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's wedding is also a time to reconsider the star's life
and career. Fans of the singer can check out Barbra Streisand.com
(http://www.barbra-streisand.com) The site is primarily devoted to
her latest CD, ``Higher Ground'' but does include some comments
from Barbra herself as well as a place to sign up to get the latest
Streisand dish. It's a little bit out of date, but it's the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are an astonishing number of fan pages devoted to creative
and interesting tributes to Barbra. The Streisand Myths and
Misinformation page
(http://acs2.bu.edu:8001/(tilde)pimentel/myths.html) is devoted to
debunking the many myths surrounding the singer. From here we can
learn that Barbra doesn't have an official fan club or an e-mail
address _ and no, she's never had her nose fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known Barbra fan site, which turns up on nearly
every Web page devoted to her, is the Barbra Streisand FAQ
(frequently asked questions) at
http://members.aol.com/markjayeye/bjsfaq. This is an amazingly
complete listing of Streisand's professional life and works. There
are no pictures, but the information here is exhaustive. Another
America Online member has another page devoted to Streisand's
musical career at http://members.aol.com/barbramusc/index.html with
some great vintage black and white photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some people who take Streisand very
seriously, there are others who don't mind having a little fun with
the icon. Mr. Showbiz has a fun site at
http://www.mrshowbiz.com/games/linked/hi/153.html that shows
visitors all the men (and there are quite a few) with whom Barbra
has spent time over the years. Memo to James Brolin: This is one
Barbra site you might just want to skip.

MCI CLOSE TO DEAL TO SELL ITS INTERNET BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI Communications Corp. is close to an agreement to sell its
entire Internet business to Cable and Wireless PLC for $1.5 billion
to $2 billion in cash, executives close to the negotiations said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the two companies could be announced this week,
the executives said, adding that minor negotiating points remained
unresolved Monday. The executives speculated that the only possible
development that could scuttle a deal would be the existence of
separate, secret talks between MCI and another buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would clear the way for the Justice Department to
approve the $37 billion acquisition of MCI by Worldcom Inc. While
the Federal Communications Commission would also have to sign off
on the MCI-Worldcom deal, few people in Washington or on Wall
Street expect the commission's review to be onerous for the
companies in the way the Justice Department's antitrust analysis
has been.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials, along with antitrust regulators
from the European Union, have been concerned that a combined MCI
and Worldcom could dominate the Internet business. Worldcom's Uunet
operation is the biggest Internet service provider, while MCI is
also a major Internet carrier. Opponents of the deal have said that
the combined company could control as much as 70 percent of the
market for wholesale access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   MCI has tried to allay those concerns before. In May it
announced that it had sold its wholesale Internet business to Cable
and Wireless, an international communications company based in
Britain, for $625 million. The unit that MCI initially agreed to
sell served smaller Internet companies that in turn sold services
to consumers. At the time, MCI said that deal would be sufficient
to answer the antitrust questions of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``By divesting MCI's Internet backbone, we have eliminated any
overlap with Worldcom's Internet business,'' Bert C. Roberts Jr.,
MCI's chairman, said. ``We have formed an agreement that addresses
antitrust concerns with the MCI-Worldcom merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators did not agree. As GTE Corp. led the lobbying
effort against both of MCI's pending deals, U.S. and European
antitrust officials maintained that MCI would have to sell its
units that offer cyberspace services directly to businesses and
consumers in addition to the wholesale division.
</P>
<P>
   Any new deal between MCI and Cable and Wireless would include
those divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust officials, and GTE, would have preferred that
Worldcom sell Uunet. But Worldcom refused.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 billion-to-$2 billion negotiating range would include
the $625 million that Cable and Wireless already agreed to pay MCI,
executives close to the negotiations said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Like MCI's original deal with Cable and Wireless, any subsequent
agreement would also make the sale contingent on MCI's being
acquired by Worldcom, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, Cable and Wireless and the Justice Department all declined
to comment Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People close to MCI and the Justice Department said that the
department had all but agreed to approve the MCI-Worldcom deal if
MCI struck an additional deal with Cable and Wireless that included
the units that sell Internet services to consumers and business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   When MCI first explored selling parts of its Internet business,
Justice Department officials told the company that GTE and Sprint
Corp. would not be acceptable buyers. GTE and Sprint are big
Internet companies, and the officials were concerned that a sale to
either of them would fail to refashion the overall competitive
landscape in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless was of interest to both MCI and the
regulators because it is a hungry, hefty company that is not a
huge-scale communications competitor in the United States.

LIBRARY INTERNET CASE COULD BE FIRST AMENDMENT LITMUS TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAN FREEDMAN   
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not exactly ``Star Wars,'' but an intense
battle in cyberspace is coming to a head in the fast-growing
suburbs of the nation's capital. It pits the American Civil
Liberties Union against conservative anti-pornography crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the decision by the public library board of Loudoun
County, Va., which voted 5-4 last October to install so-called
blocking software to deny public library patrons access to computer
Internet sites featuring ``child pornography,'' ``hardcore
pornography'' and ``material deemed harmful to juveniles'' under
Virginia law.
</P>
<P>
   Library users calling up such sites are met with a computer
screen declaring ``Violation! Violation! Violation! Access to this
site has been blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU and a local group, Mainstream Loudoun, are suing the
library's trustees in federal court in suburban Alexandria, Va.
They charge that the policy violates library patrons' First
Amendment rights because the software, X-Stop, designed by Log-On
Data Corp. of Anaheim, Calif., blocks not only pornographic sites
that have no constitutional protection, but sites that do have such
protection, such as sites maintained by the Yale University Biology
Department and the San Francisco Examiner and San Francisco
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A highly trained, professional librarian can make those
distinctions,'' said Ann Beeson, the lead ACLU lawyer in the case.
``Blocking software never could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Located northwest of Washington, Loudoun County is the scene of
exploding growth as bedroom communities spring up to replace the
small-town and rural-farming traditions that were the hallmarks of
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henderson, Loudoun County library director, said last
November his staff tested X-Stop after it was installed and found
it blocked 57 sites that had nothing to do with pornography,
including the home page for the pacifist Society of Friends, also
known as the Quakers.
</P>
<P>
   The policy puts librarians ``in the position of being parents,
and it makes second-class citizens out of those not affluent enough
to have this technology in their home,'' he said. People who rely
on the library for the Internet ``have a different level of access,
and I'm not comfortable with that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after a specialist tinkered with the software, it still
blocked the Zero Population Growth web site and the Mormon Church
page on preventing masturbation.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Black, a Virginia state legislator and library board member
who voted for the policy, said that right now, ``99.9 percent'' of
sites blocked by the software clearly are pornographic. ``And even
if the software blocked some sites that didn't need to be blocked,
the fact is there is no other solution,'' he said. ``We've had very
few complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bass, the lawyer for the board, said the controversy is less
about the First Amendment than ``whether constitution compels
libraries to facilitate federal felonies. There's no question that
obscenity and child porno is not protected speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography viewing in libraries is not the board's only worry,
he added. Under sexual harassment law, permitting library users to
view pornography might enable employees to sue the county for
failing to do anything about a ``hostile work environment,'' Bass
said.
</P>
<P>
   Depositions in the case are continuing and absent a settlement,
it is likely to go to trial this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Intervening on the side of the plaintiffs are eight others, all
of whom contend that the blocking software unconstitutionally
restricts access to their work. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Troyer, whose ``Safer Sex Page'' gives advice on
sexuality to gay and bisexual teen-agers;
</P>
<P>
   _ John Ockerbloom, whose page features books ``from Ulysses to
Little Red Riding Hood'' that have been subject to censorship;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Maryland Chapter of the American Association of University
Women, which promotes education and pay equity for women;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rob Morse, columnist for the San Francisco Examiner;
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeremy Myers, an 18-year-old offering advice and book
references for gay and lesbian teen-agers;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sergio Arau, a Mexican painter and rock singer known as ``El
Padrino'' whose artworks are displayed on the Internet;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Renaissance Transgender Association, a support group for
those switching sexual identities;
</P>
<P>
   - And Jonathan Wallace, whose on-line publication ``The Ethical
Spectacle'' examines Internet censorship issues.
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff, Mainstream Loudoun, has its own lawyer and
is not represented by the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year threw out a federal ban against
transmitting indecent materials to minors. The justices said the
prohibition was overly broad and would cut out a multitude of
constitutionally protected speech aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   But the Loudoun County case is the first test of what, if any,
limits there are on the Internet in an institution that for
generations has been the average person's most common point of
access to information: The public library.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it is being closely watched by organizations ranging
from the American Library Association, which supports the ACLU
position, to the American Center for Law and Justice, founded by
conservative tele-evangelist Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Other conservative groups are supporting the Loudoun County
Library Board, including the Family Research Council, led by former
Reagan administration official Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Most other conflicts involving blocking software have been
resolved without litigation, according to Beeson. After ACLU
complaints, library systems in Boston and in Kern County,
California agreed to give patrons the option of using the software
during Internet searches if they desired.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU also is involved in a case in Livermore, Calif. where a
local parent, identified only as ``Kathleen R.'' is suing the local
library system in California Superior Court in Alameda County for
not employing the software.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Corn-Revere, lawyer for the Mainstream Loudoun group,
recalled the statement by the late Justice Potter Stewart that he
could not define pornography, ``but I know it when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   By using the blocking software, he said, Loudoun County's
version would be ``we know it without looking at it.''

INTERNETTERS REACT TO WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something like 1.5 billion people around the world watched the
final World Cup soccer game Sunday (France over Brazil, 3-0).
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the final whistle, the Monday-morning
quarterbacking began on the Internet. (Monday-morning
quarterbacking? That's an American football term. It means
second-guessing the game, a sport favored by couch potatoes who
never get close to the field.)
</P>
<P>
   The early opinions were posted in the Usenet newsgroup
alt.sports.soccer.worldcup98, where the argument certainly will
rage for days. Samples:
</P>
<P>
   _``Why didn't Brazil play football tonight? It was too easy for
France! A boring final!''
</P>
<P>
   _``It is exactly how (the Brazilians) have been playing for the
last couple of years, and they never deserved to get to the final
game. There are so many better teams than Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Have you seen the last few World Cup finals? This one was a
miracle compared to those. France actually played some flowing
football in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   _``How much would England have won that final?''
</P>
<P>
   _``Oh here we go _English sportsmanship at its best. Someone
better tell him England can't get to the final without winning.''
</P>
<P>
   _``The French should be congratulated. They staged a well
organized tournament and an excellent final. They deserve it and
I'm glad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Again the `what if' questions. England had a decent squad but
certainly not a magical one. People seem to forget that before the
penalty loss to Argentina, England were well beaten by Romania.
Does this make Romania more worthy a World Cup winner than
England?''
</P>
<P>
   _``If England (had won) the World Cup they would have rioted and
tipped over the Eiffel Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   _``I must say after watching all the games and hearing most of
the comentary on this world cup, Brazil were made out to be virtual
supermen but, alas, they were exposed. Well, if you beat weak teams
you would obviously look good .... France on the other hand
stumbled along slowly, playing well, averagely and also scraping
out a victory against Italy, but unlike Brazil their defence is
tops and deserved to be called world class.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Well said. France put on an excellent display _especially in
the first half .... The French were not at all intimidated by the
Brazilians and ran at them from the beginning _consequently
exposing Brazil's lack of cohesion (which some of the fawning
press, in unconditional worship of Brazil, failed to remark on).
</P>
<P>
   ``The hosts have won, setting France alight and adding a new
name to the short list of World Cup victors. Felicitations les
blues!''

 Improving Anti-Smut Software  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I'm using CyberPatrol Internet blocking software, but to my
dismay, it doesn't seem to be blocking inappropriate sites that are
accessed through search engines like Yahoo. Do you know of any
other software that will prevent my teenage son from accessing sex
sites this way?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Actually, CyberPatrol will block access to a site reached
through a search engine as long as it's on the list of sites for
which the software has been programmed to look for. Unfortunately,
no blocking software is going to be able to keep up with the
explosion of raunchy Web sites. (Sex is one of the top growth
industries of the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   However, you can make CyberPatrol block results of searches for
specific words, like ``sex.'' Here's how: First, go to the IRQ Chat
button in the CyberPatrol main screen and add the words you want to
block. Then, go back to the main screen and click the button for
WWW, FTP and Other. On the left side of the dialog box that
appears, click the check box labeled Apply IRQ keyword filters to
URL names.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've done this, a search for ``sex'' in most search
engines will come up empty. Keep in mind, though, that you'll also
be blocked from sites about about Middlesex, England; poet Anne
Sexton; or other sites containing the naughty word.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I would like to know how to put a GIF image in my signature
so that it appears on all my outgoing e-mail. I use Microsoft
Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; It can be done, but it takes a few steps. First, you'll
need to create an HTML file containing the image and your
signature. (The signature actually is just your name and other
personal information, not a real signature.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have Microsoft Office 97, you can use Word to do the job.
Open Word and start a new document. Choose Picture from the Insert
menu, then click from File. Locate the GIF image file on your hard
disk and insert it into the document. Then enter your signature
above or below the image. Finally, choose Save as HTML from Word's
File menu, give the document a name and save it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now open up Outlook Express. Choose Stationery from the
Tools menu to bring up the Stationery dialog box. In the area
titled, ``When composing new messages use,'' click This Stationery.
Then click Select, browse the hard disk for your new HTML document,
and select it.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Every new message will contain the image and
signature, which can be received by anyone with a mail program
capable of handling HTML. By the way, don't forget to turn off any
other e-mail signature you may have created, to avoid a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Lately, every time I boot up my computer, the time is
wrong. The problem is that the computer's clock is slowing down.
What gives, and how can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Your system's battery probably is wearing out. And if it
fails, you may have trouble booting up your PC. My suggestion is to
take the computer to a qualified technician for a battery
replacement. You can do the job yourself, but it involves finding
the right kind of battery and backing up crucial system information
before removing the old one. FYI, most batteries are under $20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Is there any way to compose and read e-mail without first
having to go online?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Sure. Just choose the Work Offline or Go Offline option
offered in the File menu of most e-mail programs. You then can read
any messages that previously have been downloaded, as well as
compose new messages, which will be sent the next time you go
online.
</P>
<P>
   If you use America Online, you can use FlashSessions to go
online automatically at scheduled times, download new messages
you've received and send out any you've written offline.
</P>

   Travel Update: A couple of weeks ago, I told someone they'd need
special phone plugs when connecting to the Internet in Europe.
Reader Charles Mills wrote in with this nifty piece of advice:

 Motorola To Acquire Starfish  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Motorola said Tuesday it has agreed to acquire Starfish
Software, developer of the popular Rex personal organizer as well
as technology for linking wireless devices to computers.
</P>
<P>
   Starfish, based in Scotts Valley, will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola pending regulatory
approvals. Starfish chief executive Philippe Kahn will be president
of the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola President Bob Growney, who joined Kahn for the
announcement last night in San Francisco, said the cash-and-stock
deal values Starfish at several hundred million dollars. Exact
terms weren't disclosed because Starfish is a private company.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes as Motorola grapples with a tumultuous
reorganization brought on by weakness in its semiconductor business
and a 98 percent plunge in profits in its most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Growney said Motorola will build Starfish technology into
wireless devices that exchange information with each other as well
as with a variety of information sources including personal
computers, the Internet and wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complementary visions of our two companies _ to create an
environment in which consumers can literally take their world with
them _ makes this union not only logical but extremely powerful,''
said Growney.
</P>
<P>
   Starfish, which boasts about 100 employees, had been on track
for an initial public offering. But Kahn said the deal with
Motorola _ which came together in the past month _ was too good to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going for an IPO, we can focus on the technology
we're building and be part of the company that ships more than half
of the wireless devices in the world,'' he said. ``At the same
time, Motorola has been a little bit beaten up, so we'll take their
undervalued stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Motorola may benefit from having a nimble player
like Starfish in its stable _ a company that has a track record for
quickly deploying new technology. The Rex, a credit card-sized
organizer, is its best success to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starfish has continuously demonstrated its ability to
effectively advance technology solutions for swift market
development,'' said market analyst David Coursey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starfish owns a number of patents on technology for
linking wireless devices, which Motorola will now own.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn co-founded Starfish in 1994, shortly before he was ousted
as chief executive of Borland International. He had founded Borland
in 1982, and grew it into the world's third-largest software
company on the strength of database and spreadsheet products.
</P>
<P>
   Borland went sour in the 1990s, however, as its products were
eclipsed by other software that worked better with Microsoft
Windows.

 Japan Ills Darken Semicon  
 By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jitters from the Japanese election added to the pall cast over
Semicon West, the huge chip-equipment trade show that kicked off
Tuesday at Moscone Center.
</P>
<P>
   With Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigning Sunday,
analysts and executives fear that the turmoil could prolong any
economic boost for one of the industry's key regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any momentum in Japanese stabilization has gone away,'' said
analyst Clark Fuhs, vice president of Dataquest, a research firm in
San Jose. ``The exchange rate is a concern. There are some critical
levels where it starts bringing China into the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   A plunging yen makes Japanese exports cheaper, and that leads to
worries that China could devalue its currency to remain competitive
in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of the problems in Japan, there's no real good news
in that scenario for us or any other manufacturers,'' said Jon
Tompkins, chairman of San Jose-based KLA-Tencor. ``Demand for
chip-based products of all types are depressed there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without more bad news out of Asia, chip equipment-makers
remain mired in a slump that's worse than anyone can recall.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips have always been a cyclical business, in which
improvements in making chips periodically cause too much supply,
which in turn drives down prices _ and profits. And when chip
companies make less money, they order less equipment, which puts
the equipment industry into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   But this cycle is even worse than the downturn of the early
1980s, said Jim Morgan, the veteran chief executive of industry
leader Applied Materials. ``It's among the toughest and most
unforgiving that I've seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One New York analyst who follows the industry is pessimistic,
but he said he's not allowed to use the ``r-word.'' He said his
company won't let him use the r-word ``until we're in the d-word.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry expects revenues for this year to be $19.7 billion,
a 22 percent drop from last year's $25.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara-based Applied has asked certain employees to
consider buyouts, in hopes of shedding 1,000 jobs by the end of
this month. The company has been shutting down on Fridays as a
cost-saving measure that could continue until year end, a spokesman
said. On Friday, Applied said earnings for its latest quarter will
be lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Applied is not alone. Other chip equipment-makers, such as Lam
Research and Novellus, have laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more layoffs coming,'' said analyst Mark FitzGerald, a
vice president at Merrill Lynch in San Francisco. ``People are
talking about a 15 to 20 percent head-count reduction in this
area'' at some companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the troubled times: Semicon West attracted
62,000 people last year, but Stan Myers, president of Semi, the
trade association that sponsors the show, expects the number to
drop this year. He won't know by how much until the show ends. It
runs in San Francisco through tomorrow and moves to the San Jose
Convention Center for Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is prime exhibit space, and we could throw firecrackers
there and not hit anybody,'' said Jerry Karls, CEO of Integrated
Circuit Engineering Corp.
</P>
<P>
   On the show floor, there seemed to be more exhibitors scouting
the competition than customers looking for new products.
``Everybody's scratching for customers,'' said Applied's Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the business conditions that border on recession _ and
which no one sees the industry pulling out of for another 12 to 18
months _ many companies tried to put a positive spin on the
technology on display.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it looked arcane: large machines that whirred, Rube
Goldberg devices that manipulate chips, signs touting new ``exhaust
control,'' ``atmospheric robot,'' ``automated wet process'' and
other intricacies of the chip-equipment business.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms tried to make their products entertaining. Mimes
donned the white suits used in chip-making clean rooms. One man was
covered head to toe in copper _ the next big material in chip
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Some chip companies are switching from aluminum to copper for
the wiring inside chips. The equipment-makers want to encourage the
shift because it also requires new machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Novellus of San Jose rented out the spacious Yerba Buena Center
for an elaborate display touting the move to copper.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Novellus complex walked through a
``de-aluminizer,'' in which steam and flashing lights pretended to
eliminate aluminum from the body. Guides in black turtlenecks and
black slacks guided them into a theater like one used in
``Clockwork Orange,'' in which flashing messages on a screen tried
to brainwash them to use copper. They donned virtual reality-type
headsets in which the message was drilled home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if they were Novellus customers, they got to go into
another wing of the building for a massive show of the latest
equipment. Novellus displayed no hint of industry panic there, only
unbridled optimism at the technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all set to rock and roll,'' said David Godwin, a
software engineer. He watched with pride as Novellus' $3 million
Sabre machine rinsed silicon wafers and spun them dry. ``This
thing's going to make us a lot of money,'' he said.

 Specialty Internet search engines allow users to cut through
clutter  
 By Amy Doan   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say you want to locate a news group on swing dancing, a shop in
Northern California that will do custom embroidery, or a sheet
metal supplier in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   You could go to one of the main search engines, such as Yahoo or
Excite, and sort through mountains of information that may or may
not be relevant. Or you could take a shortcut and go to one of a
growing number of specialty search engines.
</P>
<P>
   As the amount of data clogging the Internet continues to grow,
it's ``just harder and harder'' for traditional automated search
engine technology to return focused data, said Danny Sullivan,
editor of the ``Search Engine Watch'' newsletter, based in London.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``the number of specialty engines has been growing
wherever you look, especially in the past year,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Thomas Regional Directory Co., best known for its
industrial supply books, recently created regional search engines
on a wide variety of industrial products, services and trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Disney started a site for kids called Dig.com that
features individual search engines for topics such as comic books
and dinosaur trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Most search engines create their listings automatically by
having software ``agents'' crawl the Web and constantly update a
directory of site information, which is matched against the
keywords typed in by users.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Yahoo, also rely on teams of editors to manually
review sites and descriptions that are submitted by site owners.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty search engines work much the same way, but because
their focus is so narrow, they can eliminate more ``clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   You can find specialty search engines by looking in hobby and
trade magazines.
</P>
<P>
   You also can find them on standard search engines. The home
pages for the major search engines, including Excite and Lycos,
produce fairly comprehensive specialty search engine listings in
their ``computers'' category.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm looking for a Viper 330 video card, it just makes no
sense whatsoever to start out with Yahoo,'' said Charlie Woods, a
Dallas engineer. ``Digging through the sites that come up just
takes too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods uses niche engines to find computer components for work
and, on weekends, to locate parts for his Honda ST1100 motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually find the exact information I'm looking for within
the first 20 or 30 listings, instead of the hundreds of listings it
took before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gettinger, who runs a glass manufacturing company in
Hayward, also uses specialty engines for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick of typing in `glass' and getting tons of
information on artistic glass or glass plants in Canada, but
nothing I could use,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of specialty search engines is that they are
sometimes no more than glorified commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Because they get fewer advertising dollars than traditional
search engines, specialty search engines often charge sites for
prominent positions in their search results.
</P>
<P>
   And some only are referral sites for companies looking for sales
leads.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers should find out how a search engine makes money
before relying on it exclusively, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users should always be on the lookout for clues as to how
commercially biased the listings are,'' said Mark Mooradian, a
director with Jupiter Communications, a research firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites that purport to be search engines don't even refer
visitors to other Web sites. For example, Jewelry-Search.com only
refers visitors to local jewelers who have paid a fee to be
included. When you're checking out a specialty search engine, pay
attention to the kinds of sites that show up on search results. If
they include a mix of commercial and noncommercial sites and news
groups, they're more likely give you less-biased information.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just because sites are paying to be included in the
results doesn't mean a site isn't useful,'' Mooradian said.
</P>
<P>
   And many generic, advertising- &QL; 
supported search engines also charge Web sites for premium
listings, he added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, mainstream search engines often have exclusive
licensing deals with online retailers. When users type in popular
keywords like ``books'' or ``music,'' sites like Amazon.com or
Barnes &AMP; Noble.com usually will be listed first.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said many users of traditional search engines don't know
that when a logo flashes ``try this first'' above a search result,
it's likely that a company has paid for top billing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lycos instructs users to ``check this out,'' with
``this'' being a link to business partner Barnes and Noble.com.
When someone jumps to the Barnes and Noble site from Lycos, the
search engine gets a commission.
</P>
<P>
   One search engine company has chosen to be up-front about its
commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
   Goto.com, launched in 1997, tells users exactly how much a site
has paid for placement on the Goto search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Goto even shows visitors how much sites are paying per click.
Most companies pay between one and 12 cents for every person who
clicks onto to their sites from Goto.
</P>
<P>
   The Goto search results are organized via competitive bidding:
Those that pay more get higher billing.

 Semiconductor Equipment-Makers May Feel the Urge to Merge  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The semiconductor equipment industry is the pits, but that could
be good news for investment bankers like Tim Sullivan _ and maybe
for bottom-fishing investors.
</P>
<P>
   Semi equipment vendors sell the multimillion-dollar machines
that run chip assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who works in Morgan Stanley's M&AMP;A practice in Menlo
Park, explained why equipment-makers, who are holding a trade
showthis week in San Francisco, may be getting the urge to merge.
</P>
<P>
   In short, after two years of overly ambitious factory expansion,
the chip market is glutted. Chipmakers like Intel are cutting jobs,
idling assembly lines _ and canceling orders for new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, there is a tendency for smaller or
weaker (equipment-makers) to decide they need to be part of a
bigger company,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report predicting more semi-equipment mergers,
analyst Tia-min Pang of Cowen &AMP; Co. in San Francisco named
potential buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, stronger vendors like Applied
Materials, Photronics and Kulicke &AMP; Soffa might use the slump to
gobble up smaller firms like Credence Systems, GaSonics,
Nanometrics and Tegal.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a word to the wise. The semi equipment industry is so
complex, even insiders like Sullivan struggle to keep up with the
science behind these complex machines that can create perfect
vacuums or spray on layers of metal a mere 50 atoms thick.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Sullivan warns that shares of semi equipment
stocks could fall even further before any potential mergers pull
them out of the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   What investors need to know is something that puzzles insiders:
Has the industry hit bottom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to say,'' said Bill McIlvaine, managing editor of
Semiconductor Business News. ``But I can tell you it's already as
bad as 1985,'' the last time equipment-makers fell this far into
the trough.
</P>
<P>
   To study up before investing, start with www.semi.org and
www.seminews.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Leaden parachutes? &LR;  The tech industry seems on the verge of
steamrolling organized labor's opposition, and persuading Congress
to increase the quota of foreign workers who can be ``imported'' to
the United States under the H-1B visa program.
</P>
<P>
   That irritates Mike Schilling, a programmer in Oakland who
thinks the H-1B issue has been cooked up by execs to hold down the
wages of software serfs like himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anyone in the world whose wages are inflated, it's
CEOs,'' Schilling complained in an e-mail that has been working its
way around the Net.
</P>
<P>
   As Schilling sees it, even CEOs who send their firms into
nose-dives float away on golden parachutes. And with Silicon Valley
headhunters talking about an ``executive shortage,'' odds are that
even bungling CEOs will get a shot at running another firm into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   So in tongue-in-cheek fashion, Schilling proposes creating a
special H-1B visa category for top brass. ``What America needs is a
CEO who's willing to work 12 hours a day for a reasonable wage and
can be cheaply deported should he not perform acceptably,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Squeaky wheel? &LR;  It took a letter to 3Com Chairman Eric
Benhamou _ with a copy to the media _ but Donna Bernett finally got
reimbursed for $191.30 in expenses she incurred before being laid
off four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   What made the long wait particularly annoying was that Bernett
worked for 3Com for only 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Wheeling, Ill., woman started on January 19 as a
$3,750-a-month print advertising supervisor. On March 16, she was
fired, as part of a 7 percent layoff in 3Com's US Robotics
division.
</P>
<P>
   She promptly filed a request to be paid for 552 miles in travel
expenses and tolls. But her chit apparently got stalled in the 3Com
network until Friday, when her letter to Benhamou, and the threat
of media exposure, prompted the company to cut a check.
</P>
<P>
   3Com spokeswoman Sara Powers said she wasn't sure what caused
the delay. But she noted that 3Com tried to ease the pain of
Bernett's layoff with a severance package that included an extra
two months pay.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Eastward, ho? &LR;  Every state in the Union is trying to grab a
piece of California's tech action. The latest wannabe is Oklahoma,
which styles itself the ``Silicon Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   Touting tax incentives, fast permits and low ($150,000) housing
prices, Gary Miller, director of Oklahoma's Department of Commerce,
will be prospecting for relocation clients at this week's
semiconductor equipment trade shows in San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   So if your evening commute sends you east over Highway 580, you
might expect a little extra delay ... as all those covered wagons
full of California refugees slow down toclimb Altamont Pass.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Cobol, Fortran speakers &LR; : The Department of Labor will open a
new site today, advertising jobs for Year 2000 programmers. See
www.dol.gov for details.

 Whisper-Light Speaker/Microphone Says an Earful  
 By Jonathan Marshall   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In yellow, green or red, it looks a little like one of my kids'
chewable Gummi Bears. But the Jabra EarSet is a unique combination
of speaker and microphonethat fits in your ear and connects by a
thin wire to a cellular phone or PC.
</P>
<P>
   The EarSet permits hands-free communication without the
encumbrance of a headband and boom microphone common to other
headsets. It's easy to forget you even have it on because it weighs
less than an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny microphone and speaker fit into a colored gel earpiece
molded to fit most ears. The package comes with 6 washable
earpieces _ small, medium and large sizes for left and right ears.
</P>
<P>
   The directional microphone, although placed at your ear, picks
up sounds from your mouth. Because it stays fixed, it's not subject
to the sound variations that plague boom microphones when you jar
or misadjust them.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the EarSet on a demanding application _ Dragon Naturally
Speaking, a PC dictation program that comes with its own,
traditional headset.
</P>
<P>
   I plugged the earpiece's wire into the microphone and speaker
jacks of my PC sound card. I had to adjust the microphone gain on
my sound card because Jabra's earpiece had lower output than the
boom microphone, but it performed just as accurately as Dragon's
mike.
</P>
<P>
   I also used the earpiece to hold a phone conversation over the
Internet, using my PC to encode and decode speech. Again, it worked
flawlessly _ more than I can say for the Internet, which sometimes
broke up the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Jabra soon will start bundling its earpiece with Internet
telephony software from Net2Phone, a division of New Jersey-based
IDT Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jabra Corp., based in San Diego, came out with an earpiece
several years ago for the Macintosh. But the company reorganized
last year, revamped the microphone and circuitry and added the gel
earpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between (the old) product and today's is a
little like the difference between a Commodore 64 and a Pentium
II,'' said Jabra spokeswoman Julie Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   The PC version of the EarSet is available from some mail-order
retailers, such as TigerDirect, for $49.95. PC and Mac versions
also are available from CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   A separate model for cellular phones _ great for talking in the
car while keeping both hands on the steering wheel _ costs $39.95,
if your phone accepts a 2.5 millimeter jack.
</P>
<P>
   The price jumps to $79.99 if you need a special connector set
for nonstandard jacks with such phones as the Motorola Flip Phone.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available from Jabra's Web site, at
www.jabra.com.

MICROSOFT UNVEILS ON-LINE HOME-BUYING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WARREN WILSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Placing another long-term bet on the Internet,
Microsoft Corp. Monday unveiled a new service that aims to link
buyers, sellers, brokers and lenders through an easy-to-use Web
site called HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is hardly the first to spot the Internet's potential
in a data-intensive field such as real estate. Already, home buyers
can tap into a multitude of local and national sites that offer a
wealth of listings and other information.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's software expertise could give it an advantage in
offering unique user-friendly features, and in any case it intends
to work with existing players as much as it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an outstanding proposition'' for the broker, said
Microsoft's Ian Morris, lead product manager for HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers pay nothing to have their properties listed on
Microsoft's site, along with all the contact information. Visitors
to the site can describe what they want and instruct HomeAdvisor to
send an e-mail message when new properties are listed that meet
their criteria. They can easily e-mail the listing agent or send
the listing to the agent they're already working with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it easy for agents to sell more homes faster,'' Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor aims to make money in two ways: advertisements and
loan-origination fees when it helps match buyers with mortgage
lenders. In theory, the lenders will get enough extra business to
make it worth their while to give Microsoft a cut of the loan fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenders obviously have to believe we're going to add a lot of
value,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   But buyers are increasingly going online for mortgage
information, so smart lenders are looking for services such as
HomeAdvisor that can help them garner more of that traffic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor includes a number of features that Morris believes
aren't available elsewhere: such as the ability to compare two
homes side-by-side; a ``defect detector'' database that helps
buyers spot problems from foundation cracks to electrical shorts;
and a tool that lets a borrower say what is most important in a
mortgage loan _ low monthly payment or short payoff time, for
example _ and ranks available mortgages accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best site I've ever seen,'' said J. Lennox Scott,
president of Seattle-based John L. Scott Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a wealth of information _ not just about properties
but about surrounding communities and nearby schools, for example,
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   And, by helping link buyers with listing agents, it's an
excellent ``connectivity'' tool and very ``friendly'' to the
real-estate industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we look forward to _ meeting more people''
through HomeAdvisor, he said. ``Real estate is a personalized
service industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is jumping aboard just yet, however.
</P>
<P>
   While several multiple-listing services around the country are
charter participants, the Kirkland, Wash.-based Northwest Multiple
Listing Service isn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the idea of the broker making contact with the
customer,'' president Jack Johnson said. Accordingly, Northwest
Multi-List allows its broker-members to post its entire database on
their sites, and about 35 brokers now do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``HomeAdvisor is a wonderful site,'' he said, and Northwest
Multi-List hasn't ruled out participating in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely enthusiastic about the Internet,'' he said.
``We're watching with great interest what's going on in other parts
of the country, in particular with these national real-estate
sites. We've just chosen at this point in time not to put our
information on there.''

MICROSOFT OFFERS HOME-BUYING SERVICES SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JENNIFER BABSON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. launched Monday a new Internet site -- called
HomeAdvisor -- that touts an array of home buying services, from
listings and primers on the purchase process to demographic data on
local neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may also connect with lenders through the site, a
service that allows Microsoft to collect a minimal fee for acting
as a mortgage broker.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant's entry into the home buying business has
rekindled a debate over the propriety of home listings in an
increasingly crowded and competitive on-line marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of some critics, the site does not include homes
that are for-sale by owners, though it does claim to have about
400,000 Realtor-listed homes displayed.
</P>
<P>
   With a paucity of homes listed on its site, it's not clear
whether Microsoft will be able to make a dent in the real estate
market. After proposing an alliance with Massachusetts' largest
real estate listing service recently, the latest entrant into the
cyber real estate market was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: MLS Property Information Network Inc. already has a
relationship with realtor.com, which with 1.2 million listings,
operates the largest real estate web site in the nation. The
National Association of Realtors has a financial stake in that
site.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's courtship did provide PIN with an unintended
fringe benefit: the leverage to demand its longtime web partner pay
a fee, about a $1 per listing, for the privilege of posting about
90 percent of PIN's nearly 80,000 annual residential listings on
its web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time we will not be cutting a deal with
Microsoft,'' said Court Dwyer, president and CEO of PIN, which is
the byproduct of a merger earlier this year between Bay State MLS
and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board's MLS 1 division.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffed Michael Keller, vice president of marketing at Real
Select, which operates realtor. com. ``One of the most recent
entrants is very late to the game and is joining a very large sea
of competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Resistance on the part of various real estate boards has forced
Microsoft to court local and regional real estate companies across
the country in search of on-line inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``Preview'' by Microsoft, the site is still grappling
with some glitches. An early review of the site, while graphically
pleasing, proved arduous and frustrating: data on home listings was
nearly impossible to obtain, and numerous delays made surfing
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that there were some issues today there is no
doubt about it,'' said Microsoft spokesman Larry Cohen. ``It's like
the final test phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Significant explosions in both the real estate market and the
World Wide Web have led to a proliferation of on-line real estate
centers and services. Many real estate agencies have their own
sites, and most national brokerage firms also have a presence on
the web. Newspaper-linked sites, such as The Boston Globe's
boston.com, offer classified real estate ads on-line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there are more and more players entering the
field,'' said Alison Berkley, group product manager for Intuit,
which touts similar mortgage and homebuying services on the
Internet. In addition to advertising about 600,000 homes, Quicken
markets the wares of 11 lenders. If a deal originated by Quicken
closes, the company derives a fee of just under one half a
percentage point, and passes a $225 rebate to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Since Quicken came on-line last November, about ten new home
buying web sites have been launched, Berkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Tutunjian, manager of five Boston real estate offices for
Hunneman/Coldwell banker, believes that Internet marketing does
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we get a lot of our out of state contacts,'' he
said. ``But unless you are part of other links, you kind of get
lost.'' hunneman.com, a web site serving 72 Hunneman offices in
Massachusetts, gets about 18,000 hits per week, according to
Tutunjian.

CRITICS HAVE NO RIGHT TO ANONYMITY ONLINE, CANADIAN COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Canadian court ruling that may impose new limits on some
online discussions, an Ontario-based recycling company attacked by
pseudonymous critics on an Internet message board has succeeded in
unmasking several of its cyberantagonists.
</P>
<P>
   While the company, the Philip Services Corp., has not yet sued
for libel, it contends that it has been defamed by comments posted
in a finance forum on Yahoo, a popular World Wide Web site. Last
month, a court in Toronto ruled for the company, ordering 12
Internet service providers to turn over the names of subscribers
who used aliases in expressing their often-vituperative opinions.
At least one Internet service provider complied with the order last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Internet postings about Philip included personal attacks
on its executives, with racial slurs and threats, said Lynda Kuhn,
a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of posters began making remarks and all of a sudden
it was open season,'' Ms. Kuhn said. ``We believe that laws that
apply to any form of communication should also apply to this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The case underscores the fact most Internet communications are
not truly anonymous. Although many Internet service providers have
policies protecting the privacy of their subscribers, they have
frequently turned over records, including subscribers' real names,
to law enforcement authorities. Some critics said the ruling could
have a chilling effect on Internet communication, at least in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the ruling has set off a heated debate about the balance
between anonymity and accountability. In an editorial on the case
Monday, The Toronto Globe and Mail cited Emile Zola's defense of
Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French Army falsely accused
of treason, in urging Internet users to remember that ``a real name
adds conviction, credibility and moral authority to a
denunciation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Libel is still libel, even on the World Wide Web,'' the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Hamilton on the west end of Lake Ontario, Philip has
had a hard few months. A copper trading scandal and the departure
of many of its senior managers have contributed to a recent steep
drop in its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Internet critics insist they were simply relaying
important information that the company would rather not have had
publicized. One participant on Monday pointedly posted a quote from
a former Canadian Prime Minister on the Canadian Bill of Rights:
``I am a Canadian, free to speak without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said one question posed by the case was whether
anonymous accusations carried enough weight to be considered
defamatory. That may become more important as Internet users
realize that the anonymity they have now is by no means ironclad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution protects anonymous speech, but that doesn't
matter if Internet service providers don't provide it,'' said Mike
Godwin, author of ``Cyber Rights,'' published last month by Random
House.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers demanded it, Godwin said, technology now available,
that would provide true anonymity so that service providers would
have no information to turn over, even if ordered to do so by a
court, would be more widely used.
</P>
<P>
   John Gallagher, 49, an active poster on the Yahoo board whose
identity was made known to Philip last week by his service
provider, Weslink, said he felt justified in using an alias. A
former Hamilton City Council representative, Gallagher said he had
been publicly involved in various controversies and wanted to
protect his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to know what this company is doing,''
Gallagher said. But he agreed that the pseudonymous communication
allowed the discussion at times to become ``aggressive.''

TANGLED WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a snapshot of the most common Web site management and
development mistakes, according to Jakob Nielsen, who was in charge
of Web site testing at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun Microsystems
Inc. and has written two books on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not knowing why you are creating a Web site in the first
place: Most companies should start their Web design project by
finding out ways in which they can provide true customer value on
their site. Give users benefits from spending time on your site,
allow them to do business with you, and their money will follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Designing for your own bosses: Internally-focused sites cause
companies to end up with home pages full of mission statements,
photos of the chief executive, and corporate history _ all of which
can fit on a single ``about this company'' page. The average
Internet user doesn't care about these things.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not getting your Web site tested to make sure it is
user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making the Web an extension of the company's marketing and
advertising program: The Web is a new new medium. Marketing and
advertising drive the viewer or reader's experience. But the viewer
drives his or her experience on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   _ Long download times: About 15 seconds is an acceptable period
of time to wait for a page to download on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excessive animation: Too many moving objects on the screen
make it difficult for users to read text on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Complex Web site addresses: Avoiding these minimizes the risk
of typographical errors, which keep users from downloading the
site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asking users to scroll down a page: Only 10 percent of users
scroll beyond the information that is visible on the screen. All
critical content and navigating options should be on the top part
of the page.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forgetting to budget for Web site maintenance: As a rule of
thumb, the annual cost to maintain a site should be at least half
of what the company spent on developing the site.

NEW SPIN ON THE 'NET: USER-FRIENDLY WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WENDY TANAKA   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just a few short years ago, many corporate Web
sites were merely on-line business cards that posted an address,
phone number and company facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first effort was a marketing effort,'' said Susan
Weinstein, vice president of the on-line financial services group
for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. ``It was designed on the
brochure model because nobody knew any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in the past few years. Now businesses have
souped up their sites to include hundreds, and often thousands, of
intricately designed, interactive Web pages full of information
about a company's products, services and subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But more information can make Web sites overwhelming and
unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Snyder of User Interface Engineering, a company that
tests Web sites for ease of use, said businesses often make the
mistake of setting up Web sites before determining what they want
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies fall into the trap of developing a Web site around
their organizational chart,'' said Snyder, a principal at the North
Andover, Mass., firm, which also tests software usability. ``So
they're designed from the company looking out. A lot of companies
don't ask themselves what's in it for the user.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also said companies erroneously think their Web sites are
extensions of their marketing and advertising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is different from advertising, which controls
everything the user sees and in what order,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Nielsen was in charge of Web site testing at Palo Alto,
Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. and has written two books on Web
sites. He said Internet users don't want to be entertained on the
Web: They want solid information, and they want it fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is about, `Get in, get out quick,''' Nielsen said.
``People will invest just a few seconds in glancing at your stuff
to see if it's useful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has not fallen on deaf ears at corporations. Most have
revamped their Web sites at least once, making them easier and
faster to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   They have accomplished this by making graphics less elaborate,
developing hyperlink labeling that clearly states what the user
will get once he or she clicks on the link, and developing
personalized Web pages that act like bookmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gold Rush is over to get on the Internet,'' said Mark
Crumpacker, chief executive of San Francisco-based Studio Archetype
Inc., which has designed sites for United Parcel Service Inc.,
BankAmerica Corp. and 3Com Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people want objective reasons to have a Web site,'' he
added. ``A lot of them want to quantify the net effect it's having
on their brand. They're adding a ton more functionality when they
come back a second time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wells Fargo's Web site (www.wellsfargo.com) began as an
on-line business card in 1995, its pages have been revamped
continually since then. Weinstein said the bank has followed three
basic guidelines: Get rid of clutter, keep the message simple and
don't bury information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things used to be buried seven layers down,'' she said. ``The
goal is to get (information) to a higher level so customers can get
things with fewer clicks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Customized pages are another trend in Web site redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Chicago-based United Airlines created a page
called ``Personalize'' that bookmarks other pages on the company's
site (www.ual.com), such as the airline's frequent flier or
reservation pages.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Tony Molinaro said the new ``Personalize'' page
allows customers to instantly call up the pages they use the most
and eliminate the laborious process of clicking through several
screens to get to information.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's ``Personalize'' page was created in response to
customer feedback, Molinaro added. ``Everybody said, `I don't want
to wade through the same screens over and over again,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Flanders, co-author of ``Web Pages That Suck,'' a guide
to developing attractive, user-friendly Internet sites, said Web
sites shouldn't pose obstacles to getting information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond four clicks is bad,'' Flanders said. He likened the
experience to shopping. ``When you go to Wal-Mart, you don't find
barbed wire fences'' around the store.
</P>
<P>
   United hopes the easier access will help the Web site account
for more of the airline's total ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Molinaro said, United expects to sell about $200
million worth of tickets through its Internet site. That's twice as
much as last year, and about 2 percent of United's total ticket
sales, Molinaro added. ``Our goal is to get to 10 percent of total
sales over the next five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many companies are finding more ways to cut costs by
selling their products over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   AMP Inc., a Harrisburg, Pa., company that sells electrical
equipment to the computer, telecommunications and automotive
industries, put its catalog on line in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company said it now spends half as much _ $8
million _ producing traditional paper catalogs, because more
customers are buying AMP's products through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our electronic catalog today is one of the best reaches to our
customers in getting them updated information instantly,'' said
Jerry Kopenhaver, marketing manager of AMP's Web site catalog.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp. estimates that the number of Internet
users in the United States will increase from about 30 million in
1997 to nearly 102 million by 2002. And the percentage of users who
buy on line will grow from 36 percent to about 50 percent. In
addition, IDC estimated that total dollars spent on Internet
transactions will grow from $4.3 billion in 1997 to more than $54
billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports of cost savings from doing business on the Web,
the jury's still out on whether companies are getting good returns
on what they spend to develop their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Business Marketing, a trade magazine in Chicago, estimated that
Web site development costs for small businesses are averaging about
$44,500. Medium and large businesses are paying on average $99,750
and $302,975, respectively, for their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Maddox, editor of trade magazine Interactive Media &AMP;
Marketing, said it's too difficult to figure out whether companies
are getting a good return on their investment because using the Web
as a business tool is such a new concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, nobody really knows what the return is,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies aren't making money. Most are barely breaking
even after having a Web site for a couple of years.''

NEW ENCRYPTION PLAN COULD ALLOW AMERICAN SOFTWARE EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new data scrambling technology probably won't resolve a
long-running dispute between law enforcement officials and the
computer industry. But the plan announced Monday could enable
American firms to export data-protection products worth billions
while easing concerns about national security.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of 13 firms led by Cisco Systems Inc. proposed a
new way to use sophisticated encryption technology to scramble
Internet messages so unauthorized people could not read them. The
system is designed for major corporations that send Internet
messages around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the encryption would occur inside the
``router,'' a computer on the network that sends the information to
its destination. There, another router would decode the message.
Between the two routers, the message would be gibberish, even if it
were intercepted. But at either end, the message would be in the
clear, and easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, a computer networking company based in San Jose, Calif.,
is the world's leading maker of network routers.
</P>
<P>
   The new system would allow the network operator to intercept
messages from individual computers before they were encrypted and
sent over the Internet. If a law enforcement agency suspected
illegal activity, it could obtain a court order forcing the company
to intercept the data before encryption.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government won't allow US firms to export their
top-quality encryption products. The government fears that the
software will fall into the hands of spies and terrorists, who
would then be able to plan crimes without fear of government
wiretaps.

   Federal officials have offered their own compromise. They would
allow exports of the software only if companies gave copies of its
code-cracking keys to some outside agency, which in turn would
provide them to the police. But security experts have denounced
this plan, saying it would be hard to prevent the spare keys from
falling into the hands of hackers or rogue government agents.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's vice president of legal and government affairs Dan
Scheinman said the new approach solves this problem. ``There are no
keys,'' Scheinman said. ``The only people who have access to the
data are the people who have access to the data today, which are
the network managers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet news service Wired News reported that the Federal
Bureau of Investigation sees merit in the plan. ``If the router is
in the possession of a third party such as an Internet service
provider, that would very much meet the needs of law enforcement,''
said FBI spokesman Barry Smith. But Scheinman said that the new
system would mainly be designed for internal corporate
communication, not for individual users connected to Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Software executives are desperate for a solution to the
encryption deadlock. A report issued in April by the Economic
Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, said the U.S. computer
industry will lose $35 billion in revenues over the next five years
as foreign firms provide encryption products.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schnell is vice president of marketing for RSA Data
Security Inc., a leading encryption software company that licenses
its software for use in other firms' products. Schnell would like
to see no restrictions on the export of encryption software. But
the new plan holds out hope of a compromise that would allow at
least some export sales to major corporations and government
agencies abroad. ``We're pragmatists,'' said Schnell. ``Our focus
is in helping our licensees help to sell their products freely on a
worldwide basis. Anything that fosters that goal is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Davidson, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, and a staunch critic of encryption controls, agreed
that the new plan is good news. ``Any opportunity to get more
encryption in the hands of more people is a step forward for
Internet privacy,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that the proposal is only useful for large
organizations with network routers that can handle data encryption.
It does nothing for Internet users who want to encrypt and decrypt
messages on their personal computers. Exports of this kind of
software are still subject to strict control. Davidson asked,
``What about the rest of us?''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's stock Monday closed at $94 1/4, up 1 5/16 on the Nasdaq
stock market.

Danged if technology don't giveth and taketh away 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently decided to join hands with those living in the latter
part of the 20th century and get cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of years I've suffered along with rabbit
ears. But I live in an area where broadcast reception isn't that
good. One of the few channels I can get is a public TV station that
seems to have a long-term contract with a gardening expert who
spends most of his air time explaining how to make homemade
mosquito repellent using soap, lemon juice and chewing tobacco. I
don't have a garden and, over time, the gardening expert has become
more annoying than mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   So, about a week ago, I set off on my great cable adventure.
What happened has very little to do with cable TV or the companies
that provide it. I could have just as easily been trying to contact
an insurance company or any other big business that uses an
automated voice mail system. Instead, what I found reminded me of
the price of technology, the price that doesn't appear on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   On my first attempt to call, I got the company's voice mail
menu. You've run into them several times a week yourself, so I
won't spend much time describing it. You are asked a series of
questions, and you're supposed to respond by pressing one of the
keys on your telephone's touchpad. I follow directions OK, and I
finally reached a question that asked me to enter my home telephone
number. I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a valid number, please enter it again,'' the
recorded voice told me. I did, figuring that I had misdialed. ``I'm
sorry, that is not a valid number. Please hold for a
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   I held through two country songs and what seemed to be an
orchestral treatment of the Beatles' ``Norwegian Wood.'' Finally,
the music stopped. By now, I was in one of my obsessive moods. I
didn't much care about cable TV, I just wanted to complain to a
human. But, instead of a real live human, I heard a recorded voice
again: ``Please enter your home telephone number.'' Like a fool, I
did. And, like a predictable machine, the recorded voice said:
``That is not a valid number.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, because I am a certified TechnoBuddy, I came up with the
perfect answer for fooling the machine. I hung up, called again,
and _ when asked to enter my home telephone number _ I entered
someone else's number and figured I could explain my subterfuge
when I finally reached a human. Danged if it didn't work. There was
no ``This is not a valid number'' message. Instead, I worked my way
_ happy in the way that only the gainfully dishonest can be _
through the menu, all the way to the questions about whether I
wanted new service, or to change my existing service.
</P>
<P>
   Just about then, the recording asked me, and I swear it is true,
to ``enter your home number.''
</P>
<P>
   I eventually got cable TV service. But the topic of this sermon
is technology, not cable TV. My experience with the voice menu
system reminded me of an old truth: For everything that technology
gives us, it also takes something away.
</P>
<P>
   I say old truth because it stretches back as far into history as
the invention of the written language. Up until that time, it was
common to create long, epic poems that were memorized and told
aloud. But that skill gradually faded away as writing let us record
the information and save our memories. That's just one example. You
can come up with dozens of examples of your own. For instance,
until recorded music was common, families would sit around the
piano and sing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that writing has eliminated memorizing poems. And
people still sing at home. But both skills have withered because a
new technology forced out an old one. It would be difficult to be
against recorded music or the written language. But it is
important, I think, to understand that it does happen.
</P>
<P>
   We _ as humans and especially as Americans _ spend a lot of time
glorifying technology. And sometimes the glory is well earned. But
we also need to remember the price tag. And, in the case of the
company that uses a high-tech voice messaging menu instead of
humans to deal with customers, the price tag can be really high.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that saved the cable company from losing a
customer was a fellow in overalls who knows a lot about homemade
mosquito repellent.

Big wedding generates news, gossip, photos 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good bet that the new wife of James Brolin, aka Barbra
Streisand, will probably not change her name. For the uninformed,
the celebrated singer and actress, wearing (what else?) a Donna
Karan wedding dress, tied the knot last week with longtime
boyfriend Brolin.
</P>
<P>
   If, by chance, your invitation got lost in the mail or your
helicopter was in the shop that day, you can find plenty of Barbra
wedding news and info on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine has the exclusive story and pictures of the big
day at http://www.pathfinder.com/people/sp/streisand/index.html.
The site is short on photos, but more are scheduled to come soon,
with the approval of the Brolins themselves. But in the meantime,
you can read a blow-by-blow, minute-by-minute account of who was
there, what they wore and what they ate (appetizers included sushi,
pizza, and roasted small potatoes filled with caviar, creme fraiche
and dill). The People site is just filled with juicy gossip, info
and tidbits that both the rabid fans and the merely curious will
adore.
</P>
<P>
   But will the couple live happily ever after? People has set up
message boards for visitors to voice their opinions. Fans of the
couple can also see if the couple's astrological signs are
compatible (Streisand's a Tauras, Brolin's a Capricorn) at
http://astrozine.com/preview002/feature4.html.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's wedding is also a time to reconsider the star's life
and career. Fans of the singer can check out Barbra Streisand.com
(http://www.barbra-streisand.com) The site is primarily devoted to
her latest CD, ``Higher Ground'' but does include some comments
from Barbra herself as well as a place to sign up to get the latest
Streisand dish. It's a little bit out of date, but it's the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are an astonishing number of fan pages devoted to creative
and interesting tributes to Barbra. The Streisand Myths and
Misinformation page
(http://acs2.bu.edu:8001/(tilde)pimentel/myths.html) is devoted to
debunking the many myths surrounding the singer. From here we can
learn that Barbra doesn't have an official fan club or an e-mail
address _ and no, she's never had her nose fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known Barbra fan site, which turns up on nearly
every Web page devoted to her, is the Barbra Streisand FAQ
(frequently asked questions) at
http://members.aol.com/markjayeye/bjsfaq. This is an amazingly
complete listing of Streisand's professional life and works. There
are no pictures, but the information here is exhaustive. Another
America Online member has another page devoted to Streisand's
musical career at http://members.aol.com/barbramusc/index.html with
some great vintage black and white photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some people who take Streisand very
seriously, there are others who don't mind having a little fun with
the icon. Mr. Showbiz has a fun site at
http://www.mrshowbiz.com/games/linked/hi/153.html that shows
visitors all the men (and there are quite a few) with whom Barbra
has spent time over the years. Memo to James Brolin: This is one
Barbra site you might just want to skip.

Tech Report: Laptop can accept new DVD disc 
By Michael E. Kanell  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you are selling widgets, you just want to sell a
bunch of them with a healthy profit margin. But if you are pushing
a format, then just selling 10 times more units than last year may
not be enough. You want it to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As the premiere issue of Business 2.0 puts it, in discussing the
emerging rules of the new economy, ``value rises exponentially with
market share'' _ at least for products that help establish a
platform or a standard. ``The more plentiful they become, the more
essential each individual unit is, a striking exception to the
economic rule that value comes from scarcity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or to think of it from the other side: If only one person owns a
fax machine, how much is it worth?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of DVD _ the digital versatile disc _ the format
doesn't completely have to replace the compact disc, which was the
first digital medium for pop culture, but it has to be in all the
places that people go for entertainment. For DVD to truly become a
roaring success, it must become the way people watch movies on
television and on computers, at home, in airports and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the challenge is like that faced by Apple Computer.
The Macintosh computer might be, as founder Steve Jobs once put it,
``insanely great,'' but it cannot survive unless a potential
purchaser knows there is plenty of Mac-friendly software and CD
games on the shelves. Apple has the advantage of already having a
large and largely loyal customer base, along with the disadvantage
of competing against the marketing machines of Microsoft, Intel and
IBM. Moreover, Mac competitors can argue that their format is as
good or better.
</P>
<P>
   DVD starts from nothing. Even worse, most consumers already own
CD players. But DVD has an inherent and critical advantage over
CDs: They can hold so much more than a CD. For instance, an entire
movie can fit on a single DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Another disadvantage Macintosh has faced is in pricing _ many
buyers will simply not pay a premium just to own an Apple. DVD too
has been more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But little by little, the manufacturers are trying to overcome
all these obstacles. More and more movie titles are available on
DVD. And DVD players will mostly be ``backward compatible'' _ that
is, capable of playing the millions of CDs that consumers have
already sunk money into. And the technology is increasingly moving
into the corners _ becoming as mobile as we increasingly expect
technology to be.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dell Computer Corp. has recently released notebook
personal computers with optional DVD drives. With that $299 option,
the Inspiron 3000 and 3200 notebooks can play full-motion video,
Dell says. Those notebooks also come with a device that lets users
play digital versatile discs and watch on their television. The
entry level version costs $2,300, including the DVD.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the Dell Inspiron, visit the company
Web site (http://www.dell.com/products/notebook/inspiron) or call
the company, 1-800-388-8542.
</P>
<P>
   True compressions
</P>
<P>
   With all the talk about cable modems, digital subscriber lines
and the like, if you are stuck at home downloading through your
28.8k bps modem, you may be forgiven for thinking that the
revolution has passed you by. No way, you sigh, that you can have
live video or piercing audio until you invest in one of those
high-priced, cutting-edge technologies for connecting to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but just perhaps you are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   RealPlayer 5.0 from RealNetworks uses data compression to let a
virtual flood of data pour through that skinny little pipeline that
runs to your PC. Reviewers writing in the summer edition of Windows
Magazine say the software gives you a pretty good shot at watching
live events, videos and hearing CD-quality music from sites like
C-SPAN, Sports Illustrated and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a free download of the basic plug-in. For RealPlayer
Plus, it's $30. For more information, visit the Web site
(http://www.real.com).
</P>
<P>
   Better mail
</P>
<P>
   E-mail for most of us is just a tool. You want it to work, and
you probably don't care if it's super-durable, extraordinarily easy
to handle or stunningly reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, you might want more from your tools if your work
_ or even your life _ depends on them. E-mail is essential to many
professionals. And even others who use e-mail for personal
messaging may be willing to pay a bit to have efficient and
reliable e-mail software. Perhaps Eudora Pro Email 4.0 from
Qualcomm is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In its summer roundup, Windows Magazine recommends 4.0 as a
feature-rich way to organize and use e-mail. Eudora's lesser
offerings are available free, but 4.0 includes a variety of
displays and a task-bar that makes for swift and productive use.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro Email 4.0 costs $59. For more information, call
Qualcomm at 1-800-238-3672 (1-800-2-EUDORA) or visit the Web site
at http://www.eudora.com.

Money tips can make for a better trip 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's say you and your family are heading off on a dream
vacation next week. After years of excuses, you've decided to spend
what a good used Toyota would cost to go to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   You've made flight and hotel reservations and gotten over your
personal reservations about traveling to any spot on the globe
where snails are eaten. But now you need a little last-minute help.
After all, you'll be dealing with languages other than Southern
American and currencies you've never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the World Wide Web can come in handy. You'll find
several sites that can cushion the culture shock of an overseas
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the problem of money. Figuring out conversion
rates can help you judge whether you're getting a good deal (stay
away from money-changer booths at airports) and also let you start
adjusting mentally for shopping trips. You'll want to have a firm
idea whether that 487-franc dinner in France is a bargain or
whether you'd be better off buying a loaf of bread and some cheese.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best currency converters on the Web is the Universal
Currency Converter at http://www.xe.net/currency/. Unlike using a
chart you've found in a newspaper or even on the Web, this
converter will do the math for you. Simply enter the amount of
money and the currency on one side of the chart, and select the
currency you'd like it converted to on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Let's use that 487-franc dinner as an example. You'd type in 487
in the left-hand box and select French francs, then select U.S.
dollars in the right-hand box. Press the button called Perform
Currency Conversion and _ in just a second or two _ you'll find the
tab for that meal is $79.89 (based on the currency exchange rate on
the day I tried this site).
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about this converter is that it is amazingly
complete. Most world currencies are available. And, you can set the
page, if you'd like, to use languages other than English. If you're
really traveling to some exotic locations, you'll be able to use
the full version of this page (with 180 different currencies) at
http://www.xe.net/currency
</P>
<P>
   /full/. But, if the currencies you need are in the main page,
you'll find it is easier to work with since you won't have so many
possible currencies to plow through.
</P>
<P>
   Since the really good sites on the Web can get overcrowded and
slow, let's look at one more currency converter before moving on.
It's called Homer: Currency Conversion and can be found at
http://www.rmg-c.se/rmg
</P>
<P>
   /currency.htm. This site works much like the first one, so you
don't need additional instructions, just some spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's tackle the language problem. If you're lucky, you
won't need to be fluent in the language of the country you plan to
visit. Especially in Europe, the natives are likely to have a
better command of English than you'd expect. But you'll want to
brush up a bit, just to show you're not the typical ugly American
who firmly believes that if you talk loud enough, they'll
understand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best places on the Web to brush up on languages _
including some you'd expect, such as French, Italian and German,
and some you wouldn't, like Farsi, Finnish and Tagalog _ is at the
excellent Languages for Travellers site at
http://www.travlang.com/languages/. Don't expect to do the few
simple exercises and then be able to get a job as a translator.
But, if you pay attention, you'll be able to order dinner, find a
bathroom and book a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   If your language needs are more extensive, you'll want to check
out a page full of links to literally hundreds of Web pages
offering everything from instant translations, to dictionaries, to
explanations of the fine points of grammar. It is, logically
enough, called Language and Translation Links and is located at
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/3137/index.html.

New desktop computer designed to turn heads 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the iMac's iridescent blue gumdrop body be the candy that
at last lures new users to the Mac platform?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Apple Computer is hoping with the August release of
its latest consumer desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   While it has some weaknesses, the iMac looks like Apple
Computer's best chance in years to expand its market share.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the iMac was designed to draw people's attention. Its
body, like the original Mac's, includes a monitor. This one,
though, is 15 inches and displays color.
</P>
<P>
   Enough power
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the iMac's microprocessor, the chip that controls
most functions of the computer, is 233 megahertz. While not the
latest that Apple Computer offers, it's pretty darn powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac also includes a 56k bps modem, 32 megabytes of RAM, a
CD-ROM drive and a 4.6 gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   You get all this for $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   That's the best deal Apple Computer has ever offered and is
competitive with the lower end of the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, budget computer maker Micro Express offers a
computer similar to the iMac for $1,349. There are less expensive
PCs, but they have slower microprocessors and fewer features than
the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the iMac's design is to offer novice users an
all-in-one design that lets them do most things without ever
opening the hood of their computer. The key markets intended for
the iMac are the home and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, the iMac has one serious, potentially debilitating
drawback. It's missing an internal floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the floppy drive is on the way out, it
remains today the best and least expensive way to copy and move
files.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing easier than copying a homework assignment or a
document onto a floppy and sticking it in the pocket of your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   You can add an external floppy or Zip drive, but that will add
an extra $200 to the cost of buying the iMac, which lessens its
appeal as a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple says the iMac will provide fast and easy use of the
Internet, it may be exaggerating. Its 56k modem is the fastest
modem for consumer use, but 56k modems often operate at lower
speeds than the theoretical limit of 53k bps.
</P>
<P>
   And both 33k and 56k modems are too slow for enjoyable use of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most PCs offer 56k modems and buyers may be pleased with
the new iMac.

 SUNNYVALE: consumer devices.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft, potentially, has the most to lose from such a change
since it would make the operating system incidental to the power
and control wielded by a networked computer in a distributed
system. For that reason, Microsoft would hold no obvious advantage
over competitors in marketing a distributed computing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its competitors and computer scientists, who view
distributed computing as the antithesis of an operating system,
Microsoft prefers to think of it as the operating system of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper on its Millennium product, a Microsoft
research team wrote: ``We argue that advances in hardware and
networking technology enable a new kind of operating system to
support tomorrow's applications. Such an operating system would
raise the level of abstraction for developers and users, so that
individual computers, file systems and networks become unimportant
to most computations in the same way that processor registers, disk
sectors, and physical pages are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Processor registers, disk sectors and physical pages are all
elements of hardware that today are controlled by an operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch to all of this: The technology at the heart
of this evolution is the network, and all the assumptions about the
future of distributed computing are based on the belief that
computer networks will be ubiquitous _ and, in most cases,
wireless.
</P>
<P>
   On a large scale, such networks are now being deployed by
cellular telephone companies and by computer industry groups
working on new standards for wireless office networks. Once these
technologies are available to consumers, beginning later this year,
the stage will be set for a fundamental change in personal
computing.
</P>
<P>
   It is the network, which can range in size from a group of
linked household devices to the global Internet, that is the
foundation upon which the new distributed computing will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of distributed computing is the ability to divide a
large set of computer instructions into multiple small parts, each
of which is processed by a different machine within a network of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, each generation of computers _ mainframes,
minicomputers and personal computers _ has been built on a
foundation of centralized control wielded by an operating system, a
single, monolithic program that performs the combined role of a
traffic cop, butler and secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent proliferation of high-speed and wireless networks
and the melding of computing and telecommunications technologies
driven by the Internet has encouraged developers to proceed on the
assumption that every home, car and other personal environment will
eventually be part of _ and empowered by _ a universal network. For
that reason, it is sometimes known as ``ubiquitous computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributed computing foresees a world in which millions of
small programs, called objects, seamlessly flit back and forth
between tens of thousands of devices that have been enabled to
recognize and be recognized by the network.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a world of cars equipped with distributed
computing devices linked by a wireless network, each car would be
delivering and receiving information from every other car, or to
and from aggregated traffic reports, along the route being driven.
This kind of networking could significantly reduce traffic
congestion by alerting drivers to accidents, congestion and weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, the traditional operating system, say advocates
of distributed computing, becomes an ungainly encumbrance, akin to
asking a baton-wielding maestro to conduct a jam session of jazz
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in such a distributed world, the boundary lines
between individual computers blur as thousands or even millions of
computers are harnessed to particular tasks as exotic as predicting
the weather or as mundane as controlling the heating and lighting
in a building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is very clear,'' said William Joy, a co-founder of
Sun Microsystems and the chief designer of Jini. ``We are moving
toward a world in which it will be possible to move software codes
that act as our personal agents between many different computers in
a global network.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of distributed computing envision a computerized world
in which each person will be surrounded by a web of hundreds of
small computers embedded in everything from smart cameras, to
pagers, to cell phones and hand-held computers that will exchange
messages and data without the intervention of a centralized
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Jini is scheduled to be publicly described for the first
time on Wednesday on Sun's Web site. It will be marketed in
September under the name Java Tone, an analogy to the ubiquitous
nature of the telephone dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   Sun says it is now working with more than 30 companies, ranging
from Federal Express Corp. to the giant software maker Computer
Associates, to develop Java Tone products.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Joy, who co-founded Sun after dropping out
of graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, has
holed up in a small laboratory in the mountains of Colorado where
he has been attempting to reinvent modern computing by exploiting
the concepts of distributed computing.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Joy's small group of researchers decided to put
into effect the ideas of David Gelernter, a computer scientist and
author from Yale University who invented a computing language
called Linda that was intended to enable the writing of programs
that could utilize the power of many computers simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter's original vision was a vast distributed computer to
simulate much of the surrounding social and physical world. He
called his vision ``Mirror Worlds'' and described it in a 1992 book
by that name (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``The guts of an operating system have always been an ensemble
of small programs, but that aspect has always been suppressed in
favor of the monolithic desktop,'' Gelernter said. ``Sun is
breaking the news to the user that an ensemble is a simple and
natural and straightforward computing model.''

<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ For more than 25 years, computer scientists
have been working to develop a technology known as distributed
computing that would put the processing power of a supercomputer in
the hands of average users.
</P>
<P>
   For scientists and others who need enormous computing power,
distributed computing holds out the promise of increasing the power
of a standard laptop exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   But for the average consumer, it will eventually produce smart
gadgets such as cars that avoid traffic jams and phones that know
not just the telephone number of every listed person in the United
States but their addresses, ZIP codes and the names of their family
members.
</P>
<P>
   In short, distributed computing promises to endow consumer
appliances _ from telephones, televisions and stereos to kitchen
appliances and cars _ with an infusion of borrowed intelligence by
connecting them, with or without wires, to a computer network.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sun Microsystems will unveil the first consumer
version of this technology, a product called Jini, which uses Sun's
Java programming language to harness the power of potentially
millions of computers, ranging from giant mainframes to tiny
palm-sized devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have all the ingredients to build a distributed
computing fabric which approaches science fiction,'' said David
Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer scientist who
pioneered distributed computing in 1971. ``You will be able to sit
with your laptop, and it will be able to reach out across the
network. And for the moments you need the power, it will become the
largest supercomputer in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It could also shift the balance of power in the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when worried governments on three continents are
struggling to restrain Microsoft Corp.'s iron grip on computing and
its ambitions on the Internet, distributed computing could level
the playing field by shifting growth in high-technology industries
to the millions of consumer appliances that increasingly contain
powerful embedded processors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft itself is known to be working on a system
similar to Jini, known as Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun, among Microsoft's fiercest competitors, has an early
advantage in this race because of the nature of its Java
programming language, which is designed to move chunks of computer
code from machine to machine. Jini uses this ability in ways that
allow computers and other devices to cooperate, sometimes by
sharing instructions or information, sometimes by actually dividing
a program into parts and spreading the computation work across
several computers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Java has already achieved widespread distribution _
thanks, in part, to Microsoft, which ships it with its Internet
Explorer browser for navigating the World Wide Web and with Windows
98. Although Sun is suing Microsoft for making unauthorized changes
to Java, the Microsoft version of the language will support Jini.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to Sun's plans, over the next 18 months, a
number of companies that make computer hardware and consumer
gadgets will begin incorporating Jini, allowing each of these
devices to talk with each other and to share processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first of these will be Quantum Corp., a disk-drive
maker based in Milpitas, Calif., that intends to commercialize the
Jini technology to make drives that have built-in office network
connections. Today, such connections are controlled by the
operating system and are difficult to configure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely going to be a dramatic leap in ease of
use,'' said Paul Borrill, vice president and chief architect at
Quantum.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, advocates of distributed computing
predict, today's desktop computer will evolve from a
self-sufficient machine that must hold all the memory, storage and
processing power it needs for any job into a social machine that
will automatically interact not only with other computers but also
with myriad consumer devices.

AT MACWORLD, APPLE TURNS OUT NEW PRODUCTS AND PLENTY OF PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The relatively sparse crowds and smaller exhibit
booths at last week's Macworld trade show in New York were tangible
evidence of the decline of Apple Computer in recent years. Visitors
to the show typically found that promises almost outnumbered actual
products. But while dazzling new products were scarce at Macworld,
no doubt many people were just as happy to take home some optimism
about the future of Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the show was an aqua and white beach ball of
a computer called the iMac. The iMac, which is the computer
equivalent of a new Volkswagen Beetle, was announced more than two
months ago and will not reach stores for another month.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 prototypes of the iMac (the ``I'' stands for
Internet) were dispersed around the show floor, where one of the
machine's admirers was Apple's former chief executive, John
Sculley. Wearing baggy corduroys and carrying a backpack, Sculley
was able to stroll largely unnoticed through the exhibits on the
show floor.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sculley who orchestrated the dismissal of Apple's
co-founder, Steve Jobs, more than a decade ago, and who was in turn
dismissed in what became a revolving door for Apple bosses that
ultimately revolved back to Jobs, who now holds the title interim
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the only real surprise of the conference, Jobs made an
unexpected appearance at Macworld to deliver the keynote address.
During his two-hour presentation, he noted that it was almost
exactly a year ago that he rejoined the company. ``When I came a
year ago, all I heard was that Apple was dying,'' Jobs said. ``A
lot of people thought Apple was in a death spiral, which I think
there was some truth to.''
</P>
<P>
   Few experts expect Apple to climb back to its old heights, but
at least it has a chance now to stanch the 10 percent annual
defection rate from its current base of Macintosh users. Jobs
conceded that Apple had ignored its individual and educational
customers for several years, but now, based on hopes for the new
consumer-friendly iMac computer, Jobs said: ``We expect to see some
growth in the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Apple is also developing a less expensive Powerbook for
consumers and students, but it will not be ready until sometime
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the computing world's attention has been on
Windows 98, but Apple's operating system is also scheduled for an
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 8.5, code-named Allegro and due this September, was given
a brief and limited demonstration at the show. Jobs and his
marketing chief, Phil Schiller, described Allegro as the most
significant upgrade to the Macintosh operating system in years,
even more significant than the jump from System 7 to System 8.
</P>
<P>
   Their enthusiasm for Mac OS 8.5 is evidently based on more than
just the two new features they selected to show to the audience: an
impressive new engine for finding information on the computer's
hard disk and on the Internet, and a feature that allows rapid
transfers of large multimedia files over computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The file transfer demonstration, involving a 150-megabyte Adobe
Photoshop file, was a dud. In a staged demonstration, an Apple
computer running Mac OS 8.5 froze as it attempted to pass the file
to another Apple computer, while a Compaq computer running Windows
NT 4.0 easily transferred the same file to a Dell machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the second try, the Apple computers beat the Windows NT
machines by about four seconds. (As one might expect, there were no
oohs and aahs from the audience.)
</P>
<P>
   Far more impressive was the demonstration of Mac OS 8.5's
information searching feature, called Sherlock, which replaces the
feeble file-finding utility in the current Mac operating system.
Instead of searching for file names, Sherlock allows users to
search for content inside documents, using natural-language
queries. Files meeting the search criteria are then ranked by
relevance _ and here's the cool part that sets it apart from even
the best Web search engines _ the computer will analyze the
document and create a brief synopsis of the file's contents, not
just the first few lines of text. The new search engine can also
scan the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least a year before Apple's next major operating
system version (Mac OS X) is made available to the public, Schiller
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until recently, Macintosh users were accustomed to having new
features and technologies well ahead of their Windows counterparts.
But at this year's show, Mac users seemed pleased with promises for
a broad array of products that showed up first in Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Among the products and programs coming to the Mac in months
ahead are the popular ``Tomb Raider'' games that star the virtual
celebrity Lara Croft, coming in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The disk-based version of the Encyclopedia Britannica will soon
be ready for the Mac from Broderbund. Disney Online was given an
unusually large part of the keynote to demonstrate a Macintosh
prototype of its popular Blast web site for children
(www.disneyblast.com/mac) Peripheral products based on the
Universal Serial Bus connection scheme will soon be appearing for
Macintosh computers. Windows-based PC's have been equipped with USB
ports for more than a year, but in this case the Mac has not been
at a disadvantage because so few USB peripherals have reached the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest was demonstrating a prototype of its one-megabyte Sparq
removable cartridge drive for Macintoshes, which has been popular
on Windows machines. The Palm Computing division of the 3COM Corp.
promised to deliver better versions of its Palm III organizer for
the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Microsoft's Macintosh development group vowed that
never again will Microsoft treat the Macintosh as a second-class
citizen by simply retooling Windows programs to run on the Mac OS.
Instead, he said, the group will have a battle cry of ``first and
only on the Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of all these promises is yet to be seen. But compared
to where the Mac was a year ago, promises are encouraging.

CLINTON PROPOSES LIMITING LIABILITY FOR YEAR 2000 COMPUTER 
SOLUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Addressing the potential computer crisis in 2000
for the first time, President Clinton said on Tuesday that he would
propose legislation to limit the liability of companies that share
data about solutions if the information proves faulty.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States would contribute $12 million to a
World Bank program to help developing nations deal with the
potential computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a speech before the National Academy of Sciences,
warned of ``gaping holes'' in efforts by government and private
industry to prepare their computer systems for the end of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the nation's computers into compliance is one of the
greatest technological challenges in history, the president said.
Failure, he added, will result in ``a series of shutdowns,
inaccurate data, faulty calculations'' that could affect government
functions from the payment of Medicare claims to control of the
nation's air traffic system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there was a ``pressing need for action'' at all
levels of government and in the private sector to deal with the
so-called millennium bug, which prevents computers from recognizing
the beginning of a new century. Most older computers are programmed
with two digits for the year in the date field and will not
automatically recognize ``00'' as 2000. They may think it is 1900,
with potentially catastrophic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The current official estimate of the cost of bringing the
federal government's computers into compliance is $6 billion, but
most experts consider that figure far too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems unbelievable, but it's only 535 days from now, at the
stroke of midnight, when we will usher in a new year, a new
century, a new millennium,'' the president said. ``It is fitting,
if more than a little ironic, that this same stroke of midnight
will pose a sharp and signal test of whether we have prepared
ourselves for the challenges of the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Good Samaritan'' legislation Clinton said he would submit
to Congress is intended to deal with the fear of many companies
that they will face expensive lawsuits if they provide information
about their computers' year 2000 compliance that proves wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is still circulating in draft form, would not
relieve companies of liability for failures of hardware or software
intended to address year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Already there is a burgeoning legal specialty of year 2000
liability litigation that is discouraging companies from freely
sharing data, according to Michael Aisenberg, a Washington lawyer
working with the administration on the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of litigation is already putting a chill on
technology initiators, who are worried they'll be sued if their
year 2000 disclosures turn out to be wrong or don't work,''
Aisenberg said. He said that granting liability relief for
well-intentioned data sharing has bipartisan support on Capitol
Hill, but could face stiff opposition from the product liability
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the potential legal costs arising from year 2000
problems range as high as $1 trillion, Aisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other administration officials expressed optimism
that the United States can bring its ``mission critical'' computer
systems into compliance before the ball drops in Times Square next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made it clear to every member of my Cabinet that the
American people have a right to expect uninterrupted service from
government, and I expect them to deliver,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has a markedly more pessimistic view of the federal
government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As of last month, only about 40 percent of the 7,336
most-critical government computer systems were prepared for
December 31, 1999, according to the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless progress improves dramatically,'' the agency declared
in a report issued June 10, ``a substantial number of
mission-critical systems will not be year 2000 compliant in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., has studied the problem for the
past several years and gives the federal government a failing grade
for its progress so far.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that he has been pressing Clinton to
personally address the millennium bug as a means of concentrating
the minds of federal bureaucrats. ``I think this is a major step
here,'' Horn said. ``The denial is over. They hadn't done anything
up to now to share with the American people what this problem is
all about. Now they have to keep at it and not assume the nation
heard it because he gave one speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Some federal agencies are better prepared for next year's turn
of the calendar than others, administration and congressional
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those relatively well along in their efforts are the
Social Security Administration, the Veterans' Administration, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But other agencies are ``substantially challenged,'' according
to John Koskinen, the administration's year 2000 czar.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are the Departments of Defense, Health and Human
Services, Education, Transportation, Energy, Education and the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said that the United States is further along than 90
percent of nations and that many countries have failed to take even
preliminary steps toward compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great risks internationally,'' he said. If the
Singapore stock exchange fails to open on Monday, Jan. 3, 2000, for
example, the repercussions will be felt throughout the global
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows,'' Koskinen said, ``what the end of next year
will look like.''

 Net Heavies Tell FTC How To Slam Spam  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of Internet heavyweights, led by America Online and
AT&AMP;T, has submitted a report to the Federal Trade Commission urging
a major crackdown on unsolicited junk e-mail, or ``spam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ad-Hoc Working Group on Unsolicited Commercial Email, which
was formed at the request of the FTC a year ago to come up ways to
put a lid on spam, is proposing that federal and state regulators
be given the authority to prosecute spammers who ``forge'' e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial e-mailers sometimes ``forge'' their return addresses
_ making it look as if the message came from AOL or other popular
online services _ to trick consumers into opening their mail. Many
of these messages promote get-rich-quick schemes, pyramid
operations and sex sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that different from old-fashioned junk mail that looks
like it's from the government or might contain a check. But unlike
junk mail sent through the post office, e-mail spammers can send
out millions of pieces at virtually no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This form of elusive behavior is costing everyone _ the
system, individual consumers _ a great deal of money and frustrates
consumers' ability to limit messages they don't want,'' said
Deirdre Mulligan, staff counsel of the Center for Democracy and
Technology in Washington, D.C., and principal writer of the 32-page
report.
</P>
<P>
   The rampant use of forged addresses and e-mail containing
fraudulent material prompted the FTC to request a report from
industry leaders last summer. The ad hoc group of 40 companies and
organizations also includes IBM, Microsoft, MCI, the American Civil
Liberties Union and the Direct Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our core concern is with e-mail that has deceptive content,''
FTC attorney John Rothchild said. ``Anything that allows companies
to steal money from unsuspecting consumers through scams _ whether
by direct mail or e-mail _ is a major concern to us. There are a
large number of old-fashioned pyramid schemes online that are
camouflaged as business opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothchild said the five-person FTC is studying the report and
will comment soon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving states the ability to prosecute spammers,
the report recommends that Internet service providers make
widespread use of filtering software to weed out junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These measures could significantly reduce the volume of spam
on the Internet,'' said Richard Buchband, general counsel of Juno
Online Services LP, a provider of free e-mail. ``Until now, the
most effective way to stop spammers was by suing them.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Juno, which boasts 5.4 million users, has sued
eight junk mailers since 1997 to bar them from hawking
get-rich-quick schemes on its e-mail service or from forging Juno
e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Juno, AOL and others have successfully sued spammers
off their sites, the strategy is costly and doesn't shield
consumers from the scores of online mass marketers who aren't taken
to court, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 billion pieces of junk e-mail a year are
clogging up Internet pathways and individuals' e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting outcry among consumers has prompted several pieces
of anti-spamming legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Netizens Protection Act, sponsored by Representative
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., would amend the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act of 1991, which bans unsolicited junk faxes, to also
regulate junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate unanimously passed a provision of the
Consumer Antislamming Act, co-authored by Senator Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., that would fine junk e-mailers up to $15,000 if
they mask their identities with forged addresses. The bill
prohibits the unauthorized switching of telephone service providers
for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ad hoc group's report encourages Internet service providers
and Net surfers to employ a combination of litigation and software
filters for ``temporary relief from (junk) e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But it admits that isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite some service providers' best efforts to litigate
(spam) off the Internet, some senders are quick to target other
service providers when faced with a judgment forbidding them from
targeting a specific provider,'' the report stated.

FTC URGES CONSUMERS TO WATCH OUT FOR `DIRTY DOZEN' E-MAIL SCHEMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By NICOLE TSONG   
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After examining over 250,000 e-mails from around
the nation, the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday warned e-mail
users about the 12 most common fraudulent get-rich schemes being
touted by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the ``dirty dozen'' e-mails bear a close resemblance
to unsolicited offers already conveyed by telephone and regular
Postal Service mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 e-mail examples were collected at an FTC e-mail address
created to study and help prevent e-mail fraud. The address,
uceftc.gov, receives 1,000 to 1,500 e-mails daily.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said fraudulent e-mail is easy and inexpensive to send
_ and e-mail addresses are accessible for anyone who has access to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   David Medine, associate FTC director, said it's easy for senders
of unsolicited e-mail to harvest e-mail addresses because ``anytime
you put your address out there on the Internet, there are automated
programs capturing those e-mail addresses and adding them to a
list.''
</P>
<P>
   The jargon of cyberspace identifies unsolicited e-mail as
``spam.'' Its senders are ``spammers.'' Using the address lists,
spammers solicit by sending spam.
</P>
<P>
   The schemes are not new, Bernstein added, and many of them are
simply modified for the new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many spammers who make deceptive claims in their e-mail simply
imitate what they see others doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the FTC's ``dirty dozen,'' listed in order of
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business opportunities: They offer a lot of money for a small
amount of time and money that are usually too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making money by sending bulk e-mail: They offer money for
simply e-mailing a lot of people, but bulk e-mail violates e-mail
service rules for most Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chain letters: Chain letters generally claim to make money
simply by sending the letter to a certain number of people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work-at-home: Two popular versions for making money from the
comfort of home include envelope stuffing and craft assembly, but
``nobody will really pay you for stuffing envelopes, and craft
assembly promoters usually refuse to buy the crafts, claiming the
work does not meet their `quality standards,''' Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health and diet: Bogus cures offered via e-mail, guaranteed to
cure all ills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Currency trading: These deals offer the chance to ``make
unlimited profits exchanging money on world currency markets,''
Bernstein warned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get something free: Computer or phone card offers are common
in this scam. The consumer is urged to sign up for membership fees
but then receives nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investment opportunities: The senders suggest they have inside
financial information or they promote high rates of return with no
risk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Descrambler kits to allow you to receive cable TV signals
without paying subscription fees. The kits generally do not work,
and stealing cable signals is against the law, Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guaranteed loans or credit: Promoters may offer credit cards,
regardless of credit history for a fee, or offer home-equity loans
that turn out to be lists of lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Credit repair: For a fee, the sender offers to clear up a bad
credit record.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vacation prize promotions: Deluxe vacations for a cheap price
which never turn out to be the luxury vacation touted by the
advertisement.

FTC WANTS TO STAMP OUT SPAM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DANIELLE SHOOK  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Want to make some money? Just send $20 for a list
of people you can e-mail and watch the money roll in. Or at least,
that's what spammers want you to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Spam is unsolicited commercial electronic mail, and it is sent
to almost anyone who has an e-mail account.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's annoying, it slows down the e-mail system, and a lot of
it is fraudulent,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Bureau of
Consumer Protection for the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Spam _ sent in bulk to millions of e-mail recipients at a time _
usually takes the form of business opportunity offers, chain
letters and work-at-home schemes that offer infinite wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC released a list Tuesday of the twelve most common spams.
The commission compiled the list after an investigation that began
last fall. Using the FTC World Wide Web site and ``word of mouth''
advertisng on the Internet, the FTC encouraged people to send their
unwanted, unsolicited commercial e-mail to a special electronic
mailbox (uce(at)ftc.gov).
</P>
<P>
   The FTC built a searchable database so it could study the mail
and identify possible targets for law enforcement actions. Thus
far, the commission has brought five actions against spamming
companies, one of them resulting in a $2 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The database has also prevented other companies from getting
into trouble. FTC officials believed some of the spammers were
imitating others without realizing their actions might violate
state and federal laws prohibiting deceptive advertising claims in
all media, including e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC sent letters to more than 1,000 spammers identified
through the database informing them of the law and noting their
actions were being watched by law enforcement. Some companies
expressed appreciation to the FTC for sending the letters before
they got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, consumers had forwarded more than 250,000
pieces of spam to the FTC Web site, and continue to do so at a rate
of between 1,000 and 1,500 spams per day.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC says they will continue to monitor the spam that they
receive for use in law enforcement and consumer education.

POPULAR E-MAIL SCAMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are some of the scams the Federal Trade
Commission has encountered most often:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Business Opportunities _ Usually promise a lot of income for a
small investment of time and money. Some are actually old-fashioned
pyramid schemes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Bulk E-Mailings _ Offer lists of e-mail addresses or software to
allow you to make the mailings. What they don't mention is that the
lists are of poor quality, sending bulk e-mail violates the terms
of service of most Internet service providers, and several states
have laws regulating the sending of bulk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Chain Letters _ Electronic versions of the old-fashioned chain
letters. They are as illegal as the old-fashioned paper versions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Work-at-Home Schemes _ Two popular versions are
envelope-stuffing and craft assembly. However, nobody will really
pay you for stuffing envelopes, and craft assembly promoters
usually refuse to buy crafts, claiming the work does not meet their
``quality standards.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Health And Diet Scams _ Offer ``scientific breakthroughs,''
``miraculous cures,'' ``exclusive products,'' ``secret formulas,''
and ``ancient ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Get Something Free _ After paying a membership fee, consumers
learn that they don't quality for the ``free'' gift until they
recruit other ``members.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Cable Descrambler Kits _ Offers for sale a kit that lets you
receive cable without paying subscription fees. Two problems: the
kits usually don't work and stealing cable service is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Credit Repair Scams _ For an up-front fee, they offer to clear
up a bad credit record for a charge or show you how to get an
Employer Identification Number. No one can erase a bad credit
record if it's accurate, and using an Employer Identification
Number to set up a new credit identity is against the law.

CLINTON URGES BUSINESSES TO DEAL WITH YEAR 2000 BUG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning that the millennium bug ``is not one of the
summer movies, where you can close your eyes during the scary
parts,'' President Clinton on Tuesday urged the business community
to fix their computers before they disrupt the nation's economic
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any business that approaches the new year armed only with a
bottle of champagne and a noisemaker is likely to have a very big
hangover on New Year's morning,'' Clinton said in a long-awaited
speech on the Year 2000 computer problem at the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The president also promised to send Congress legislation that
would protect firms sharing advice on upgrading computers from
lawsuits stemming from use of the material.
</P>
<P>
   When midnight strikes on Jan. 1, 2000, programs that identify
dates by only their last two digits may recognize the ``00'' as the
year 1900. The bug threatens to cripple government agencies,
industrial firms, banks, hospitals and financial exchanges around
the world that use computer calendars to monitor their operations.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, key Republicans on Capitol Hill have been
urging Clinton to put the full weight of his office behind a
high-profile campaign to alert Americans to the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded Tuesday by praising the Republicans for their
efforts as they sat in the first row of the auditorium. ``This can
be a model of partnership,'' the president asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the thousands of retired computer authorities whose help
could prove vital, Clinton announced that the Labor Department had
established a Year 2000 talent bank to hook up experts on the
computer glitch with people who need their aid. And Clinton also
noted that the Justice Department ruled earlier this month that
``competitors who merely share information on how to solve this
problem are not in violation of the nation's antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get that message out there loud and clear: no one
should be afraid to help another company to deal with this
challenge,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Another key goal of Clinton's speech was to remove the Year 2000
problem from the political agenda. Any massive disruption in
commerce could potentially harm the chances of Vice President Al
Gore, the administration's lead player on technology issues, in his
forthcoming bid to succeed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Clinton, Gore said: ``The year 2000 problem is a
management challenge and a programming challenge. It must not be a
political football. We need bipartisan cooperation to solve the
year 2000 problem, not political rhetoric. More than anything else,
the year 2000 problem has revealed how interconnected and
interdependent we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the president sought to temper a sense of urgency
with a dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we act and not be in denial,'' he said.
``It is also very important that we avoid overreaction from people
who hear, 'Oh, my goodness, this problem is out there.' And so we
have to do both things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steven Horn, R-Calif., who chairs a House subcommittee that
has been probing the federal response to the Year 2000 problem,
said he told Clinton after the speech that ``Franklin D. Roosevelt
would have been proud of you, because what the nation needed to
hear at this time was a ``fireside address' on this critical
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a true emergency,'' agreed Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah,
who chairs a special Senate panel on the Year 2000 computer
problem. ``I won't nit-pick on whether he should have spoken out
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said ``a private foundation will soon announce a major
effort to coordinate a nationwide response at all levels of
society.'' He said the group was seeking to recruit ``a major
industrial figure'' to lead a broadly based campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some time ago, Bennett had scheduled his own speech on the
problem, to be delivered on Wednesday to the National Press Club
under the working title of ``Paul Revere and Not Chicken Little:
Who's Sounding the Call for the Year 2000 and Who's Not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'll have to revise that speech,'' Bennett said.

 Egghead Cracks the Net  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months after scrapping its money-losing chain of stores,
Egghead.com Inc. could be the first big retailer to successfully
transform itself into a pure Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Its three Web sites comprise an online superstore with more than
40,000 computer products. The flagship site, www.egghead.com, sells
new hardware and software, while www.surplusdirect.com and
www.surplusauction.com offer older versions of products, along with
refurbished and surplus goods.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, sensing that Egghead could become a major shopping
presence on the Net, have driven the company's stock up from $8.44
at the start of July to $26.13 on Monday. The shares gave back some
yesterday, closing down $2.72 to $23.41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's finally setting in that Egghead is no longer the
chain of 170 little strip mall stores, and that they have a very
strong brand name that's recognized by anyone who's used a computer
over the past 10 years,'' said Paul Taylor, an analyst for Arcadia
Investment Corp. in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Egghead doesn't expect to return to profitability in the near
future, but it hopes that by slashing operating costs and focusing
on the Internet, it has set the stage for a rebound. The company
had an operating loss of $7.2 million in its fourth quarter that
ended in March _ its 11th loss in the past 12 quarters. However,
online sales _ the key to future success _ hit $30.5 million during
the quarter, exceeding forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Growth appears to be especially strong for
www.surplusauction.com &UR; ,  &LR; a site that lets consumers bid online for
computer hardware and software. Egghead said that in the first
quarter that ended in June, revenues from the auction site nearly
doubled from the fourth quarter, reaching $13.7 million. (The
company will report first-quarter results on July 28.)
</P>
<P>
   After what Egghead has endured during the past several years,
any positive news is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1984 as Egghead Software, it was the most prominent
chain selling computer software for a decade. At its zenith, it
boasted 250 stores and a thriving catalog business.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, however, computer superstores such as CompUSA were
starting to eat into Egghead's business. By the summer of 1996, the
company was on the rocks, buckling under the same pressures that
were afflicting other software chains such as Software Etc. and
Babbages, which also were finding it nearly impossible to turn a
profit with small stores based in shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   At that point the Egghead turned to its chairman, George Orban,
an early investor in the company who had also helped start several
other retail ventures, including Ross Stores, the chain of discount
clothing outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Orban became chief executive of Egghead in January of 1997,
replacing Terence Strom. Orban's first order of business was to
close about 80 stores (out of a total at that time of 160), and
concentrate on markets where he thought the company could compete.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Orban suggested that Egghead turn its
attention to the Internet. The company redesigned its Web site for
online shopping, and in August it acquired Surplus Direct, which
operated www.surplusdirect.com and the then-new
www.surplusauction.com, in a $31.5 million stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, Orban was confident Egghead could make
it exclusively on its growing Internet business. Last January 28,
the company said it would close its remaining 80 stores, lay off 80
percent of its 1,000 employees, take a $42 million restructuring
charge and change its name to Egghead.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point you could have made the case that Egghead would
not have long to live,'' conceded company spokesman John Hough.
</P>
<P>
   What brought Egghead back, said Orban, was its strong brand
name, a solid core of management, and the fact that it had more
than $60 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have capital and intelligent people there are a
lot of things you can do even in as difficult a situation as
Egghead found itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orban, 52, doesn't really see much difference between selling
out of a store or off the Web. ``I've often said this is no more a
technology business than a chain store is,'' he said. ``This is a
business of retailing in which you need to use technology to make
it successful.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to seen whether Orban's vision will translate into a
long-term rebound. The few analysts who follow the company are
taking a wait-and-see approach about the recent rise in its stock.

   ``People are going crazy on all the Internet stocks, and this is
one that has just now been discovered,'' said Casey Stern of Starr
Securities in New York. ``What concerns me about these stocks is
that when they go up this quickly, if there's a hiccup they're
going to come down just as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Egghead grow itself into an Internet shopping franchise? ``I
can't say at this point,'' Stern said. ``But I certainly like what
Egghead has done. It looks like they're on their way.''

COMPUTER-CHIP MACHINE SUPPLIERS STUCK IN DOLDRUMS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The companies that make the machines that make
computer chips are weathering the worst industry slump in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current environment is one of the toughest, most
unforgiving that I have ever seen,'' said James Morgan, chairman
and chief executive of Applied Materials Inc. of Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose-based Dataquest Inc. estimated that
semiconductor-equipment sales would decline 17.3 percent this year.
The industry's revenues fell 7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, things were flying pretty high,'' said John Field,
vice president of marketing and OEM sales at Asyst Technologies
Inc. in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry has taken a pretty steep southward direction,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   An industry in despair is the theme at the Semicon West show,
the largest annual gathering of semiconductor-equipment makers,
which continues through Wednesday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame a host of factors for the slump, including an
over-supply of chips and the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most equipment makers have predicted
lower-than-expected earnings, which have led them to cut costs
dramatically by slashing employees and reducing expenses for
business travel, industry conventions and other items.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be ``a pretty bleak year,'' said Gene Norrett,
a Dataquest analyst who follows the semiconductor industry. ``We
don't see much improvement of the financials till mid- to late next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, the world's largest semiconductor equipment
maker, said Friday its third-quarter earnings would fall about 5
cents a share because of reduced orders.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Applied Materials announced plans to eliminate 1,000 of
its 15,000 workers through attrition and a voluntary severance
program. Last month, Novellus Systems Inc. of San Jose said it
would cut about 180 employees, or 10 percent of its work force. Two
weeks ago, Asyst let go 10 percent, or about 60, of its workers due
to sluggish orders for its equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Norrett noted that businesses readying their computer systems
for the so-called millennium bug and countries converting to the
new European currency would also hurt sales of semiconductor
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Norrett explained that after businesses bought the software to
accommodate these changes, there wouldn't be much capital left over
to buy new computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole food chain is affected,'' Norrett said.
</P>
<P>
   One area in which equipment makers aren't making cutbacks is
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Field of Asyst said an industry retreat was the perfect time to
test new technologies that a company could launch when the market
strengthens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not coming up with new products, you're dead in
technology,'' Field said.

CITING LOW CHIP PRICES, INTEL EARNS LESS THAN FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. reported a 29 percent drop in
second-quarter earnings Tuesday, a greater-than-expected decline
that the leading maker of computer chips attributed to weakened
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is regarded as a bellwether of the computer
industry, also said that it did not expect to see a significant
improvement in its third-quarter financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Intel reported its earnings after the stock market closed, and
its shares fell slightly in after-hours dealing. Investors had
recently pushed Intel and other technology stocks higher on
optimism that the company's results would portend a rebound in
growth.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ending on June 27, Intel earned $1.17 billion,
or 66 cents a fully diluted share, compared with $1.645 billion, or
92 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue totaled $5.93 billion, compared with $5.96 billion in
the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earnings
estimates, had expected Intel to earn 68 cents a share. The
so-called whisper number, offered by analysts to clients orally,
was 70 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel's earnings fell two cents short of the consensus,
analysts said there were no major surprises.
</P>
<P>
   But in a reflection of the anxiety surrounding Intel's
prospects, its shares declined $1.6875 Tuesday in regular Nasdaq
trading, to $80.6875. In after-hours dealings, once the earnings
figures had been released, the shares eased further to $80.125.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's earnings have suffered in recent quarters from cuts in
the prices of chips to meet new competition and a supply glut of
personal computers in the hands of distributors and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said gross profit margins were reduced because of
write-downs of inventory, reflecting weaker selling prices at the
end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that
without these write-downs, Intel would have earned 71 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important,'' he said, ``is that the outlook going
forward continues to be in line with our expectation that the PC
inventory correction is in the process of ending, and Intel will be
one of the big beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said that the inventory write-downs reflected some
weakness that should have been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a sigh of relief that things are not falling off
a cliff in the second half,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G.
Cowen Securities Corp. ``But people should remember this company is
a far way from the halcyon days of the early '90s.'' Peck said
Intel is ``not going to show earnings growth in 1998, and '99 may
be tough as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reported that shipments of microprocessors were down
slightly in the second quarter from the first quarter of 1998, but
that sales of products based on its newer P6 design continued to
grow while Pentium processor-based products declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite a difficult environment for the computing industry,
Intel has made significant strides toward increased productivity,
just as we have worked to renew growth,'' Craig R. Barrett, Intel's
president and chief executive, said in a statement. ``We have cut
costs, extended our product line, and are ahead of schedule in
using new manufacturing processes. As a result, we have increased
Intel's competitiveness substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Intel has seldom had to lower prices because
consumers were willing to pay more for its newest,
highest-performance chips. But while a portion of the market will
still pay high prices for the fastest microprocessors, the personal
computer industry's fastest-growing segment has been sub-$1,000
machines.
</P>
<P>
   After letting Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National
Semiconductor Corp. get an early lead in that market, Intel
responded with the low-cost Celeron chip, but that chip had a slow
start.

BOOK OFFERS ADVICE FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS EXECUTIVES IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New Yorker Larry Wang stepped off the plane in Taipei,
Taiwan, back in 1990, he had only the vaguest notion of how to fit
into Taiwanese business and society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no role model I could take a lead from,'' he
recalls. ``That first year, I kept my head down, working on my
language skills. Every day, I was in over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wang, a grandchild of Chinese immigrants, is fluent in
Mandarin as well as English. Holding an MBA from UCLA's Anderson
School, he is also now head of an international headhunting firm
based in Oakland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in Taipei and the past 3-and-1/2 years in Hong
Kong, Wang has international experience to burn _ and share. He
shares it as the author of a new book, ``The New Gold Mountain,'' a
how-to aimed chiefly at Chinese Americans interested in pursuing
careers in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had a lot of value-added information,'' says Wang,
founder and principal in Wang &AMP; Li Asia Resources, during a visit
to San Francisco. ``And I wanted to tell this story, which I
thought was untold.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 37, structured ``The New Gold Mountain'' around interviews
with executives at multinational corporations who have relocated to
greater China. Before East Asia's economies were disrupted by the
current fiscal crisis, the region led the planet in growth for a
decade as the world economy became more globalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold Mountain'' is a traditional Chinese name for prosperous
North America. The ``New Gold Mountain'' is Wang's hopeful
characterization of business opportunities in greater China. Such
opportunities, he maintains, are especially good for bicultural,
bilingual people of Chinese descent and other Asia-philes who speak
at least one Asian language.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high levels of education among Chinese Americans, they
still face a glass ceiling in U.S. business, Wang says. ``That's
not a criticism of the United States, that's just the way it is,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Gold Mountain,'' stuffed with anecdotes and data,
includes chapters such as ``The Outlook for Key Industries,'' ``The
Ten Most Often Asked Questions'' and ``The Financial Payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang accentuates the positive in the book as evidenced by its
upbeat subtitle: ``The Success of Chinese Americans in Greater
China.'' Even so, he allows that the expatriate life in Asia is not
for everyone, writing hard-headed chapters such as ``Do You Belong
in Greater China?'' and ``The Realities to Face (Or Why Some Don't
Make It).''
</P>
<P>
   Difficulties notwithstanding, people who make successful lives
abroad, Wang says, ``are open-minded and like to live day to day.''
More often than not, he adds, they are also ``young and mobile, and
willing to go in-country.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Tsai, a senior executive in Wang &AMP; Li's Oakland office _
and a veteran of a six-year stint in wide-open Taiwan _ says: ``You
can be in your late 20s and 30s, and be hands-on (in Asia). You can
make decisions on projects that in the U.S. would go to a manager
in his mid-40s. There's not this bottleneck at upper senior
management.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Gold Mountain'' includes detailed comparisons of the
four major cities of greater China: Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei and
Hong Kong. Appendixes compare Asian supermarket prices of Western
products like M&AMP;Ms and Vidal Sassoon shampoo, list salary ranges,
give essential tax information and sketch cultural characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're expecting a bustling place with the night life of
Hong Kong, Beijing will disappoint you,'' Wang writes. ``It's much
more residential. Although the night scene is growing, it's much
more limited and not as centrally located as in Hong Kong and
Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang concedes that the year-old East Asian fiscal crisis has
roiled the region but says that mainland China and Taiwan have
suffered less than most. For companies wanting to do business in
that part of the world, he says, a long-term commitment is
essential for when the rebound comes.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, whose own commitment to Asia is long-term, returns to the
United States ``four or five times a year,'' he says, adding that
``with the Internet, travel, voice mail and video conferencing,
Asia's not as far away as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he muses, he'll probably have an epiphany and move
back to the States. ``But for me, it hasn't happened yet,'' he
says. ``I wonder about the transition back. Am I going to get
bored? There's so much energy and juice in Asia.''
</P>

BOOMING SAN FRANCISCO ECONOMY CREATES 100,000 JOBS IN ONE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's robust economy created more than
100,000 jobs in the area between March 1997 and March 1998,
according to a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly report, issued by the Bay Area Council, said this
was the third consecutive 12-month period that the nine-county
region produced at least 100,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area economy continues to drive California's economic
growth and to lead the way for the nation,'' said Sunne Wright
McPeak, president of the council, a San Francisco-based nonprofit
public policy organization made up of corporate chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the region's employers are continuing to hire new
workers as they continue to pursue market opportunities,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the council's report, business services _ which
includes photocopying stores, computer programming companies and
advertising firms, among others _ led the job growth, accounting
for slightly more than half of the 100,000 new jobs. Other sectors
of the economy that showed strong job growth were durable goods
manufacturing, insurance, real estate, wholesale trade and
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general good news, Bay Area exports, which rely
heavily on a struggling Asia, continued to falter, with the March
1997 to March 1998 period showing no increase over the $47 billion
figure for the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor equipment industry, which has many companies
headquartered in Silicon Valley, has been hit hardest by the
downturn in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The report also addressed the issue of the Bay Area's housing
crunch and how the dearth of affordable homes may hurt the region.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fassinger, co-author of the council's survey, said if more
new homes aren't built closer to work places soon, some Bay Area
residents may choose to move away.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short-term, the Asian economy is creating bumps,''
Fassinger said. ``But in the long-term, our competitiveness inside
the United States will depend on the housing market.''

HYPOCRISY IS A SIN _ AND THAT'S THE GOSPEL TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLYDE WADSWORTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Spurred by the religious right, Republicans in
Congress are waging a Bible-thumping crusade this summer against
lesbian and gay Americans.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have branded gay people as sinners. They have
stalled the ambassadorial nomination of gay philanthropist James
Hormel and promised to kill a presidential executive order that
bars discrimination in federal workplaces against gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Bible defines this practice as a sin,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott explained in a recent column sent to
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican, speaking on a conservative
television talk show a few weeks ago, described homosexuality as an
addiction that can be treated like alcoholism or kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, quoted
Bible verses that he said showed homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is very clear on this. In fact, I can give you a
reference if you like _ one of many _ but it is very clear on this.
Now, both myself and Sen. Lott believe very strongly in the Bible.
... I abide by the instructions that are given to me in the
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited what he said were several references to homosexuality
in the New Testament books of Romans, Timothy and First
Corinthians.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear the echo of Southern conservatives who
earlier this century described interracial marriage as a sin and
racial segregation as part of ``God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, of course, made a name for himself years ago by referring
to Barney Frank, a gay Democratic congressman from Massachusetts,
as ``Barney Fag.'' He quickly apologized and, incredibly, explained
the epithet as a slip of the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just pretend for a Christian second that legislators Lott
and Armey actually believed in the Constitution's separation of
church and state. Let's pretend that Senator Lott, for example, had
a rational, secular basis for refusing to allow the full Senate to
vote on Hormel's nomination as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just imagine that in their personal lives, citizens Lott
and Armey practiced what they preached _ that they conformed their
every back slap and thank-you-ma'am to the literal word of the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no more bacon, rare steak or cheeseburgers for
Dick Armey, the Texan. The dietary laws of the Old Testament forbid
them.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no more polyester blends for Trent Lott. The Book
of Leviticus, not to mention good taste, prohibits the wearing of
mixed fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   The New Testament also poses a number of thorny problems for
Lott and Armey. Gentlemen, say goodbye to your rising salaries and
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Accumulating wealth is, according to scripture, out.
</P>
<P>
   Passing judgment on others is also discouraged. And when you
feel that urge to discriminate against your gay neighbors or
nominees, don't forget the Golden Rule.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's that pesky New Testament command
against hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the most difficult command of all for Lott and
Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Political lackeys of the religious right have a penchant for
quoting biblical verses that support their mid-20th century, middle
class (dare I say) lifestyle, and ignoring passages that condemn
the sins of greed and self-righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope for political hypocrites such as Lott and
Armey. Hypocrisy, like opportunism and demagoguery, is a disease of
the body politic. It is treatable. We must work with these
Republican leaders to control their problem. They will thank us
someday.

PERSONAL HONOR STILL HAS MEANING TO SOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tuesday morning, after 11 years of warfare and an
intense, seven-month courtroom ordeal, Steve Pagones went back into
the old courthouse on Market Street in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to learn
how precisely much money he'll never be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping for a substantial judgment,` he told me the night
before. ``I hope the jury sends a strong message. We can't have
this hate. We can't have guys like this running around spreading
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones had sued the Rev. Al Sharpton and two defrocked New York
lawyers, Alton Maddox and Vernon Mason, for slander. He'd asked for
$395 million in damages. The jury proclaimed him the winner in this
case Monday, and will decide this week how much to award him _
millions, in all probability.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones has known from the start, however, that he would never
see dime one from these guys. For Pagones this was never about
money _ although money is the only remedy the law provides for the
sins committed against him.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent $330,000 in legal fees to prove beyond all doubt
that he never kidnapped and raped Tawana Brawley. The Steven
Pagones Legal Fund, at Box 350, Beacon, N.Y. 12508, has raised
about $150,000 for him to wage this fight. But he went into that
courtroom Tuesday morning in debt to the tune of 180 grand.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? For the sake of what too many people consider a
quaint and archaic concept. Steve Pagones went to war against these
guys because their accusations had stained his personal honor.
</P>
<P>
   This is Old World thinking _ the sort you find the solid,
Greek-American community in the Poughkeepsie area that produced
Steve Pagones. In communities like that, people exist who believe
that values like honor still have sharp meaning even in a fuzzy
world.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that right and wrong are tangible commodities when
much of the larger society views human activity through subtly
tinted shades of relativist gray.
</P>
<P>
   Most people wouldn't have waged this fight. After all, Pagones
was exonerated by a grand jury that looked at the evidence and
concluded that Sharpton, Maddox and Mason were only blowing smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But these three men had made vile accusations against Steve
Pagones. He had little girls. He had to be sure that no lingering
doubt concerning their father's honor would ever exist in their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Pagones faced two crucial problems, neither
simple. One was that Sharpton, Maddox and Mason had made 22
separate statements, mostly on talk shows. They were lengthy
statements, and some had defamed Steve Pagones in their entirety
and some hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you consider a statement that contains defamatory
material, but not every word is an accusation, does that constitute
slander? During deliberations, the jury asked the judge about that.
You decide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem was that Steve Pagones was a Dutchess County
assistant district attorney when Tawana Brawley's lawyers and her
press spokesman branded him a rapist. As a prosecutor, he was a
public figure. And for a public figure to collect in a defamation
suit, he has to prove that what was said about him was not only
untrue but that the person who said it either knew that or just
didn't give a damn whether it was true or not.
</P>
<P>
   That last thing is called a reckless disregard for the truth.
It's the kindest interpretation of what Sharpton, Maddox and Mason
were guilty of in branding Steve Pagones a kidnapper and a rapist _
charges that Mason and Maddox repeat to this very day, without the
flimsiest shred of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The most charitable thing you can say is that the truth is
utterly incidental to them.
</P>
<P>
   What's probably more accurate is that they figured out, early
on, that 15-year-old Tawana Brawley had been out partying for a few
days and had cooked up the whole sordid story of kidnap and rape to
dodge the wrath of her stepfather, who'd done time for
manslaughter. And that unfortunate reality did nothing to bolster
their contention that the criminal justice system discriminates
against people of color.
</P>
<P>
   So, the three of them simply ignored the truth. So, the facts
don't fit the theory. A minor detail. So, this young lawyer from a
politically connected family is tarred as a rapist. So what?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal, but he's white, so the hell with him.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones figures that this defamation trial was about nothing but
the truth. In reality, though, it was about a species of hatred
that requires no truth for sustenance. It has been about a peculiar
brand of hatred, born of pain and humiliation and generations of
racial injustice, that feeds on its own flesh, with no other fuel
necessary to burn brightly.
</P>
<P>
   So, now this business is officially finished. As did the grand
jury so many years ago, this civil jury in Poughkeepsie has made
clear that Tawana Brawley was never kidnapped and raped by Steve
Pagones or anybody else. She made that clear herself when she
refused even to enter the courtroom to testify on behalf of
Shaprton and her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been made clear that Steve Pagones was victimized
through the sheer bad luck of having his picture appear in the
paper and having a desperate, confused teenager point to it. And it
has been made clear that race hatred, whether practiced by whites
or blacks, remains humanity's largest, ugliest, most stubborn wart.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been made clear that such hatred can poison even
those who have devoted their lives to battling it in others.
Somewhere along the line, as this case unfolded 11 years ago, Al
Sharpton, Alton Maddox and Vernon Mason were transformed into that
which they were waging war against. They morphed into race haters
willing to deny the essential humanity of those they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The hatred took over completely, burying any other human
impulse. Their only useful purpose now is to serve as bad examples.
</P>
<P>
   They became what we all can become if we let hatred consume us.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A carnival-sized crowd in blue suits and neckties
abruptly pulled stakes at the end of the speech, and the carpeted
warehouse in which NASA keeps its biggest space training equipment
ebbed into a hush.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the president can do that to a room, even one
this big and industrial: drain it of so many people so quickly it
feels like the air has left, too. Spectators, security officers,
television cameras with their clacking bird legs, all suddenly
gone. Out.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone split with President Clinton after his tour of
the Johnson Space Center on this hot April afternoon. The seven
bright crew members of the space shuttle Discovery still kicked
around on NASA's royal blue carpet, still buzzing a bit from the
VIP glow. With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   Payload specialist John Glenn, a native Ohioan, was not high on
the thrill of having been with the president, something he does now
and then in his day job. Instead he enjoyed a more precious moment:
hanging out with his space ship crew.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the glare, off camera, Glenn reveled in the
camaraderie of being John rather than Senator Glenn, dribbling out
M&AMP;Ms to all hands, swapping tastes of the space food that was
sampled by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing in the glory of it. Biting a steaming fork of
rehydrated shrimp cocktail offered by a crew mate who declared it
``the Cadillac of space food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is great!'' Glenn said, mouth open, chewing, hot.
``May have shrimp for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I don't know. I
found out one thing in tasting it: stir it up a little bit. If you
get down to the corner (of the plastic bag) where that horseradish
is concentrated, Ohhhhhh!''
</P>
<P>
   America is waiting for John Glenn's return to glory with the
shuttle launch in October, but Glenn himself is not. He turned 77
Saturday(NOTE: JULY 18), and for him the glory is already back.
</P>
<P>
   He is tenacious yet patient in the pursuit of his mission, and
those traits have served him well. That's why he broke the coast-to
coast flight record in 1957. Why, in 1962, he became the first
American in orbit. And that is why, come Oct. 29, he'll be the
oldest human to fly in space
</P>
<P>
   The launch is not for months, but the mission is already
underway. It's in the endless training on shuttle systems and the
poring over experiment manuals. It's him dangling down the side of
a life-sized shuttle trainer and mastering _ at long last since
he's been so slow warming to the new computers in his Senate office
_ the high-powered laptops that run some of the science experiments
aboard the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying every minute of it,'' Glenn said that day in
Houston, ``want to spend all the time here I can getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe that.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lt. Col. Glenn rocketed through a clearing sky above
Cape Canaveral on that late February morning in 1962, he already
knew something about fame. Before the ticker tape parades and the
presidential medals and the speech before Congress, Glenn had
introduced his face to America.
</P>
<P>
   He teamed with youngster Eddie Hodges, who went on to a brief
Broadway career, to win about $25,000 on the television game show
Name that Tune in October of 1957. A former glee club member and a
life-long devotee to a good barbershop quartet, Glenn made big
money by quickly recognizing such tunes as Far Away Places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some gal just walked up to him... `` remembers Glenn's
longest, closest friend, retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Tom Miller,
75. ``She didn't recognize him or anything, said, 'How'd you like
to be on a show?'''
</P>
<P>
   Recognize him? Yeah, Glenn was famous even before that. Months
before this CBS talent scout spotted him shopping in the New York,
Glenn made headlines by setting a cross-country speed record. The
mission was Operation Bullet, which Glenn invented and named, and
it involved flying the F8U jet at supersonic speeds from Los
Angeles to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to wring out a supersonic engine over more than
three hours of high-powered flight time to see how it stood up. At
the same time, Glenn hoped to snag the spotlight for the Marines by
setting a record. Worked like a charm. The plane did beautifully
and Glenn, one of two pilots who took off that morning, was the
only one who didn't have to bail out before New York making the
trip faster than if he'd ridden a bullet fired from a .45 caliber
gun.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marines nominated Glenn for the Harmon Trophy, an
international aviator's prize that had previously been won by Chuck
Yeager and Howard Hughes, the Corps gave him all the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be worth mentioning that it was largely through
repeated efforts on the part of the major that the Navy and the
Defense Department permitted the flight to be made,'' the Harmon
application reads. ``Three times (Glenn) had submitted detailed
proposals and flight statistics before, on the fourth try, his
efforts bore fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn didn't win the award, but he chiseled out a reputation for
rare teancity. Anyone who saw him make the speed record his
personal mission knew Glenn would be a guy who didn't just beat the
odds, he'd wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always starts from behind and winds up in the front
ranks,'' said retired Adm. James Stockdale, who was in Glenn's
class at test pilot school. ``Covered everything in his life
because he'll take on a task without necessarily having all the law
degrees and all that stuff. He's willing to get in there and learn
it as he goes. And he's still doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockdale became famous as Ross Perot's running mate in the
presidential election of 1992, but before his late-in-life
political debut he was a fighter pilot, Vietnam prisoner of war and
Congressional Medal of Honor winner. He tutored Glenn in physics
and calculus at the test pilot school in Patuxent River, Maryland
in early `54 because Glenn had left college before graduating to
fly in World War II. In exchange, Glenn taught the Naval Academy
grad to fly jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew within himself that he had the capacity to learn fast
enough to keep up with almost any academic experience,'' Stockdale
said.
</P>
<P>
   By launch day, Glenn will have spent nearly 500 hours in
training. He will know the essentials of living in orbit from
sleeping to using the bathroom (the toilet is vacuum sealed with
spring-loaded clamps that hold the astronaut in place). He'll
understand the rudiments of the shuttle life support systems and
radio operations, and he's been put in charge of the flight's still
and video photography.
</P>
<P>
   When he's done Glenn still won't be schooled in how to fly the
shuttle, but he'll be qualified for a job as a television news
cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Senator's down here we try to keep him busy because
we do have him for a limited period of time and we want him to be
as prepared with all the orbiter systems as we can,'' said Curt
Brown, Glenn's shuttle flight commander. ``Plus, he has a whole
suite of life science experiments that he has started.''
</P>
<P>
   He returns to Washington saddled with reading material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we load him up,'' said Steve Williams, training
manager for Glenn's flight, ``but he loads himself up. He's a real
interesting man to work with. He wants more than is the minimum
required to perform the job. We give him the information that's
required to do the job, and he's looking for the next level of
detail, the next level of depth of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Industriousness is not something Glenn developed for NASA. Or
the Marines for that matter. Growing up in New Concord, a pretty
Presbyterian town about 70 miles east of Columbus, Glenn got a car
only when he made a clunker on his dad's Chevy lot run. (Mr. Glenn
was a plumber by trade, but had a car dealership in tiny New
Concord.) And he only got money as a boy by harvesting rhubarbs
from the family garden and selling them from a wagon. ``I was the
rhubarb king of New Concord!'' he boasts.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a model airplane builder who loved the taste of
speed. That old Chevy was a convertable whose top had long ago
rotted away, and Glenn never replaced it. He drilled holes in the
floor to drain the rain, and has had rag tops ever since. Yes, even
today.
</P>
<P>
   But flying was something Glenn took to as soon as he could.
Muskingum College, right there in New Concord, offered flying
lessons for physics credit under a federal program designed to
build a supply of combat pilots as World War II approached. The
class was taught on a grass field 50 miles away, but that didn't
deter Glenn. No surprise there, he just drove.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Glenn insists the whole space shuttle thing began
accidentally. He swears he wasn't fishing for a way back into the
astronaut program, to get that second space shot he was denied
during Project Mercury. President Kennedy reportedly had decided
Glenn was too popular to risk his life with another rocket flight.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was preparing for NASA's budget hearings in the summer of
1996 when he stumbled across a medical chart that listed the
multitude of physiological reactions the human body has to
prolonged weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   He saw muscle atrophy and cardiovascular shifts, and
sleeplessness and weakening of the immune system. Brittling of the
bones. Dozens of changes to the body that astronauts endure in
weightlessness before recovering fully soon after returning to the
gentle pull of earth's gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had a thought. He snatched a medical book on geriatrics,
and there he saw another chart listing the many painful effects of
normal human aging. Muscle atrophy and cardiovascular shifts,
sleeplessness and weakening of the immune system. Brittling of the
bones.
</P>
<P>
   As a man in his 70s, Glenn was becoming familiar with some of
these conditions, though he has been stalling them as best he could
with a diet of perpetual moderation and a devotion to brisk 2-mile
walks four or five times a week.
</P>
<P>
   NASA already was working with the National Institute of Aging, a
part of the National Institutes of Health, on some of these same
issues but experts there hadn't yet proposed sending an elderly
person into space to see if an aged body would react any
differently than younger astronaut bodies do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into this thing and developed what I thought was a
rationale for somebody (in his age group) going,'' Glenn said, ``to
look into these particular areas. And if I could do it, why,
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn admits it wasn't really that casual for him. What he
saw in those medical books was more than some interesting facts
that made hm curious. What Glenn saw in those medical books was a
misssion.
</P>
<P>
   Within months he was on the floor of the Senate reading from
NASA documents about the similar effects of aging and space travel,
sharpening his rationale, taking it to the public through C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have the very personal attention of every
person in this country who is 60 years of age or older,'' Glenn
said from the floor. ``One thing that has happened in the look into
the life and biosciences in the NASA program has been that we find
some notable parallels between what happens to astronauts in space
and what happens to the elderly right here on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we can find what triggers some of these similarities,
perhaps we will have a whole new handle on approaching difficulties
that people have right here on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, he'd gone to see NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin, a President Bush appointee who found himself being asked to
approve sending into space a man born not many years after the
Wright Brothers triumphed at Kitty Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the issue was more than age because this was not
just any fit-as-a-fiddle grandfather. John Glenn is a national
icon, a Cold War and Real War hero, the very personification of
America's pioneering work in space. Glenn didn't just ride
America's first space capsule into orbit, he designed the
instrument panel. It would be like bringing back Henry Ford to race
the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   It was an opportunity of great poetry and great danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space frontier is unforgiving to error,'' Goldin said.
``It was a very big decision that had to be made. You know, it was
not a comfortable decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to be the guy whose decision to send America's John
Glenn back into space accidently kills him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was uncomfortable in the sense, here is a national hero,''
Goldin said. ``President Kennedy made just the opposite decision. I
mean, the President of the United States decided not fly him
because he was a national hero. So it was uncomfortable in that
sense because I was going to override what President Kennedy had
decided some 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin made a list of requirements that would have to be met
before he'd agree to the flight. The science experiments would have
to be legit, Glenn's health would have to be a certainty, the White
House would have to stay out of the process, and Glenn's wife Annie
would have to be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know her and I called her,'' Goldin said of Glenn's wife
since 1943. ``You know what she said to me? `This is what John
wants to do. I've been with him for 55 years, I'm going to support
him.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, Glenn, as he is want to do, just kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Need the experiments peer reviewed? Fine, tell me if I can
provide anything to help. Want me to pass a physical? Fine, you
pick the doctor. Need my medical history? No problem, I've been
sending NASA my annual physicals every year since I left the space
program in 1964. Between NASA and the Marines, the government has
most every one since I was in college.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin insisted on no medical waivers, ``and I said, `Fair
enough,'' Glenn said. He told his 52-year-old son David, a
physician in California, about all the medical tests he'd undergone
and the younger Glenn concluded that NASA had done everything but
an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn was not content to sit back and wait for the signal.
He started calling Goldin. To check. How's it going? What's cooking
on my idea for a shuttle flight? Have you heard anything new? Can I
get you any more information?
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Tom Miller got a call at home in Arlington.
This is the same Arlington house he lived in back in 1962, which is
next door to the house the Glenn's owned at the time -_ the Millers
and Glenns built the houses side by side _ the house where Annie
Glenn and the two teenaged Glenn kids watched America's first
orbital flight, and where Vice President Lyndon Johnson dropped by
that historic day.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goldin was on the phone. He needed suggestions for dealing
with Glenn, Miller says. The senator was driving folks at NASA
crazy. But Miller didn't have much advice to offer on taming this
guy he'd known since flight school 50 years ago. It was more like a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dan, `You're in contact with the most persistent person
I've ever known.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not many things make John Glenn squirm. Nerves of steel are part
of the legend, part of the hero package. After all, he's a fighter
pilot who flew 149 combat missions In World War II and Korea and
collected a host of medals in the process. This after losing a
friend to anti-aircraft fire in combat mission number one.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has met with world leaders, and even made a hearty but
failed attempt to become one, losing his 1984 bid for president. He
was in California with Bobby Kennedy the night he was killed, and
flew to Boston in the morning to tell the Kennedy children.
</P>
<P>
   He's faced difficult things, and that's not to say things don't
effect him, but he handles them. Whatever it is, he deals.
</P>
<P>
   But something does unnerve Glenn, or at least take him out of
his stride, make him a little less sure-footed than his fighter
pilot confidence would like: the whole topic of his flight that
doesn't deal very specifically with the scientific research, the
procedures, the quantifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin has been up front in saying that while defensible
scientific research made the Glenn flight possible, that's not all
that's going on. Goldin says he wanted to give Glenn the second
space flight he didn't get before, and has said several times that
``Inspiration is a part of the American psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn might be flattered, but he's not letting on: ``I've heard
him say that... that it goes beyond (science). And I suppose
there's that aspect to it, that someone going up at my age...
whether it will be an inspiration, I don't... Define inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it make me an inspiration to older people to be more
active or will it affect younger peoples' view that the elderly are
not people just to be put away in a bin? You know, will there be
that aspect to it? I suppose there will. But that wasn't the design
when we were starting out. We didn't set out to design it to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, at least some of Glenn's reticence may be to deflect
the charges of critics who say his flight has little scientific
value and is instead a nostalgic adventure. John Pike, director of
space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, doesn't
oppose Glenn's return to space, just the rationale being proffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question you have to ask is, why are we doing this?'' Pike
said. ``We're doing it because it's John Glenn, we're not doing it
because he's a geezer.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn of course bristles at this idea, pointing out that the
National Institute on Aging had a pair of conferences to discuss
his flight .
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought in experts from all over the country to talk
about...'' Glenn said, ``would we learn enough by doing this, or do
we have the potential of learning enough that they should really
back it and get into it. And after these two national conferences
they had, why they decided yes they'd do it. They thought there was
real merit to this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed, says Pike. The science is not ``completely bogus,'' but
neither is it essential nor likely to result in any breakthroughs
in the aging process of people on earth, he said. Pike said the
space program would benefit most from Glenn's flight if Glenn would
embrace the cultural significance of a space hero returning to
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not useful, it's glorious,'' Pike said. ``I wish he would
get off this medical stuff and give us some pep talks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the medical stuff, Glenn will be involved in two age-related
experiments, as both a researcher and a guinea pig. One will study
the way certain proteins are processed during weightlessness, in
the hopes that researchers will gain a hint about what causes
muscle weakening in space. The other will look into sleep patterns
by comparing the circadian rhythm, or biological clock that governs
alertness and sleepiness, between Glenn and others in the crew.
</P>
<P>
   For those two studies, Glenn will give blood 12 times in nine
days. Flight engineer, Dr. Scott Parazynski, who's on his third
shuttle mission, will insert a catheter into Glenn's arm so he'll
only be stuck with a needle four times.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will talk about the science all day. He can recount from
memory the minute details of each shuttle procedure he must know,
tossing in extra info like how fast the ship will be traveling when
he does this thing or that. He can talk about the crew flying with
him on this flight, effusively respectful of each one of them. But
he's never been one to offer details from his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Even going back to Project Mercury, America's first space
program. Glenn talked longest and soonest in those press
conferences with the seven original astronauts, but it was all
about the work, not the feeling he got from the work.
</P>
<P>
   Example: That first orbital flight concluded with a harrowing
period during reentry into earth's atmosphere when everyone thought
his heat shield might have slipped loose, which would have meant
instant incineration of the capsule. America waited long minutes in
one of the nation's first truly unifying television moments to see
if the shield was still attached and Glenn was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   In retelling that moment, Glenn described his state of mind in
the capsule as `concerned.' And that's not today, looking back on a
tough moment 36 years ago, that's back then. On the Navy destroyer
that picked him up.
</P>
<P>
   So now, faced with the cultural significance of his return to
space as an elderly man, the shameless romance of it, the grand
potential for it to inspire young and old... well, you heard him,
that's not part of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I leave it to other people to make observations about
whether they think that's going to occur or not,'' Glenn said. ``I
don't PROpose or OPPose, I guess. If it's going to have that
effect, and other people think it will have that effect, well fine,
maybe that's a good, maybe that's a good benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife Annie is a bit like him on matters such as these,
at least publicly. His true love since high school, she's been
stiff-upper-lipping it for a long, long time. Just a few weeks ago,
milling about at Johnson Space Center while Glenn and the crew
worked through the routine they'll follow upon first achieving
orbit, Annie shrugged at questions about the dangers involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the scary type like it was before because back then
it was so, so unknown,'' she said. ``I had confidence then, but you
just didn't know. But he was a test pilot so that's just one of
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggest to her that he still is, and she laughs and nods
approvingly. ``He keeps me going. He keeps me alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Glenns concede that the family was at first
``cool'' to the idea of his return to space, everyone has since
climbed aboard. Glenn has had both his children and the two grand
kids out to Houston for a tour of the simulators he'll begin
training in shortly. And Annie is with him for most of his sessions
at the space center.
</P>
<P>
   She says seeing things firsthand has helped her overcome the
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you have to,'' she said flatly. ``I'm very lucky that I
can learn what's going to affect him, and I can watch him in
training or attend classes. And he's really so excited. So
tickled.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the science, he wants to make clear. The science. After
every question about what it means to him personally, Glenn swings
back to the mission like a compass finding true north. ``I always
wanted to go up again,'' he'll say, ``but that's sort of beside the
point...''
</P>
<P>
   Until finally, in his Washington office with the Senate computer
behind him cued to the shuttle Discovery's webpage, he lets a door
drift open. Yes, there was something about the first space flight
that moved him. And held him. In a rare, fleeting moment, he
confesses that much. Behind the Cold Warrior exulting in the power
of American ingenuity there was this guy from Ohio who as a kid
made model airplanes and as a grown up got to look down on the
earth the way angels do. He agrees, now, that it was spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not spiritual in the idea that you expect to run into God or
anything like that,'' he says. ``But a spiritual quality in that
having such a different vantage point to look at creation, even
though you're not that far away from earth, but to look at it from
that new kind of vantage point can't help but give you a greater
appreciation for all this creation we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's squirming. This is clearly off the mission. Tenacity
and discipline don't help explain the way a single day in orbit, 4
hours and 55 minutes in a metal can no bigger than a refrigerator,
could grip a person's imagination for the rest of his life.

   ``I suppose when you've had an experience like that you're a
little different person when you come back,'' Glenn says, trying.
``You've seen things that very few people have ever seen, and that
can't help but... I guess it maybe makes you... maybe a little more
tolerant of life in general or you're not quite so prone to be
critical of everything that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's a poor way to put it, I don't know.''

 LAKE UMBAGOG, N.H.: ... my boat.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I like to tell people that's when we met.''
</P>
<P>
   A tree swallow skims past the nose of the canoe, picking off
mouthfuls of insects, its wingtips feathering the surface of the
lake. Above the tree line a great blue heron slowly flaps its broad
wings. A blackbird bobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here three years ago, it was the fall and the eaglets
were old enough to catch their own food,'' Desmarais says. ``One of
the adults caught a fish and flew to the nest to eat it. The
eaglets _ they were as big as the parent _ started squawking and
squawking for the fish. Finally the adult swooped down and gave it
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses. ``I have never seen that kind of behavior before and
never since. Nature is meant to be harsh, and the eaglets are meant
to fend for themselves. I learned something about being a father
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Photography wasn't something Art's father taught him, but
construction was. Roland Desmarais, a field engineer, steered Art
toward the pit by telling him it represented a solid, stable
living.
</P>
<P>
   Art entered the army after high school and was carting bricks by
age 20. When he became a foreman at 27, his father came down to the
work site and taught him how to measure the slope of pipe as it is
being laid, an exacting process known as ``shooting elevations.''
</P>
<P>
   Art is not sure that construction is what he wants to teach
Alex. But he wants to share the experience of searching a distant
shore for a particular scene or image.
</P>
<P>
   As the canoe proceeds, Art and his son begin playing a familiar
game: Be the first to spot wildlife. Normally as sharp-eyed as his
father, Alex is sluggish today, and Art gently chides him as he
points out loon after loon.
</P>
<P>
   Art tells Alex to look for animal parts _ moose ears, loon
beaks, deer eyes _ and not the whole animal. Alex spots an osprey's
nest through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al, you think we see much, think about how much we miss,'' Art
says. ``There is an entire universe of things happening here that
we have no idea about, right behind the line of trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex squints toward the horizon. He focuses on a dark stain in
the distance, stark against the gray sky, and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the eagle's nest, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The return of bald eagles to Lake Umbagog is part of a larger
story of the near-extinction and repopulation of the bald eagle in
the lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   The national bird has been under attack for most of the
country's history. Throughout the 1800s, land cleared for
agriculture destroyed the eagles' natural habitat, and farmers shot
them, mistakenly thinking they posed a threat to livestock.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, only &UR;  &LR; 417 eagles lived in the continental United
States; today, there are more than 4,500. Most wildlife biologists
credit the comeback to the 1972 banning of DDT, a pesticide that
caused eagles to lay thin-shelled eggs that broke before hatching.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to coax bald eagles back to New Hampshire have had
limited success compared to neighboring Maine, whose craggy coasts
and system of lakes are home to 150 to 200 nesting pairs.
</P>
<P>
   The open water, abundant fish, and isolation of Lake Umbagog
provides an ideal setting for eagles, who mate for life, to raise
their young.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late '70s, the Audubon Society, armed with a network
of volunteers like Art, has monitored the lake in search of nesting
eagles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, two birds began collecting branches at the forking head
of an ancient pine tree just yards from the Maine border _ the same
tree that a thinning population of eagles had abandoned 40 years
before.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Art saw a newspaper article about the return of the eagles to
Lake Umbagog and bought a canoe to search for them. He has filled
shoeboxes with images of eagles, yet returns to the lake an average
of 15 weekends a year.
</P>
<P>
   He knows what shot he is still searching for: ``He's just coming
up out of the water, a fish in his talons,'' Art says, his eyes
blazing &UR; . &LR;  ``He's looking right down the lens, right at me _ he's
flying right at me.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot has not come _ yet. But the image of it floating around
the next bend warms him through winter mornings so cold that water
splashed into the canoe freezes before hitting the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The canoe approaches the nesting area spotted by Alex. The
wildlife has disappeared and the air is still; this is eagle
territory. Art, his eyes focused on a black mass near the nest,
aims his camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check your shutter speed, Al, that's what you want to check,''
he whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Through the lens the mass takes shape. The eagle is preening
itself, its head hidden under its wing _ a dark silhouette
contoured by ruffling feathers.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle raises its head.
</P>
<P>
   Art steadies the camera against his nose. His son mirrors his
father's movements. Art fingers the shutter release, the autofocus
lens clicking with tiny corrections.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, he and his son put their cameras down without
taking a picture.
</P>
<P>
   Art looks at Alex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sometimes miss a lot when you look through the camera,''
he explains, eyes still on the eagle. ``You forget to enjoy what
you're seeing.''

   ASHLAND, Mass. _ They came from near and far to hug their
``mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people, including devotees from New Hampshire and
Rhode Island and even California, packed the steamy gymnasium at
the David Mindness Middle School here to wait hours for a hug from
the holy woman from India many affectionately refer to as their
spiritual mother.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary embrace. Mata Amritanandamayi, a guru
whose name translates to ``mother of immortal bliss'' envelopes
followers in a warm hug meant to provide divine healing and
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The line to receive a blessing from the ``hugging guru'' more
commonly known as Amma snaked down one side of the sweltering
basketball court July 9. One-by-one, they fell into her arms. She
gently massaged their backs and spoke soothing words into the ear.
Some walked away laughing; others crying.
</P>
<P>
   It went on like this for hours, well past midnight, inside the
cavernous gym adorned with multi-colored Indian textiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had her arms wrapped around me and she was laughing and so
happy and it felt like I was taking in love,'' said Mariana Luz,
after Amma hugged her and her two children, Keisha, 9, and Tobi, 7.
Luz, who lives in Amherst, had heard about Amma from her
chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of about 50 people from the Amherst area who rode a
bus for two hours to see Amma. ``I didn't know what it was like,
but I figured I'd give it a try,'' Luz said. ``There's a real
positive energy in the room. It's really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, where she grew up in a destitute family, Amma, 44, is
considered a ``living saint,'' for both her spiritual talents and
her work for the poor. She has helped establish orphanages, schools
and hospitals. In this country she has started soup kitchens in
several cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Ashland, like everywhere else Amma goes, volunteers did a
brisk sale of Amma videotapes, compact disks, tapes, and posters
along with jewelry and other handicrafts. The proceeds are used to
fund Amma's charitable projects.
</P>
<P>
   From a very young age, Amma says she has been moved by the
experiences of the suffering and the poor. Her followers say Amma's
power and appeal stem from a sense that she radiates unconditional
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is the foundation of the world,'' Amma is fond of
repeating. ``Where there is love, there is peace. Where there is
selfishness, there is misery and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Amma first came to the United States 11 years ago. Ever since,
her annual nationwide tours have drawn huge crowds. She even
attracts a steady number of groupies who follow her from
city &UR;  &LR; to &UR;  &LR; city. During some appearances, Amma, who is said to need
only two hours of sleep a night, has hugged several thousand
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel like I'm a big baby and she's my mommy,''
Louie Mezei of Upton said, describing what it's like to get a hug
from Amma.
</P>
<P>
   Amma appeals to people like Mezei, a psychotherapist who has
been at several of the guru's appearances, who say her spirituality
goes beyond dogma or any one set of beliefs. Mezei, who is Jewish,
does attend Shabbat services, but also practices Buddhist
meditation and takes instruction from a Zen teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Although born a Hindu, Amma believes all religions are equally
worthy. ``There is no harm in having many religions and faiths,''
Amma tells those who come to her teachings. ``But it is harmful to
think they are different, and that one faith is higher and another
lower. See the unity in them and the great ideals which they
teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Viveka Villarin flew from San Diego to Boston and then rented a
car to come see Amma Thursday night and also to take part in a
retreat with the guru this weekend. After being blessed by Amma,
Villarin, an actress and dancer, said she was filled with an
overwhelming feeling of ``bliss, joy and love. Wouldn't you want to
get some more that too?''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Camille Numrick, who drove from
Providence to Ashland for a hug from Amma, has gone all across the
country to see the guru. ``As they say in India I wanted to be in
the presence of a master,'' said Numrick, who is career services
director at Community College of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a living example of what she talks about _ compassion,
love and self-realization,'' said Numrick, who has even spent a
month in India living in Amma's ashram. ``And she's always telling
us we can have that and with faith and trust many of us realize we
can.''

 &UR;  &LR; _Dissidents in the Greek Orthodox Church claimed victory last week
at a national church convention when they won passage of a
resolution asking the Greek archbishop to reinstate four priests
fired last year from Hellenic College and Holy Cross School of
Theology.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, passed at the clergy-laity conference in
Orlando, Fla., seeks the appointment of an independent task force
to review the controversial firings at the Brookline school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A spokesman for Archbishop Spyridon, who had the four men
fired last July, told reporters in Orlando that Spyridon, the
leader of the nation's 2 million Greek Orthodox, had no plans to
return the priests to the school.
</P>
<P>
   But church officials told conference attendees that they will
heed the concerns of dissidents, some of whom accuse Spyridon of
not respecting the grievances of lay church members.

<P>
   _After making controversial comments regarding divine punishment
on central Florida, religious broadcaster Pat Robertson is donating
money and supplies to fire victims in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Operation Blessing International, Robertson's
humanitarian aid organization, delivered $25,000 and 40,000 pounds
of food to an Orlando, Fla., charitable group. Robertson, through a
spokesman, denied that the assistances had anything to do with his
earlier comments about Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's annual Gay Days celebration in Orlanda,
rainbow-colored flags flew from utility poles in the city's
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some
serious hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in
God's face if I were you,'' Robertson reportedly said June 8 on his
television program on the Christian Broadcasting Network.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson later said his comments were taken out of context.

`MARY' IS LOWBROW, GROSS _ BUT HILARIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY 
Directed by: Bobby and Peter Farrelly 
Screenplay by: Peter and Bobby Farrelly, Ed Decter, John J.
Strauss 
Starring: Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Lee Evans, Chris
Elliott, Lin Shaye, Brett Favre, Jeffrey Tambor 
Running time: 119 minutes 
Rated: R (strong comic sexual content and language) 
Three Stars 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad taste kings Bobby and Peter Farrelly sink to new heights of
vulgar fun in ``There's Something About Mary.'' You name the
offense, especially along political gender lines, and this new film
commits it. But while it's dumb and even dumber than a lot of
gross-out comedies, it'll have the last laugh on all of them. It's
hard to describe just what's so funny that it comes sneaking in
under your radar to make you laugh as often as ``There's Something
About Mary'' does. It's not as funny as its trailer makes it look,
but it won't leave you wondering where its brainless yuks are.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, there's nothing amusing about the ability of Cameron
Diaz's pretty Mary to attract fixated stalkers. But then writing
isn't the strength of this film. The devising of riotous sight gags
is. Matt Dillon's mustache and toothily insincere grin alone will
make you guffaw. As a lowlife private eye sent to Miami to find the
girl of Ben Stiller's dreams, Dillon's gumshoe double-crosses
Stiller by falling for Mary and making a play for her while keeping
Stiller away.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller is no slouch at physical comedy, either, from the moment
he kicks the film off in an '80s prologue. Looking like Austin
Powers in braces and a simian posture, Stiller's lovesick nerd
blows his big chance to take Diaz's school beauty to the prom when
he does himself a mischief by a too-careless zipping of his zipper.
The subsequent combination of humiliation and yearning is all he
needs to keep the flame alive for years. When a colleague
encounters Diaz at a convention, and tells Stiller where she may be
found, that's all he needs. From there, he works his way through
mishaps from arrest to dog bites, with time out for a masturbation
sight gag unrivaled by even the most enthusiastically scatological
comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon should do more comedies. His bottom-feeding gumshoe is
the most entertainingly outrageous thing in the film, even though
it runs on too long and mires him in repetiton. Stiller is glum
fun, even when he's lumbered with sentimentality, as he slouches
toward happiness with occasional timeouts to hide in the bushes.
Diaz soldiers gamely through her assignment, sunnily and chirpily
remaining oblivious to her role as a magnet for nutcakes. The film
throws to the winds any remote chance to remain on the right side
of political correctness by unleashing its mayhem on an obviously
stuffed dog, too. You won't be proud of yourself for laughing at
the staunchly lowbrow ``There's Something About Mary,'' but laugh
you will.

FIRM LOOKS TO MELD FASHION, FUNCTION INTO PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ To display his company's product at its best,
Adam Rizika first turns off the showroom lights.
</P>
<P>
   Then he takes out a flashlight and begins spotlighting, one by
one, windbreakers, T-shirts, motorcycle jackets, backpacks, shoes,
shorts, armbands, even life preservers.
</P>
<P>
   All bear well-known brands _ Banana Republic, Nike, Adidas, L.L.
Bean, Eddie Bauer, and others. And each, as the light catches it,
flares into brightness, brought to radiance by a powdery, high-tech
material called Illuminite.
</P>
<P>
   This reflective fabric treatment is manufactured by Reflective
Technologies Inc., a company that Rizika, 36, launched in 1993 with
his brother, a cousin, and a friend who he met at the Sloan School
of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now housed in back-street industrial space, Reflective
Technologies boasts global ambitions, seeing worldwide markets for
a product that promises clothing manufacturers the opportunity to
sell safety along with good looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact you combine function with fashion adds genuine
value,'' says Matthew Austin, Reflective Technologies's director of
global marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Finer than beach sand, the core ingredient of Illuminite is made
in the company's factory here from glass and aluminum. It then is
shipped to textile finishing companies where the tiny, shiny
particles, each about the thickness of a fine human hair, are mixed
with dyes and a patented clear glue and printed onto fabrics in a
multitude of patterns and colors.
</P>
<P>
   The final result is clothing which, worn at night, stands out
when illuminated by car or truck headlights. To launch the product,
Reflective Technologies has focused on apparel for runners and
bicyclists who, especially in cities, train mostly at dawn or after
dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winter cyclist is always concerned about safety,'' said
Elena Alfaro, clothing manager at Wheel Works, a cycling specialty
shop where Illuminite-treated jackets made by Bellwether Inc. of
San Francisco have been a slow but steady seller.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminite reflective fabric's market debut in 1995 was met with
favorable reviews from cycling and running magazines, and won
acclaim in Popular Science magazine as one of its ``top 100 new
products'' for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And, after production start-up kinks were resolved, sales showed
early promise, rising from $700,000 in 1996 to about $3 million
last year, according to Rizika.
</P>
<P>
   But revenues this year, projected at about $4.5 million, may be
falling a bit behind expectations, as shoppers blink at the high
price of Illuminite-treated products.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Illuminite treatment is expensive, pushing
the cost of lightweight fabric from an average of $2.50 a yard to
between $11 and $14 a yard.
</P>
<P>
   Translated to the sales rack, that adds between $15 and $30 to
the price of a nylon windbreaker which, without treatment, would
probably sell for about $40, clothing manufacturers say.
</P>
<P>
   This high cost blocks all hopes of ever getting Illuminite into
mass-market stores such as Sears, Macy's, or T.J. Maxx. At the same
time, some apparel specialists say, Reflective Technologies's focus
so far on the amateur athletic market may be blocking Illuminite
from building a fashion reputation.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for companies that specialize in cycling or runners'
gear. ``Illuminite fits very well into our picture, where our
market tends to be conservative and not onto fashion trends,'' says
Adam Howes, apparel products manager at Performance Cycling Co. in
Durham, N.C., which sells by mail order and through 38
company-owned stores.
</P>
<P>
   But John d'Arbeloff, owner and president of Railriders
Sportswear, a clothing maker, said once runner-cyclist markets had
had a crack at the new product in 1996 and 1997, sales slumped and
retailers lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wildly excited about the concept,'' d'Arbeloff said.
``The problem was the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, d'Arbeloff dropped his outerwear Illuminite lines
this year, but does plan this fall to introduce Lycra tights with a
reflective Illuminite stripe down each leg. ``I think it will do
huge numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other early casualties, Rizika acknowledges, included Nike Inc.,
which was Reflective Technologies's second customer in 1995 when it
brought out jogging shorts made with Illuminite fabric, and Adidas,
which put out a jacket made with the material.
</P>
<P>
   Rizika says both say they would reconsider if Reflective
Technologies got big enough to promote in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Now that moment is at hand, in a deal that promises both lower
costs and product exposure around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Reflective Technologies in April signed a long-term licensing
agreement with a Taiwan textile mill, Formosa Taffeta Co. Ltd.,
giving that company production and marketing rights for Illuminite
in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Rizika said Taiwan's lower labor costs should cut the cost of
Illuminite-treated nylon or cotton-polyester blend by as much as 50
percent, to about $6 or $7 per yard.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity to the major clothing production shops in Thailand,
Indonesia, and China will mean further savings in both labor and
shipping costs for the apparel companies that market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And Formosa Taffeta, which has 60 salespeople _ 20 times more
than Reflective Technologies's sales force _ will be promoting the
Illuminite name in all its markets.
</P>
<P>
   A Fall River textile company, Duro Industries Inc., which now
makes all Illuminite-treated fabric, will retain that business for
US production of nylon, cotton, and cotton-polyester blend fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiations are under way with other mills to add
fabrics _ including PolarTec fleece, made by Malden Mills
Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The reflective powder itself will continue to be made in
Cambridge and be shipped to the producing mills. The process now
employs eight of Reflective Technologies's 22 employees. A second
production shift is planned this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The company's revenues now are derived mostly from the sale of
treated fabric _ with about one-fourth of sales attributed to the
fabric itself and the balance to the Illuminite treatment.
</P>
<P>
   With production beginning in Taiwan, Rizika says he expects
revenues this year to hit about $4.5 million and rise in 1999 to $7
million _ with the share from fabric resale falling to less than 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held, Reflective Technologies does not report
earnings, but Rizika said he expects 1998 to be the company's first
profitable year.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, as production expands and costs drop, the
company is pushing to become recognized as a brand and to get
Illuminite used on a broader variety of garments and other goods _
including infant wear, military outerwear, and a variety of outdoor
applications including raincoats and umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   The late-summer edition of the popular One Step Ahead baby
products catalog features Illuminite jackets for $39.95 and caps
for $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge this year is moving from the running market to
all these other markets,'' Rizika said.
</P>
<P>
   One eye-catching use introduced earlier this year: Dog coats and
vests made with Illuminite reflective fabric, marketed by Glow Dog
Inc. of Concord, Mass., whose founder, Beth Marcus, is a Reflective
Technologies stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus also is planning a series of children's Halloween capes _
in red, blue, or black _ that could be ready by fall and sell for
$15.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Rizika says the US Military Academy at West Point has an order
pending with Duro, a regular Army supplier, to produce fabric to
make jackets for its 4,000-member cadet corps.
</P>
<P>
   And talks are under way with Totes Inc., the largest US umbrella
company, to use Illuminite reflective treatment on some of its
product line.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, the marketing director, hopes that affiliations with
such name brands as PolarTec and Totes will help build Illuminite's
own brand visibility. ``We would like to be known in our field as
GoreTex is in its field,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Reflective Technologies also has launched a European sales
program aimed at sports-oriented outerwear in Germany and Italy.
And the company is targeting rainwear companies that sell in
northern Europe, where in the depths of winter night begins at 3:30
p.m. and lasts until after breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope,'' says Austin, ``is that by next winter the vast
majority of Danish commuters,'' most of whom bicycle at least
partway to work, ``will be wearing Illuminite rain capes.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LETTSWORTH, La. _ Since the boll weevil crossed from Mexico
into Brownsville, Texas, in 1892, American cotton growers and
entomologists have spent a century battling the pest, and at long
last victory seems at hand.
</P>
<P>
   As surely as the weevil spread across the southeastern quarter
of the country, destroying billions of dollars in crops and
thousands of jobs, a scientific counterattack that began in North
Carolina in 1978 is slowly beating the varmint back.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia already have
effectively eliminated the boll weevil, and now other major
cotton-producing states in the South are moving to join the
regional crusade known as the Boll Weevil Eradication Program.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many, especially those whose livelihoods are tied
to the land, the eradication program is a magic bullet, the
agricultural equivalent of Dr. Jonas Salk's polio vaccine.
Nevertheless, some farmers are unwilling to pay the price of the
program, which currently consists of blitzing cotton fields with a
potent pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the cotton-growing states coordinate the effort, the
weevil will be wiped out in five years, said Bob Odom, commissioner
of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture &AMP; Forestry, holding up
the five digits of his left hand for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   But in states such as his own, the issue is still a subject of
political debate, a source of controversy over costs and funding.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find state funds for the project, Louisiana
legislators last month attempted to dedicate $13 million to the
eradication program from the revenues of slot machines being
proposed for race tracks. The measure created an unusual alliance
between gambling-friendly legislators from the bayou country of
south Louisiana and the more conservative representatives of the
cotton-producing, Baptist territory in north Louisiana who are
nominally opposed to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the bill failed, but the agriculture department
found other sources of money and the session ended with
high-spirited legislators pulling an electric keyboard onto the
floor and singing the ode to the boll weevil by New Orleans
musician Fats Domino:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just lookin' for a home,
</P>
<P>
   got no place to roam...''
</P>
<P>
   For a tiny beetle, the boll weevil has dealt out tons of misery.
Though half the size of a housefly, the weevils have literally been
able to nip vast cotton crops in the bud. As John Andries, director
of Louisiana's boll weevil eradication program, explained, the
weevil pounces on new cotton plants and pierces the bud with its
sharp snout.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, its like eating filet mignon,'' Andries said. Once
the bud is punctured, it falls to the ground and never produces a
cotton boll.
</P>
<P>
   The weevil also uses the plant for other purposes. ``Cotton is
the only plant the boll weevil can use for reproduction,'' said
Craig Roussel, the state horticulturalist. ``Cotton is its only
host.''
</P>
<P>
   The current assault on the boll weevil, through the concentrated
effort to kill the pest during the winter as well as the regular
doses of the pesticide during the growing season, is far more
sophisticated than the early efforts at control.
</P>
<P>
   When the boll weevil first appeared, a US Department of
Agriculture farm bulletin in 1902 recommended the use of molasses
to attract the weevil to arsenic poison. A year later, a government
entomologist lamented ``that there is not even a remote probability
that the boll weevil will ever be exterminated.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1917, the weevil had spread across the Gulf Coast states,
from Texas to Georgia, where cotton production fell by 30 percent.
There were tales of field hands being paid a bounty of one penny
per weevil captured. Odom, the Lousiana agriculture commissioner,
remembers turning a hand crank as a boy on his family's farm in
Claiborne Parish to scatter a crude poison called ``Black Annie''
on the cotton plants.
</P>
<P>
   When Georgia sponsored a public demonstration of aerial spraying
in 1924, more than 10,000 spectators showed up with high hopes of
eliminating the pest. Through the years, various chemicals were
used by the crop dusters. At a huge cost to the farmers, the boll
weevil was arrested, but nothing seemed to work on a widespread
basis until the southern states and cotton organizations began the
coordinated eradiction program.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, the program still faces obstacles on the local
level. Because the cotton growers are called upon to split the cost
of the program with the state _ a commitment that would cost each
farmer $15 per acre of cotton each year for the five years _ it
must be approved by a referendum. A statewide vote in 1995 failed
to reach the required two-thirds threshold for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton farmers across the river in the fertile Mississippi Delta
also rejected the concept at first, though a new referendum, fanned
by the eradication program's success in other southern states, is
planned there soon.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Odom speculated that Louisiana growers
originally voted against the program because of its cost and ``that
age old thing, suspicions about 'the government is here to help
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   To jump-start the program in Louisiana, farmers have been
divided into two zones, a cotton-growing corridor along the Red
River in the central part of the state and the Mississippi River
delta area of northeast Louisiana. The eradication program was
eventually approved in the Red River zone, and is now in its second
year of activity.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in northeastern Louisiana will hold another referendum
in September, and state agricultural authorities are using a
long-range economic argument to push hard for passage of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   During the past four years, Louisiana farmers have opted to
plant less and less cotton because of the high costs of production
and low prices. Only 440,000 acres of cotton were planted in the
state this year, compared to more than 1 million acres in 1995.
According to projections by the state agriculture department, the
shift from cotton acreage to corn costs the local economy $500 per
acre.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers continue to resist this economic argument as well
as the prospect of paying $15 per acre a year to eradicate the
weevil, but the eradication program has its advocates in men such
as Paul Roy of Pointe Coupee Parish, who farms nearly 3,000 acres
at a point where the Red and Atchafalaya Rivers converge with the
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Roy has only 250 acres in cotton this year, ``down from what
it's been,'' he said. ``The biggest deterrent has been insects.
They can get in your pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   He supported the eradication program in both referendums and
believes it already is paying dividends. His farm, as well as the
cotton fields owned by his neighbors, is being blitzed
systematically by cropdusters spraying Malathion, a pesticide that
has been used in home gardens for years and is now regarded as the
final exterminating agent for boll weevils.
</P>
<P>
   The state controls the program, following each flight by
computer to determine if the spraying pattern is effective and
monitoring each field with lime-colored traps designed to catch
random weevils. If more than two weevils show up in a single trap,
it triggers intensified spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Control has been taken away from the whim of the farmer, and
under the program every acre of cotton in the zone is treated. The
universal program is designed to eliminate the possibility that
weevils might thrive in one farm neglected by its owner while
neighboring farmers invest heavily in efforts to control the pest.
</P>
<P>
   On Roy's farm the other day, the presence of weevils was
negligible. When he tried to control the weevils himself, Roy said,
``It was unreal, the costs were enormous. I would shake every time
I saw the entomologist.'' Though he is now paying handsomely into
the program, he said, ``I'm looking down the road. I know the
eradication program is a bump in the road, but when we get over it,
it will be clear sailing. I think this is going to prove that a
government program can work.''

<P>
   LAKE UMBAGOG, N.H. _ Art Desmarais and his son, Alex, drop their
canoe into the murky waters of Lake Umbagog, a wildlife refuge in
northern New Hampshire, as the sky softens just before daybreak on
a bitterly cold June morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overcast,'' Desmarais tells Alex, pushing the canoe from
the shore. ``Perfect for shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dull morning light, they are a taciturn pair, the spindly
40-year-old father and the soft-eyed 14-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours ago, Art Desmarais was supervising Big Dig
utilities work in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Although construction is in Art's blood, he settled on his
avocation at an early age; by age 10 he was taking snapshots of
beavers with his Kodak Instamatic camera.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Alex is 14, and approaching some of life's crossroads,
Art senses a need to impart the kind of wisdom his father passed
on. He wants to show him how balancing work with other interests
can bring solace to a man, and to prove to Alex that even the most
placid souls can harbor a grand passion.
</P>
<P>
   Art's passion is locating New Hampshire's only nesting pair of
bald eagles and capturing them on film from the perfect angle, in
full, resplendent beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Alex will join his father's quest.
</P>
<P>
   The younger of two Desmarais children, Alex has always been a
quiet child, carefully protected by Art and his wife, Doreen. Now,
both parents want to start preparing him for life on his own.
</P>
<P>
   One recent night, shortly after Art arrives home from work, he
and his son load a truck with camera equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction work is not unlike photography,'' says Art.
``Your day is planned before it starts, but you need to be ready
for anything that might come up. You have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   On this morning, as he has for close to a decade, Art rises at 2
a.m. from his bed in Northwood, N.H., and travels through the night
to photograph bald eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the early start, a foray to scout moose crossings near
the lake is several minutes too late;he finds mud tracked across
the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wildlife never wait,'' Art tells Alex as they slide the
canoe off the truck's roof.
</P>
<P>
   They carry the canoe to the lake shore. Alex stocks it with a
cooler of Pepsi _ his father's chief addiction along with menthol
lights _ and a 60-pound battery for the small hand-held motor Art
uses now that arthritis in his back keeps him from rowing. Art
huddles over a closely guarded plastic container filled with camera
equipment, adjusting straps and setting meters in a hallowed
morning ritual.
</P>
<P>
   They set off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing at his favorite diner in Boston before his night shift
on the Big Dig, Art says: ``Photography's about seeing the world
with the eyes of a child, with emotion and with wonder. Each animal
I photograph has a different flavor _ the eagle is awe, the bear is
intimidation, the deer is shyness. In a strange way, these animals
are a reflection of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Art is a relentless observer. His vision pervades his life, even
when he is at work in the construction trenches of Boston.
Photography sharpens his focus on the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cross the street into the financial district like some
giant flock of birds,'' he says. ``We might take away a sidewalk
and they will try to walk there anyway, they are so used to their
daily patterns. But you've got to be there early to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He spreads glossy images on the table. Art photographed what he
calls his ``big three'' before eagles even began nesting at the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   Two were taken in September 1987, with warm lake water and a
predawn fog in the trees. In one, three rocks jut from the water in
front of a small island of green shrubbery, a white mist obscuring
a valley in the background. Another looks like an unfinished
painting: a half-submerged moose in mid-bite, a bleached patch of
light hovering above the moose's pricked ears.
</P>
<P>
   The third picture of a spring sunset in 1988 also seems
otherworldly: A spattering of dark clouds, with red and orange
edges, and pastel streaks across the lake in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarais calls these shots ``targets of opportunity.'' Most of
his other shots required a fisherman's patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put yourself in proximity to see something and
sooner or later it happens,'' he explains. ``I might sit for five
hours and watch salmon roll down the river without getting a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I see when I look at these pictures?'' he asks
himself. ``I see awesome creatures specifically designed to do
certain things. I see the awkward cupped horns of a moose so he can
hear his mate. I see his very long legs, like stilts, so he can
walk through the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Art looks up from his prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photography for me isn't a hobby,'' he says, ``it's a way of
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After he and Alex have been on the water several minutes,
Desmarais tells of YT, a photogenic male eagle who died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``YT seemed to prance in front of the camera. Sometimes I
thought he knew I was taking his picture,'' he says. ``I was up
here in September of '92, canoeing around the nest. I got up real
close, within 20 feet _ you have no idea how big the tree actually
is until you get close _ and YT was about 50 feet up on one of the
branches. I put down my camera and looked at YT, and YT looked at
me, and I could see his yellow eyes. Then YT reached down and
pulled out a big feather from his wing'' _ Desmarais gestures with
his hands two feet apart _ ``and he let it drop right next to my
boat.

REMEMBERING A REPORTER OF THE OLD SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- When Doug Crocket died, he took with him an
awesome and valuable secret: how to have fun in the news business,
a trade he adorned for most of his life, which ended last week at
70 in a Massachusetts hospital. Doug had fun because he distorted,
embroidered, exaggerated, mangled, stretched, and twisted the
events of the day, but only AFTER he had filed a thorough, fair,
and accurate story about them.
</P>
<P>
   What he called ``whomping up'' a story did not mean making it
up, but squeezing into it enough emotion to appeal to readers, whom
he regarded as family. Afterward, over strong drink, he would
regale colleagues about the perils, real and imaginary, he escaped
in his daily odyssey. Hyperbole was his hallmark in depicting
outrages perpetrated by editors, called by the old New England
epithet, ``chowderheads,'' or, if he felt kindly, ``bubbleheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he feared editors. We all did when crime and three-alarm
fires superseded spin and press conferences in defining news. When
private grief outranked public policy, general assignment reporters
outnumbered analysts and specialists, who were, in Crocket's view,
``reporters afraid to ask dumb questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry cops and random hazards made fear part of our lives, but
created camaraderie, too. Doug was the morale officer, reciting
hilarious accounts of his first-person stunts. He entered a
log-rolling contest and lived to tell the tale. He was truly
fearful of being assigned to bat against the Red Sox reliever, Dick
Radatz.
</P>
<P>
   He would have admired his obit. ``Mr. Crocket wasn't a
journalist. He was a reporter,'' Tom Long wrote. ``A reporter of
the old school: a tough-talking sweetheart.'' His publisher, Bill
Taylor, said, ``Doug was one of the true `Globies,''' a breed quick
to complain but with loyalty as deep as the Quincy quarries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote in Commentary that ``the
`working press' (as it liked to call itself) was surprisingly close
in origins and attitudes to working people generally. They were not
Ivy Leaguers. They now are or soon will be.'' I protested, citing
White House reporters like the AP's Frank Cormier of Northwestern,
Peter Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News and Michigan, and Matthew
V. Storin of The Boston Globe and the University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan was prescient. The path to press glory soon
detoured from police precincts to little magazines whose writers
talked only to people who wanted to talk to them, who avoided the
gritty reality of general assignment. In Doug Crocket's day, there
was only one Walter Lippmann, an Olympian oracle. Today, the
precocious punditry of ``little Lippmanns'' infests cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Crocket's working-class origins and attitudes might not fit in
today. He would certainly not be allowed to greet half the females
in Area Code 617 with, ``Hi there, Miss Teen-Age America!''
</P>
<P>
   Storin, his editor, said, ``Doug was right out of `The Front
Page.' He was the ultimate street reporter who could talk to anyone
and get anyone to talk to him.'' And leave 'em laughing. In the
1920s, ``The Front Page'' succeeded as drama because it mirrored
reality. Amid boozy high-jinks, the autobiographies of Ben Hecht,
Gene Fowler, and Stanley Walker ultimately confessed that their
jaded cleverness was a cover for raging sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   In the Crocket era, every reporter was part cynic and part sob
sister. Doug was born for the assignment of Globe Santa, the
charity his newspaper inherited when The Boston Post folded in
1956. Since then, thousands of children have enjoyed Christmas
because of contributors moved by the Globe Santa staff, of which
Doug was the Dickensian stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   The prose was purple and persuasive. Some of his old
runningmates read it skeptically, but weakened. During one
Yuletide, an old pal sent Globe Santa a check, which Doug listed
atop the Christmas Day list: ``Fat Kid: $500.'' And the Fat Kid
wept.

BIG TALK LEAVES EMPTY FEELING

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After testing all the teachers, ranking all the students, and
revising all the curricula, one barrier will remain to meaningful
education reform in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   After cutting state income taxes, rebating some of the state
surplus, and doubling personal tax exemptions, one obstacle will
continue to stymie the achievement of Massachusetts children in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Too many kids go to school every morning in this Commonwealth
with an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Agriculture puts the number of underfed
children in Massachusetts at 62,000. The doctors, nutritionists,
and social workers who have just completed a survey of hungry
children across the state under the auspices of Tufts University
and Project Bread put a price tag of $40 million-$50 million beyond
current expenditures on eliminating what is both an educational
impediment and a moral disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Too much of the discussion about education reform has consisted
of blaming the teachers. &UR;  &LR; Alas, hunger does not yield as easily to
demagoguery as the reputation of public school teachers. Its
causes, however, are plain and its solution even simpler than a
standardized test. All that's needed is the political will, an
ingredient shamefully lacking in a state experiencing such flush
economic times.
</P>
<P>
   Deep within the state budget on its way to Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci's desk this week is a mere $2 million to expand school
breakfast and summer meal programs for poor children. It is not
nearly enough, but it was not easily secured.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham championed the need to
finance programs to increase participation in school and summer
breakfast programs. Sixty percent of the children eligible for
school breakfasts are not receiving them and a stunning 90 percent
eligible for partially subsidized meals are not getting them. ``It
was not easy to get the money we did get. There is a great fear up
here of creating a new entitlement,'' Birmingham said of the
atmosphere on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of $2 million might increase outreach efforts and
establish a few pilot programs to reach hungry children, but
Massachusetts has a long and distinguished record of doing more
than the minimum for its most vulnerable children. When the federal
government reduced its commitment to the nutritional program for
Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in the 1980s, Governor Michael
Dukakis and the Legislature bridged the funding gap for
Massachusetts families. When the number of uninsured children began
to climb with the cost of health care in this decade, state
lawmakers devised a means to extend medical coverage to the
unprotected. Just this week, the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention ranked Massachusetts first in the nation in immunizing
its children.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need a pilot program to prove what our mothers taught
us: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. What we need
is a year-round universal school breakfast program that offers a
morning meal to every hungry child in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the recommendation of those who participated in the
statewide survey of hunger in Massachusetts, but the researchers'
report may come too late. By autumn, when its study is due to be
released, the mania for election-year tax cuts and tax rebates
consuming the gubernatorial candidates and the leadership of both
parties might well have overtaken this opportunity to address the
needs of poorly nourished children.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, voters will not turn down a few hundred dollars in
tax cuts _ for many working families it represents a sizable
savings _ but it is a misreading of the public mood to think that
taxpayers are unwilling to share the wealth with children when
education continually tops the priority list in voter survey after
voter survey.
</P>
<P>
   The public understands better than its elected representatives
that the fever that fueled Citizens for Limited Taxation for more
than a decade has long since subsided. Barbara Anderson's anti-tax
group is on the verge of going out of business this summer, after
all, citing public indifference to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts electorate is anything but indifferent to the
issues that surround the education of our children. For months now,
we have heard those with their hands on the public purse strings
insist that Massachusetts children need the brightest teachers and
the highest standards in order to learn. Isn't it reasonable to ask
whether they don't also need a full stomach?

MEMO TO POPE: THIS CARDINAL WAS NO SAINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My mother has been blessed with an interesting life. Sitting at
my kitchen table last week, she noticed a brief news item about the
proposed canonization of the Croatian Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I worked in Belgrade in 1950, there was a campaign to get
the US to free Stepinac,'' she said. ``Every Serb we knew said if
Stepinac was released from jail, they would tear him limb from
limb. It was said he burned down churches full of Orthodox Serbs
during the war. Odd choice for a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd choice, indeed. But the current pope's heartfelt
anti-Communism _ the same belief that prevents him from canonizing
the martyred Salvadoran bishop Oscar Romero _ may elevate Stepinac
to the ranks of the elect. A fervent Croat nationalist, Stepinac
served a pro-Nazi, Croat puppet state during World War II. There is
scant evidence that he spoke out against the horrifying anti-Serb
atrocities committed during the war. Speaking to The Washington
Post, a Croat journalist explained that Stepinac preferred the
``criminal'' Ustachi terrorists governing wartime Croatia to the
``anti-Christ'' fighting the Nazis _ the anti-clerical Communist,
Josip Broz Tito.
</P>
<P>
   Should Stepinac become a saint, he would join a motley crew.
Isabella I of Spain, champion of the Inquisition, is also up for
sainthood. For several decades, conservative prelates have been
hoping to canonize the controversial wartime Pope Pius XII,
although there seems to be little likelihood of that happening
soon.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when saints were chosen by acclamation, or by
vox populi. St. Francis of Assisi and his spiritual sister Clare
(curiously, the patron saint of television) were canonized almost
immediately after their deaths in the 13th century, but less worthy
candidates abounded. Local heroes and potentates could jawbone
their way to sainthood. ``Clearly, some form of quality control was
needed,'' writes Kenneth Woodward, author of the insider's guide to
sainthood, ``Making Saints.'' In the 16th century, the church
instituted a formal system of nominations and a host of
bureaucratic hurdles for would-be divines.
</P>
<P>
   And yet peculiarities remain. In 1969, the Vatican turfed out 60
saints from the liturgical calendar, including the mythical St.
Christopher, whose image I carry in my wallet. Popular favorites
like St. Nicholas, a.k.a. Mr. Claus, and St. George of England were
downgraded. Now Pope John Paul II is approving saints at a pace
faster than any of his predecessors. It's said that he loves to
``carry a saint in his pocket'' _ sometimes two or three _ on his
frequent foreign travels.
</P>
<P>
   In America, as elsewhere, this had produced some anomalies. For
instance, the Pope was unable to beatify Father Junipero Serra
during his California visit in 1985 because Native American
activists accused the famous missionary of mistreating the Indians.
In 1987, the same year he beatified Serra from the Vatican, John
Paul also beatified Philadelphia heiress Katharine Drexel, who led
dramatic ministries to Native Americans and blacks earlier in this
century. Yet even after being honored, Drexel is almost completely
unknown in her native land.
</P>
<P>
   Who's next? Two obvious candidates are Mother Teresa and ``Good
Pope John'' XXIII, who convened Vatican II. Just a few months ago,
New York's Cardinal O'Connor threw his ecclesiastical weight behind
the candidacy of Dorothy Day, the charismatic founder of the
Catholic Worker movement. Day's admirers have been reluctant to
push her nomination, believing that the money spent on a
canonization _ often $1 million or more _ would be better used to
help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   If selected, Day would be a most modern saint. As a young woman,
she had an abortion and later bore a child out of wedlock, sins she
deeply regretted in later life. Author Woodward points out that
Day's spiritual journey imitates the model Catholic life of St.
Augustine. ``Sinner turned saint is what everybody loves,''
Woodward says. ``She's kosher on that score.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Worker volunteer Frank Donovan, who knew Day, recalls
that ``she would often say, `Don't call me a saint! I don't want to
be dismissed that easily.''' Day's extraordinary life work can
never be dismissed. Let's just hope she's not walking alongside
Cardinal Stepinac when the next saints go marching in.

GOOD RIDDANCE, TINA BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'd prescribe a year of The New Yorker for Mr. David Nyhan,''
says the postcard animal dressed up as a doc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mail the card below. You get the world's best cartoons. And
the world's best magazine.'' Then, (big type, please, in a catchy
fuchsia panel: ``WITH TINA BROWN AS EDITOR.''
</P>
<P>
   Err, scratch that. Ms. Brown has moved to the synergistic worlds
of publishing books, magazines, press releases, screenplays, and
all the rest that goes into the business of film (don't call it
movies).
</P>
<P>
   And good riddance, say I.
</P>
<P>
   Because she tarted up The New Yorker. For my money, she took the
venerable mag downmarket, injecting all that glitz and glitter and
groany prose about s-e-x.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she did it without my money. Which is why I am a
lapsed New Yorker subscriber, a conscientous objector in the war
Tina waged to lower the beltline of journalism's
never-too-high-to-begin-with standards. I abstained, after her
downward market trek became apparent, despite enticements like the
low-ball, one-year, 46-issue subscription for $19.98, wherein ``I
save over $124 off the cover price.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why The New Yorker is still bleeding cash. She took
circulation for the Newhouse Bros. loss leader up to 800,000 from
500,000. She got a lot more people in the lower end of the media
food chain talking about this or that that cropped up in her
feverishly massaged pages.She did photography, fashion,
(itals)daring.(unitals) But she drowned it in flirtations with sex.
All kinds, manner of, and cul-de-sacs. The magazine, under Brown's
tenure, became a bit of a sex rag. Not totally and exclusively. But
sufficiently to import wholesale the rather sick cultural values of
the glossy magazine enclaves of Manhattan and Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   May I suggest something heretical to Mr. S.I. Newhouse, admiral
of the journalistic fleet at Advance Publications and Conde Nast? A
lot of us reasonably intelligent and sensible folk, who have the IQ
and wherewithal to deal with your storied magazine, did not like
her act.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine chain's boss of bosses offered her another
five-year contract, so he obviously liked what she was doing, even
though the magazine lost torrents of money. But out here where the
folks live, the magazine's covers and features frequently exuded
the rotting stench of sex-for-sale. It's hard enough in the
contemporary media supermarket to find products not drenched in
sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a supermarket in America that does not stack the Cosmo
girl's breastbone at eye level in every checkout aisle? Don't the
grownups of America understand the concept that sex has become more
important as a marketing tool than as a reproductive technique?
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, some clever, some crude, Tina Brown steered her
writers, artists, and editors in the direction of the pubic
regions. I'm not making any personal or Freudian judgments. Don't
know her, don't expect to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She constantly put new geist in the Zeitgeist,'' reported The
New York Times of Tina's turns at the Tatler, Vanity Fair, and The
New Yorker. Hmmm. The zeitgeist is ``the general intellectual,
moral and cultural climate of an era,'' says my friend Mr. Webster.
</P>
<P>
   If the Times is correct, that places Tina Brown at Ground Zero
of the cultural meltdown that characterizes modern English
language-printed communications. What a legacy: I took the New
Yorker magazine lower, and sold more copies doing it.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, she dusted out the cupboards, aired the linen,
opened the windows, and otherwise spiffed up a dingy, creaky, musty
old B&AMP;B of a cultural magazine. No doubt a lot of what she did
needed doing.No doubt some of the enmeies she made in the process
are mere old-guard types gnashing their fillings over progress,
modernity, trendiness, political correctness, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But gossip, glitter, and a tropism for deadly earnest
discussions of Sexsexsexsexsex and more so quickly pall. There is
not a single subject about which so much is written, to so little
avail.
</P>
<P>
   The animal kingdom _ and the plants too, for all I know _ play
their part in the great sexual game, and none of them need literary
guidance in how to conduct their mating rituals. Tina certainly
knew how to generate the buzz. And she certainly knew how to sting,
as her fearsome reputation attests. But for those of us who didn't
like this Oxford-educated British lady poking around in our
erogenous zones, trying to stir us in the direction of talking
about or buying subjects or something we'd otherwise abjure, I say
bring on the David Remnick renascence. He's only the fifth editor
since Harold Ross's brilliance enlived American culture, beginning
in 1925. I'll keep my fingers crossed, and my postcard handy.

<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Needles, do your trick!'' Brian Rutledge commands.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the living room carpet of the house trailer, Needles
the tabby cat doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit!'' Rutledge tries.
</P>
<P>
   Needles still doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do your dog thing!''
</P>
<P>
   Needles still doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not gonna do it, are you, Needles?''
</P>
<P>
   Needles finally sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good cat,'' Rutledge purrs. ``Good cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is domestic life in Franklin Park, where it's not always
easy to tell where the zoo leaves off and the zoo director's
residence begins. But departing a 110-acre spread in Colorado to
live in an 800-square-foot trailer in the heart of Boston doesn't
mean a man has to leave his livestock behind, does it? Just listen
and you might hear one of Rutledge's 21 sled dogs yapping from
somewhere yonder in their kennel. Or look out toward the paddock
and you might spy Miss Bekka Jack, the 18-year-old cutting horse
that belongs to Rutledge's wife, Kathleen Brennan Rutledge. ``A
good cuttin' horse, but not a great cuttin' horse,'' Brian Rutledge
muses.
</P>
<P>
   Highly energetic and supremely self-confident, Rutledge, 46, was
hired nearly two years ago at $140,000 a year to restore Greater
Boston's hapless Franklin Park and Stone zoos and thereby save us
from what he calls our ``eco-ignorance.'' He's been marketed by his
employers as a tall-in-the-saddle savior, and Lord knows he looks
and sounds the part: Western hat, cowboy boots, measured twang,
etc. His wife, a former Ford model to whom he's been married for
four years, wears a fringed buckskin jacket she says he made when
he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   And darned if he hasn't created a small urban ranch inside the
72-acre Franklin Park Zoo. OK, it's not exactly big sky country,
not when you find yourself being awakened in the morning by the
not-so-gentle jangle of an ice-cream truck. The Rutledge range
looks more like something you'd find in, say, back-roads Worcester
County, what with its horse trailer, its shed (which contains four
dog sleds and one Western saddle), its Chevy Tahoe sport utility
vehicle, its assorted animals, and the L-shaped beige trailer,
which squats beneath the tall white oak trees. Oh, and don't forget
the TV satellite dish. ``Rodeo only comes on Prime-star,'' Brian
Rutledge explains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even though Franklin Park isn't a place where the
deer and the antelope play _ at the moment, the zoo displays
neither _ it does offer certain unique vistas. ``I love looking out
the window and seeing the zebra,'' says Kathleen Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   As for life inside a dwelling that resembles a bowling alley,
the 6-foot-1 husband and the 5-foot-9 wife are apparently making
do. While the couple isn't known for painting the town red _ their
idea of a good time is to drop in at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain,
the quintessential neighborhood saloon _ Kathleen Rutledge at least
got red paint on some of the trailer's muted interior walls.
West-of-the-Mississippi decor includes a lamp fashioned from deer
antlers, a Native American dream catcher, a poster for a Western
art exhibit in Tulsa, and a small gathering of Kathleen's
still-life photographs of the West. There's simply not room for a
whole lot more in a home where the hat rack _ a Nordic Track
exerciser _ takes up significant space.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, Brian Rutledge confesses, he uses the rent-free
trailer, which the zoo purchased for him, as little more than a
bunkhouse. He is Zoo Man to his wife's Dog Woman, sometimes riding
Miss Bekka Jack to his office a few hundred yards away while she
spends much of her day tending the 13 Alaskan huskies and eight
malamutes the couple races competitively, primarily in Colorado.
Significantly, their fenced yard includes a picnic table and a gas
grill. ``I can't even cook in the house,'' says Brian Rutledge, who
recently purchased an outdoor Dutch oven. ``I can cook outside, but
not inside.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would you expect from someone who spent his boyhood
summers camping deep in the Michigan woods with his family? Who was
called ``Animal'' by his friends, but not for the usual reasons?
Who cowboyed in Colorado as a teenager, bought himself a horse upon
graduation from high school, and majored in animal behavior in
college? Who trains and rides cutting horses, raises and races sled
dogs, and bought himself and his wife matching spurs as a wedding
gift?
</P>
<P>
   The way Zoo Man figures it, there wasn't much choice but to
settle into Franklin Park. Most major zoological parks provide an
on-site home for their director, in no small part because, as Brian
Rutledge himself puts it, ``running a zoo is more like running a
ranch than running a widget factory.'' Besides, having upward of a
couple of dozen dogs in tow might tend to scare off the suburban
Welcome Wagon. ``Who'd want us as neighbors?'' Kathleen Rutledge
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he arrived in Boston in September 1996, having
resided in Colorado for a couple of years after spending 13 years
as director of the Baltimore Zoo, Brian Rutledge initially thought
he might try honest-to-God rural New England living. ``I went out
the first day to look for an area with cows,'' he recalls. ``I got
all the way to Pittsfield before I saw any cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you just can't get out of the city quickly here,'' he
adds. ``In Baltimore, I could drive 28 miles out of the city in 35
minutes. You'd need a helicopter to do that here. If we lived
outside the city, I'd have to leave for work at 5 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rutledges have all of Franklin Park's 500 acres as
their back yard. ``I'd rather have a small home with lots of land
than the other way around,'' Kathleen Rutledge declares. ``My life
is outbuildings. I get more upset if the barn's messy than the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely, however, that a cougar will bring down a mule
deer a few yards from their home, as it once did in Colorado. Their
property in the Centennial State _ which they still own, and which
they revisit about twice a year _ backs up onto some 80,000 acres
of federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rutledge himself admits that the confinement of trailer
life occasionally makes him a tad stir-crazy, although he's more
likely to carry on about Boston traffic or the fact that the locals
seem to him incapable of saying please and thank you. He says he'd
like a larger, permanent home on the zoo grounds, a place to meet
and greet zoo supporters and financial angels. Such a structure,
however, is not in the immediate future for a pair of zoos that are
being raised from the dead to the tune of an estimated $100 million
over 10 years, despite the fact that zoo officials say attendance
and revenues have roughly doubled during Rutledge's brief tenure.
``We owe the taxpayers a great zoo before we worry about building a
residence,'' says Grace Fey, who chairs the board of directors of
Zoo New England.
</P>
<P>
   But for now trailer life suffices for the man who confidently
sees himself as the builder of the first two great zoos of the next
century and who says he took the job so it wouldn't be filled by
``someone who would just take a stab at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't a mission,'' Brian Rutledge announces as he sits in
his minuscule living room, ``if you don't have something to give
up, is it?''

SINEAD'S RAGE; GUILT-FREE GUYNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been six years since Sinead O'Connor earned a permanent
place in the Hall of Fierce when she shredded a photograph of Pope
John Paul II, and intoned, ``Fight the real enemy,'' on ``Saturday
Night Live.'' Sure, she evoked the wrath of Catholics, including a
hypocritical Madonna. But it was a refreshingly candid moment in an
industry lousy with pretense. Here was a beautiful woman who
desexualized herself by shaving her head, a fiesty zealot with the
voice of an angry angel forever raging against the machine. She
championed Public Enemy, flipped off the Grammys, and was
threatened by Frank Sinatra for boycotting the Star-Spangled
Banner. Her actions were so jaw-droppingly over, it was hard not to
admire their raw loopiness, though they overshadowed her talent and
undermined record sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now 31 and twice a mother, O'Connor seems a bit less prickly. In
the current  &UR; Spin &LR; , O'Connor, on the road this suumer as part of
the Lilith Fair, tells writer Chris Norris she has few regrets
about actions which brought her grief in the past. ``I respect
myself for being the age that I was and having this passion and
integrity that I did have,'' she says. ``I can say about the Pope
thing, I'm very proud of that and I stand by it and I would do it
again. Quite a lot of the other things _ like the national anthem
and the Grammys _ I wouldn't do now because they're just
(expletive) young moody (expletive).'' Likewise, she has little
regard for you musical descendants whose rage seems more like a
fashion accessory. ``I suppose it bothers me that people like them
have sold a lot more records than I ever sold. They don't cause
trouble and they play a game. They're not controversial in any
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of playing games, is Jesse Camp for real? Is Camp,
anointed the newest idiot in MTV's village after beating 4,000
others in the network's ``I Wanna Be a VJ'' contest in April,
really the lovable geek-stoner he claims to be or is he pulling one
of his wool leg warmers over our eyes? It seems like it may be the
latter. His dad, J. Holden Camp, chairman of the humanities
department at the University of Hartford, tells Spin his son, whose
real name is Josh, ``is a good sweet kid who has created a bit of a
facade. He did well in school, and he had a lot of fun with
drama.'' Looks like he still is.

   &UR; P.O.V. &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the men's magazine which is Details without urban
cool or female readership, continues to genuflect to the guilt-free
guyness which (thankfully) hasn't been on public display since
Frank, Dean, and Sammy rampaged through the Sands Hotel. You can
practically smell aftershave on every page. So in addition to a
vodka primer _ Ketel One gets a A+ for its ``exceptionally clean
finish _ there's Scott Bindley's entertaining mini-opus, ``In
Defense of Bachelorhood.'' According to Bindley, married life can
be can be a soul-sucking morass of soggy diapers, minivans, and sex
as often as the World Cup. Hence, men should be live it up as
bachelors. Singledom, he says, means more time and money for a cool
sports car, titanium golf clubs, and a satellite dish which can get
every sporting event from Little League to logrolling. But Bindley
is quick to say everything he writes ``is predicated on the belief
that the bachelor existence should be temporary. We are not
advocating starting up a local chapter of Spanky and Alfalfa's
He-Man Women-Haters Club.''

   The women of  &UR; Bust &LR;  seem like they couldn't care less if they
make men uncomfortable. This smart New York-based quarterly is
dedicated to celebrating all things female, and if the boys can't
handle it, well, they don't have to go home, but they've got to the
heck the out of here. In short, chicks rule. This month's edition
is the Girlfriends issue, an ode to those faithful women who help
us through our lives, those who are the Marys to our Rhodas, the
Lavernes to our Shirleys. There's Donna Lovell's too-true feature,
``Six Reasons Why Your Girlfriend is Better Than a Boyfriend,'' and
``Bosom Buddies,'' a funny meditation of the best girlfriends of
all time, including Lucy and Ethel, Cagney and Lacy, Patsy and
Edina of the late great ``Absolutely Fabulous.''

   For nearly a decade, Queen Latifah, the first lady of hip-hop,
has been bobbing and weaving questions about whether she prefers
princesses to princes in her queendom. Speculation on her sexuality
only intensified after she played a lesbian bank robber in the 1996
urban caper ``Set It Off.'' So in the current issue of  &UR; The Source,
 &LR; she pumps ``Order in the Court,'' her first CD in five years, and
gives a shout-out to the late Biggie Smalls. Mostly, though, she
talks about those rumors. ``I have no problems with my sexuality,
whatever you wanna think I am,'' the woman born Dana Owens tells
writer Amy Linden. ``I'll never answer the question. I'd rather
have you die wanting to know. You can assume whatever you want. I'm
me. I'm not ashamed of who I am, and who I sleep with is nobody's
businesses.'' Which is very similar to what George Michael used to
say before he came out earlier this year _ not that there's
anything wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, Morris Dees, leader of the Southern Poverty
Law Center, gets an unwarranted slap in the MediaWatch column. Dees
has always gotten props for dropping dimes on the hateful
activities of such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation. But
then Dees added the Nation of Islam to SPLC's list of hate groups.
Writes Brett Johnson, ``If you want to make friends and influence
people in the 'hood, dissing (Louis) Farrakhan and the Nation is
not the place to start.'' Perhaps. But since Farrakhan has made
anti-Semitic remarks, as well as homophobic and misogynistic
comments, he belongs on Dees's list. So to the Source, that slap is
right back at 'cha.

AMERICANS STILL RELISH HOT DOGS AS A SUMMER TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's be frank, as it were: Summer is the season of the hot dog.
About 35 percent of America's annual platter of 20 billion hot dogs
are eaten between Memorial Day and Labor Day, according to industry
data. So maybe that's what's meant by ``the dog days of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the aroma of sizzling pups has begun to waft over
the landscape, taking its place alongside suntan lotion and freshly
mowed grass as a significant smell of summer. But if a hot dog
seems a simple pleasure to most of us, connoisseurs of this
particular type of cooked sausage know differently. In short,
there's more to hot dogs _ a.k.a. franks, frankfurters, wieners,
weenies, red hots, and so forth _ than meets the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Every junk-food trend spotter knows that 1992 marked the
emergence of ``low-fat'' hot dogs (3 or fewer grams of fat), while
1995 signaled the arrival of that apparent oxymoron, the ``no fat''
hot dog (less than 0.5 gram of fat). But while such so-called
``better-for-you'' franks were able to grab some quick market
share, they've now leveled off at between 10 and 15 percent of all
US sales.
</P>
<P>
   The king of American dogs remains the beef-pork combination,
which accounts for about 60 percent of US retail sales. Beef is
next at approximately 25 percent, with poultry representing about
12 percent. But there are sharp regional differences. At Star
Markets, for example, beef franks represent about 70 percent of all
frankfurters sold, with beef-pork accounting for most of the rest.
``That's true throughout New England,'' says Jim MacDonald, Star
vice president for perishable merchandising. ``We're an area that's
not so much beef-dominant as pork-resistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Matt Monkiewicz, who is hot dog product
manager at Kayem Foods Inc. in Chelsea, Mass. Monkiewicz, who
represents the fourth generation of his family to make dogs, points
out that Kayem's beef-pork franks, sold largely to delicatessens,
outsell the company's beef line.
</P>
<P>
   And please don't talk to him about turkey dogs or chicken dogs.
``Poultry is a little less firm, a little mushier,'' he contends
politely. ``You don't get the juiciness you get with pork and beef.
That's really not the kind of product we want under the Kayem
label.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hot dogs and there are hot dogs. And then there are
more hot dogs. Kayem alone makes 108 varieties, ranging from 5 to
12 inches in length. Odd dogs you might find in a local grocery
store include buffalo dogs, vegetable dogs, and tofu dogs. There
are kosher dogs, too, of course. On the road, you might encounter
the likes of chili dogs, Chicago dogs, Coney Island dogs, nacho
dogs, and sauerkraut dogs. Most hot dogs are stripped of their
skins after they're cooked during processing, although many
aficionados prefer a hot dog that arrives in a natural casing, i.e.
an exterior made of animal intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs have a deserved reputation as a high-fat food. Beef and
pork dogs contain the most fat (usually about 12 to 22 grams),
while beef franks have somewhat less (7 to 17 grams). Hot dogs
aren't recommended for someone trying to cut down on salt: Most
contain between 300 and 700 milligrams of sodium.
</P>
<P>
   However, eating a chicken or a turkey dog isn't always a low-fat
experience. Example: A 1.5-ounce Applegate Farms beef frank
contains 7 grams of fat, while a Weaver 1.6-ounce chicken frank has
9 grams. But maybe the fat factor doesn't matter to people, what
with only 10 to 15 percent of US hot dog sales being of the low-fat
or no-fat variety. ``There's a certain perception out there that a
hot dog ain't a hot dog if you take the fat out,'' points out Janet
Riley, an executive of the National Hot Dog &AMP; Sausage Council, a
trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to cook a dog _ grilling, boiling, broiling,
steaming, microwaving and deep-frying. The major methods are
boiling and grilling, but Julia Child feels that appearance should
dictate preference. ``Grilling hot dogs _ or even sauteing them in
a pan _ makes them look nicer, don't you think?'' advises the
Cambridge food doyenne. ``And if they're grilled or sauteed,
they're better split because, again, they look better that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressing the dog'' is important, too. Ketchup is popular among
kids, of course. But it's also big among Gen Xers, according to
research done by National Foods, the maker of Hebrew National
franks. Folks from ages 55 to 64 much prefer mustard, the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   Preferences for certain toppings vary by region as well. Ketchup
rules in the north-central United States, for example, while
mayonnaise is popular in the South and West. According to Kayem,
mustard is New England's most popular dressing, followed by
ketchup, then relish.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the roll? Squishy American-style hot dog rolls
prevail, but there are backers of sesame seed, poppy seed, kaiser
rolls, potato rolls (in Philadelphia), and sourdough rolls (in San
Francisco). But please: no sun-dried tomato rolls, not even in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hot Dog &AMP; Sausage Council says that eating a
standard hot dog and bun should require no more than five bites.
And the organization also advises against wine with hot dogs,
instead suggesting beer, soda, lemonade, or ice tea. We would say
hot dogs go fine with anything but wine.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the frankfurter are in dispute. Was it born in
Germany in Frankfurt am Main or in Austria in Vienna? Scholars
disagree only slightly less vehemently than the two cities do.
</P>
<P>
   On this side of the Atlantic, debate flourishes over the
addition of the bun. Were sausages in a roll first served in New
York City's Bowery during the 1860s by a German immigrant operating
a pushcart? Or were they initially offered at a Coney Island stand
in 1871? And what about the story that the first hot dog on a bun
was served at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis? Or the one about
the editorial cartoonist who coined the term ``hot dog'' after he
saw wieners served in buns at New York's Polo Grounds ballpark in
1901?
</P>
<P>
   If you want to impress your friends while standing around the
backyard grill this summer, tell them stuff like this:
</P>
<P>
   _If Americans will indeed eat 20 billion hot dogs this year,
that's about 75 for every man, woman, and child in the country.
</P>
<P>
   _Major league baseball fans are expected to eat 26 million hot
dogs at ballparks in 1998, only a few more than Babe Ruth allegedly
ate at a single sitting. (Actually, he supposedly downed 12.)
</P>
<P>
   _Yes, Oscar Mayer Foods, the nation's largest hot dog producer,
still maintains a Wienermobile. These frankfurter-shaped
promotional vehicles have been around since 1936, and this is the
sixth generation of the car.
</P>
<P>
   _The famous Hot Dog Festival held each July in _ naturally _
Frankfort, Ind., draws some 15,000 folks who eat about 12,000 hot
dogs. But that's barely a mouthful compared to the approximately
75,000 dogs devoured by some 32,000 people at the recent Hot Dog
Safari held at Suffolk Downs in East Boston.

SUMMER COOK BOOKS SHOW HOW TO PREPARE LIGHT AND EASY FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM M. DOWD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the season of eating light.
</P>
<P>
   That can mean one of several things: eating lower-fat foods
because you need to fit into that bathing suit or shorts, lower
bulk food because your digestion seems to slow in the hot months,
or just less complicated food because you have so many more things
to absorb your time than being stuck in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your selection, here's a rundown on the latest crop of
cookbooks that will hit one or more of those categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertaing Light &AMP; Easy,'' by Laurie Burrows Grad. Simon &AMP;
Schuster. 399 pp. $25.
</P>
<P>
   Any author who begins with one of my favorite diet quotes
(``Never eat more than you can lift.'' _ Miss Piggy) is OK in my
cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Grad is a restaurant critic for Buzz magazine after 17 years as
food editor of the Los Angeles Times. ``Light and easy'' are her
watchwords. They've popped up in one of her previous cookbook names
and in the title of a cable TV show she once hosted, so we know she
takes them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, her healthy-eating recipes are a lot more time
consuming than tossing a marbled steak on the broiler, ladeling
cheese sauce on the broccoli and putting dollops of whipped cream
on the pie, but if you eat her way you'll probably live longer so
you'll have the time to cook.
</P>
<P>
   She uses her own recipes as well as techniques and recipes from
noted chefs and food experts she's come across professionally,
people such as Molly O'Neill of The New York Times and chef Nobu
Matsuhia of Nobu's in New York. In more than 175 recipes, Grad
provides such toothsome dishes as potato-zucchini pancakes, beef
burgundy with porcini mushrooms, rack of lamb with pistachio-mint
crumb crust and butterflied turkey breast with orange mustard glaze
and raisin bread stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than a collection of recipes, however. Grad
includes with many of them cooking notes, variations, and do-ahead
prep. She also provides tips on entertaining light, suggested full
menus, and a guide on how to modernize and streamline your kitchen
without going into debt. A solid how-to book on many levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool Kitchen,'' by Lauren Chattman. William Morrow &AMP; Co. 164
pp. $22.
</P>
<P>
   This is a first-cookbook effort for the former pastry chef at
Nick and Toni's restaurant in East Hampton, N.Y. Her premise is
good eating without a lot of cooking, especially in hot weather. To
that end, Chattman has put together 125 recipes for salads,
sandwiches, desserts, sauces and the like. The result is an
imaginative collection, although a bit spare for the hefty price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   I see the ingredients lists and the instructional pages (how to
peel a mango, how to poach boneless chicken breasts, etc.) as the
most valuable portions.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who have resolved to put together one of those
hot-day meals you've heard about on the TV Food Network or seen in
a magazine but find your shelves bereft of some key indgredients,
Chattman provides a good pantry list of basics to keep on hand:
bottled veggies, dried fruits, herbs and chilies, oils and so on.
Such staples, you'll find, aren't confined to summertime use. Among
her intriguing recipes: double orange sundaes, tomato-feta sauce,
roast beef and rosemary mushrooms on focaccia, avocado dip with
chipotles and lime, and wasabi mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``101 Essential Tips: Barbecuing,'' by Marlena Spieler. DK
Publishing Inc., $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of a series of ``101 Essential Tips'' books
published in various countries by the Dorling Kindersley Ltd.
company of London and overseen by series editor Bella Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same company that produced the brilliant, oversized
``Ultimate Chocolate Cookbook'' earlier this year. But in the
``101'' series the slick-paper books are compact (5x7 inches) and
brief (72 pages), yet packed with smart color photographs that both
illustrate and guide the user.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Barbecuing'' edition contains good tips on barbecue
equipment, hygiene and procedures, instructions on the uses of
rubs, marinades and sauces, and lots of recipes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a no-brainer: Get the book! And if you want to know more

</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets of Fat-Free Indian Cooking,'' by Priya Kulkarni and
Anita Ranade. Avery Publishing Group. 228 pp. $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   A common perception of Indian food is that, with its emphasis on
vegetables and legumes and use of small amounts of meat, it is by
definition low-fat. To some extent that is true, but like any
cuisine there are regional variations. And in that variety, you'll
often find milk and cream, nuts, butter and other ingredients
fairly high in fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Kulkarni, who lives in Virginia, teaches Indian cooking classes.
Co-author Ranade, who lives in Oregon, holds a university degree in
food and nutrition. They boast that most of their collection of 150
recipes have less than two grams of fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   They've avoided the usual trap of making things low-fat by
taking away the parts that taste good. Instead, they've paid a lot
of attention to cooking methods (steaming, roasting, pan browning)
that can maintain flavors while getting rid of fats; herbs you
don't commonly use but that can enhance flavors with virtually no
calories, fat or cholesterol; how to shop for better uncooked
ingredients (even what to order and what to avoid in Indian
restaurants), and other smart stuff.

<P>
   BOSTON _ When two major conventions decided last week to leave
New York and return to Boston next year, tourism officials could
barely contain their excitement. They quickly revised their 1999
schedule, one already filled with an unprecedented string of
high-profile events that will provide the city with its best
opportunity in memory to put itself on display.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of tourists are expected to pour into
Boston in 1999 for the Ryder Cup, golf's prestigious international
competition between US and European professionals, at The Country
Club in Brookline; the Women's World Cup soccer tournament at
Foxboro Stadium; and Major League Baseball's All-Star Game at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all: Next year Boston also will host early rounds
of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, the National Hockey
League's annual player draft, and more than a dozen large
technology, education, and health-care industry conventions,
including the two surprise returnees from New York _ MacWorld Expo,
the annual East Coast trade show and gathering of Apple Computer
Inc. enthusiasts, and the Seybold desktop publishing seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions and sporting events are expected to pump
hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy and, in some
instances, propel Boston onto a world stage. But hosting just one
big-time event puts a strain on any city; hosting so many, one
after another, is a potential nightmare. Can Boston, a modest-sized
city with notorious traffic jams and a critical shortage of hotel
rooms, handle the pressure?
</P>
<P>
   Not suprisingly, tourism officials say the city will be ready,
noting that none of the major events expected to draw 75,000 to
100,000 or more people _ the Ryder Cup, the Women's World Cup, and
the All-Star Game _ overlap with one another. ``As long as they're
not happening at the same time, we should not have a problem,''
said Tony Nunziante, a spokesman for the city's Office of Special
Events and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say that, unlike years past when city agencies
often engaged in turf battles, there is more cooperation now
because officials recognize that beyond the economic benefits of
staging blockbuster events, Boston has a chance to sell itself to
organizations that might consider coming here in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of communication and cross-fertilization makes these
things work,'' said Dusty Rhodes, whose firm, Conventures Inc., has
helped the city plan many showcase events over the years. But, she
added that putting on a major event in Boston is always complex
because of its geography, traffic, and lack of venues for large
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this town, it takes extraordinary planning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite their upbeat attitude and near-giddiness about
Boston's 1999 events schedule, tourism officials admit that the
heat is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we drop the ball, it's going to cost us in terms of being
able to attract events like these,'' acknowledged Patrick B.
Moscaritolo, president of the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau. ``I'm sweating the details, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moscaritolo and others say their confidence in preparing for
the onslaught of tourists in 1999 stems from a successful track
record hosting several logistically complex events in recent years,
such as SailBoston '92, the men's World Cup soccer in 1994, and the
100th running of the Boston Marathon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done these kinds of international, world-class events
before,'' said Moscaritolo.
</P>
<P>
   But never so many of them in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   The city's major events calendar starts filling up in late
January, with a convention of more than 21,000 dentists, and picks
up steam through the spring with the Seybold Seminars, expected to
draw 20,000 desktop and Internet publishers; the NCAA tournament
playoffs, which could attract more than 30,000 fans; and the
International Seafood Show, which draws more than 20,000 visitors
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball tournament and seafood show will overlap and be
followed immediately by the National Science Teachers convention.
Because Boston is such a popular tourist destination for families,
many of those attending the three events are expected to meet up
with spouses and children and spend some extra days, which is good
news for the local economy but a potentially heavy strain on hotel
capacity, according to Moscaritolo.
</P>
<P>
   The summer months will be even busier, with the women's World
Cup soccer tournament at Foxboro Stadium June 20 through July 4,
the All-Star game at Fenway Park on July 13, and the return of
MacWorld Expo Aug. 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   If the US women's soccer team, the defending world champion,
makes the semifinal round at Foxboro, the World Cup tournament
could draw as many as 100,000 people, Moscaritolo said. The
All-Star game, including four days of pre-game activities, will
attract another 100,000 and MacWorld could draw up to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the premier event for 1999 is the Ryder Cup, which is
scheduled to begin the third week of September at The Country Club.
The tournament, at which the best US golfers will attempt to wrest
the cup away from their European counterparts, is expected to bring
more than 150,000 people and an estimated $50 million to the Boston
area during its nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   For all these events, securing enough hotel space will be
perhaps the biggest challenge. Developers are building several
hotels around Greater Boston, and Moscaritolo said there would be
about 2,500 additional rooms in the region by the end of next year,
but it is unclear how many extra hotel rooms would be ready for
next year's major events.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy booming, most hotels in Greater Boston are
enjoying high occupancy rates because of increased business travel.
Add special events such as the All-Star Game or the Ryder Cup, and
things could really get tight. One obvious solution is to book
rooms well in advance in nearby cities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  For instance, the Boston tourism bureau had to reserve blocks
of hotel rooms for next March as far away as Providence to
accommodate all of the 18,000 visitors expected for the National
Science Teachers convention in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For the Ryder Cup in September, tourism officials have reserved
about 7,000 rooms in 44 hotels around Greater Boston. Since most
visitors will stay for multiple days, that adds up to roughly
42,000 ``room nights'' in hotel parlance, Moscaritolo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hotel within a 25-mile radius of Brookline has been
booked for eight months,'' said Marge Amster, the town economic
development officer in charge of coordinating many of the plans for
the golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation is another tricky issue, especially because of
chronic traffic problems caused by the Big Dig. As a result, the
MBTA will play a pivotal role in getting people to and from events.
With parking for the Ryder Cup extremely limited, for example, up
to two-thirds of the estimated 30,000 people attending the
tournament each day are expected to take the T, Amster said. Others
will be transported to the country club on buses arranged by
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Amster acknowledges that transportation issues are probably the
town's biggest issue, but said, ``I feel positive because we have
lots of time to anticipate many different situations and to develop
plans for them.'' And she had some simple advice for handling the
Ryder Cup as well as the other major events scheduled for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we plan early,'' she said. ``It's not
something that you do very often _ try to handle this large a group
of people.''

BEACON CAPITAL ROLLING TOWARD PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starting over isn't nearly so hard when people want to throw
money at you.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after completing the $4.4 billion sale of Beacon
Properties Corp., Alan Leventhal is building a new Boston-based
real estate business at breakneck pace _ and going public again is
considered only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom had said Leventhal's new Beacon Capital
Partners would launch an initial public offering of stock by the
end of this year or in early 1999. Now the soft stock market for
office-oriented real estate investment trusts, or REITs, may push
an IPO deeper into next year, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal had barely turned the Beacon Properties keys over to
Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties Trust when Leventhal and chief
deputy Lionel Fortin started planning a new real estate vehicle
last winter. Within nine weeks, they raised $420 million in a
private equity offering for Beacon Capital and have since issued
another $50 million in stock as partial payment for real estate.
</P>
<P>
   File that as another example of how capital formation for REITs
has accelerated so dramatically in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1993 when Leventhal had first discussed raising public
money for Beacon Properties. Ten months later, the IPO got off the
ground and the company had raised less than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Leventhal, Fortin, and a large group of former Beacon
Properties managers can point to a track record: earning a
compounded annual return of 42 percent for public investors during
the company's three-year public life from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal says 60 percent of institutions that invested in
Beacon Properties have put money into the new Beacon Capital.
Wellington Management Co. is listed in documents as the company's
largest investor, owning a 10.9 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   The track record was certainly a plus. But investors who
eventually bought into Beacon Properties years ago could appreciate
its top-shelf portfolio of real estate, including local jewels like
Rowes Wharf and One Post Office Square.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who took a piece of Beacon Capital's private offering
this spring bought into a blind pool. There was no real estate,
just a pile of money from the offering and a management group
prepared to invest it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have spent a lot of it in East Cambridge, Mass.,
including $123 million for Technology Square, a group of buildings
whose current tenants are Polaroid Corp. and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Square is the kind of property Beacon Capital has
been seeking: real estate with expiring leases and value-added
potential. Leventhal thinks he can refurbish the buildings, which
currently command rents as low as $6 a foot, and lease them in the
$24 per foot range. The topper: Seller Prudential Insurance Co. of
America agreed to take $50 million of Beacon Capital stock as part
of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Beacon Capital deal, a $91 million purchase of office
and research buildings in suburban Dallas two weeks ago, brings the
spending total to about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Private REITs usually can borrow to pay for up to 60 percent of
their assets, which would allow Beacon Capital to buy about $1
billion of real estate before requiring a new round of funding.
Analysts presume that would be the time Leventhal would want to go
public, if public REIT stock prices were strong.
</P>
<P>
   Ask real estate analysts about Beacon Capital and they will
scratch their heads on one point: Why did Zell shell out billions
for Beacon Properties and not insist on some kind of noncompete
agreement to sideline Leventhal, who at one time was expected to
become a director of Equity Office Properties?
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal says Beacon Capital is no competition for Zell and
isn't even looking for the same kind of property. ``We're really
competing in a different niche in the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another point of view: Zell just wanted to buy Boston
Properties's assets and little else. ``He thought he would have to
give them jobs and was happy to find out he didn't have to,'' said
Fred Carr of the Penobscot Group, a real estate investment advisory
firm in Boston. ``Sam just breathed a big sigh of relief and did
the deal.''

MINORITIES AT FLORIDA PLANT SUE OCEAN SPRAY

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; VERO BEACH, Fla. _ In this city of 17,000, where the
grapefruit crop is king, seasonal workers who pick, process, and
pack fruit make up a high concentration of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   As with the nation's 2 million farm workers, many live in
poverty, in a region whose pristine coast is lined with gated
mansions and luxurious retirement homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people for generations have been picking or processing
fruit here,'' said Milton Thomas, director of economic development
at the Vero Beach Chamber of Commerce. ``It is a way of life,
albeit a poor way of life, and it has been the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a $3.5 million discrimination lawsuit that has shaken
officials at Massachusetts-based Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., 34
African-Americans and one Hispanic say they are looking to the
legal system to change that norm. The group of current and former
employees alleges racial bias and sexual harassment by a company
that has been credited with setting labor standards in this rural
city 65 miles north of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has focused attention on the fine line &UR;  &LR; between
employment opportunities and exploitation in a region where the
only alternatives to processing or packing for undereducated
workers are low-paying jobs in the fields or in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed June 15 in federal court in Fort Lauderdale,
alleges that white workers with little or no education rarely
remain in menial positions, but are groomed for higher-paying work
while their minority coworkers remain behind. It says the plant has
had only one minority manager in its 20-year history _ an
African-American male who quit after about 15 months on the job.
And it accuses a white manager of groping five black women and
threatening their jobs if they complained.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the accusations, Ocean Spray last month dispatched
Annmarie Lewis, corporate human resources manager, from its
Lakeville, Mass. headquarters to look into the claims. She
concluded that some of the plaintiffs have themselves been
promoted. But plaintiffs contend that despite these promotions, no
minorities hold jobs paying $13 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The company also noted that it has a system for reporting
harassment complaints, but that the women did not use it.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit notwithstanding, Ocean Spray, a privately &UR;  &LR; held
growers' cooperative with $1.44 billion in 1997 revenues, is known
in Vero Beach for good benefits and competitive wages. Company
supporters say that during peak grapefruit picking season, from
September through May, an entry-level worker &UR;  &LR; can earn more than
$21,000 including overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small plant and (managerial and skilled) positions
do not open up often,'' said Lewis. ``We've recently filled a
position with a black candidate who will be a trainer.... These
allegations are not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit against Ocean Spray is hardly the first to take an
employer to task &UR;  &LR; in Indian River County. A flurry of civil-rights
suits have been filed recently against companies and
municipalities, including telephone company BellSouth and Subway
sandwich shops. The cases suggest a rising militancy among workers
who see few opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Local officials point to what they call the guerilla tactics
of a Fort Lauderdale attorney as the source of employers' recent
legal challenges; African-Americans in neighboring communities
contend people simply want their due.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray's Vero Beach plant employs 75 people year-round,
including 15 minorities. At peak grapefruit season, its work force
swells 60 percent to 120, representing the addition of a seasonal
work force, mostly black, that returns year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs, both full time and seasonal, contend there are no
minority electricians, waste-water operators, or A-level mechanics,
whose starting hourly wages range from $13.37 to $14.94. Company
officials argue there are only seven or eight of those coveted
positions, and once people are promoted or hired to fill such
posts, few leave.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-acre site on which Ocean Spray built its citrus division
20 years ago is a tranquil spot, surrounded by citrus groves,
cabbage palm, and turkey oak laced with Spanish moss. Drive east,
toward the coast, and the region's wealth is apparent. There, along
the Treasure Coast, in a county that produces 30 percent of the
world's fresh grapefruit and most of the nation's grapefruit
concentrate, prosperity reigns.
</P>
<P>
   Turn west, past the citrus groves into the unincorporated city
of Gifford, and the scene changes. The city, home to some seasonal
workers, stands in stark contrast to the fashionable condominiums
and elegant stucco homes along the Atlantic coast. Shabby trailers
and modest houses dot the streets of this community of 8,000 whose
dusty walks recall an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While development companies and agricultural expansion have
transformed large sections of Indian River County, turning a mostly
rural region into a big player in the global fruit market, Gifford
has stayed pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Said the chamber's Thomas: ``The area known as Gifford is
probably more like it was in 1956 than any other place in'' the
county.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Ocean Spray, employees seem to be of two minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working here nine years, and there's bad and there's
good,'' said Milton Johnson, a blender in his early 30s. ``That
doesn't mean things can't be changed.''

   ASHLAND, Mass. _ They came from near and far to hug their
``mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people, including devotees from New Hampshire and
Rhode Island and even California, packed the steamy gymnasium at
the David Mindness Middle School here to wait hours for a hug from
the holy woman from India many affectionately refer to as their
spiritual mother.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary embrace. Mata Amritanandamayi, a guru
whose name translates to ``mother of immortal bliss'' envelopes
followers in a warm hug meant to provide divine healing and
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The line to receive a blessing from the ``hugging guru'' more
commonly known as Amma snaked down one side of the sweltering
basketball court July 9. One-by-one, they fell into her arms. She
gently massaged their backs and spoke soothing words into the ear.
Some walked away laughing; others crying.
</P>
<P>
   It went on like this for hours, well past midnight, inside the
cavernous gym adorned with multi-colored Indian textiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had her arms wrapped around me and she was laughing and so
happy and it felt like I was taking in love,'' said Mariana Luz,
after Amma hugged her and her two children, Keisha, 9, and Tobi, 7.
Luz, who lives in Amherst, had heard about Amma from her
chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of about 50 people from the Amherst area who rode a
bus for two hours to see Amma. ``I didn't know what it was like,
but I figured I'd give it a try,'' Luz said. ``There's a real
positive energy in the room. It's really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, where she grew up in a destitute family, Amma, 44, is
considered a ``living saint,'' for both her spiritual talents and
her work for the poor. She has helped establish orphanages, schools
and hospitals. In this country she has started soup kitchens in
several cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Ashland, like everywhere else Amma goes, volunteers did a
brisk sale of Amma videotapes, compact disks, tapes, and posters
along with jewelry and other handicrafts. The proceeds are used to
fund Amma's charitable projects.
</P>
<P>
   From a very young age, Amma says she has been moved by the
experiences of the suffering and the poor. Her followers say Amma's
power and appeal stem from a sense that she radiates unconditional
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is the foundation of the world,'' Amma is fond of
repeating. ``Where there is love, there is peace. Where there is
selfishness, there is misery and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Amma first came to the United States 11 years ago. Ever since,
her annual nationwide tours have drawn huge crowds. She even
attracts a steady number of groupies who follow her from
city &UR;  &LR; to &UR;  &LR; city. During some appearances, Amma, who is said to need
only two hours of sleep a night, has hugged several thousand
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel like I'm a big baby and she's my mommy,''
Louie Mezei of Upton said, describing what it's like to get a hug
from Amma.
</P>
<P>
   Amma appeals to people like Mezei, a psychotherapist who has
been at several of the guru's appearances, who say her spirituality
goes beyond dogma or any one set of beliefs. Mezei, who is Jewish,
does attend Shabbat services, but also practices Buddhist
meditation and takes instruction from a Zen teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Although born a Hindu, Amma believes all religions are equally
worthy. ``There is no harm in having many religions and faiths,''
Amma tells those who come to her teachings. ``But it is harmful to
think they are different, and that one faith is higher and another
lower. See the unity in them and the great ideals which they
teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Viveka Villarin flew from San Diego to Boston and then rented a
car to come see Amma Thursday night and also to take part in a
retreat with the guru this weekend. After being blessed by Amma,
Villarin, an actress and dancer, said she was filled with an
overwhelming feeling of ``bliss, joy and love. Wouldn't you want to
get some more that too?''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Camille Numrick, who drove from
Providence to Ashland for a hug from Amma, has gone all across the
country to see the guru. ``As they say in India I wanted to be in
the presence of a master,'' said Numrick, who is career services
director at Community College of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a living example of what she talks about _ compassion,
love and self-realization,'' said Numrick, who has even spent a
month in India living in Amma's ashram. ``And she's always telling
us we can have that and with faith and trust many of us realize we
can.''

 &UR;  &LR; _Dissidents in the Greek Orthodox Church claimed victory last week
at a national church convention when they won passage of a
resolution asking the Greek archbishop to reinstate four priests
fired last year from Hellenic College and Holy Cross School of
Theology.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, passed at the clergy-laity conference in
Orlando, Fla., seeks the appointment of an independent task force
to review the controversial firings at the Brookline school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A spokesman for Archbishop Spyridon, who had the four men
fired last July, told reporters in Orlando that Spyridon, the
leader of the nation's 2 million Greek Orthodox, had no plans to
return the priests to the school.
</P>
<P>
   But church officials told conference attendees that they will
heed the concerns of dissidents, some of whom accuse Spyridon of
not respecting the grievances of lay church members.
</P>
<P>
   _After making controversial comments regarding divine punishment
on central Florida, religious broadcaster Pat Robertson is donating
money and supplies to fire victims in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Operation Blessing International, Robertson's
humanitarian aid organization, delivered $25,000 and 40,000 pounds
of food to an Orlando, Fla., charitable group. Robertson, through a
spokesman, denied that the assistances had anything to do with his
earlier comments about Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's annual Gay Days celebration in Orlanda,
rainbow-colored flags flew from utility poles in the city's
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some
serious hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in
God's face if I were you,'' Robertson reportedly said June 8 on his
television program on the Christian Broadcasting Network.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson later said his comments were taken out of context.

SAILORS' SPIRITS ARE HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT   AND BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whitney Connor and Elizabeth Kratzig, the Olympic sailing
hopefuls from Mystic, Conn., are back from two months of racing and
training in Europe, not with wins, but with a lot of confidence
from what they called ``world-class competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel really good,'' said Kratzig. ``This is the first time
we have competed in big European regattas, so we accomplished what
we went over to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, she said, that meant checking out their new 470 sailboat
that they had never raced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of changes in the sail and mast setup that made
a big impact on or speed, so at the end we were going really
fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two, whose goal is to compete in the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, also had a chance to work on their large-fleet skills.
``Regattas in the US only have about 25 boats, but in Europe they
have 60 or more so you have to change tactics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kratzig said the biggest win was at the Regatta Week in Kiel,
Germany, where the team finished 10th overall out of 60 boats. To
top it off, Kratzig said, ``the Ukrainian women were ranked number
one, and we forced them to tack away.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is back in the US for more training, before they resume
racing at the end of the summer _ first to Spain for the World
Championships, then to Florida for the ``pre-pre'' Olympic trials,
then to Australia in December and January for three regattas.
</P>
<P>

Wolters on way back
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kara Wolters, who averaged 9.8 points and 5.2 rebounds last fall
in her rookie season with the ABL's New England Blizzard, is
expected to be back to full strength by the time training camp
opens on Sept. 28. After helping the US Women's National Team to a
gold medal in the World Championships in June, Wolters underwent
surgery on July 2 to tighten ligaments in her left shoulder, which
should keep that shoulder from popping out of joint. Wolters had
the same surgery on her right shoulder before her freshman year at
the University of Connecticut, so says of her recovery, ``I know
what to expect.'' ... Joan Benoit Samuelson and Kathrine Switzer
were two of the inaugual inductees last weekend to the Distance
Running Hall of Fame in Utica, N.Y. Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic
gold medalist in the marathon, and Switzer, the first official
female entrant in the Boston Marathon in 1967 and a promoter of
women's running ever since, were joined by marathoners Bill
Rodgers, Frank Shorter and 79-year-old Ted Corbitt, a 1952 Olympian
and later an ultramarathoner. For 21 years, the city has hosted the
Utica Boilermaker road race, the largest 15-kilometer road race in
the country ... Jean Clark, a freshman forward for the University
of Connecticut women's basketball team who missed most of the
season because of chronic stress fractures in both legs, is going
back home to California and will not return to the team ... Tracy
Ducar, a 1991 graduate of North Andover High who was a standout
goalkeeper there and for perennial national champion North
Carolina, will back up University of Massachusetts grad Brianna
Scurry when the US Women's National Team plays in the upcoming
Goodwill Games ... The second annual Crusade for Health night
features the 11-1 Boston Renegades vs. the Atlanta Classics at 7:30
p.m. Friday at Bowditch Field in Framingham. The program, sponsored
by MetroWest Medical Center, aims to help preteens make healthy
lifestyle choices. Call 508-870-0057 for tickets.

OLYMPIC SPEEDSKATER CHRIS WITTY NOW A WORLD-CLASS CYCLIST, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The track is the same oval shape.
</P>
<P>
   The race is at the same breakneck speed.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes pull energy from the same muscle group _ the
quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   So Chris Witty, who has a world record and two Olympic medals in
speedskating, figured, what the heck? Why not give bicycle racing
on the track a try?
</P>
<P>
   She has, and now is on her way to showing up at the Olympics
again _ this time in Sydney, in the year 2000, and wearing racing
shorts instead of a skinsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Cycling isn't a new sport to Witty, who has used it as
cross-training to complement her speedskating. But it's taken a
back seat the last two years, when she was understandably devoted
to her winter sport. She set a world record in the 1,000-meter
speedskating race in Calgary in November 1997, then she went on to
win silver and bronze medals in the Olympics in Nagano in February.
(Her 1,000-meter world record remained intact, because even the
gold medalist couldn't break it.)
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to the spring: Witty has again traded her blades
for wheels and moved inside to compete on the velodrome, a steeply
banked bicycle track.
</P>
<P>
   After the Olympics, Witty raced in two World Cup bike races in
Europe, and finished in the top 10 in both. In a national
competition in Indianapolis in May, she won both the 500-meter race
and the match sprint. She finished the season earlier this month by
winning the 500-meter race at the National Championships in Frisco,
Texas, and finishing second in the match-sprint race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of rested for a few days (after the nationals) and am
just taking a break,'' Witty said last week from her home in Corona
Del Mar, Calif. Well, resting except for a quick jaunt up to
Calgary this week to get a little skating in before the cycling
events in the Goodwill Games July 25-26 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to the World Championships in Bordeaux, France, at
the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   So don't for a minute put Witty in the same class as basketball
superstar Michael Jordan, who tried his hand at minor league
baseball four years ago before returning to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, speedskating and bicycle racing seem to have had a
natural symbiotic relationship over the years. Of the eight
althetes who were two-sport Olympians, four were competitors in
bicycling (summer games) and skating (winter games). The
double-dippers included Connie Carpenter Phinney, the late Art
Longsjo, Arnold Uhrlass, and Connie Paraskevin-Young. Five-time
gold medalist speedskater Eric Heiden made the 1980 Olympic bike
racing team as an alternate (the US boycotted the Moscow games that
year), and went on to compete in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Witty, 23, almost made it to the Summer Olympics in 1996, but
she was only chosen as an alternate after being edged out by
Paraskevin-Young. No hard feelings, though: Paraskevin-Young is now
Witty's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Witty said that even though she started skating when she was 8,
it wasn't until she was 16 that she devoted more time to cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been used for cross-training in the summer,
because they didn't have indoor ice, and you use the same quad
muscles,'' she said. ``A lot of the leg and lower-body strength is
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But the strategies, she said, are not at all similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very different, because in the match sprint in
cycling I'm going against somebody,'' Witty said. ``On the ice, I'm
just racing against the clock ... all the events are time-trial
events, so you have that time-trial mentality and preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraskevin-Young, whose husband Roger met Witty in 1992 when he
was coach of her junior worlds team, said she thinks the winter
Olympian is definitely on track for the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has happened since (Chris started),'' said
Paraskevin-Young. ``She's matured mentally and physcially, and that
will continue. She's already at the Olympic level, so with an
athlete like that it's a matter of where and how she chooses to
spend her time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the beauty, she said, is now thatthe Summer and Winter
Olympics are staggered to be held every two years, Witty has a
break of four years between each event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a different ballgame now,'' said
Paraskevin-Young. ``Sure, it was done in the past, but it was more
difficult when you had Olympics in the same year.'' Which is
probably why, of all the eight dual US Olympians, only one _ Eddie
Eagan _ medaled in two sports (he had a gold for boxing in 1920,
and a gold in the bobsled in 1932).
</P>
<P>
   Witty, an admitted nonstop athlete, said she uses the gap not to
slack off, but to develop another sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good they are staggered, so I can take a couple of years
to figure out the sport before the next Olympics,'' she said. If
there's any downside, she said, it's that competing year-round
means she has little time to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's difficult mentally, especially because you have
to travel so much that you're never home,'' said Witty, who last
visited her parents and three brothers in April in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   No argument from Paraskevin-Young, who bagged skating when she
grew weary of the nonstop competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly why I quit, I wanted an offseason,'' she said.

WESTWOOD IS BRITISH OPEN HEIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Lee Westwood is the rising star of European
golf, perhaps the next Nick Faldo. The English have adopted him as
their new patron saint, a player who has casually stepped to the
forefront as Faldo struggles to regain the form that lifted him to
No. 1 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just examine the recent record. Westwood has wandered around the
globe, winning seven times in seven countries since October.
</P>
<P>
   This is similar to the diversity exhibited by Ernie Els, who has
won the US Open twice in the past four years. It's the form showed
at Royal Birkdale 22 years ago by young Seve Ballesteros, who
stamped his imprint on the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months past his 25th birthday, Westwood is England's
new star, the latest in a succession that includes Tony Jacklin,
Sandy Lyle, and Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   Will Westwood take his anticipated place in the world order as
the 127th British Open begins Thursday at the windy Lancashire
links hard by the Irish Sea? He has won in Spain, Japan, Australia,
the United States, Germany, England, and, most recently, Scotland,
where he prevailed by four shots in the Loch Lomond tournament
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a man confident enough to break the hoodoo that
has prevented any golfer in Europe from winning the event before
the Open and then the Open itself, it is Westwood, whose confidence
is one of the most striking of his characteristics,'' wrote John
Hopkins in The Times Tuesdayof London Tuesday. ``He looks
questioners straight in the eye, speaks his mind and demonstrates a
maturity and composure that are far beyond many of his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood's win at Loch Lomond elevated him to No. 7 on the world
list as he displaced Colin Montgomerie atop the European Tour
rankings, where Montgomerie has reigned for five years. Westwood,
who grew up in the small town of Worksop near Nottingham about a
two-hour drive from Royal Birkdale in the British Midlands, handles
questions easily and has savvy that belies his boyish looks.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a British writer Tuesday if he reads all his
mounting press clippings, Westwood said he does. He also indicated
that he ``has a list'' of those who write negatively about him.
``You're not on it,'' he said to the writer. ``Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   How high are his expectations here? ``I don't have any
expectations, really,'' answered Westwood. Tuesday ``I treat it
like any other tournament. First, I try to make the cut. If I'm in
there with a chance on Sunday, I'll give it a go. If I do get the
opportunity, I hope to take it. I just try and not make any stupid
mistakes. I've been in contention. I would say I've won more
tournaments when I've been in contention than I've lost. I've been
in four playoffs and I've won three of them, so ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is why Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, who was on the
victorious European Ryder Cup team with Westwood last fall, has
commented on his demeanor. ``When I look at him, I think first of
his composure,'' said Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood can hammer drives, play aggressively on and near the
greens, and is prepared to define his career in terms of winning
major championships. ``I won't be nervous coming down the stretch
if I'm leading,'' said Westwood, who would be the first from Great
Britain to win at Royal Birkdale, which is hosting its eighth Open
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of winning. I'm not afraid of losing. If I
don't win the Open this year, it won't be the end of the world to
me. I would dearly love to win it, but it's not life-and-death.
It's only a game at the end of the day. I've sacrificed quite a lot
of things already. This is my ultimate aim _ to be No. 1. You know,
sacrificing going out getting drunk on a Friday night with the lads
isn't a lot to sacrifice. I can save a few quid as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood, who won at New Orleans the week before the Masters,
loves links-styled courses. ``I would like to see us play more
links golf,'' he said. ``I had a pretty good record when I was an
amateur on links courses. I think we should probably play more of
them. I think most of the Europeans have played so many in the past
that you never really forget how to play links golf. It's either
suited to your game or it's not. I'm trying to go into it positive,
thinking I can play links golf.''
</P>
<P>
   As Montgomerie has said, Westwood ``has become the man to beat
at every tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood is taking it all in stride. ``Nothing bothers me,'' he
said. ``There's more media attention. I was 12th in the world last
week. I'm seventh this week. It's too short a time spell to treat
it differently. I'm still the same person.''

TV GUIDE'S 50 GREATEST MOMENTS FULL OF STATIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If TV Guide had only bothered to explain itself, we'd have a
clearer picture of how it managed to screw up its list of 50
Greatest Sports Moments so badly.
</P>
<P>
   A Top Anything list is an opinion, of course. We all understand
that. Just because I think ``Things We Said Today'' is the greatest
of all Beatles songs doesn't mean you'll agree. And let's give TV
Guide credit for anticipating rants like this one. ``Our list is
bound to spark debate,'' the compilers write, ``because the only
thing we like more than watching sports is arguing about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed.
</P>
<P>
   So how could you people take the 1968 Houston-UCLA game, merely
the most important college basketball game in history, and rank it
49th? How could you insert two NASCAR happenings in your Top 50?
How could you make the Thrilla In Manila, which six people watched
on an embryonic network called HBO, and rank it
(itals)anywhere,(unitals) let alone No. 2?
</P>
<P>
   Something else: Did television sports begin in 1960? Or did we
all dream we watched the Colts beat the Giants in Yankee Stadium on
Dec. 28, 1958, in pro football's first overtime game? Was not Bobby
Thomson's home run _ the most electrifying moment in baseball
history _ on TV? And so what if it took place on Oct. 3, 1951? I
would wager that a few more people watched that game than were
privileged to see the Thrilla In Manila 24 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Now I trust you're sitting down. In its July 11-17 issue, TV
Guide has ranked the 50 Greatest Sports Moments and has failed to
include _ and I swear I am not making this up _ Super Bowl III. I
reread the article approximately 111 times to make sure I hadn't
missed it. Borg-McEnroe at Wimbledon (1980) is No. 5, and Bonnie
Blair winning her fourth gold medal is No. 20, and Hagler-Hearns is
No. 37 (a good fight, but no Archie Moore-Yvon Durelle), but Joe
Namath &AMP; Co. blowing apart the myth of NFL invincibility doesn't
even make the cut?
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, people, if you don't know enough to include Jets 16,
Colts 7, you automatically forfeit credibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is a distinct lack of historical perspective on display
here. The two most important college basketball games ever played
are the Houston-UCLA game of Jan. 20, 1968, when a national
audience watched Elvin Hayes and Houston upend mighty UCLA; and the
1979 game when Magic Johnson's Michigan State team defeated Larry
Bird's Indiana State team in what remains the highest-rated NCAA
championship game ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-UCLA game was riveting, and the fallout buzz changed
the scope of college basketball forever. It's got to be a Top 10
event. The Michigan State-Indiana State game wasn't so hot, but no
college baskketball game has ever been more
(itals)anticipated,(unitals) and as such, it's a Top 20 TV event,
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   What is the matter with these people? Julius Erving makes one
nice up-and-under swoop against the Lakers in 1980 and that's good
enough for No. 24? (itals)Twenty-four?(unitals) Larry Bird shooting
15 for 20 in the 1984 Heat Game? The 1976 Celtic-Suns Triple OT?
Michael Jordan's amazing right-hand-to-left-hand midair shift
against the Lakers in 1991? Jordan's 35-point first half against
Portland a year later? If they wanted some NBA moments, we could
have supplied them with some NBA moments, no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   They did get one right, and I'd have put it even higher.
Checking in at No. 10 is Jayne Torville and Christopher Dean's
spellbinding ``Bolero'' dance routine from the Sarajevo Olympics.
This was the ultimate proof that figure skating isn't even a sport,
since six of the lunkhead judges couldn't even bring themselves to
award perfect 6's on technical merit, settling for nitpicking
5.9's. What Torville and Dean did had far more to do with art than
sport. It dignified us as a species. It was numerically
unjudgeable, and it probably would have been a good idea if figure
skating had just closed up shop and gone home right then and there,
because none of us will live long enough to see anything better. As
a TV Olympic moment, I'd put it in the Top 5.
</P>
<P>
   They don't come right out and say why the oldest event is the
1960 Olympic decathlon duel between Rafer Johnson and C.K. Yang
(No. 16). If they're making an arbitrary cutoff date of 1960, they
should say so. People watched sports on TV by the millions during
the '50s. Baseball All-Star Games were huge. Stan Musial's
12th-inning game-winning homer in 1955 at Milwaukee was very big.
And World Series, plural? Whoa! How about Willie Mays's catch in
1954? Omigod! The Dodgers beating the Yankees for Brooklyn's only
World Series title in 1955? Hey! Don Larsen's perfect game?
</P>
<P>
   They got the second US Olympic hockey victory over the dreaded
Russkies, (No. 23), but they missed the first one in 1960. I'm here
to say it was on TV. The 1963 USC-Wisconsin Rose Bowl, a k a the
Ron Vanderkelen show? That had people talking for years.
</P>
<P>
   You can't exaggerate how important baseball was in the first 60
years of the century, so where is Bill Mazeroski's home run that
beat the Yankees in 1960? Please. Jimmy Connors mugging his way
past Aaron Krickstein in 1991 checks in at a truly incomprehensible
28? Do me a favor. Stop the next 100,000 people not named Bud
Collins you meet on the street and ask them if they remember Jimmy
Connors beating Aaron Krickstein. Then consider that No. 29 is Kirk
Gibson's 1988 World Series home run off Dennis Eckersley. Your next
question will undoubtedly be, who are these fools, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   All right, what about No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   It's our guy Pudge whacking that Pat Darcy pitch off the
left-field foul pole, so I guess nobody around here is about to
quarrel with that judgment. Thanks to legendary director Harry
Coyle's genius, the sight of Carlton Fisk attempting to direct the
ball to stay fair will always remain a wonderful TV moment. We all
agree that it was a transcendent World Series in 1975 and that Game
6 was a baseball novella. It was exquisite. But it wasn't the Jets
and Colts, and so we're back where we started.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to offer a disclaimer about the desire to provoke
debate, and it's another thing to provide a list that does away
with the first 15 years of TV sports history and then omits Super
Bowl III, a seminal event in American sports history. TV Guide
recently offered a nice Sinatra retrospective. Perhaps this
magazine should stick to entertainment issues and leave sports to
people who actually know sports.

SQUIRRELS DRIVE SUBURBAN DWELLERS NUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY MARTINEAU  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's squirrel season, and suburban dwellers are
going nuts.
</P>
<P>
   A surging squirrel population has pitted some against their
bushy-tailed neighbors whose arboreal antics and penchants for
chomping on power lines have caused frequent blackouts in some
areas around Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   William Peterson and his neighbors on leafy Gari Lane in
Guilderland lost power six times last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about electricity or anything about
squirrels,'' Peterson said. ``But I do know something needs to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, upstate New York suffered about 1,500 major power
outages from animals nibbling, gnawing or scampering across power
lines, according to Niagra Mohawk spokesman Nick Lyman. NIMO
defines a major power outage as one in which service is disrupted
for more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect in most cases? Sciurus carolinensison gray squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   They are either filing down their incisors, a necessity for all
rodents, or touching their tails or noses on transformers, said
Lyman. ``Squirrels are a problem,'' he said. ``In New York City, I
imagine it's the same problem with the rats. A squirrel is just a
rat by another name.''
</P>
<P>
   Like coyotes and Canada geese, squirrels have adapted well to
the pressures of urban and suburban living, said Ward Stone, state
Department of Environmental Conservation animal pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``With bird food, pet food, all around there's a lot of extra
food supplies available to them,'' said Stone, who estimated there
are about 500,000 squirrels in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``To compensate for a thin treeline, squirrels may
throw telephone poles and wires into their routine. He'll jump off
the trees, over a wire, to get to another.''
</P>
<P>
   For customers like Peterson, the squirrel's agility is annoying.
But there's not much the power company can do, aside from
physically removing the critters, said Lyman. When a squirrel chews
on a live line, or touches a power transformer, the system detects
electricity flowing where it shouldn't and automatically shuts off.
In the process, the squirrel is zapped by an average of 13.2
kilovolts and typically electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squirrels standing on power lines tend to get one bite at a
line,'' he said. ``Once they chomp in they get electrocuted, unlike
phone or cable wires where they can nibble.''
</P>
<P>
   If the problem persists in certain areas, the company may
install a squirrel guard, or a spoke-like contraption that sits on
a transformer and emits a low level of electricity to deter the
rodents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are designed to give the squirrel a tingly sensation so
they think `I don't want to go there,''' said Lyman, who added that
the company may install the guards in Peterson's area.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies also report occasional damaged cables from
chewing, which causes signal leakage, or a ghosty television image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem the industry will continue to face as long as
there are squirrels,'' said Time Warner spokesman Peter Taubkin.
``Especially in areas with a lot of trees.'' Since the early 1990s
the company has used ``armored cable'' which consists of a steel
coating over all outdoor wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Stone didn't think the squirrel problem was going to go away
soon. ``Some people hate them and some people love them,'' he said.
``But the squirrels are here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not such a bad thing, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bright little creatures. They're attractive. They are
acrobatic. You have to admire their ability to leap from limb to
limb.''

   Added Charles Huntington, 28, another blender: ``It's a good
place, and just like any other place, we have problems, but we
always get over them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two full-time workers, covered in protective overalls and
hardhats, blend tons of ripe grapefruit each day using high-tech
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   During peak grapefruit season, trucks laden with fruit roll into
the company yard. There, ``kickers'' board trucks and literally
kick remaining fruit from the back of the vehicle onto a chute. The
grapefruit then pass along a conveyor belt, where ``graders'' check
for blemishes and rot, and cleanup crews clear the floors of rotten
grapefruit pulp and rind. According to the plantiffs, most of
these &UR;  &LR; workers are minorities. &UR;  &LR; The company said it could not
confirm the racial breakdown of employees.
</P>
<P>
   It is this alleged division of labor that has sparked tensions
at Ocean Spray's citrus division, causing African-American workers
to allege in the 27-page complaint that ``blacks are employed in
only dangerous and back-breaking positions regardless of experience
and seniority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a problem, we want to fix it,'' Nancy McDermott,
senior vice president for company operations and human resources,
said from Ocean Spray's satellite office in Plymouth, Mass. ``We're
frustrated. We do not know the truth. As best as we can determine,
there are no records of people coming forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Lockhart, one of the plaintiffs, claims he came forward
many times but no one listened. A 20-year employee who started as a
fruit kicker, Lockhart, 44, alleges he performed just about every
job at the plant during his tenure but his efforts were
unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even worked as a supervisor for second shift for two years,
but I never got the title of supervisor or the pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart admits that his responsibilities _ and his wages _ have
increased over time, from $5 per hour as a fruit kicker in 1978 to
$12.45 per hour today as a production coordinator. And although
Lockhart describes himself as the highest-paid African-American
employee at the citrus plant, there is more bitterness than pride
in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   A high &UR;  &LR; school graduate who says he was a supervisor in the
military, Lockhart alleges that a white worker who did not have a
diploma or Lockhart's experience was groomed by management for a
supervisory job and promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had this job I'm in now for six years, but I want to move
up,'' he said. ``I'd like to be a full supervisor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ike Jones has a similar story to tell. He started at the
company 12 years ago, fresh out of high school. Although Jones, 29,
of Fort Pierce, now works as a shipping clerk, he says he has
watched white workers with less on-the-job experience move further
in less time.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also accuses a white manager, identified in court
papers as Michael Saunders, of touching and making lewd remarks to
five African-American women and then threatening them with job loss
if they complained.
</P>
<P>
   Said Natalie Camper, a Massachusetts workplace expert who has
conducted diversity and sexual harassment training at Vero Beach
and other Ocean Spray plants: ``I can't imagine (Ocean Spray
making) many stupid responses to (employee) complaints at that
plant because everybody there has been educated.''
</P>
<P>
   But a second lawsuit filed in a Florida state court by Diane
Hinton, 44, of Wabasso, alleges she was threatened with loss of her
job in 1996 after complaining that Saunders had grabbed her
breasts. Saunders was later fired, according to the plaintiffs'
Fort Lauderdale lawyer, Barry Mandelkorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Saunders chose to resign in May,'' insists Ocean Spray's
Lewis. Saunders could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray officials argue all was quiet until six months ago,
when the company received a telephone call from Norman Ganz, a Fort
Lauderdale lawyer who has filed at least nine discrimination suits
against employers in the Indian River County area. The Ocean Spray
action brings that number to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray's McDermott says the company began negotiating with
Ganz but broke off talks when it became apparent that ``we would
not be allowed to talk to employees and really get to the bottom of
the charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers say the company offered a monetary settlement _ if the
plaintiffs resigned. After declining the offer, the plaintiffs
filed in federal court. They also retained Mandelkorn, another Fort
Lauderdale lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The switch in attorneys occurred after a federal magistrate in
the spring recommended that a US district judge fine Ganz $116,000
for ``guerrilla litigation'' and ``terrorist tactics'' in a
civil-rights lawsuit he brought against Subway.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Ganz built a lucrative practice primarily with
civil-rights cases in a county still marked by both subtle and
not-so-subtle discrimination. And, they say, he commanded large
settlements by scaring employers into settling.
</P>
<P>
   Ganz, who has moved out of his Fort Lauderdale office, could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Ocean Spray plant won't say so directly, but
there is a general feeling there that the company's legal problems
were brought about by Ganz's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is very puzzling and confusing,'' said Ted
Kucinsky, the citrus division's plant manager. ``It really makes
you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Gifford, Barbara King, 45, owner of Barbara King's
Beauty Supply Co., says she wasn't surprised by the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't go into a job expecting to stay at the bottom,''
King said from her perch behind the counter of her one-room stucco
shop along dusty Martin Luther King Blvd.

 &HT;    IN A ROYAL TEST CASE, RUSSIAN 'PRINCE' SEEKS TO RECLAIM LOST
ESTATE

   PETROVSKOYE, Russia _ Looking more like the servant than the
master of a Tolstoy novel, Yevgeny Meshchersky fingered his
moth-eaten trouser leg as he surveyed his ancestral home: a palace
with no roof, no windows and overgrown with summer weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky moved his family onto the decaying estate outside
Moscow about 18 months ago in an act of defiant homesteading,
adopting the title of prince but the life of a pauper.
</P>
<P>
   A former engineer in a Soviet-era ceramics factory in Ukraine,
Meshchersky, 47, claims direct lineage to one of old Russia's
prominent aristocratic families, whose tree reaches back some 800
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of my children is here on the land where their
ancestors are buried,'' he said as a July rainstorm pelted the
vegetable patch outside his broken-down mansion.
</P>
<P>
   He vows to restore the 18th-Century estate to its former glory
despite the Russian government, which contends he has no legal
rights to the property no matter what his last name.
</P>
<P>
   The lot of Russia's former nobility has gained renewed attention
with this week's controversy-tainted burial of the nation's last
czar, Nicholas II, and his family in St. Petersburg, 80 years after
their murder by a Bolshevik firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, the descendants of
Russia's imperial ruling class have made a half-hearted comeback
attempt. In a country where the Communist Party remains a political
power, nobility has delicately articulated its legal rights and
social standing taken in the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few like Meshchersky are trying to assert their
birthright in concrete terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Nobility Assembly, established in 1990, now counts
10,000 registered members in Russia and estimates that there are
another 100,000 Russians with lineage to the bygone bluebloods --
in a country of 147 million. Another 20,000 to 50,000 Russian
nobility live abroad, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group, which supports the establishment of a
constitutional monarchy in Russia, are assisting Meshchersky in his
test case.
</P>
<P>
   Post-communist Russia has not yet enacted any significant
restitution laws regarding the era of Soviet rule. Lower courts
have rejected Meshchersky's claims to the land. His case is now
before the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the burial of the czar's remains isn't as simple as
putting some bones in the ground, Meshchersky's land grab has
implications beyond mere property law. At issue is what role, if
any, nobility should play in the new Russian democracy and who
rightfully owns much of the land in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Moscow Times warned in an editorial that
Meshchersky's case could set a dangerous precedent. ``Russia simply
cannot afford the instability that would result'' if he won his
case, the newspaper said. ``Where would it end?''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the sensitive question of Russia's royalty and
their place in society, neither President Boris Yeltsin nor
Patriarch Alexy II, head of Russian Orthodox Church, plan to be at
the burial of the last czar on Friday. Neither will some of the
more prominent direct descendants from the Romanov family in a
dispute over whether the bones have been correctly identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas II was not a good czar and he betrayed his people.
But our predecessors swore an oath to him, and so we must pay him a
final tribute,'' Meshchersky said. ``I think the president and the
patriarch are betraying the memory of the czar.''
</P>
<P>
   A serious public debate on restoring the monarchy in Russia is
premature, said Prince Nikolai Romanov, head of the Association of
the House of the Romanovs, a group of descendants of Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is facing now numerous other problems that need to be
considered, and are acute,'' he told a news conference in St.
Petersburg earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Meshchersky calls for restoring the ``ancient traditions''
and he presumes to act as lord of the manor for the village of
Alabino, which has spilled onto his family lands in the eight
decades since his family fled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to act as judge and peacemaker for the people
here,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   With a hint of sarcasm, many villagers refer to him as prince.
Yet few seem to oppose his effort to claim the estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the prince. If he thinks he has
rights to the land, he should take it. Who knows these days, maybe
I could find documents that I am a prince,'' quipped Nikolai
Dulnev, a 37-year-old laborer, as he emerged from the village's
grocery story.
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky maintains a stiff upper lip, despite the miserable
conditions on the estate, which was completed in 1780 and abandoned
early in the Russian revolution by his great-grandfather and other
distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family -- wife Ludmilla, and four children ages 20 to
5 -- live in one of four mansions that surround the central,
column-studded palace, which was largely destroyed when Red Army
soldiers bombed it to scavenge for building materials.
</P>
<P>
   In Communist times, one of the mansions served as the village
post office and for a few years housed medical staff who worked at
the local clinic. But largely they were flop houses for drunks, and
the land became a dumping ground for rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky said it was painful to see the ruins for the first
time three years ago, but he proudly notes that more than 70 years
of neglect under Communism couldn't erase it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   History here is too deep, he said. Napoleon made his calamitous
retreat from Moscow on a road that ran near the estate, about 25
miles west of Moscow. Thirty French soldiers were held in the
stables as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't eat history and Meshchersky has been forced to
become a subsistence farmer in order to feed his family, who
endured a difficult winter. The building has only wood-burning
stoves and a makeshift electrical connection to run a few lights.
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky vows to stay on, saying that ongoing occupancy of
the estate is crucial to his legal case and to his agenda for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My genes allow me to run the country,'' he said. ``I know what
is needed for my lands, and I know what the country needs for its
rebirth.''

   ``Russia is facing now numerous other problems that need to be
considered, and are acute,'' he told a news conference in St.
Petersburg earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Meshchersky calls for restoring the ``ancient traditions''
and he presumes to act as lord of the manor for the village of
Alabino, which has spilled onto his family lands in the eight
decades since his family fled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to act as judge and peacemaker for the people
here,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   With a hint of sarcasm, many villagers refer to him as prince.
Yet few seem to oppose his effort to claim the estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the prince. If he thinks he has
rights to the land, he should take it. Who knows these days, maybe
I could find documents that I am a prince,'' quipped Nikolai
Dulnev, a 37-year-old laborer, as he emerged from the village's
grocery story.
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky maintains a stiff upper lip, despite the miserable
conditions on the estate, which was completed in 1780 and abandoned
early in the Russian revolution by his great-grandfather and other
distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family -- wife Ludmilla, and four children ages 20 to
5 -- live in one of four mansions that surround the central,
column-studded palace, which was largely destroyed when Red Army
soldiers bombed it to scavenge for building materials.
</P>
<P>
   In Communist times, one of the mansions served as the village
post office and for a few years housed medical staff who worked at
the local clinic. But largely they were flop houses for drunks, and
the land became a dumping ground for rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky said it was painful to see the ruins for the first
time three years ago, but he proudly notes that more than 70 years
of neglect under Communism couldn't erase it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   History here is too deep, he said. Napoleon made his calamitous
retreat from Moscow on a road that ran near the estate, about 25
miles west of Moscow. Thirty French soldiers were held in the
stables as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't eat history and Meshchersky has been forced to
become a subsistence farmer in order to feed his family, who
endured a difficult winter. The building has only wood-burning
stoves and a makeshift electrical connection to run a few lights.
</P>
<P>
   Meshchersky vows to stay on, saying that ongoing occupancy of
the estate is crucial to his legal case and to his agenda for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My genes allow me to run the country,'' he said. ``I know what
is needed for my lands, and I know what the country needs for its
rebirth.''

   TV-CRITIC (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Genius is a lot like spaghetti
sauce. Refreshing, piquant, and the thing that makes all the
difference between simple and simply divine. But sometimes it can
be awfully messy. Frank Lloyd Wright, always happy to admit his
genius, was a three-napkin mess maker in his personal life. America
will soon realize just how messy; Wright is the next entry in the
Ken Burns body of work on PBS (scheduled Nov. 10 and 11).

&HT;        BERKLEY LEADS MONEY RACE IN CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 15 -- Despite an embarrassing admission last
month that she told her former boss at the Las Vegas Sands Casino
to do favors for local politicians, Nevada Democrat Shelley Berkley
is winning the race that fuels successful congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley, a University of Nevada regent, is among 12 candidates
vying to fill the Las Vegas congressional seat being vacated by
two-term Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev. Ensign is leaving the 1st
District post this year to challenge Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Some political pundits speculated that Berkley, the heir
apparent to fill Ensign's seat, was politically damaged after she
admitted in June to telling a former casino executive to do favors
for Las Vegas politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley told Las Vegas Sands Chairman Sheldon Adelson in a 1996
memo that he should contribute to the political campaigns of local
judges because they would return the favor. Adelson criticized her
for suggesting the contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Berkley was secretly tape recorded by a friend
during a telephone conversation about her efforts to convince
Adelson to do favors for two local county commissioners, including
giving one a daiquiri concession and hiring the uncle of the other
to help obtain building permits for the construction of the $2
billion Venetian casino-hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But Berkley's admission doesn't seem to have hurt her
fund-raising ability. She has raised more than 10 times the amount
of money as her primary opponent and almost five times as much as
the two front-running candidates for the Republican nomination,
according to new financial disclosure reports due today at the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC reports detail how much money a candidate for federal
office has raised, who contributed and where the campaign funds
were spent. The FEC quarterly report covered the dates April 1
through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   While a well-funded campaign does not always guarantee a win,
money is needed to buy high-priced television advertising time.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley has raised about $354,000 this year, $179,000 of which
she collected in the last three months. Her fund-raising total has
hit $768,000, and she has $546,000 cash on hand. Berkley's
contributor list reads like a medical or law directory, although
she also received more than $12,000 in the past three months from
people associated with the hotel-and-casino industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the notable individual contributors to Berkley's
campaign include Las Vegas Dr. G. Michael Singh, $2,000, and MGM
Grand executive Alejandro Yemenidjian, $2,000. Berkley also
received $5,000 each from a number of political action committees
(PAC), including the United Steel Workers of America and the
Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   She also received $5,000 from Reid's Searchlight Leadership Fund
PAC and $1,000 from Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank's
campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley's Democratic primary opponent, local hotel-casino
floorman Clay Baty, has raised a paltry $520 over the past three
months, bringing his year-to-date campaign fund raising total to
$3,520. Baty lists $1,500 cash on hand, nearly equal to the $1,155
in loans made to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two front-runners for the GOP nomination, former Judge Don
Chairez and Prime Cable Account Executive Esther Quisenberry, are
neck-and-neck as they try to raise campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Chairez has raised $81,000, all during the second quarter of
this year. He has spent very little on his campaign, presumably
saving it for a big television buy right before the primary.
Chairez has $77,000 cash on hand, including a $25,000 loan made to
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Quisenberry raised $52,000 during April, May and June -- giving
her a year-to-date total of $81,000. But Quisenberry has spent
$38,000, leaving her campaign with $43,000 cash on hand, a little
more than half of what Chairez has in the bank.

TV VIEWS SHOULD PREPARE FOR THE WORST THIS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Actors, producers, executives, flaks and other
television types are gathered in Pasadena, Calif., this month for
one reason: to descend upon TV critics and convince them that their
shows _ all of their shows _ are destined to be great hits.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of shows. That would be a lot of hits. But here is
a question from a newcomer: If all these shows are hits, where do
all the lame ones come from?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some of these bad shows look good on paper. Most turn out
to be merely bland _ think ``Step By Step'' _ which run their
course over several months or seasons without distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Some become epic failures, like ``Supertrain'' or ``Cop Rock''
or ``Hello, Larry,'' the vehicle MacLean Stevenson used to wreck
his career. There should be something in his honor, the MacLean
Stevenson (Memorial) Award for disastrous professional moves. Past
winners would include Wayne Rogers, Shelley Long, David Caruso and
this year's designee, Susan Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many good shows that fail for lack of audience
or backing (``Murder One,'' ``Nothing Sacred''), most cancellations
show some promise in production, but never mature artistically or
commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those that don't have a shot, which begs the
question: ``What were the makers thinking?'' Brace yourself for
some scary bad shows coming out of California this fall.
</P>
<P>
   (``Fantasy Island''? ``Hollywood Squares''? Again? Can remakes
of ``Man From Atlantis'' and ``Holmes and Yoyo'' be far behind?)
</P>
<P>
   But these pale in comparison to The Worst Ever, the singular
show that can be identified objectively. The star was Jackie
Gleason. The show was ``You're in the Picture,'' born Jan. 20,
1961, died Jan. 20, 1961. It lasted only one episode.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1960, CBS had a bomb on its hands with its 9:30
p.m. Friday slot in ``Mr. Garlund,'' a tepid adventure starring the
unforgettable Charles Quinlivan (OK, I never heard of him, either).
Stories of intrigue around international business did not grab an
audience, even after the name was changed to ``The Garlund Touch''
a few months after its premiere. By January, the show was axed and
CBS had a half hour to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Who could fill it better than the star of ``The Jackie Gleason
Show'' and ``The Honeymooners''? Gleason could make people laugh
just staring into the camera. That would have made better
television than ``You're in the Picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Here was the premise. Four celebrity panelists _ Arthur
Treacher, Keenan Wynn, Pat Carroll and Jan Sterling _ stuck their
heads through cutouts (the kind you see at a fair or ballpark). The
difference was that the panelists didn't know what the scenes were
accompanying their faces. They would ask questions to host Gleason
who would provide clues. Once a cutout was identified, they moved
on to the next cutout.
</P>
<P>
   This was live television. The thought behind this was the witty
Gleason could ad-lib his way through a humorous half hour. It
turned out the only thing funny was that it ever got on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, Gleason, apparently recovered from his brief bout
of insanity, did something brilliant: He said CBS blew it, and
apologized. ``Honesty is the best policy,'' he said. ``We had a
show last week that laid the biggest bomb. I've seen bombs in my
day, but this one made the H-bomb look like a two-inch salute.''
May the wretched shows that come out this fall die as noble a
death.

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT NEXT SUBJECT FOR KEN BURNS ON PBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Genius is a lot like spaghetti sauce.
Refreshing, piquant, and the thing that makes all the difference
between simple and simply divine. But sometimes it can be awfully
messy.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright, always happy to admit his genius, was a
three-napkin mess maker in his personal life. America will soon
realize just how messy; Wright is the next entry in the Ken Burns
body of work on PBS (scheduled Nov. 10 and 11).
</P>
<P>
   Burns notes that the great architect once said he purposely
chose ``honest arrogance'' over ``hypocritical humility'' as the
guiding principle of his personality. To someone like Wright, a man
who abandoned his family and courted scandal the way most people
shop for groceries, honest humility wasn't even an option.
</P>
<P>
   Burns yesterday said Wright was American in every way _ ``a
perfect symbol of the genius, the conflict and the inspiration of
the century, what we call the American century.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour biography of Wright doesn't stint on the ugly
stuff, but Burns said questions about personality and art always
crop up when studying the lives of great individuals. He said the
good and the bad must be taken in balance. In other words, we don't
have to like the guy, but, Burns concluded: ``You stand in a Wright
building and it's like the difference between a guy who paints and
Rembrandt.''
</P>
<P>
   For a look at genius less messy, PBS's ``American Masters''
series profiles Leonard Bernstein (scheduled Oct. 28). Though
Bernstein had his moments of self-doubt and despair, his brother,
Burton, remembers him as a happy, curious musical genius. ``He was
omnivorous in his intellectuality and his love of everything,'' he
said. ``That is the key to Lenny.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's helpful hint: How to address a prince who also happens
to be a TV producer. Publicity material identifies Prince Edward,
seventh in line to the English throne, as Edward Windsor, founder
of Ardent Productions. PBS publicist Harry Forbes advised the
teeming masses of TV critics gathered in Pasadena that, in
addressing the prince, ``It's not Prince Edward, it's not Mr.
Windsor, it's just Edward.''
</P>
<P>
   Allrighty then. As for ``Crown and Country,'' a six-part
exploration of England's great historical sites, including a few to
which he was given extraordinary access, Edward didn't really say
much. Royal mum's the word, except for Edward's expectation that
Americans are willing to give him the benefit of any doubt about
his qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our country we just have hang-ups about titles, which I
don't think you have so much in this country,'' he said. ``So if I
come to this country and talk to people about producing programs,
people will just accept that that's what I'm here to talk about. In
Britain, if you've got a title, then you obviously don't have any
brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired of all those British accents on ``Masterpiece Theatre''?
PBS said it is creating ``Mobil Masterpiece Theatre's American
Collection'' to bring American literature to U.S. audiences. Nine
films over three years are on the drawing board, including Willa
Cather's ``The Song of the Lark'' and Langston Hughes' ``Cora
Unashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Network Television has signed Burt Reynolds to star in
three pictures about a tough but honest cop who is framed by his
department, goes to jail, gets out and goes searching for the only
witness who can clear him. Reynolds also directs the first of this
``Hard Time'' trilogy, due to premiere Dec. 13, and it's one of the
reasons he took the TNT offer.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said he's also indebted to Ted Turner for the fact that
young people seem to know who he is, even if they haven't seen
``Boogie Nights,'' the film that resurrected his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Turner seemed to have Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds
film festivals on the weekends,'' Reynolds said, ``and I feel very
grateful to him for that.''

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ever since she was a mere 64 years old, Sylvia Jaffe has been
traveling to Pietrasanta, Italy, leading a group of fellow
sculptors to ply their art where Michelangelo once worked his magic
in marble.
 &HT;    Jaffe is a sculptor/instructor at the Boca Raton Museum of Art
in Florida, who again will lead a group of artists to the Tuscany
region of Italy in August and September.
 &HT;    She has had students as young as 30 and as old at 93 with skill
levels of all ranges, including beginner.
 &HT;    She has spent 20 summers in Pietrasanta, as she says, ``learning
from master artisans and inspired by the mountains of stone around
me ...
 &HT;    ``This is not a package trip,'' Jaffe stresses. But she has made
arrangements for the students to stay in one of two Pietrasanta
hotels and to work in a fully equipped marble studio five days a
week.
 &HT;    ``We share the cost of renting cars while in Italy,'' she says.
``On weekends we travel to nearby cities and towns where we visit
museums, churches and other points of interest. Sometimes during
the week we break early for a picnic or take walking tours of other
artists' studios. This year's itinerary includes a two-day trip to
Rome.''
 &HT;    Students will select their own stones, which are cut to size and
placed on their own personal work tables for the 20 working days.

morning carving, to the group lunch, to the afternoon working, to

accommodations and airfare _ is about $6,000 for the month. For

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ever since she was a mere 64 years old, Sylvia Jaffe has been
traveling to Pietrasanta, Italy, leading a group of fellow
sculptors to ply their art where Michelangelo once worked his magic
in marble.
 &HT;    Jaffe is a sculptor/instructor at the Boca Raton Museum of Art
in Florida, who again will lead a group of artists to the Tuscany
region of Italy in August and September.
 &HT;    She has had students as young as 30 and as old at 93 with skill
levels of all ranges, including beginner.
 &HT;    She has spent 20 summers in Pietrasanta, as she says, ``learning
from master artisans and inspired by the mountains of stone around
me ...
 &HT;    ``This is not a package trip,'' Jaffe stresses. But she has made
arrangements for the students to stay in one of two Pietrasanta
hotels and to work in a fully equipped marble studio five days a
week.
 &HT;    ``We share the cost of renting cars while in Italy,'' she says.
``On weekends we travel to nearby cities and towns where we visit
museums, churches and other points of interest. Sometimes during
the week we break early for a picnic or take walking tours of other
artists' studios. This year's itinerary includes a two-day trip to
Rome.''
 &HT;    Students will select their own stones, which are cut to size and
placed on their own personal work tables for the 20 working days.
 &HT;    Trained artisans are available to the students. Spouses who

 &HT;    
 By DAVID E. SANGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Washington has always been a city of multiple personalities.
 &HT;    There is monumental Washington, the mecca for tourists who line
up for the White House tour, wander the statue-lined halls of
Congress and cram the National Air and Space Museum.
 &HT;    There is green Washington, the leafy parks and residential
neighborhoods of Northwest, and the jogging routes through Rock
Creek Park and along the C&AMP;O Canal.
 &HT;    And there is dysfunctional Washington, the world's most famously
mismanaged capital, parts of which are plagued by crime, troubled
schools and deeply impoverished neighborhoods where few tour buses
stray.
 &HT;    But this city of a thousand movie scenes defies typecasting. In
a long afternoon stroll, it is easy to move from the new Franklin
D. Roosevelt Memorial, past the Watergate (known to a new
generation of scandal buffs as the home of Monica Lewinsky), up
through Georgetown and into the woods near the vice president's
official residence. There, deer still wander, only three miles from
the White House.
 &HT;    In the summer, Washington changes hands. Congress is itching to
get out by late July, and by early August, the Red Line, the subway
artery for the city's standing army of lawyers, deal makers,
journalists and bureaucrats, is overrun by tourists headed for the
Mall and the National Zoo. (Alas, only one of the city's two famous
pandas has survived the rigors of Washington life.)
 &HT;    For visitors, getting in and out of Washington is becoming
easier. The recently renamed Washington Reagan National Airport
finally has its new (if somewhat garish) main terminal, and without
stepping outside, you can catch Metro trains to downtown. But for
cheaper airfares, check out the more-distant Baltimore-Washington
Airport.
 &HT;    For train travelers, Amtrak lowers rates in summer (especially
for kids) and it drops you exactly where you want to be: the
refurbished Union Station, within sight of Capitol Hill. The
station is filled with boutiques and places to eat, and is a
retreat from the Washington heat.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    For a touch of 1870s Paris, the National Gallery's East Building
is presenting ``Manet, Monet, and the Gare St.-Lazare,'' through
Sept. 20.
 &HT;    Some of the paintings are familiar: the eerie ``Chemin de Fer''
along with 19 other of Manet works, many inspired by scenes just
outside his studio. There are also 14 works by Monet, and five by
Gustav Caillebotte. Admission is free. Hours: Monday to Saturday 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Information: (202)
737-4215.
 &HT;    Just off the Mall, and into the air-conditioning, a visitor
might start at the National Portrait Gallery, Eighth and F Streets,
N.W., for ``Celebrity Caricature in America,'' a collection of
show-biz drawings by Al Hirschfeld, running till Aug. 23. Don't
miss the portrait of Babe Ruth.
 &HT;    Then drop in at the National Museum of American History, 14th
Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., to check out the re-creation
of an El Monte, Calif., sweatshop, part of ``Between a Rock and a
Hard Place: A Dialogue on American Sweatshops,'' an exhibit through
Oct. 30 about how immigrants have been treated on American shores.
 &HT;    At the Freer Gallery of Art, on the Mall at 12th Street and
Jefferson Drive, there is a new exhibit of Islamic art, featuring
calligraphy from the Koran and manuscripts that date from the ninth
century. Calligraphy aficionados will also find early 17th-century
works from Kyoto, Japan. The Freer's permanent exhibit of Japanese
screens is among the best this side of the Pacific.
 &HT;    These museums are open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. Information:
(202) 357-2700.
 &HT;    From now until Oct. 24, the Folger Shakespeare Library, 201 East
Capitol St., S.E., is showing ``Papers and Porcelains,'' a
collection of late 18th- and 19th-century tinted sheets, pastoral
and military scenes. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.;
(202) 544-7077.
 &HT;    Wolf Trap, the open-air concert center in nearby Vienna, Va.,
has a jammed summer schedule, ranging from jazz to Mozart. Mary
Chapin Carpenter sings on July 17, 18 and 19 at 8 p.m. ($30 and
$18), and Ray Charles on Aug. 11 ($27 and $16).
 &HT;    The Wolf Trap Opera Company turns to Mozart's ``Abduction From
the Seraglio'' on July 24, 26, and 28 ($45). It is the perfect
Washington opera: Nasty villains and a wise ruler who, in a
reminder of a less voluble age of government, sings not a word.
 &HT;    For tickets to any Wolf Trap performance and schedules, call
(800) 955-5566 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, or visit
www.wolf-trap.org on the Web.
 &HT;    The fast way to Wolf Trap is the Orange Line to West Falls
Church, where a shuttle bus leaves every 20 minutes for $3.50 round
trip.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum has its usual permanent
array of aircraft and temporary shows.
 &HT;    The ``Star Wars: The Magic of Myth'' exhibit, on through
October, is free, but tickets must be picked up starting at 9:45
a.m. or in advance through Protix, (800) 529-2440, for a $3.25
service fee.
 &HT;    Anyone with a real aviation bug, however, should make it out to
the Garber Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in
Suitland, Md., east of the city. This is where the Smithsonian
keeps 90 percent of its aircraft and rockets, and where its staff
restores old planes, buffs up rocket engines and pieces together
propellers. Some buildings are open as a no-frill museum.
 &HT;    Reservations are required two weeks ahead for tours, at 10 a.m.
daily plus 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, lasting three hours;
(202) 357-1400.
 &HT;    At the National Zoo, the 3000 block of Connecticut Avenue, N.W.,
just north of the Woodley-Zoo subway stop, Amazonia is a magical
rain forest complete with dense vines, vegetation and aquatic life
and plenty of microscopes for hands-on exhibits.
 &HT;    A new exhibit, ``Birds of Paradise Lost,'' is filled with song
birds from Hawaii, including the brilliant orange iiwi. The zoo is
open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in summer. Admission is free, but
parking costs $1 to $10; (202) 673-4800.
 &HT;    Some of the better hiking adventures are near downtown. My
4-year-old son, Andrew, delights in the paths, streams and old
stone bridges behind Dumbarton Oaks.
 &HT;    The museum, (202) 339-6400, with its collection of Byzantine and
pre-Columbian art, is open only from 2 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Sunday ($1 contribution) and the gardens 2 to 6 p.m. daily ($4
admission), but the paths, which reach down into Rock Creek Park,
are accessible any time from the back of Montrose Park, next to
Dumbarton Oaks on R Street in Georgetown.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Grand Hyatt, 1000 H St., N.W., near 11th Street, has 900
rooms and is well situated: above Metro Center, where all the
city's subways come together.
 &HT;    Summer rates range from $139 to $290 depending on availability,
based on double occupancy. It also has a series of good restaurants
in a cool atrium that is a popular escape from the summer heat;
(800) 233-1234, fax (202) 628-1641.
 &HT;    The Washington Westin, 2350 M St., N.W., is equidistant from
downtown and Georgetown and has 263 modern rooms. Summer rates are
$109 on weekends, $179 during the week. Try the Cafe on M for lunch
and the M Street Grill, by the inner courtyard, for more formal
fare; (800) 848-0016, fax (202) 857-0127.
 &HT;    Budget: Each of the 195 rooms has a full kitchen at the St.
James Hotel, 950 24th St., N.W., an all-suite hotel. Continental
breakfast is included, and there is a good outdoor pool. Rates
begin at $89 on the weekends, and $125 during the week. It is a
short walk to the Kennedy Center, and even shorter to the Foggy
Bottom Metro station; (800) 852-8512, fax (202) 466-6484.
 &HT;    Luxury: Hotel George, 15 E St., N.W., near North Capitol Street,
is a four-month-old 139-room luxury ultra-modern contemporary hotel
on Capital Hill, near Union Station. In July and August, rates are
reduced to $109 (from the usual $185 to $240), and suites start at
$200, including Continental breakfast and parking; (800) 576-8331,
fax (202) 347-4213.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    One of the best new restaurants in Washington is Greenwood at
Cleveland Park, 3529 Connecticut Ave., N.W., a small place named
for its chef, Carole Wagner Greenwood. It serves an eclectic mix of
California-style seasonal cuisine, like smoke salmon stack with
avocado goat cheese for an appetizer, and lightly grilled tuna
filet served very rare.
 &HT;    Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine came to $96. Open
for dinner daily, except Monday; (202) 833-6572.
 &HT;    Citronelle, in the Latham Hotel at 3000 M St., N.W., in
Georgetown, is making a comeback after a total renovation. A former
assistant White House pastry chef, Ann Amernick, does the desserts.
 &HT;    Dinners run north of $70 to $75 a person with wine, but it's
worth it, and there is plenty of people-watching. Try the red
snapper or the lamb, and the almond polenta for dessert. Daily
dinner except Sunday; (202) 625-2150.
 &HT;    Great Japanese cuisine can be found in a tiny sliver of a
restaurant called Makoto, 4822 MacArthur Blvd., N.W., north of
Georgetown. It has a sushi bar tended by several chefs trained in
similarly wonderful holes-in-the-wall in Tokyo.
 &HT;    At the restaurant's four tables, you can get the chef's special
six- to 10-course meal for $38 a person. Closed Monday and for
lunch Sunday; (202) 298-6866.
 &HT;    There are plenty of vegetarian selections at the Lebanese
Taverna, 2641 Connecticut Ave., N.W. Try the mehshi bel zeit _
eggplant, zucchini and bell pepper stuffed with rice and spices.
There is pleasant sidewalk dining at lunch and dinner, but

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By DAVID E. SANGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Washington has always been a city of multiple personalities.
 &HT;    There is monumental Washington, the mecca for tourists who line
up for the White House tour, wander the statue-lined halls of
Congress and cram the National Air and Space Museum.
 &HT;    There is green Washington, the leafy parks and residential
neighborhoods of Northwest, and the jogging routes through Rock
Creek Park and along the C&AMP;O Canal.
 &HT;    And there is dysfunctional Washington, the world's most famously
mismanaged capital, parts of which are plagued by crime, troubled
schools and deeply impoverished neighborhoods where few tour buses
stray.
 &HT;    But this city of a thousand movie scenes defies typecasting. In
a long afternoon stroll, it is easy to move from the new Franklin
D. Roosevelt Memorial, past the Watergate (known to a new
generation of scandal buffs as the home of Monica Lewinsky), up
through Georgetown and into the woods near the vice president's
official residence. There, deer still wander, only three miles from
the White House.
 &HT;    In the summer, Washington changes hands. Congress is itching to
get out by late July, and by early August, the Red Line, the subway
artery for the city's standing army of lawyers, deal makers,
journalists and bureaucrats, is overrun by tourists headed for the
Mall and the National Zoo. (Alas, only one of the city's two famous
pandas has survived the rigors of Washington life.)
 &HT;    For visitors, getting in and out of Washington is becoming
easier. The recently renamed Washington Reagan National Airport
finally has its new (if somewhat garish) main terminal, and without
stepping outside, you can catch Metro trains to downtown. But for
cheaper airfares, check out the more-distant Baltimore-Washington
Airport.
 &HT;    For train travelers, Amtrak lowers rates in summer (especially
for kids) and it drops you exactly where you want to be: the
refurbished Union Station, within sight of Capitol Hill. The
station is filled with boutiques and places to eat, and is a
retreat from the Washington heat.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    For a touch of 1870s Paris, the National Gallery's East Building
is presenting ``Manet, Monet, and the Gare St.-Lazare,'' through
Sept. 20.
 &HT;    Some of the paintings are familiar: the eerie ``Chemin de Fer''
along with 19 other of Manet works, many inspired by scenes just
outside his studio. There are also 14 works by Monet, and five by
Gustav Caillebotte. Admission is free. Hours: Monday to Saturday 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Information: (202)
737-4215.
 &HT;    Just off the Mall, and into the air-conditioning, a visitor
might start at the National Portrait Gallery, Eighth and F Streets,
N.W., for ``Celebrity Caricature in America,'' a collection of
show-biz drawings by Al Hirschfeld, running till Aug. 23. Don't
miss the portrait of Babe Ruth.
 &HT;    Then drop in at the National Museum of American History, 14th
Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., to check out the re-creation
of an El Monte, Calif., sweatshop, part of ``Between a Rock and a
Hard Place: A Dialogue on American Sweatshops,'' an exhibit through
Oct. 30 about how immigrants have been treated on American shores.
 &HT;    At the Freer Gallery of Art, on the Mall at 12th Street and
Jefferson Drive, there is a new exhibit of Islamic art, featuring
calligraphy from the Koran and manuscripts that date from the ninth
century. Calligraphy aficionados will also find early 17th-century
works from Kyoto, Japan. The Freer's permanent exhibit of Japanese
screens is among the best this side of the Pacific.
 &HT;    These museums are open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. Information:
(202) 357-2700.
 &HT;    From now until Oct. 24, the Folger Shakespeare Library, 201 East
Capitol St., S.E., is showing ``Papers and Porcelains,'' a
collection of late 18th- and 19th-century tinted sheets, pastoral
and military scenes. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.;
(202) 544-7077.
 &HT;    Wolf Trap, the open-air concert center in nearby Vienna, Va.,
has a jammed summer schedule, ranging from jazz to Mozart. Mary
Chapin Carpenter sings on July 17, 18 and 19 at 8 p.m. ($30 and
$18), and Ray Charles on Aug. 11 ($27 and $16).
 &HT;    The Wolf Trap Opera Company turns to Mozart's ``Abduction From
the Seraglio'' on July 24, 26, and 28 ($45). It is the perfect
Washington opera: Nasty villains and a wise ruler who, in a
reminder of a less voluble age of government, sings not a word.
 &HT;    For tickets to any Wolf Trap performance and schedules, call
(800) 955-5566 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, or visit
www.wolf-trap.org on the Web.
 &HT;    The fast way to Wolf Trap is the Orange Line to West Falls
Church, where a shuttle bus leaves every 20 minutes for $3.50 round
trip.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum has its usual permanent
array of aircraft and temporary shows.
 &HT;    The ``Star Wars: The Magic of Myth'' exhibit, on through
October, is free, but tickets must be picked up starting at 9:45
a.m. or in advance through Protix, (800) 529-2440, for a $3.25
service fee.
 &HT;    Anyone with a real aviation bug, however, should make it out to
the Garber Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in
Suitland, Md., east of the city. This is where the Smithsonian
keeps 90 percent of its aircraft and rockets, and where its staff
restores old planes, buffs up rocket engines and pieces together
propellers. Some buildings are open as a no-frill museum.
 &HT;    Reservations are required two weeks ahead for tours, at 10 a.m.
daily plus 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, lasting three hours;
(202) 357-1400.
 &HT;    At the National Zoo, the 3000 block of Connecticut Avenue, N.W.,
just north of the Woodley-Zoo subway stop, Amazonia is a magical
rain forest complete with dense vines, vegetation and aquatic life
and plenty of microscopes for hands-on exhibits.
 &HT;    A new exhibit, ``Birds of Paradise Lost,'' is filled with song
birds from Hawaii, including the brilliant orange iiwi. The zoo is
open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in summer. Admission is free, but
parking costs $1 to $10; (202) 673-4800.
 &HT;    Some of the better hiking adventures are near downtown. My
4-year-old son, Andrew, delights in the paths, streams and old
stone bridges behind Dumbarton Oaks.
 &HT;    The museum, (202) 339-6400, with its collection of Byzantine and
pre-Columbian art, is open only from 2 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Sunday ($1 contribution) and the gardens 2 to 6 p.m. daily ($4
admission), but the paths, which reach down into Rock Creek Park,
are accessible any time from the back of Montrose Park, next to
Dumbarton Oaks on R Street in Georgetown.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Grand Hyatt, 1000 H St., N.W., near 11th Street, has 900
rooms and is well situated: above Metro Center, where all the
city's subways come together.
 &HT;    Summer rates range from $139 to $290 depending on availability,
based on double occupancy. It also has a series of good restaurants
in a cool atrium that is a popular escape from the summer heat;
(800) 233-1234, fax (202) 628-1641.
 &HT;    The Washington Westin, 2350 M St., N.W., is equidistant from
downtown and Georgetown and has 263 modern rooms. Summer rates are
$109 on weekends, $179 during the week. Try the Cafe on M for lunch
and the M Street Grill, by the inner courtyard, for more formal
fare; (800) 848-0016, fax (202) 857-0127.
 &HT;    Budget: Each of the 195 rooms has a full kitchen at the St.
James Hotel, 950 24th St., N.W., an all-suite hotel. Continental
breakfast is included, and there is a good outdoor pool. Rates
begin at $89 on the weekends, and $125 during the week. It is a
short walk to the Kennedy Center, and even shorter to the Foggy
Bottom Metro station; (800) 852-8512, fax (202) 466-6484.
 &HT;    Luxury: Hotel George, 15 E St., N.W., near North Capitol Street,
is a four-month-old 139-room luxury ultra-modern contemporary hotel
on Capital Hill, near Union Station. In July and August, rates are
reduced to $109 (from the usual $185 to $240), and suites start at
$200, including Continental breakfast and parking; (800) 576-8331,
fax (202) 347-4213.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    One of the best new restaurants in Washington is Greenwood at
Cleveland Park, 3529 Connecticut Ave., N.W., a small place named
for its chef, Carole Wagner Greenwood. It serves an eclectic mix of
California-style seasonal cuisine, like smoke salmon stack with
avocado goat cheese for an appetizer, and lightly grilled tuna
filet served very rare.
 &HT;    Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine came to $96. Open
for dinner daily, except Monday; (202) 833-6572.
 &HT;    Citronelle, in the Latham Hotel at 3000 M St., N.W., in
Georgetown, is making a comeback after a total renovation. A former
assistant White House pastry chef, Ann Amernick, does the desserts.
 &HT;    Dinners run north of $70 to $75 a person with wine, but it's
worth it, and there is plenty of people-watching. Try the red
snapper or the lamb, and the almond polenta for dessert. Daily
dinner except Sunday; (202) 625-2150.
 &HT;    Great Japanese cuisine can be found in a tiny sliver of a
restaurant called Makoto, 4822 MacArthur Blvd., N.W., north of
Georgetown. It has a sushi bar tended by several chefs trained in
similarly wonderful holes-in-the-wall in Tokyo.
 &HT;    At the restaurant's four tables, you can get the chef's special
six- to 10-course meal for $38 a person. Closed Monday and for
lunch Sunday; (202) 298-6866.
 &HT;    There are plenty of vegetarian selections at the Lebanese
Taverna, 2641 Connecticut Ave., N.W. Try the mehshi bel zeit _
eggplant, zucchini and bell pepper stuffed with rice and spices.
There is pleasant sidewalk dining at lunch and dinner, but
reservations are available only to 6:30 p.m. Dinner is about $20 a
person, without drinks; (202) 265-8681.
 &HT;    Asian cuisine of all kinds can be found at Oodles Noodles,
downtown at 1120 19th St., N.W. The Malaysian shrimp is spicy and
the pad Thai is delicious. Lunch or dinner for two with drinks is
about $30; (202) 293-3138.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Since this summer's travel season is shaping up to be the
busiest in years, consumers need every bit of help they can to take
the sting out of their vacation's price tag.
 &HT;    Here are a few suggestions for those who've yet to make their
summer plans.
 FREQUENT-FLIER MILES  
 &HT;    For travelers who have a stash of frequent-flier miles, Randy
Petersen, editor of InsideFlyer (4715-C Town Center Drive, Colorado
Springs, Colo. 90816; 800-333-5937) has this advice: ``Don't even
think of using miles to go to New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Orlando, Chicago or Las Vegas. The same is true for Boston, Denver,
Phoenix or Seattle. These are all top places for people to redeem
their awards, and those awards are pretty much already taken.''
 &HT;    But, on a more encouraging note, he advises looking for seats to
Tucson, Ariz.; Key West, Jacksonville and Sarasota, Fla.;
Indianapolis, Ind.; Portland, Ore.; Nashville, Tenn.; Austin and
San Antonio, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wis.
 &HT;    ``Since San Francisco is hard, consider flying to Oakland
instead,'' Petersen recommends. ``And Honolulu is tough, so think
about flying to Kona. As for Denver, look to Colorado Springs as an
alternative.''
 &HT;    Petersen also has some advice about international travel,
suggesting that travelers look to new airline routes. That means
Dublin and Edinburgh for Continental and the new seven-times-a-week
service to Hong Kong that United Airlines is offering.
 AIRLINE TICKETS  
 &HT;    A good source of bargains for last-minute travelers is the
Internet. American Airlines (www.americanair.com) has Net SAAver
Fares _ last-minute, round-trip deals that are posted every week to
subscribers via e-mail.
 &HT;    International deals are listed on Mondays, domestic deals on
Wednesdays. The e-mail subscription is offered for free.
 &HT;    Most flights originate at the airline's hub cities of Chicago,
Dallas and Miami. These deals are good for long weekend travel from
either Thursday to Monday or Friday to Monday or Tuesday.
 &HT;    American also offers discounted first-class fares every week.
And the Web site offers tickets for longer stays.
 &HT;    Look also to U.S. Airways (www.usairways.com) and Continental
(www.flycontinental.com) for weekly e-mail specials.
 &HT;    TWA (www.twa.com) has Trans World Specials, and Cathay Pacific
(www.cathaypacific(TILDE)air.com) sends deals out periodically.
Many of these airline sites also offer well-priced car-rental and
hotel deals too.
 &HT;    For price-sensitive travelers, Priceline.com (www.priceline.com)
is the newest source for airline tickets. A traveler logs onto this
site, decides what price he would like to pay for a round-trip
ticket, makes the request and guarantees it with a major credit
card.
 &HT;    Within one hour for domestic travel and 24 hours for
international trips, travelers can learn whether an airline has
agreed to release a seat and which flights and routing are
provided. Tickets are non-refundable, non-exchangeable and do not
earn frequent-flier miles.
 CONSOLIDATOR TICKETS  
 &HT;    This is the time of year when consolidator tickets to major
European cities can offer the best trans-Atlantic values around.
 &HT;    But the downside to these discounted tickets is that they are
usually not refundable, transferrable or good for frequent-flier
mileage credit.
 &HT;    These tickets are also typically non-endorsable, which means in
the event of a delay or cancellation, they cannot be used to travel
on another airline.
 &HT;    Many travel agents will procure these tickets. However, for
those who wish to do it themselves, one of the largest
consolidators around is Council Travel (205 East 42nd St., New
York, N.Y. 10017; 800-226-8624; www.ciee.org).
 ADVENTURE TRAVEL  
 &HT;    For anyone who needs a rafting, climbing, caving, biking or
sea-kayaking fix, the links provided by GORP, the Great Outdoors
Recreation Pages (www.gorp.com), could be useful, as could the
Outdoor Action Guide to Outdoor Resources
(www.princeton.edu/(TILDE)oa/outother.html). It's a quick way to
find out which companies still have space on a bike trip to the
Tetons or a hike in Maine.
 HOTELS  
 &HT;    Weekday and weekend hotel discounts exist, but consumers may
find they have to ask for them.
 &HT;    The same is true for discounts provided for members of
automobile clubs like the Automobile Association of America (AAA)
and organizations like the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP).
 &HT;    Hotel brokers can offer larger discounts of 10 percent to 50
percent off the ``rack'' or published rate at select city and
resort properties throughout the country. Here's a short list.
 &HT;    Accommodations Express (801 Asbury Ave., Ocean City, N.J. 08226;
800-444-7666; www.accomodationsexp.com)
 &HT;    Branson Nights Reservations (P.O. Box 2321, Branson, Mo. 65616;
800-329-9999; www.branson-nights.com) works just with hotels in
Branson, Mo.
 &HT;    Capitol Reservations (1730 Rhode Island Ave. NW, Suite 1114,
Washington, D.C. 20036; 800-847-4832; www.hotelsdc.com) deals only
with properties in the Washington D.C. area.
 &HT;    Central Reservation Service (505 Maitland Ave., Suite 100,
Altamonte Springs, Fla. 32701;
800-548-3311;www.reservation(AT)america.com)
 &HT;    Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-356-1123; www.express-res.com) works only with hotels in New
York and Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut Hill Lane, Suite 203,

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Since this summer's travel season is shaping up to be the
busiest in years, consumers need every bit of help they can to take
the sting out of their vacation's price tag.
 &HT;    Here are a few suggestions for those who've yet to make their
summer plans.
 FREQUENT-FLIER MILES  
 &HT;    For travelers who have a stash of frequent-flier miles, Randy
Petersen, editor of InsideFlyer (4715-C Town Center Drive, Colorado
Springs, Colo. 90816; 800-333-5937) has this advice: ``Don't even
think of using miles to go to New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Orlando, Chicago or Las Vegas. The same is true for Boston, Denver,
Phoenix or Seattle. These are all top places for people to redeem
their awards, and those awards are pretty much already taken.''
 &HT;    But, on a more encouraging note, he advises looking for seats to
Tucson, Ariz.; Key West, Jacksonville and Sarasota, Fla.;
Indianapolis, Ind.; Portland, Ore.; Nashville, Tenn.; Austin and
San Antonio, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wis.
 &HT;    ``Since San Francisco is hard, consider flying to Oakland
instead,'' Petersen recommends. ``And Honolulu is tough, so think
about flying to Kona. As for Denver, look to Colorado Springs as an
alternative.''
 &HT;    Petersen also has some advice about international travel,
suggesting that travelers look to new airline routes. That means
Dublin and Edinburgh for Continental and the new seven-times-a-week
service to Hong Kong that United Airlines is offering.
 AIRLINE TICKETS  
 &HT;    A good source of bargains for last-minute travelers is the
Internet. American Airlines (www.americanair.com) has Net SAAver
Fares _ last-minute, round-trip deals that are posted every week to
subscribers via e-mail.
 &HT;    International deals are listed n Mondays, domestic deals on
Wednesdays. The e-mail subscription is offered for free.
 &HT;    Most flights originate at the airline's hub cities of Chicago,
Dallas and Miami. These deals are good for long weekend travel from
either Thursday to Monday or Friday to Monday or Tuesday.
 &HT;    American also offers discounted first-class fares every week.
And the Web site offers tickets for longer stays.
 &HT;    Look also to U.S. Airways (www.usairways.com) and Continental
(www.flycontinental.com) for weekly e-mail specials.
 &HT;    TWA (www.twa.com) has Trans World Specials, and Cathay Pacific
(www.cathaypacific(TILDE)air.com) sends deals out periodically.
Many of these airline sites also offer well-priced car-rental and
hotel deals too.
 &HT;    For price-sensitive travelers, Priceline.com (www.priceline.com)
is the newest source for airline tickets. A traveler logs onto this
site, decides what price he would like to pay for a round-trip
ticket, makes the request and guarantees it with a major credit
card.
 &HT;    Within one hour for domestic travel and 24 hours for
international trips, travelers can learn whether an airline has
agreed to release a seat and which flights and routing are
provided. Tickets are non-refundable, non-exchangeable and do not
earn frequent-flier miles.
 CONSOLIDATOR TICKETS  
 &HT;    This is the time of year when consolidator tickets to major
European cities can offer the best trans-Atlantic values around.
 &HT;    But the downside to these discounted tickets is that they are
usually not refundable, transferrable or good for frequent-flier
mileage credit.
 &HT;    These tickets are also typically non-endorsable, which means in
the event of a delay or cancellation, they cannot be used to travel
on another airline.
 &HT;    Many travel agents will procure these tickets. However, for
those who wish to do it themselves, one of the largest
consolidators around is Council Travel (205 East 42nd St., New
York, N.Y. 10017; 800-226-8624; www.ciee.org).
 ADVENTURE TRAVEL  
 &HT;    For anyone who needs a rafting, climbing, caving, biking or
sea-kayaking fix, the links provided by GORP, the Great Outdoors
Recreation Pages (www.gorp.com), could be useful, as could the
Outdoor Action Guide to Outdoor Resources
(www.princeton.edu/(TILDE)oa/outother.html). It's a quick way to
find out which companies still have space on a bike trip to the
Tetons or a hike in Maine.
 HOTELS  
 &HT;    Weekday and weekend hotel discounts exist, but consumers may
find they have to ask for them.
 &HT;    The same is true for discounts provided for members of
automobile clubs like the Automobile Association of America (AAA)
and organizations like the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP).
 &HT;    Hotel brokers can offer larger discounts of 10 percent to 50
percent off the ``rack'' or published rate at select city and
resort properties throughout the country. Here's a short list.
 &HT;    Accommodations Express (801 Asbury Ave., Ocean City, N.J. 08226;
800-444-7666; www.accomodationsexp.com)
 &HT;    Branson Nights Reservations (P.O. Box 2321, Branson, Mo. 65616;
800-329-9999; www.branson-nights.com) works just with hotels in
Branson, Mo.
 &HT;    Capitol Reservations (1730 Rhode Island Ave. NW, Suite 1114,
Washington, D.C. 20036; 800-847-4832; www.hotelsdc.com) deals only
with properties in the Washington D.C. area.

   CZAR-ROYALTY _ PETROVSKOYE, Russia _ This heir to Russian
royalty lives in a palace without a roof, with no windows and the
plumbing shot on an estate strewn with garbage. His government says
he has no legal claim to the property no matter what his last name.
Still, Yevgeny Meshchersky, 47, a former engineer in a ceramics
factory, remains wedded to his land and vows to restore the family
estate to its former elegance. Since the Soviet Union disintegrated
in 1991, royalty has made a half-hearted comeback in Russia,
seeking to reassert its legal rights and property taken in the
Bolshevik revolution of 1917. The lot of the Russian nobility and
their descendants has gained renewed attention with this week's
(Fri. July 17) burial of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his
family. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

<P>
   HEALTH _ WASHINGTON _ A Senate Republican task force, responding
to the political potency of the health care issue, unveils its
version of ``patients' rights'' legislation to deal with consumer
complaints about the managed care industry. Democrats complain that
it omits a provision allowing patients to sue HMOs for medical
decisions that prove harmful, and that it includes tax-free
``medical savings accounts'' that some believe would lead people to
skimp on preventive care. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is a task force
member. (Harlan, Cox News Service).

   SPACE-BUGS _ WASHINGTON _ The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which hopes during the next decade to retrieve
samples of the stuff asteroids, comets and other Solar System
objects are made of, had better be very careful to avoid
contaminating Earth with extraterrestial germs, a committee of the
National Academy of Sciences warns in a report being released
Wednesday. The chances of encountering outer space microbes are
very low, the committee said, but too little is known about some
asteroids to rule out the presence of life forms and two moons of
Jupiter _ Europa and Ganymede _ have ``significant potential'' of
harboring living entities. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 500).

Marc Morial, the dapper, 40-year-old son of the city's first black

Morial is settling into his second term as mayor, a position given

full-length albums that can join a permanent collection. For those
who have been sending and receiving music via the Internet, digital

 &HT;    KEY ANSWERS LACKING ON DIGITAL MUST-CARRY RULES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Saturday, July 18.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Federal Communications Commission recently
sought to frame the rules that will govern television in the
digital era that dawns this fall, it defied the rules on the way
regulatory business is usually done in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly every case, the commission and Congress quietly decide
the issues beforehand. Only then do they put their views out for
public comment, which rarely produces much change during the final
hearing process. That's the way things worked in the 1960s, when
the FCC decided that all car radios had to carry FM stations.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to consider whether cable TV operators
should be required to carry the digital signals of broadcasters,
the commissioners and the FCC staff observed strict neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's reluctance to choose sides reflects a deep division
between the interdependent cable and broadcast industries on ``must
carry,'' as the issue is known in trade circles.
</P>
<P>
   The split has spawned a technological holy war over the last
major piece of what has become an 11-year effort to bring digital
television (DTV) _ with its promise of superb images, high-fidelity
sound, and computer-like interactivity _ into American homes.
</P>
<P>
   At the nub of the problem is the fact that in some markets where
DTV is soon due to go on the air, the cable systems are saturated
or, in trade jargon, ``channel-locked.''
</P>
<P>
   For each digital signal they carry, cable systems must allocate
at least one extra channel, and perhaps more, depending on the
over-the-air format that is used and operators' ability to compress
content.
</P>
<P>
   In order to carry DTV channels, cable operators say, they would
have to drop less popular outlets such as C-SPAN, enraging some
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Fritts, president and chief executive officer of the
National Association of Broadcasters, said, ``We are delivering on
our pledge to bring a new generation of digital television to
American consumers this fall. The FCC has a responsibility to
ensure that cable systems will not impede customers from receiving
the full benefits of this new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But Decker Anstrom, president and chief executive officer of the
National Cable Television Association, the chief industry trade
group, said his members will oppose any rule that requires them to
carry both the new digital and the current signals on their cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This double-dose of must-carry would surely result in (some
current) cable networks being dropped in many places and would
again relegate cable networks to second-class citizenship,''
Anstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a federal mandate later this year, the cable industry
wants to negotiate a deal on digital carriage issues with the
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC hopes a compromise will spare the agency the need to
choose a winner. Absent such a deal, it is virtually certain that
the loser will fight on in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   History seems to favor the broadcasters. When the Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting System sued the FCC over its rules requiring
cable systems to carry the current analog broadcasts, the Supreme
Court in 1997 upheld the commission's rules on a 5-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the federal regulators lack the luxury of time.
Wide-screen DTV sets from several of Japan's biggest electronics
firms are to be loaded on ships bound for U.S. ports in early
August. These first-generation sets will be large projection units
and will retail for $7,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the FCC has ordered the four major networks _ ABC,
CBS, NBC and Fox _ to begin airing DTV programs in Atlanta and the
nation's other top 10 markets, covering 30 percent of U.S.
households, by Nov. 1. Since nearly 70 percent of all viewers
subscribe to a cable service, if the systems fail to link up
seamlessly, the huge commitment by the broadcasters and the set
makers to DTV may be imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this debate to focus and first and foremost on
consumers,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. In calling the FCC's
July 9 request for industry comments ``an important step in
focusing debate on how best to bring a digital signal to
Americans,'' Kennard noted that the debate has been and will
continue to be ``intensive and fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed FCC Commissioner Susan Ness, ``I have absolutely no
preconceived ideas on how this should come out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides grapple, the FCC must also decide several
related issues:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether to let cable operations degrade the DTV signal to save
precious bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether rules should cover only the main digital signal or
include the multiple programs that DTV technology permits as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On which ``tier,'' or subscriber pricing level, of a cable
system digital programming should go.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether to grant small-market cable operators special waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard also plans to call both sides together shortly to urge
them to speed up their dealings on yet another still missing piece
of the DTV puzzle: how to ensure that the engineering
specifications of digital-ready cable boxes mesh with DTV
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   A snag has arisen, because Hollywood, which has a big financial
stake in the movie rental business, wants strong safeguards adopted
to bar commercial piracy of digital images that, in theory, can
produce an endless chain of perfect copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a huge problem for us,'' said Jack Valenti,
head the Motion Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But must-carry remains an even bigger problem -- with no easy
solutions in sight.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, most industry experts agree, as cable systems
invest in more bandwidth and as better compression techniques
become widely available, the holy war with the broadcasters over
must-carry could well end in an honorable cease-fire. But, for at
least for the moment, a peace that would let the FCC off the hook
appears to be a fuzzy spot on a distant DTV horizon.

should be required to carry the digital signals of broadcasters,
the commissioners and the FCC staff observed strict neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's reluctance to choose sides reflects a deep division
between the interdependent cable and broadcast industries on ``must
carry,'' as the issue is known in trade circles.
</P>
<P>
   The split has spawned a technological holy war over the last
major piece of what has become an 11-year effort to bring digital
television (DTV) _ with its promise of superb images, high-fidelity
sound, and computer-like interactivity _ into American homes.
</P>
<P>
   At the nub of the problem is the fact that in some markets where
DTV is soon due to go on the air, the cable systems are saturated
or, in trade jargon, ``channel-locked.''
</P>
<P>
   For each digital signal they carry, cable systems must allocate
at least one extra channel, and perhaps more, depending on the
over-the-air format that is used and operators' ability to compress
content.
</P>
<P>
   In order to carry DTV channels, cable operators say, they would
have to drop less popular outlets such as C-SPAN, enraging some
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Fritts, president and chief executive officer of the
National Association of Broadcasters, said, ``We are delivering on
our pledge to bring a new generation of digital television to
American consumers this fall. The FCC has a responsibility to
ensure that cable systems will not impede customers from receiving
the full benefits of this new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But Decker Anstrom, president and chief executive officer of the
National Cable Television Association, the chief industry trade
group, said his members will oppose any rule that requires them to
carry both the new digital and the current signals on their cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This double-dose of must-carry would surely result in (some
current) cable networks being dropped in many places and would
again relegate cable networks to second-class citizenship,''
Anstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a federal mandate later this year, the cable industry
wants to negotiate a deal on digital carriage issues with the
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC hopes a compromise will spare the agency the need to
choose a winner. Absent such a deal, it is virtually certain that
the loser will fight on in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   History seems to favor the broadcasters. When the Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting System sued the FCC over its rules requiring
cable systems to carry the current analog broadcasts, the Supreme
Court in 1997 upheld the commission's rules on a 5-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the federal regulators lack the luxury of time.
Wide-screen DTV sets from several of Japan's biggest electronics
firms are to be loaded on ships bound for U.S. ports in early
August. These first-generation sets will be large projection units
and will retail for $7,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the FCC has ordered the four major networks _ ABC,
CBS, NBC and Fox _ to begin airing DTV programs in Atlanta and the
nation's other top 10 markets, covering 30 percent of U.S.
households, by Nov. 1. Since nearly 70 percent of all viewers
subscribe to a cable service, if the systems fail to link up
seamlessly, the huge commitment by the broadcasters and the set
makers to DTV may be imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this debate to focus and first and foremost on
consumers,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. In calling the FCC's
July 9 request for industry comments ``an important step in
focusing debate on how best to bring a digital signal to
Americans,'' Kennard noted that the debate has been and will
continue to be ``intensive and fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed FCC Commissioner Susan Ness, ``I have absolutely no
preconceived ideas on how this should come out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides grapple, the FCC must also decide several
related issues:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether to let cable operations degrade the DTV signal to save
precious bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether rules should cover only the main digital signal or
include the multiple programs that DTV technology permits as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On which ``tier,'' or subscriber pricing level, of a cable
system digital programming should go.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether to grant small-market cable operators special waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard also plans to call both sides together shortly to urge
them to speed up their dealings on yet another still missing piece
of the DTV puzzle: how to ensure that the engineering
specifications of digital-ready cable boxes mesh with DTV
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   A snag has arisen, because Hollywood, which has a big financial
stake in the movie rental business, wants strong safeguards adopted
to bar commercial piracy of digital images that, in theory, can
produce an endless chain of perfect copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a huge problem for us,'' said Jack Valenti,
head the Motion Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But must-carry remains an even bigger problem -- with no easy
solutions in sight.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, most industry experts agree, as cable systems
invest in more bandwidth and as better compression techniques
become widely available, the holy war with the broadcasters over
must-carry could well end in an honorable cease-fire. But, for at
least for the moment, a peace that would let the FCC off the hook
appears to be a fuzzy spot on a distant DTV horizon.

<P>
   The gulf separating American and Japanese perceptions of the
U.S. troops stationed in Japan could jeopardize the alliance
between these two important countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in Japan as a
gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. Most Japanese,
while fond of the alliance with the United States, would like to
see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1996 opinion poll in Asahi Shimbun found that 70 percent
of the Japanese people supported the alliance with the United
States while 67 percent favored a reduction in the number of U.S.
military bases. This discriminating public preference is reasonable
in today's Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was signed during the Korean War
in 1951 at the same time as the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which
formally ended the Allied occupation of Japan. The security treaty
enabled U.S. troops to remain in Japan and opened Japanese
facilities as a staging area and logistics base for American forces
in the war being waged on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military bases in Japan were seen as essential to
containing communist expansion, especially since the Soviet Union,
China and North Korea were considered a monolithic threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today the international environment has changed as dramatically
in East Asia as in Europe. The United States and its allies are no
longer squared off against the Soviet Union. Indeed, the Soviet
Union is no more. Since its collapse, Russian forces in East Asia
have become hollow. A comparison of Japan's 1989 and 1997 white
paper on defense shows a more than 50 percent reduction in the
number of personnel, surface combat ships, submarines and warplanes
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's warships are rusting in port, leaving only a
few submarines and surface ships in the Pacific fleet operational.
According to Japanese military analysts, Russian air force pilots
fly no more than 20 to 30 hours of training time a year, making the
most basic skills difficult to maintain. In Japan, fighter pilots
train a minimum of 150 hours a year.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese specialists estimate that Pyongyang has about 100
modern warplanes, although they get little flying time because of
shortages of fuel and spare parts. Seoul has 400 modern fighter
planes, tanks, attack helicopters and antitank missiles. The
South's edge is clear.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Pyongyang chooses to act irrationally by launching
a desperate attack, no amount of military power can deter it.
Deterrence assumes reasonable judgment by the enemy. One way to
lessen the likelihood of a senseless strike is to avoid cornering
North Korea's leaders and thus driving them into desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese military power has also diminished considerably. The
number of combat aircraft has fallen to 3,700 from 5,400 ten years
ago. China's submarines have dwindled from 100 to 60, and only
three are modern designs recently imported from Russia. Most of
their 50 or so surface ships are outdated. Given China's current
financial problems, the Chinese army can modernize only gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Washington justifies the privileges it has enjoyed since World
War II by warning the Japanese about what it wrongly claims is an
increase in Chinese military power and the threat posed by Nodon 1,
North Korea's 600-mile-range missile. Simultaneously, it appeals to
its own citizens and other Asian nations by claiming that American
troops forestall any Japanese inclination to remilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   These arguments no longer acknowledge Asia's reality. Like other
advanced countries, from the 19th to the mid-20th century, Japan
committed the blunder of taking overseas territory through
conquest, but it already paid dearly for this in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It is egotistical for Americans to believe that the United
States has done Japan a favor by defending it all these years by
stationing its forces within the country. U.S. forces in Japan
numbered 260,000 during the 1950s, 47,000 in 1990, and today stand
at 37,000. Whenever more American soldiers leave, the Japanese see
it as more good news.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. army stations only 1,500 personnel on Japan's main
islands, primarily for supply and communications duties. Japan's
land defense is left to its own forces, which include more than
1,000 tanks and 150,000 soldiers. From Tokyo's point of view,
American forces have not really stood in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. ground forces in Japan consist of only 14,000 Marines based
on Okinawa, one of the islands least vulnerable to Soviet attack
during the Cold War. The Japanese are aware that the Marines are
standing by for possible deployment elsewhere in the region, namely
the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1959 Japan's air defense has been entrusted to its own air
force, which today has a powerful fighter fleet of 200 F-15Js and
100 improved F-4Es as well as 13 early airborne warning aircrafts
and 26 Patriot air-defense batteries. In addition, the ground
self-defense force has a large number of medium- and short-range
surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. Air Force's 54 F-15s, which are
intended mainly for the defense of Korean air space, are safely
tucked away on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   From the Cold War until today, the U.S. Navy has contributed
indirectly to the prosperity and defense of Japan. The Navy
stations the Seventh Fleet flagship, a communications ship, an
aircraft carrier and its nine escort ships at the Yokosuka port in
Tokyo bay, and six other ships, including four amphibious vessels,
at the Sasebo naval base on western Kyushu.
</P>
<P>
   But these warships were not exclusively for Japan's defense.
They have been deployed in the western Pacific, the Indian Ocean
and the Persian Gulf. Before 1990, however, it was clear that had
the Soviet Union attempted to invade Japan, several U.S. aircraft
carriers would have moved into Japanese waters and interdicted
Soviet sea routes.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear deterrence is a different story. Both Russia and China,
while weak in conventional military power, hold enough nuclear
missiles to destroy Japan. It is legitimate to ask how Japan would
counter nuclear blackmail. Tokyo, which accepted unconditionally
the permanent extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in
1995 and renounced development of its own nuclear deterrent, has no
choice but to depend on the nuclear umbrella of an ally.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the interest of the United States, so long as it does
not wish to see Japan withdraw from the NPT and develop its own
nuclear deterrent, to maintain its alliance with Japan and continue
to provide a nuclear umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan's perspective, friendly relations with the United
States, the only remaining military superpower, are vital. Even if
all common threats disappeared in the next century, the alliance
would still be in Japan's interest.
</P>
<P>
   As the common threat presented by the Cold War diminishes, it is
natural for the Japanese people to be skeptical of the U.S.
military presence. The American military bases cost Japan $4
billion annually. If forgone rent and other revenues are included,
Japan's annual burden jumps to $5 billion, at a time when the
Japanese government faces a serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cost-sharing, Japan bears the largest burden among
U.S. allies for maintaining U.S. forces, with Germany and South
Korea paying $60 million and $290 million, respectively. By a 1995
Special Measures Agreement, Japan is committed through the year
2000 to pay the salaries of 24,000 civilian employees at the bases,
the utility costs, including energy, water and communications, and
most of the construction expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This burden to Japanese taxpayers hangs like a darkening cloud
over the future of the alliance. Japan should honor the 1995
agreement but put America on notice that it will not renew the
agreement in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is the business of statesmen, not bureaucrats or generals, to
plan for the future. The U.S. military presence in Japan should
fade with this century's end. The time has come for the leaders of
Japan and the United States to discuss an alliance fit for the next
century.

<P>
   The gulf separating American and Japanese perceptions of the
U.S. troops stationed in Japan could jeopardize the alliance
between these two important countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in Japan as a
gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. Most Japanese,
while fond of the alliance with the United States, would like to
see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1996 opinion poll in Asahi Shimbun found that 70 percent
of the Japanese people supported the alliance with the United
States while 67 percent favored a reduction in the number of U.S.
military bases. This discriminating public preference is reasonable
in today's Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was signed during the Korean War
in 1951 at the same time as the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which
formally ended the Allied occupation of Japan. The security treaty
enabled U.S. troops to remain in Japan and opened Japanese
facilities as a staging area and logistics base for American forces
in the war being waged on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military bases in Japan were seen as essential to
containing communist expansion, especially since the Soviet Union,
China and North Korea were considered a monolithic threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today the international environment has changed as dramatically
in East Asia as in Europe. The United States and its allies are no
longer squared off against the Soviet Union. Indeed, the Soviet
Union is no more. Since its collapse, Russian forces in East Asia
have become hollow. A comparison of Japan's 1989 and 1997 white
paper on defense shows a more than 50 percent reduction in the
number of personnel, surface combat ships, submarines and warplanes
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's warships are rusting in port, leaving only a
few submarines and surface ships in the Pacific fleet operational.
According to Japanese military analysts, Russian air force pilots
fly no more than 20 to 30 hours of training time a year, making the
most basic skills difficult to maintain. In Japan, fighter pilots
train a minimum of 150 hours a year.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese specialists estimate that Pyongyang has about 100
modern warplanes, although they get little flying time because of
shortages of fuel and spare parts. Seoul has 400 modern fighter
planes, tanks, attack helicopters and antitank missiles. The
South's edge is clear.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Pyongyang chooses to act irrationally by launching
a desperate attack, no amount of military power can deter it.
Deterrence assumes reasonable judgment by the enemy. One way to
lessen the likelihood of a senseless strike is to avoid cornering
North Korea's leaders and thus driving them into desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese military power has also diminished considerably. The
number of combat aircraft has fallen to 3,700 from 5,400 ten years
ago. China's submarines have dwindled from 100 to 60, and only
three are modern designs recently imported from Russia. Most of
their 50 or so surface ships are outdated. Given China's current
financial problems, the Chinese army can modernize only gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Washington justifies the privileges it has enjoyed since World
War II by warning the Japanese about what it wrongly claims is an
increase in Chinese military power and the threat posed by Nodon 1,
North Korea's 600-mile-range missile. Simultaneously, it appeals to
its own citizens and other Asian nations by claiming that American
troops forestall any Japanese inclination to remilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   These arguments no longer acknowledge Asia's reality. Like other
advanced countries, from the 19th to the mid-20th century, Japan
committed the blunder of taking overseas territory through
conquest, but it already paid dearly for this in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It is egotistical for Americans to believe that the United
States has done Japan a favor by defending it all these years by
stationing its forces within the country. U.S. forces in Japan
numbered 260,000 during the 1950s, 47,000 in 1990, and today stand
at 37,000. Whenever more American soldiers leave, the Japanese see
it as more good news.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. army stations only 1,500 personnel on Japan's main
islands, primarily for supply and communications duties. Japan's
land defense is left to its own forces, which include more than
1,000 tanks and 150,000 soldiers. From Tokyo's point of view,
American forces have not really stood in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. ground forces in Japan consist of only 14,000 Marines based
on Okinawa, one of the islands least vulnerable to Soviet attack
during the Cold War. The Japanese are aware that the Marines are
standing by for possible deployment elsewhere in the region, namely
the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1959 Japan's air defense has been entrusted to its own air
force, which today has a powerful fighter fleet of 200 F-15Js and
100 improved F-4Es as well as 13 early airborne warning aircrafts
and 26 Patriot air-defense batteries. In addition, the ground
self-defense force has a large number of medium- and short-range
surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. Air Force's 54 F-15s, which are
intended mainly for the defense of Korean air space, are safely
tucked away on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   From the Cold War until today, the U.S. Navy has contributed
indirectly to the prosperity and defense of Japan. The Navy
stations the Seventh Fleet flagship, a communications ship, an
aircraft carrier and its nine escort ships at the Yokosuka port in
Tokyo bay, and six other ships, including four amphibious vessels,
at the Sasebo naval base on western Kyushu.
</P>
<P>
   But these warships were not exclusively for Japan's defense.
They have been deployed in the western Pacific, the Indian Ocean
and the Persian Gulf. Before 1990, however, it was clear that had
the Soviet Union attempted to invade Japan, several U.S. aircraft
carriers would have moved into Japanese waters and interdicted
Soviet sea routes.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear deterrence is a different story. Both Russia and China,
while weak in conventional military power, hold enough nuclear
missiles to destroy Japan. It is legitimate to ask how Japan would
counter nuclear blackmail. Tokyo, which accepted unconditionally
the permanent extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in
1995 and renounced development of its own nuclear deterrent, has no
choice but to depend on the nuclear umbrella of an ally.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the interest of the United States, so long as it does
not wish to see Japan withdraw from the NPT and develop its own
nuclear deterrent, to maintain its alliance with Japan and continue
to provide a nuclear umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan's perspective, friendly relations with the United
States, the only remaining military superpower, are vital. Even if
all common threats disappeared in the next century, the alliance
would still be in Japan's interest.
</P>
<P>
   As the common threat presented by the Cold War diminishes, it is
natural for the Japanese people to be skeptical of the U.S.
military presence. The American military bases cost Japan $4
billion annually. If forgone rent and other revenues are included,
Japan's annual burden jumps to $5 billion, at a time when the
Japanese government faces a serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cost-sharing, Japan bears the largest burden among
U.S. allies for maintaining U.S. forces, with Germany and South
Korea paying $60 million and $290 million, respectively. By a 1995
Special Measures Agreement, Japan is committed through the year
2000 to pay the salaries of 24,000 civilian employees at the bases,
the utility costs, including energy, water and communications, and
most of the construction expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This burden to Japanese taxpayers hangs like a darkening cloud
over the future of the alliance. Japan should honor the 1995
agreement but put America on notice that it will not renew the
agreement in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is the business of statesmen, not bureaucrats or generals, to
plan for the future. The U.S. military presence in Japan should
fade with this century's end. The time has come for the leaders of
Japan and the United States to discuss an alliance fit for the next
century.

<P>
   In most species, the rules are pretty simple: Males try to mate
as often as possible; females, who must bear and provide for
offspring, seek to limit their mates to the best candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Mating systems have evolved over millions of years, as males and
females try to achieve their conflicting agendas. But what if all
members of a species have the same agenda?
</P>
<P>
   For hermaphrodites, says zoologist Nico Michiels, love is war.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels, who works at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral
Physiology in Starnberg, Germany, studies hermaphroditic flatworms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the literature on behavior and sexual conflict
focuses on species with separate sexes and there's very little
known about hermaphrodites,'' he says. ``People had assumed that
hermaphrodites are simply the sum of a male and a female. But the
conflicts hermaphrodites have are very different from those of
species with separate sexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hermaphroditic flatworms mate hypodermically _ that is, a
flatworm must jab its penis into its partner and inject sperm.
</P>
<P>
   The sperm courses through the loose tissue of a flatworm's body
until it reaches the ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   This mating method is not uncommon in flatworms, but researchers
didn't realize that mating could escalate into a violent contest.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels and Leslie Newman of the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of Natural History observed matings between 17
pairs of flatworms.
</P>
<P>
   When two flatworms meet, ``they rear up in this spectacular
posture, stick out their penises and try to stab each other,''
Michiels says. The flatworms feint and parry in a duel that can
last an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels calls this behavior penis fencing. The flatworm that
successfully stabs its mate gets to fertilize eggs, while the worm
being stabbed has to bear the cost of healing its wounds and
producing offspring _ hence the fencing match.
</P>
<P>
   Flatworm mating, Michiels says, is ``a sexual conflict that has
almost gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Michiels recently found another flatworm species with sperm so
aggressive that it eats its way through tissue, leaving gaping
holes in the body of the unlucky mate. A worm can lose up to
two-thirds its body mass in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Penis fencing has been seen only in flat worms so far, but
Michiels suspects that other hermaphroditic species have also
evolved violent mating systems. ``Due to the identical but not
compatible interests of two mating partners,'' he says, ``you can
have sexual conflicts that escalate in a violent way, to an extent
that is not known in species with separate sexes.''

   In most species, the rules are pretty simple: Males try to mate
as often as possible; females, who must bear and provide for
offspring, seek to limit their mates to the best candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Mating systems have evolved over millions of years, as males and
females try to achieve their conflicting agendas. But what if all
members of a species have the same agenda?
</P>
<P>
   For hermaphrodites, says zoologist Nico Michiels, love is war.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels, who works at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral
Physiology in Starnberg, Germany, studies hermaphroditic flatworms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the literature on behavior and sexual conflict
focuses on species with separate sexes and there's very little
known about hermaphrodites,'' he says. ``People had assumed that
hermaphrodites are simply the sum of a male and a female. But the
conflicts hermaphrodites have are very different from those of
species with separate sexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hermaphroditic flatworms mate hypodermically _ that is, a
flatworm must jab its penis into its partner and inject sperm.
</P>
<P>
   The sperm courses through the loose tissue of a flatworm's body
until it reaches the ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   This mating method is not uncommon in flatworms, but researchers
didn't realize that mating could escalate into a violent contest.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels and Leslie Newman of the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of Natural History observed matings between 17
pairs of flatworms.
</P>
<P>
   When two flatworms meet, ``they rear up in this spectacular
posture, stick out their penises and try to stab each other,''
Michiels says. The flatworms feint and parry in a duel that can
last an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels calls this behavior penis fencing. The flatworm that
successfully stabs its mate gets to fertilize eggs, while the worm
being stabbed has to bear the cost of healing its wounds and
producing offspring _ hence the fencing match.
</P>
<P>
   Flatworm mating, Michiels says, is ``a sexual conflict that has
almost gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Michiels recently found another flatworm species with sperm so
aggressive that it eats its way through tissue, leaving gaping
holes in the body of the unlucky mate. A worm can lose up to
two-thirds its body mass in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Penis fencing has been seen only in flat worms so far, but
Michiels suspects that other hermaphroditic species have also
evolved violent mating systems. ``Due to the identical but not
compatible interests of two mating partners,'' he says, ``you can
have sexual conflicts that escalate in a violent way, to an extent
that is not known in species with separate sexes.''

   The first symptoms of infection with the Ebola virus _ sore
throat, headache, muscle pain _ are deceptively mild harbingers of
the horrors to come.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days the virus victims begin vomiting blood and
bleeding profusely, both internally and from the nose, eyes and
gums.
</P>
<P>
   Between 50 percent and 90 percent of them die within two weeks _
some within days _ from blood loss and shock.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure for Ebola and no vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 epidemic in the former Zaire, for example, left 245 dead.
At least 44 more died in Gabon in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   How does Ebola induce such massive hemorrhaging, and why do so
few people fight it off?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are only now providing the first clues to Ebola's
virulence. Surprisingly, this preliminary work has already led to
an experimental vaccine that, in guinea pigs at least, seems to
thwart the virus.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few things known about Ebola was that during the
initial stages of infection, the virus floods the bloodstream with
a glycoprotein _ a protein with sugars attached.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knew what the glycoproprotein's role was in the
viral assault, but its overwhelming presence suggested it meant bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Michigan and at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, however, have recently learned that the
glycoprotein is part of a two-pronged attack on the body that
leaves the victim bleeding and defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two forms of the glycoprotein. The virus
releases one into the bloodstream. The other _ a larger version of
the same glycoprotein _ remains attached to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nabel, a molecular virologist at the University of
Michigan, has found that the free form fastens onto a type of white
blood cell called a neutrophil.
</P>
<P>
   These cells are the immune system's frontline troops. They
engulf and destroy invading viruses and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrophils also signal the other fighters of the immune system:
the B cells that make antibodies and the T cells that kill
virus-infected cells.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel suspects that by binding to the neutrophils, Ebola's free
glycoprotein hobbles them so they can't combat the invader or
signal other cells. This frees the virus to attack the body's blood
vessels, using the attached glycoprotein as a key to enter
endothelial cells _ the cells that line the interiors of our veins
and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that as Ebola invades and subverts the cells' genetic
machinery to make more of itself, it also damages the endothelial
cells, making blood vessels leaky and weak.
</P>
<P>
   The patient first bleeds and then goes into shock as falling
blood pressure leaves the circulatory system unable to pump blood
to vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   Long before their immune systems can mount an antibody response
_ a process that can take weeks _ most Ebola victims bleed to
death.
</P>
<P>
   This understanding of Ebola's deadly one-two punch may help
Nabel further develop a prototype vaccine that has shown promising
results in guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine consists of the gene that codes for either type of
Ebola's glycoprotein spliced into a plasmid _ a harmless piece of
DNA from a bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel injected the vaccine into two groups of guinea pigs. Two
months later, he infected one group with live Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   After four months he infected the second group. (Guinea pigs
suffer the same hemorrhagic response to Ebola as humans do.)
</P>
<P>
   The animals in the first group not only produced T cells and
antibodies against Ebola but remained entirely healthy. Most of the
animals in the second group also survived the attack. Evidently,
the vaccine gave the guinea pigs enough time to muster an immune
response to counter Ebola.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel hopes his experimental vaccine will one day protect
high-risk populations living in the virus' home turf in sub-Saharan
Africa, as well as the doctors and nurses who attend Ebola patients
and the animal handlers in laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nabel is optimistic about the prospects for his vaccine
he points out that diseases often thwart the best effort of medical
research. ``Viruses have a way of mutating and adapting.''

<P>
   As the final match of the 15th World Cup was being played out in
France on Sunday, a full third of the planet's population tuned in
to witness the host nation's surprising capture of the most coveted
trophy in the world: a thick, drippy, solid-18-karat-gold
abstraction of two Atlaslike athletes shrugging the globe.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one way the mania for the World Cup is
understandable, for it is the ultimate trophy, one of the few that
is singular: Created in 1974 by Silvio Gazzaniga, an Italian
sculptor, to replace the original, which survived World War II and
theft before being retired to third-time victor Brasil in 1970, the
priceless cup is passed like a torch from victor to victor only
every four years, compared to the factory-level output of Hollywood
awards, whose repetition dulls their own glow.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for the World Cup is also the largest in terms
of participants; this year's winner was narrowed from 168 countries
over a two-year elimination process. More national clubs belong to
the Federation Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA,
than do countries to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Let soccer philistines in the United States consider the intense
traffic of trophies in their own land. For every achievement there
seems to be an arcane assembly _ and arcane loving cup _ to honor
it. From football's Tiffany-designed Vince Lombardi Trophy to
hockey's immense Stanley Cup to basketball's tiered totems
(proportional in height to its players), each sport has its cup,
and so does every momentary prowess. How else to explain GQ
magazine's Man of the Year award (a crystal male torso with muscles
as improbable as those sculpted by Botero), or MTV's movie awards,
( shellacked bags of popcorn as unappetizing as window-display
sushi)?
</P>
<P>
   The trophy glut reflects the growing cultural obsession with
heroes, celebrities and winners. ``Part of it has to do with group
identity,'' said George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``Competitions, even if one
participates only as a spectator, reaffirm one's membership in the
tribe. And part of it is that trophies identify role models, or
attempt to establish new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   With society ever more splintered, a trophy glut is inevitable.
Each social faction has its criteria for greatness and devises a
fitting emblem for it, feeding the factory of signs that define
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Though few will come by NFL rings or Purple Hearts, almost
everybody has been bestowed with a certificate or gold-plated
trinket to identify competence at bowling, baking pies, flipping
burgers, selling stereos, inventing theories, making art. The
paradox, of course, is that the more trophy winners there are, the
less trophies are able to fulfill their function: to signify
uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Nunberg, the usage editor of the American Heritage
Dictionary and a cultural commentator for National Public Radio,
agrees: ``A lot of what we see is spurious competition. Most
trophies have no other purpose but commercial _ to sell the
products of the sponsor, to fill air time and, mostly, to
demonstrate the fact that we've gotten quite good at manufacturing
trophies, events and celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   The function of the trophy has always been to single out the
exceptional from the ordinary. Before the modern concept of the
individual, the earliest exemplars were sacrificial victims.
Ancient societies didn't expect their deities to be satisfied with
common fare, hence, the election of the virginal, the clairvoyant,
the brave for ascension. Modern-day field sports find an antecedent
in the Mesoamerican juego de pelota in which the winner was killed,
for he clearly qualified as the most worthy gift to the gods. He
was the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Trophies gained their glittering, tacky dimension when they
became representations of triumph as opposed to evidence of the
triumph itself. Military trophies were the spoils of war:
opponents' weapons, belongings, the opponents themselves (or parts
of them), which were hung on trees or structures as indisputable
proof of the conquest. Similarly, hunting trophies were the kill _
the animals, horns, head or hide _ a real trace of big-game
bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Just as early societies eventually figured out that they could
substitute animals for humans and then objects for animals in their
sacrificial rites, so modern societies have invested objects with
symbolic value, affirmed by collective sentiment. The shiny cup,
urn and plate (emblems of offering and receiving) remain the most
common trophy forms, a testament to the persistence of traditional
images of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the value of trophies today is associated with the
achievement, the form has to be recognized,'' said Leo Brody, a
professor of English at the University of Southern California and
the author of ``The Frenzy of Renown,'' a history of fame, recently
republished by Vintage.
</P>
<P>
   As the expression ``trophy wife'' indicates, the primary
function of trophies is to be ornamental, and that explains their
dazzling appearance. It's not surprising that luxury-goods
companies like Baccarat and Tiffany &AMP; Company have weighed in.
Tiffany is behind the new Women's NBA trophy (a basketball on a
pedestal), the New York City Marathon's (a platter etched with a
map of the city) and the Lombardi Trophy (a silver regulation-size
football).
</P>
<P>
   On some level, trophy designs do attempt to be meaningful. MTV's
popcorn trophy, for example, is deliberately kitschy, so recipients
can't be serious when accepting it for such flip categories as Best
Scream.
</P>
<P>
   But the main thing is that it appear permanent. Hence, the
justification, from GQ's director of communications, Mary Wible, of
the magazine's choice of a crystal torso for its Man of the Year
award. ``We chose it because it's very masculine,'' said Ms. Wible,
``and because it's heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Brody suggests that the creation of heroes, celebrities and
winners will only escalate, perhaps in inverse proportion to the
duration of their fame. But there's nothing wrong with being
honored for accomplishments, he said. ``One feature of a democratic
society is the multiplicity of ways to get to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The FIFA cup is one of the few contemporary examples that
recalls the original meaning of trophies, for many reasons. The
sporting ground is the last legitimate battlefield of civilized
society, where individualism and nationalism can flare without too
much bloodshed. Athletes don't go home with the spoils of the
defeated, like their ears (though some might like to).But during
the World Cup games, one of the most endearing rituals was the
players' polite exchange of not blood but sweat-soaked jerseys at
the end of 90 minutes of earnest ankle-hacking. Still, everyone
held out for the FIFA cup, which is worth more than its weight in
gold.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restore some of the old luster of trophies, the
R.S. Owens Co., which manufactures the Oscar, Emmy, Clio and other
high-profile awards, is issuing a new line of products called Art
as Awards. Scott Siegel, its president, whose company grew from $15
to a $20 million in sales over the last five years, said: ``Nobody
wants to decorate their home or office with useless junk.'' The
company has commissioned a glass-blowing company to create
limited-edition trophies that are ``works of art first and awards
second.'' (Although the idea of a limited edition of an object
meant to convey uniqueness seems an oxymoron.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, it proliferates. The trophy's commonness has already
distanced it from its etymological root, which derives from the
Greek tropos, , to turn, as in an opponent's turn of fate, or
defeat. As Nunberg said: ``It's not a trophy unless somebody loses.
You can't just have winners.''

SIMPLER REGIMENS COMING IN THE AIDS DRUG QUEST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ When it comes to AIDS treatment, timing and luck are
still as important as virology, immunology, and clinical research.
But that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the lucky ones,'' AIDS activist Mark Harrington
told a rapt audience at the 12th World AIDS Conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Harrington's AIDS began to worsen ominously two years
ago, a process specialists call disease progression, researchers
came up with a potent triple-drug cocktail, a regimen that has all
but eliminated the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from his
system and rescued his dying immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have progressed at a better time,'' Harrington
said, flashing a slide of his rejuvenated lymph node tissue. ``My
immune system is coming back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   A 49-year-old Rhode Island woman we'll call Christine is lucky
too, in a less dramatic way. Unlike Harrington, she couldn't defer
AIDS treatment until the triple-drug therapy came along. ``She was
progressing so rapidly that we had to layer in each new drug as it
was available,'' said her AIDS physician for the past 10 years, Dr.
Kenneth Mayer of Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Usually HIV responds to that kind of sequential drug treatment
by developing resistance to each drug in turn, eventually using up
all options. But thankfully, and for reasons no one can explain,
Christine's virus did not become drug resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, she has begun developing the abnormal fat
deposits that are cropping up in about 20 percent of patients on
long-term triple-drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In a more precarious situation is Spencer Cox, a colleague of
Harrington's in the New York-based Treatment Action Group. Like
Christine, he has been heavily treated for HIV _ but now he's
resistant to most of the available drugs. Last December he took
himself off treatment to wait for researchers to come up with a
recipe for a new cocktail that will suppress the HIV in his system,
now hovering at a worrisome 230,000 viruses in each milliliter (1/5
teaspoon) of his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he's hopeful. ``I tend to find the gray cloud in
every silver lining, but I came away from Geneva feeling pretty
optimistic,'' Cox said last week.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Physicians who treat HIV patients and search for
better therapies say they feel optimistic too _ even though nothing
that came out of the Geneva conference tips the balance away from
timing and luck in AIDS treatment and toward reliable, sure-fire
options for individuals at every stage of HIV disease.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's a case for pessimism, too.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, new drugs in the pipeline appear at least as
potent as current drugs, but they may not come in time to help
those whose current therapy is failing them _ about half the most
intensively treated patients. Also, no imminent drugs represent a
truly new class capable of attacking HIV at a different point in
its life cycle. Thus, it's possible that patients whose virus is
resistant to current drugs will be resistant to new versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my disappointments was that there wasn't more about new
treatments that would benefit those with advanced AIDS,'' said Dr.
Harvey Makadon of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is also still a matter of luck which patients will respond to
current anti-HIV cocktails as dramatically as Harrington did. All
the world's virologists cannot explain or predict why some people's
HIV can be suppressed indefinitely (so far) to a tiny residuum,
while in others the virus roars back.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the cleverest immunologists say why treatment returns
some patients' ravaged immune systems to virtually normal, like
Harrington's, while others' appear beyond redemption.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the frustrating unknowns, many see the glass as
half-full. ``For the individual, there's still a certain amount of
caprice,'' Mayer acknowledged. ``But in the aggregate, we now can
treat HIV as a chronic, difficult, but manageable infectious
disease. That's real progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the positive new signs:
</P>
<P>
   --Much simpler HIV regimens. Instead of the onerous 20 to 30
tablets that patients are now told they must take without fail
morning, noon, and night, it will be possible to swallow three or
four pills a day, split into morning and evening doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a massive reduction in the number of
pills,'' said Dr. Julio Montaner of the University of British
Columbia. ``We have nearly a half-dozen drugs that lend themselves
to once-daily dosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier regimens make it more likely people will take their
medicine faithfully, lowering the risk of treatment failure. That
should also diminish the risk that people will develop
omni-resistant viral mutants that, scientists now know, can be
transmitted sexually.
</P>
<P>
   --More choices. Drugs in the pipeline, and others not far
behind, introduce the possibility of effective regimens that don't
require protease inhibitors, the potent antivirals that made the
big difference two years ago in combination with older drugs. If
so, protease inhibitors can be held in reserve for those whose
virus rebounds after first-line therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``protease-sparing'' regimens may also provide an
alternative for patients like Christine who suffer lipid
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will soon have some really intriguing new choices _ for
beginning therapy or switching therapy _ that look equal or better
in potency to the current gold standard,'' said Dr. R. Scott Hitt,
a Los Angeles AIDS doctor who chairs President Clinton's Advisory
Council on HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   --Immune reconstitution. Researchers are heartened by signs that
current treatments allow patients' immune systems to recover more
completely than they expected. Even many whose virus rebounds seem
to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first conference in which there was any optimism
about the immune system's ability to kick in,'' said Dr. Calvin
Cohen of the Community Research Initiative of New England. ``There
was always this feeling that the immune system was doomed to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are rushing to exploit and augment this immune
recovery, so that even if HIV cannot be eradicated from every last
cell in most patients, it might be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington articulated the question in many people's minds:
``Are we willing to settle for lifelong therapy, or treat until the
immune system can control whatever residual HIV remains? Do we need
to delete every last...infected cell?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HIV DRUGS IN THE PIPELINE &QL; 
 &QL; 
Clinical trial results on four new drugs promise additional options
soon. But all work in the same ways as existing drugs, so patients
who have developed resistance to standard drugs may also be
resistant to these. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Efaverenz (Sustiva)  &QL; 
DuPont Pharmaceuticals  &QL; 
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  &QL; 
Potent HIV suppression, even in two-drug combination; Works in
cocktails without a protease inhibitor, saving those drugs for
later. Side effects similar to standard drugs; can alter mood.  &QL; 
Only once daily  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
--1592 (Abacavir)  &QL; 
GlaxoWellcome  &QL; 
Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor  &QL; 
Potent antiviral in three-drug cocktail, even without a protease
inhibitor. Promising in children failing current treatment. May get
into central nervous system. Side effects resemble standard drugs,
but 3 percent suffer allergic reaction that can be fatal if 1592 is
restarted.  &QL; 
Twice daily, no food/water restrictions  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Adefovir (Preveon)  &QL; 
Gilead Sciences  &QL; 
Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor  &QL; 
Preliminary studies suggest antiviral efficacy, though perhaps less
potent. As a nucleotide, may work against virus resistant to
nucleosides. Some patients suffer kidney toxicity.  &QL; 
Probably once daily  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Amprenavir  &QL; 
GlaxoWellcome/ &QL; 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals  &QL; 
Protease inhibitor  &QL; 
Potent effect in two-drug combination with Abacavir in small
trials. Three-drug combination with nucleosides showed durable
effect. Penetrates into central nervous system. Side effects
similar to other drugs in this class.  &QL; 
Probably twice daily, no food/water restrictions  &QL; 
 &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bored with chat? Tired of shopping on the Web? Sick of e-mail
from your relatives? How about taking a test?
</P>
<P>
   That's right, a test.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web has become a breeding ground for
psychometricians, professional and otherwise, who are filling
cyberspace with thousands of tests that you can administer to
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to log on these days without being collared by
someone with just a few questions that purport to test your
intelligence, your emotional well-being or your predisposition to
depression, alcoholism, hypochondria, diabetes or attention deficit
disorder. The odd thing is that people seem to like to take these
tests.
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which children spend years suffering through
tests, why adults would take them for fun is a mystery. But there
is something alluring about an optional quiz, with its promise of
ranking you in terms of your lovability or likelihood of having a
heart attack. Just look at the number of quizzes in magazines, on
television and radio, and now, in spades, on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude tests with actual relevance to the workaday world are
still hard to find on line. Someday, certainly, it will be possible
to take the SAT on the Net. But not yet, because the College Board,
which administers the test, still considers the Net insufficiently
secure.
</P>
<P>
   But late at night or on a rainy day, the Net offers a chance to
quiz yourself silly, to find out how you rank in every imaginable
context.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Web, there are no visible proctors or stopwatches in
evidence, and no one to raise an eyebrow at your response to a
question about your sexual habits. For instance, you might scoff at
Mensa, the organization of self-anointed geniuses, but it is
difficult to turn down the chance to spend three minutes on a test
to see if you would be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea of being able to confront your deepest fears
in private,'' said Jim Goldberg, a 51-year-old management
consultant in Sonoma, Calif., who took the Mensa test. ``And it's
comforting to know that even if I do score like an intellectual and
emotional misfit, it can remain my own little secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is one of a small group of people recruited by
Circuits, in a purely unscientific fashion, to explore the Web's
variety of tests. The group included a doctor, a lawyer, a British
civil servant, a writer, a consultant, a German freelance
journalist and an Internet project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group recently chose from a dozen or so Web-based
tests _ including a test that promised to gauge IQ, an emotional
quotient test and a karma calibrator _ and sampled whatever struck
their fancy. By day's end, all had discovered that they were
geniuses but also emotionally dysfunctional karmic failures.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to know how private an online test really
is, or what kind of data the test is collecting _ particularly when
it starts out by testing knowledge of your name, address and
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop for Robert Wallich, 39, an earnest civil servant
in London, was the Karmometer. The test can be found on the Random
House page for Laura Esquivel's novel ``The Law of Love.'' It
promises to tell you how karmically evolved you are, as well as
your chances of finding your soul mate in your current lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The test includes this question: ``It is the Golden Age of Spain
and you are a valiant captain in Cortez's army. You are rewarded
for your bravery in the conquest of Mexico with a house atop an
ancient pyramid of great religious significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Your choices: (a) Accept the house. You deserve it. (b) Offer it
back to the aboriginal people. (c) Keep the house but free your
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karmically challenged'' was the verdict for Wallich, who chose
(a) when the karmically correct answer was presumably (b). (The
Karmometer's creators do not supply the correct answers, preferring
perhaps for test-takers to divine them.)
</P>
<P>
   Regine Wosnitza, on the other hand, a 39-year-old freelance
journalist in Berlin who is a firm believer in reincarnation and
the powers of karma, was disappointed in the Karmometer for a
different reason. ``The questions themselves, I thought, were
fairly primitive and had nothing to do with real karma theory,''
she said. Like Wallich, Ms. Wosnitza was told that she would have
to wait until her next lifetime to find her soul mate. ``Of course,
I am not too happy about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Wosnitza nor Wallich thought to purchase Ms.
Esquivel's novel from the Random House site.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McCarthy, 43, a science and humor writer in San Francisco,
tried her hand at a New Age IQ test. Her score: Very Good. ``This
score was despite my refusal to agree that alien spaceships landed
at Roswell,'' Ms. McCarthy said. ``I said it was a high-altitude
weather balloon, and they told me that was wrong. It's not wrong at
all. I have references, but there was nobody there to fight with.''
</P>
<P>
   Few could resist the emotional intelligence quiz. This test,
which is offered on the Utne Reader's Web site, was written by
Daniel Goleman, who covered behavioral science for The New York
Times for a number of years. Not surprisingly, it is based on
Goleman's best-selling book, ``Emotional Intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The test includes such stumpers as this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine you're an insurance salesman calling prospective
clients. Fifteen people in a row have hung up on you, and you're
getting discouraged. What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   (a) Call it a day and hope you have better luck tomorrow. (b)
Assess qualities in yourself that may be undermining your ability
to make a sale. (c) Try something new in the next call and keep
plugging away. (d) Consider another line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scoring well on that question _ the ``correct'' answer is (c) _
and most others on the test isn't easy. The median score of the
volunteer group was 60 out of a possible 200. That could lead a
cynic to wonder if the test is aimed, ever so subliminally, at
suggesting to people that they bolster their emotional wherewithal
by reading the book.
</P>
<P>
   Handily enough, the book is available straight from the Utne Web
site, through a direct link to Amazon.com. Many of the wandering
test takers complained about the thinly disguised effort at
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kirk Neely, an endocrinologist who lives in Portola Valley,
Calif., is an easygoing 44-year-old whose happy domestic life _ he
has been married for more than 18 years _ is something to which
many of his friends aspire, but he flunked the emotional test with
a score of 80. ``I was honest about my probable behavior,'' he
said. ``When I went back and answered the way sincere
self-improvers would probably want you to behave, I got a 180.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence tests on the Web are something else altogether. The
widely adopted, if also controversial, Wechsler and Stanford-Binet
IQ tests are hard to find on line, if they are there at all. Still,
dozens of Web sites say they offer a test of basic intelligence,
and those tests appear to be enormously popular.
</P>
<P>
   One cottage purveyor of IQ tests says he gets more than 200
e-mail messages each day regarding his tests. This kind soul, who
administers his tests from his home in China, reminds his visitors,
in large type: ``LOW POINTS DO NOT NECESSARILY MEAN YOU ARE NOT
SMART.''
</P>
<P>
   One particularly easy test that supposedly gauges intelligence
can be found at www.iqtest.com, where several of those smarting
from a slap from Goleman's test found salve for their psyches. In
contrast with Goleman's workout, this test is hard to flub. One
random stab at the multiple-choice answers yielded an IQ of 103,
well within the average range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early questions were at the level of my 9-year-old,''
Neely said. ``The later ones were more subtle and thus more
satisfying. The following slowed me down: `Does an inside-out
left-handed glove fit a right hand?' and `Can your niece be your
aunt?' I kept thinking, from the odd groups I've seen, it must be
possible.'' Neely reported scoring a remarkable 158, which put him,
he said, ``somewhere between Plato and Darwin.''
</P>
<P>
   When a couple of stragglers clicked on the IQ test site, they
were startled to see that it had been hijacked by a hacker
threatening (with many misspellings) to ``reveal the IQ scorez of
all the pplz I hate,'' including President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky
and all French people. Where the warm and welcoming words of the
iqtest.com folks had been stood a collection of white type on a
black background, filled with menacing gibberish. About 24 hours
later, the site was restored, leaving no trace of the hacker's
presence. Such are the potential hazards of an idle traipse through
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Tobias, 54, a lawyer in Oakland, Calif., turned to the
Web site of the New York University psychiatry department, where he
found a test to screen for attention deficit disorder. ``It told me
that my procrastination was a possible symptom of attention deficit
disorder that perhaps should be evaluated by a psychiatrist,''
Tobias said. Neely and Goldberg were told the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procrastination and disorganization are my major faults,''
Neely said. ``If my major faults actually indicated ADD, 70 percent
of the adult population would be on Ritalin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Lenard Adler, director of the New York University
Hospital for Joint Diseases' Attention Deficit Disorder Center,
which sponsors the test, cautioned that the Web-based test is ``not
in any way, shape or form meant to be diagnostic.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobias noted, with disappointment, that the psychiatry
department offered a telephone number for referrals _ to the
Attention Deficit Disorder Center. Still, Tobias, a relative
newcomer to the Web, said: ``The Web is an interesting place for an
ADD screen. When I first encountered it, I thought Web surfing
itself might be symptomatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the recruits enjoyed the tests. Tobias said, ``I don't
see myself as a big test-taking, games-playing kind of guy,'' and
he recommended against seeking out Web tests. ``Don't bother,'' he
said. ``The tests I took struck me as simple-minded, commercial or
both.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Wosnitza said she loved them ``although I do not
necessarily believe in them, even if they turn out good results for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lebkowsky, ``the Internet guy'' for the Whole Foods Market
in Austin, Texas, also enjoyed the tests and aced every probe. ``I
found out that I have excellent karma and can find my soul mate,''
he said. ``I also got five of five correct on the Mensa test. I now
know that I am truly an excellent person. However, my stomach's
still growling, my deadlines are still hanging over my head, and
I'm still prone to the same anxieties and depressions. Now what?''
</P>
<P>
   Lebkowsky, 49, might consider pointing his browser toward the
New York University depression screening test. Or perhaps he should
quit while he's ahead and log off.

YOUTH PROGRAMS TEAR DOWN WALLS OF PREJUDICE

<P>
   Smart. Bookish. Boring.
</P>
<P>
   As stereotypes go, the Asian-American one doesn't seem half bad.
</P>
<P>
   But as high school senior Ryan Cuffee learned this summer, such
stereotyping can cut as deep as any remark about his
African-American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it in a joking manner, but it's wrong,'' said
Cuffee, who loves in Arlington, Texas. ``I never really did it
much, but I've stopped doing it now. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cuffee, the revelation came not from a textbook or TV show,
but through intense, structured interaction with students from
other cultures at a camp called Anytown Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Anytown Texas is among summer programs that seek to heal the
wounds of the past and present through the lives of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of such programs find that targeting young people
offers the best chance of creating a society free of racial,
religious and economic stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are talking about attitudes and changing and opening
minds, I think we have a better chance with young people than with
folks my age,'' said Emily L. Trantham, executive director of the
Fort Worth/Tarrant County Region of The National Conference for
Community and Justice, formerly The National Conference of
Christians and Jews. The nonsectarian group has hosted Anytown
Texas for 16 years and provides other programs for youth and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are trying to understand who they are,
and who others are and where they fit in, and what kind of adult
they want to be,'' Trantham said. ``They are making decisions about
these kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar thinking lies behind the Ulster Project, begun 24 years
ago by an Anglican priest in the Republic of Ireland in an effort
to ease tensions between Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, about 760 Catholic and Protestant students from
Northern Ireland come to the United States for one month of
interaction with American teens.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington is one of 24 cities to host an Ulster group.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, 16 teen-agers and two adult counselors from
Northern Ireland arrived in Arlington for a month of activities.
</P>
<P>
   The trip gives the teens a chance to experience another culture
and to step back and get a different view of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow up hearing that another bomb's gone off, or another
soldier has been shot,'' said Cheryl McCutcheon, 20, counselor for
the girls in the group. ``Then you realize, `That's not happening
in other countries.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that Protestants and Catholics do not fight all
the time in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up mixing with both groups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Mathys, president of the Ulster Project-Arlington, said that
the struggle in Northern Ireland is really political rather0tT9

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lining a closet with aromatic cedar strips is an easy and
worthwhile project for any homeowner to undertake. The fragrance
will keep clothes smelling fresh and the natural resins in the
cedar, although not insecticides, will repel moths. Unlike moth
balls, the cedar will not have to be replenished.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective, the closet must have a door that closes to make
a snug seal against the stops. You can't use just any kind of cedar
either. It must be Eastern Red Cedar, often called ''aromatic
cedar.'' Fortunately, most lumberyards and home centers stock this
particular cedar. Usually it is sold prepackaged in 1/4-inch thick
strips cut and grooved for closet installation. Each package has
enough wood to cover about 16 square feet
</P>
<P>
   The tools and skills required for this job are basic ones.
You'll need a hammer, colored paneling nails (they should be about
the same shade as the cedar), a nailset, a trim saw and a miter
box, a caulking gun with a cartridge of construction adhesive, a
level, a chalk line and a ruler or steel tape. Depending on the
closet's size, you'll probably be able to line it in a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by emptying the closet. Remove the clothes pole, shelves,
and the baseboard and ceiling moldings, as well as the clothes and
any storage boxes. In order to capture the cedar fragrance, you
must line the entire closet, including floor, ceiling, and the
inside surface of the door. So measure the height and width of the
four walls (include the door) and the length and width of the
ceiling. Use these measurements to calculate the surface area of
the entire interior. Buy enough cedar to cover this area.
</P>
<P>
   The cedar strips in the package will be about 3 1/2 inches wide
and will vary in length (usually pieces 48-, 32- and 16-inches
long). For most of the job, you will only cut the strips to length.
Closer to the ceiling, however, the gap between the last few boards
and the ceiling may be narrower than 3 1/2 inches. Here you'll have
to rip (cut the strips lengthwise) the boards to fit.
</P>
<P>
   Open all the packages and sort the strips according to size. Set
aside a few boards that are straight-grained and knot free _ these
will easier to rip _ to install near the ceiling. Note that the
strips have a rough and a smooth finished side. The smooth side
should always face out.
</P>
<P>
   In the closet, find the center of each wall stud and also the
ceiling joists. You can use a stud finder for this, or you can
drill a series of small holes in line along the wall until you
locate the framing members. Studs are usually located 16 inches
apart on center, so when you find one, you can easily measure to
find the others. Snap a chalk line to mark their location from top
to bottom. Also snap lines for the joists.
</P>
<P>
   Nail the first cedar strip to the back wall about 1/2 inch from
the floor with the grooved edge down. Use the level to make sure
this first row is perfectly horizontal; if it is not, then the
entire job will be out of square. Nail the boards to the studs,
using the nail set to drive the nail heads flush with the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Apply of few dabs of construction adhesive to the back (rough
side) of the next strip and press it in place above the first row.
The grooves on the edge of this board should mate with the tongue
of the board under it. Continue adding boards to build successive
rows.
</P>
<P>
   With the construction adhesive, it is not necessary to nail
every piece. Nail only a few here and there to hold the rows in
place until the adhesive sets. Remember to check that each row is
level. The end boards do not have to fit directly against the
adjacent wall. You can leave a 1/8 gap to allow for expansion. The
gap will be covered by the pieces on the neighboring wall.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the walls first before installing cedar on the floor and
ceiling. You may leave a small gap where the walls and floor meet.
This can be covered with strips of molding. For molding you can rip
one-inch strips of cedar, or you can buy quarter round molding at
the lumberyard. .
</P>
<P>
   Panel the door last. When covering the door, be sure to leave a
gap around the perimeter to allow the door to close against the
stop molding.
</P>
<P>
   The cedar should not be painted or finished in any way. This
would seal in the natural oils and keep the cedar fragrance from
circulating.

YOUTH PROGRAMS TEAR DOWN WALLS OF PREJUDICE
</HEADLINE>

By MATTHEW BRADY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smart. Bookish. Boring.
</P>
<P>
   As stereotypes go, the Asian-American one doesn't seem half bad.
</P>
<P>
   But as high school senior Ryan Cuffee learned this summer,such
stereotyping can cut as deep as any remark about his
African-American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it in a joking manner, but it's wrong,'' said
Cuffee, who loves in Arlington, Texas. ``I never really did it
much, but I've stopped doing it now. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cuffee, the revelation came not from a textbook or TV show,
but through intense, structured interaction with students from
other cultures at a camp called Anytown Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Anytown Texas is among summer programs that seek to heal the
wounds of the past and present through the lives of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of such programs find that targeting young people
offers the best chance of creating a society free of racial,
religious and economic stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are talking about attitudes and changing and opening
minds, I think we have a better chance with young people than with
folks my age,'' said Emily L. Trantham, executive director of the
Fort Worth-Tarrant County Region of The National Conference for
Community and Justice, formerly The National Conference of
Christians and Jews. The nonsectarian group has hosted Anytown
Texas for 16 years and provides other programs for youth and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are trying to understand who they are,
and who others are and where they fit in, and what kind of adult
they want to be,'' Trantham said. ``They are making decisions about
these kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar thinking lies behind the Ulster Project, begun 24 years
ago by an Anglican priest in the Republic of Ireland in an effort
to ease tensions between Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, about 760 Catholic and Protestant students from
Northern Ireland come to the United States for one month of
interaction with American teens.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington is one of 24 cities to host an Ulster group.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, 16 teen-agers and two adult counselors from
Northern Ireland arrived in Arlington for a month of activities.
</P>
<P>
   The trip gives the teens a chance to experience another culture
and to step back and get a different view of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow up hearing that another bomb's gone off, or another
soldier has been shot,'' said Cheryl McCutcheon, 20, counselor for
the girls in the group. ``Then you realize, `That's not happening
in other countries.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that Protestants and Catholics do not fight all
the time in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up mixing with both groups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Mathys, president of the Ulster Project-Arlington, said that
the struggle in Northern Ireland is really political rather than
religious and that it can teach the United States much about its
own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do is look at what happened recently in
Jasper,'' Mathys said. ``It is sort of humbling when they are
looking to us to help break down barriers when we are still
struggling 130 years after the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Trantham said she believes that the fast pace of life impedes
understanding among various cultures in American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking specifically about stereotypes,'' she said. ``I
think particularly in this day and time, when we are absolutely
bombarded with so much information, we have to be able to quickly
categorize in order to kind of keep our sanity about this world we
live in,'' she said. ``But in doing so we may categorize in a way
that is wrong .... It's not having the opportunity to really get to
know someone who is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a year, Trantham organizes a six-week interfaith dialogue
involving seminary students from various faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, during the first session, some students want to
engage in theological debate. But instead, Trantham said, the
students must talk about themselves and their backgrounds: where
they grew up, number of family members, etc. In the second session,
the conversation turns to superficial religious issues. By the
third session, ``We start probing with some questions where we know
people will have differences,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The approach seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have one or two who feel comfortable talking about
anything, anywhere, with anyone,'' she said. ``Most of us are not
like that. I think most of us, before we want to become intimate
with anyone, want to know a little bit about that person, want to
know some of the things we share in common, want to know that what
we think and what we feel will be respected and listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach is taken at Anytown Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cuffee said that when his mother first approached him about
going, he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go. I figured it would be a waste of time,''
he said. ``I didn't like the fact that I would be gone for a week
with people I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He went anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Now he calls it the experience of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he make a lot of friends, but he also gained
insights into the dynamics of human relationships and learned that
any cultural barrier can be overcome with time, compassion and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons were summed up for Cuffee on the next-to-last day of
camp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Thursday, and the students were instructed to divide
into racial groups: African-American, Asian, Irish, German.
Interaction was permitted only within racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were black, you could not look at, talk to, address any
kind of white person,'' Cuffee said. ``It was difficult. ... You
got to know these people, and then for somebody to tell you could
not be friends because they were a different race _ it was very
difficult to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   The segregation was supposed to last all day. It lasted about 30
minutes, until one of the campers led the group in a rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wanted to do it in their hearts, but they were
pretty much afraid or scared of what would happen to them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The joy of breaking down the walls and the feeling of
camaraderie as the campers reunited is an experience Cuffee said he
will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the experience of a lifetime,'' he said. ``If you are
not educated about another race or another group, you are not going
to be open to them. People fear what they don't know.''

SEDUCTIVE SEDONA WOOS TOURISTS 

</HEADLINE>

By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ When pioneer T. Carl Schnebly settled in 1902
amid the spectacular red rocks and deep canyons that dominate this
enchanting landscape, he suggested Schnebly Station as the name for
a new post office.
</P>
<P>
   Too long to fit on cancellation stamps, the government informed.
</P>
<P>
   So T. Carl instead named the community after his 25-year-old
wife. And almost a century later, given its widely diverse appeals
_ and especially its mystical lures _ we can only imagine that
Sedona Schnebly was a woman of multiple personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sedona and the adjacent Oak Creek Canyon recreation area,
sandwiched a two-hour drive north from Phoenix or 2 1/2 hours south
from the rim of the Grand Canyon, hosts 5 million annual visitors _
remarkable considering the greater Sedona population is only
16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some gravitate here _ for a fortnight or a lifetime _ because of
Sedona's growing status as a premier arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Others pause to splash in old-fashioned swimming holes carved
between towering cliffs; to explore ancient Indian ruins by foot,
Jeep or horseback; to gaze upon a dazzling array of twinkling stars
from a cabin or campground beside Oak Creek; to languish in the lap
of luxury at the appropriately named Enchantment Resort.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number come to regenerate their spiritual being at
``power vortexes'' said to rival England's Stonehenge, the Pyramids
of Egypt and Australia's Ayers Rock among the world's strongest
energy fields.
</P>
<P>
   Forever hovering above all these pursuits _ literally and
figuratively _ are brilliantly hued cliffs and rugged sandstone
spires sculpted over millions of years by ocean tides and desert
winds, their shapes inspiring monikers such as Cathedral Rock,
Courthouse Butte, Madonna and the Nuns, Coffee Pot, Snoopy and Bell
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   First-time visitors spend hours, even days, focusing on these
red rocks from hot-air balloons, helicopters or Jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   Countless others, even those who have never approached Arizona,
admire their splendor from a living-room recliner or a theater
seat.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 full-length films have been filmed entirely or in
part here _ from 1932's ``Riders of the Purple Sage'' to 1985's
``The Karate Kid'' and with stars that include John Wayne, Shirley
Temple, Henry Fonda, Joan Crawford, Elvis Presley and Robert
DeNiro.
</P>
<P>
   Though current movie trends aren't always compatible with
Sedona's dedication toward preserving its natural wonders
(``Today's action-oriented directors ask us if they can blow up the
rocks,'' one tourism official says, sighing), rare is the day that
the land doesn't serve as a backdrop for television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Or the inspiration for a myriad of lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
POWER OF THE ROCKS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the ``home of the famous 101 omelettes'' _ among them
asparagus and turkey; peanut butter, jelly and banana; corned-beef
hash; and cottage cheese and blueberry _ the Coffee Pot Restaurant
represents a Sedona institution.
</P>
<P>
   Brochures and pamphlets stationed in its foyer also hint at the
newest rage, promoting ``Spiritual and Psychic Readings by
Solomon,'' ``Mystic Tours With Rahelio'' and ``Angelic Healings and
Past Life Regression'' clinics scheduled at the Center for the New
Age along Arizona Highway 179.
</P>
<P>
   Recent network tabloid television reports disturb civic leaders.
``They make it seem like we're the land of the kooks, and that's
just not so,'' one resident says.
</P>
<P>
   Elija Barkham, who conducts vortex tours for the Sedona Red Rock
Jeep Company, concedes, ``There is a lot of New Age garbage here.''
But don't get the wrong impression: Barkham, who moved to Sedona
from Great Britain, is a devoted believer in the power of the
rocks. ``I couldn't guide these tours if I didn't get a physical
and spiritual awakening,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Barkham has ample company: The Anasazi Indians considered this
red-rock country sacred ground thousands of years ago. More recent
meditators became known as ``channelers''; so the joke goes,
``Sedona is the only place in America with no TV stations and 1,500
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the term ``vortex'' was first applied here
in 1980 by lecturer and former Sedona resident Page Bryant, who _
based on scientific fact or modern mythology, take your pick _
identified a limited number of area locations she claimed represent
ideal meditation sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Bell Rock, are considered ``up-flow'' vortexes:
Supposedly these enable us to evaluate our lives from an elevated
plane. ``I've taken people to Bell Rock without telling them
anything, and they say, `Wow, I feel I've just had a shot of
caffeine,''' Barkham says.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Cathedral Rock, are ``in-flow'' vortexes: They
are said to facilitate introspection and an understanding of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another vortex, the Sedona post office, ``is supposed to be
a place of confusion,'' Barkham says. ``There must be something to
it because there are more dings in cars there than at any other
place in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid is that traffic flow also is heaviest at the post
office. Indeed, is there logic in any of this? Barkham stands
beside a gently flowing stream at Red Rock Crossing, one of
Arizona's most-photographed sites, on a glorious morning _ 70
degrees; a soft breeze; shade trees shielding the sun _ and peers
up at majestic Cathedral Rock. Nearby, three fishermen perched on
boulders make their casts as if posing for a Norman Rockwell
painting. A young couple spreads a picnic lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are your inner feelings at this moment?'' Barkham
inquires.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, it's very peaceful,'' comes the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got it! You understand the vortex!'' Barkham beams.
</P>
<P>
   Why spoil the moment?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the myths are not told and the songs are not sung, then the
land will die,'' Barkham says wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INDIAN CULTURE AND HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that this emphasis on vortexes as a tourist
attraction commercializes or makes light of hallowed Indian
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the native way is to never make judgments, and I will not
condemn any teaching or any individual where the spirit and heart
honors the beauty of the land and the beauty of living,'' says
Uqualla, a Havasupai Indian who serves as Enchantment Resort's
cultural ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone who comes to Sedona is going to be spiritually
elevated,'' Uqualla says. ``But if this New Age opens a door, it
can be good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uqualla, raised by his medicine-man grandfather on the floor of
the Grand Canyon, celebrates the red rocks, too, especially within
the walls of Boynton Canyon _ another designated Sedona-area vortex
_ where Enchantment is situated.
</P>
<P>
   In full ceremonial dress, he recounts stories of tribes that
roamed this land: the Anasazi, the Sinaguan, the Yavapai (his
cousin tribe) and the Apache. He introduces hiking trails that lead
to Honanki and Palatki, 800-year-old cliff dwellings adorned with
petroglyphs and pictographs, symbols created by pigment rubbed into
the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep tour companies also conduct guided tours that focus on
these sites and on Indian culture and history. A half-hour
excursion to the south leads to Montezuma Castle, the oldest and
best-preserved cliff dwelling in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can only bring a voice to the beauty of this land,''
says Uqualla. ``I realized many years ago that nature is more
powerful than man can ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AH, OAK CREEK CANYON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nature is especially powerful here. And generous. Not only are
the rock formations unique, but Sedona is surrounded by the
1.8-million-acre Coconino National Forest. Overall, the area
includes seven major biological communities ranging from desert
grassland to pine-fir forest.
</P>
<P>
   Every approach is tinged with drama. Arriving from the south,
motorists frequently pull to the shoulder of Arizona Highway 179,
mesmerized by their initial glimpse of fire-red Bell Rock and
Courthouse Butte. Those advancing on Arizona Highway 89A from
Jerome, a ghost of a town perched on Cleopatra Hill 35 miles to the
west, delight in panoramic views of the Mogollon Rim, the southern
escarpment of the High Colorado Plateau into which Oak Creek Canyon
is cut.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Oak Creek Canyon. One of America's most heralded scenic
drives _ an extension of Arizona Highway 89A north from Sedona
toward Flagstaff _ twists through a gorge whose depths reach 2,500
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether for practical transportation or as a day trip, this
journey is a highlight of any visit. The canyon road, guarded by
enormous cottonwood and sycamore trees, rises almost 2,000 feet
from Sedona's 4,500-foot elevation. Names attest to the rugged
terrain and/or rich tradition: Bootlegger and Banjo Bill
campgrounds; Grasshopper Point; Buzzard Ridge; East Pocket Knob.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that Zane Grey was moved to write ``Call of the
Canyon.'' Now, rustic lodges beckon stressed-out travelers whose
concept of re-energizing involves not a vortex but settling into a
hammock on a creekside patio, paperback in hand. Others find
shelter in one of six campgrounds operated by the National Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Slide Rock State Park, located eight miles north of Sedona along
State Highway 89A (but with about a quarter-mile walk from the
entrance to Oak Creek), is exactly as the name implies: a natural
water slide especially popular with kids in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing north, a succession of stomach-churning switchbacks
ascends to the Oak Creek Canyon Vista. Views are stunning from this
6,407-foot elevation. But then, almost every road _ paved or gravel
_ or footpath opens up a treasure chest of scenic wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, humans aren't alone in feasting off the land.
Animal and plant life abound: Almost 200 bird species, more than 50
types of mammals, 80 types of fish, amphibians and reptiles and
more than 500 species of seed plants have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A CENTER FOR THE ARTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, given the natural beauty and cultural
legacies, that Sedona has emerged into a center for the arts? Its
status as a haven for painters and sculptors, actors and musicians
long preceded the New Age invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood discovered Red Rock Country in the 1920s, especially
as a venue for cowboy movies. Over time, Lucille Ball, Orson
Welles, Jane Russell and Walt Disney were among celebrities who
called Sedona home, and several modern-day notables live quietly in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Surrealist painter Max Ernst settled here in 1950. When he and
sculptor Nassan Gobran sought a forum to demonstrate their skills,
they chose an old barn on the edge of town. Thus, the Sedona Arts
Center was born. And the ``Art Barn'' remains at the heart of this
community as a headquarters for classroom instruction and a
showcase for aspiring artists young and old.
</P>
<P>
   Most workshops now last several weeks, with topics ranging from
creative sculpture, advanced pottery and mask-making to songwriting
and acting. Craig Thompson, the Arts Center's executive director,
says plans are to create, as he terms it, ``the equivalency of an
Elderhostel program where anybody could come here for as short a
time as one or two days to a week and take classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The center also stages theatrical productions and sponsors
regular art exhibits, and a blueprint is established for a newer,
larger complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboy Artists of America was founded here in 1965, and
Southwestern, Western and American Indian arts continue to
flourish. More than 40 galleries represent nationally and
internationally known artists; many are situated in the fascinating
Tlaquepaque Arts and Crafts Village on Arizona Highway 179 just
south of the Uptown Sedona shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   Aesthetic appreciations are evident in other ways, too, among
them the striking Chapel of the Holy Cross, a huge sculpture
perched on a spur of red rock 200 feet above the desert floor and
visible to passersby on Arizona Highway 179 south of town. The
chapel is open year-round, and a glass enclosure affords sweeping
views.
</P>
<P>
   Annual arts-related events include the nationally acclaimed
Sedona Sculpture Walk (Oct. 2-4), which features more than 100
participating artists; the Sedona Arts Festival (Oct. 10-11); and
Jazz on the Rocks (Sept. 26), whose headliners have included Dizzy
Gillespie and Nancy Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting pop, rock, jazz and classical artists perform regularly
in the summer, and a new amphitheater is under construction.
Readers of American Style magazine recently tabbed Sedona among the
nation's top five arts destinations, behind only Santa Fe, Seattle,
New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Though the arts scene is varied, a common impetus is evident.
``Certainly the red rocks are an inspiration to many artists,''
Thompson says. ``Most come here for a vacation and fall in love
with the place, then years later they come back to live.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`A DELICATE ENVIRONMENT' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter which of Sedona's many personalities we explore, we
discover its soul imbedded in the red rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Its future, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Yadon, chairman of the Sedona-Oak Creek Canyon Chamber of
Commerce and owner of the luxurious Canyon Villa Inn, applauds the
emphasis on culture and tradition. And of a New Age to which he
admittedly doesn't belong, Yadon says, ``Many people come here to
find themselves, and I know it's heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he promotes these lures, Yadon says, ``We're in a
delicate environment. This environment is our main product. Above
all, we must respect and preserve this product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the land is what makes this place truly
special.''
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine that Sedona Schnebly is smiling.

COBBLER RECIPES ARE JUST PEACHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not sure where the first peach cobbler came from. I suspect
it was baked a long time ago when a cook like me, who couldn't bake
to save his soul, tried to make a pie and it fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than toss it out, he just lied and said he intended the
crust to be down in the filling. I would have done the same.
</P>
<P>
   I love peach cobbler, but I must say I am not too selective. I
enjoy the rich recipes with brown sugar crumbles on top, but I also
dive into the foil-pan, soupy-insides, cafeteria kind.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbler isn't supposed to be gourmet food. It is a quick,
inexpensive way to salvage the peaches that are going bad right
before your eyes. It's what you make when you just have to get rid
of those dusty cans in the pantry; it is what you make when you
don't have the skill and patience to roll out a 1/8-inch-thick
crust with fluted edges.
</P>
<P>
   It is also what you make right after you've been to the Parker
County Peach Festival in Weatherford, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   You can't drive through Parker County these days without your
mouth watering. The Peach Festival was last weekend, and I'll bet
there are hundreds of people sitting at home now, watching their
peaches go brown.
</P>
<P>
   I don't blame them. Parker County peaches are seductive. You
must have them, even if you don't know what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop is bountiful, the growers say. But the peaches
are kind of small. Instead of being the size of oranges, as they
usually are, they have been reduced to the size of healthy plums
because of the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness the festival people have come out with a cookbook
this year. It wasn't ready when I went looking for it, but the
folks at the Weatherford Chamber of Commerce told me the cookbook
has the same categories as the Peach Festival Food Competition.
</P>
<P>
   Those categories include cakes, sweet breads, pies, cobblers,
candy, miscellaneous, and children younger than 15.
</P>
<P>
   Children under 15 are hard to cook, I would think.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the chamber sent me an advance copy of the cobbler
recipes. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   JO ANN GLENN'S BUSY DAY PEACH COBBLER
</P>
<P>
   1 stick butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 heaping teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   4 cups Parker County peaches, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in 2-quart baking dish. Combine dry ingredients,
reserving 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon for peach mixture. Stir
remaining dry ingredients into melted butter in baking dish. Add
milk and stir again. Bring fruit, 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon to
boil. As soon as it boils, take off the heat and pour over batter.
Do not stir. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until crust is
golden brown.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER SUTHERLAND'S PEACH COBBLER
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup crushed corn flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   9 fresh peach halves
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease 8-inch square pan.
In large bowl, beat butter, brown sugar, lemon peel and lemon juice
until light and fluffy. Add flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and
nutmeg to butter mixture; beat until well-blended. Stir in cereal
until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Press half of mixture in bottom of greased pan. Arrange peach
halves, cut side down, over crust. Sprinkle with remaining crumb
mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until golden
brown.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE WRIGHT'S PEACH COBBLER
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sliced fresh peaches
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup margarine
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Put 1/2 cup margarine in baking dish; set in 350-degree oven to
melt while preparing the following ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Mix sugar, baking powder, flour, milk and salt together. Pour
mixture over melted butter; do not stir. Put peaches on top of
this. Bake in 350-degree oven for 45 minutes or until brown.
</P>
<P>
   Here is another recipe, but this one didn't come from
Weatherford. I'm not sure where it came from, exactly. I got it off
the Internet, and I seldom know where I am while on the Internet.
There were several just like it, and the addition of the Cheddar
cheese is intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   PEACH COBBLER WITH CHEDDAR BISCUITS
</P>
<P>
   1 quart peaches, sliced
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon almond extract
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Cheddar biscuits:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup biscuit mix, such as Bisquick
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mild Cheddar cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place the peaches in a greased
baking pan. Mix the sugar, cornstarch and salt, then sprinkle over
the peaches. Sprinkle the lemon juice and almond extract over the
peach mixture. Bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the biscuits by
combining all the ingredients, stirring well. Remove the baking pan
and drop the dough onto the hot peach mixture and bake for an
additional 20 minutes or until the biscuits are done. Serve warm
with whipped topping or ice cream.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1996 comedy ``Mother'' may be one of the only films to have
a running joke about videophones. In the movie, a 30-something
sports agent played by Rob Morrow tries to foster family unity by
handing out the gadgets to his closest relatives. His brother,
played by Albert Brooks, refuses even to unpack his, but the title
character, played by Debbie Reynolds, gamely does her best. But
despite all the instructions from her son and all the contortions
she goes through, she can manage to send only a fuzzy picture of
her neck or headless torso. ``I told him I like this,'' the mother
confesses, ``but it's driving me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that videophone technology more
properly belongs to the mother's generation than to her sons'.
First introduced by AT&AMP;T at the 1964 World's Fair, videophones _
sometimes called ``granny phones'' _ are perhaps the
longest-running source of disappointment for the consumer
electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   While expensive videoconferencing systems using costly,
high-speed data lines have found some acceptance in the corporate
world, the market for home videophones, the Holy Grail of gadgets,
is a battleground littered with four decades of failures by some of
the world's biggest names in electronics and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of the videophone has persisted, nudged along by
science fiction (``Star Trek''), comic strips (``Dick Tracy'') and
intermittent releases (AT&AMP;T's first marketing effort in Pittsburgh
in 1970 and its videophone 2500 in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, several companies have bravely moved into
the consumer videophone market, fortified by a new international
technical standard for video calling, more powerful computer chips
and the prospect of high-speed home Internet links.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them seem to have learned an important lesson from the
crushed dreams of the past: they are not claiming to have a product
that will change the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very realistic: it's not a mass-market product,'' said
Daniel Flohr, president and chief executive of C-Phone, a
videophone manufacturer based in Wilmington, N.C. ``Everyone's not
going to run out to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   The current efforts to make the sort of phones used by the
Jetsons fall into two camps: television-based systems and
computer-based systems. C-Phone and ViaTV units are literally black
boxes, each stuffed with a microprocessor and a tiny camera, that
use regular television sets for their visual display and
conventional telephone lines for transmission. (Both also run up
normal long-distance charges.)
</P>
<P>
   ViaTV's maker, 8X8, also offers a higher-priced variation that
does not require a television. With its tiny liquid crystal display
screen, the 8X8 Desktop Videophone comes the closest in appearance
to the popular image of the videophone.
</P>
<P>
   Both the 8X8 ViaTV (which is also sold by 3Com as the Bigpicture
TV Phone) and C-Phone are no more difficult to set up than a VCR.
Either box is linked to a television set and connected to the
telephone world through a separate cable that plugs into a standard
phone jack. Once wired, neither unit interferes with normal
television or telephone operation.
</P>
<P>
   All calls begin as voice-only connections. Then, assuming the
other party is willing and able to reveal all, buttons are pushed
and a video image appears within 30 seconds or so.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the computer-based systems _ including
Microsoft Net Meeting, CU-SeeMe, 3Com Bigpicture videophones, IRIS
Phone, VDO Phone Professional and the Intel videophone _ turn
relatively powerful personal computers (generally with at least a
Pentium processor and 16 megabytes of memory) equipped with
cameras, microphones and other equipment into videophones. The
hardware is supplied with some of the software packages.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have a suitable, fully equipped computer _ which
could represent an investment of $1,500 or more _ video calling can
be relatively inexpensive. One of the most popular software titles,
Microsoft's Net Meeting, can be downloaded free. Television set-top
or desktop videophone units, by contrast, can cost as much as $650.
</P>
<P>
   Some video-calling programs operate over the regular phone
network. Others trade predictability and quality for lower
operating costs by moving through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet video calling is much trickier. To start with, most
users must set up the time for the call in advance. Most PC-based
videophones will work only after both users log into special
directory servers known as Internet Locator Servers. There are more
than 200 such servers for Microsoft's Net Meeting alone, and the
listings on those confirm the suspicions that transmissions of
sexual encounters are a leading use of the technology. ``If I were
a cynic, I would say the whole VCR industry was launched by a very
similar thing,'' said Net Meeting product manager Tom Laemmel.
``But good came out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   What hooked Bruce Powell, a Web site designer in Tiburon,
Calif., was the chance to keep in better contact with his
mother-in-law in Nancy, France. ``If you're calling a family
member, it just makes a huge difference to be able to see each
other,'' he said. Given his profession, Powell first tried the
Internet-based system CU-SeeMe. ``When you're dealing with
technophobes like my mother-in-law, using CU-SeeMe is totally out
of the question,'' he said. ``It's just much too complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell then bought a pair of 8X8 Via TV unit; one was soon on
its way across the Atlantic with a French translation of the
installation instructions. His 77-year-old mother-in-law, with some
help from an adult son, plugged in her unit without incident. They
generally exchange video calls once a month. They have found that
video calls tend to last longer than regular phone conversations,
so the American and French sides of the family alternate placing
the calls and paying the intercontinental toll charges.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An interview over Powell's videophone system demonstrated some
of the lingering problems with such systems. First, rapid motion
overwhelms them. As Powell's 3{-year-old son flitted in and out of
the picture, the machine rendered him in coarse pixels _ the same
effect deliberately used in television documentaries to obscure
identities.
</P>
<P>
   Even a conversation with the more sedate Powell had its
shortcomings. Creating and moving images places heavy
data-processing demands on the unit. Because the video image must
first be compressed for transmission and then expanded for viewing,
the resulting picture lags well behind the accompanying voice,
making it look as though Powell was starring in a badly dubbed
foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   But the image and voice quality on the 8X8 units and C-Phone is
clearly better than anything traveling over the Internet. Even over
the fairly controlled high-speed link provided by Microsoft's
internal corporate network, the voice of Laemmel during a
videophone interview was slightly distorted, and his image was
sometimes dark and blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly all consumer videophone systems, Net Meeting
transmits, at best, only half the number of frames per second that
broadcast television uses, making all action look slightly odd.
</P>
<P>
   But things really fell apart when Laemmel continued the
interview through a second computer linked to the Internet through
a standard, consumer-speed dial-up modem. Some sentences became
incomprehensible because of lost or distorted words, and the video
often blacked out or froze. ``The fact we're going over the
Internet makes it sort of a crap shoot,'' Laemmel said.
</P>
<P>
   Current users can get better still images. Nearly every system
can produce still images of very high quality that users can easily
create with snapshot or freeze-frame commands. Many of Powell's
calls, for example, turn into variations of slide shows as wiggly
babies are lifted to the camera and frozen electronically or older
children's drawings are given the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of talk about overcoming the remaining technical
hurdles to make videophones a mass consumer product, but even that
may not guarantee success.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mantei Tremaine, a sociologist and computer scientist at
the Drexel University College of Information Science and Technology
in Philadelphia, has studied videophones for more than nine years.
What she has found is that the psychological barriers are almost as
daunting as the technical ones.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1996, for example, while she was on the faculty
of the University of Toronto, she studied employees at a small
company after two corporate offices were connected with a
videophone system. In time, she found, all nonmanagerial employees
disabled the visual connection, often by taping over the camera
lenses or pulling out wires. ``Everything was disconnected,''
Professor Mantei Tremaine said. ``This is how people felt about the
video.''
</P>
<P>
   The resentment stemmed from many factors. An early study
conducted by AT&AMP;T found that people took an average of 11 rings to
answer a videophone call _ often, they were tidying up their
personal appearance and desk before answering. (The cartoon
character Jane Jetson avoided the problem by donning a special mask
before answering her videophone.)
</P>
<P>
   But the professor saw that users grew used to the videophones.
No longer mindful, some users chatted away unaware that their beer
bellies were poking out from shirts. Male managers unnerved female
secretaries by speaking too close to cameras, unintentionally
``creating those powerful close-ups you see in romantic movies,''
Professor Mantei Tremaine said.
</P>
<P>
   But she found that one issue, privacy, ultimately loomed above
all else. ``People who didn't use videophones were worried about
having their privacy invaded,'' she said. ``And people who did use
them feared they were invading someone else's privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are issues developing about whom you will let see
your image on video calls. CU-SeeMe, for example, operates special
servers that allow many users to participate in video-and-voice
chat sessions. Forrest Milkowski, co-founder of White Pine
Software, the company that developed and markets CU-SeeMe, says
there was already resentment toward users who pointed their cameras
at, say, a houseplant. ``If you don't show your face, people find
that insulting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there will very likely be a lot of users who do
not want just anyone taking a peek. Dottie Lassen, a hospital
kitchen worker in Lebanon, N.H., and her 29-year-old son, Jason,
who lives in Los Angeles, were each given C-Phones after using them
on a television talk show late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two have used the units about a half-dozen times
to stay in touch, and Ms. Lassen has been pleased with the results.
``It's truly amazing,'' she said, but that does not mean she would
ever use videophones exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't pick it up and talk to just anyone,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't want strangers to see how my house is set up, to see where
my windows are, see the counter where I put my purse. Video calls
are really personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Videophones are also demanding. During a video call, it is
impossible to sift through e-mail, fold laundry or scan the
newspaper without those activities being noticed. Yet the current
technology often has the perverse effect of making everyone seem
inattentive. Since the cameras and display screens are set apart in
all videophone systems, fakery is the only tool for people who want
to appear as if they are hanging onto every word. Rather than
actually looking at the image of the person talking, a listener who
wants to seem engaged must stare directly into the camera lens.
</P>
<P>
   But neither technical nor psychological barriers are likely to
deter efforts to make the videophone succeed. Last December,
Kyocera introduced a wireless videophone in Japan. At two frames
per second, its black-and-white images barely offer any sense of
motion. But at least it keeps up the proud gadget tradition
videophones began back in 1964.

VIDEOCONFERENCING'S KILLER APP: SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (sidebar with CIR-VIDEOPHONES)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Videophones add a new dimension of anxiety to the familiar
problem of the phone ringing while you are in the bathtub. It turns
out, however, that thousands of people actually look forward to
video calls while they, and their callers, are undressed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as is typically the case with a new technology, early
adopters of videoconferencing have discovered that the so-called
killer app is sex. From Kansas to Kiev, Internet users are
enthusiastically embracing Net-based videoconferencing that allows
them to play show-and-tell with other uninhibited souls.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and other companies that make videoconferencing
products say that while sex-related applications are a very visible
use of the new technology, the most common applications are indeed
for business: conducting meetings, collaborating on work projects
and telecommuting, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also some people _ thousands, actually _ who use
the technology to exhibit themselves, in real time, without clothes
and to watch others doing the same. All it takes is a recent-model
personal computer, an Internet connection, conferencing software, a
microphone and a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   For voyeurs, even less equipment is needed. Thousands of
commercial sex sites on the Internet _ some broadcasting from
elaborate studios in Las Vegas or New York, others from a simple
Web camera in a woman's bedroom in Iowa _ offer live video to
customers, who need only a credit card and a standard Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live videos are almost a necessity if you're going to have a
successful subscription site,'' said Mark Tiarra, chief executive
of Tiarracorp of Midland Park, N.J., one of the largest providers
of design services to adults-only Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   But for two-way video and audio, it gets a bit more complicated.
One of the most popular software packages for Internet
videoconferencing is Net Meeting, which is free from Microsoft. To
promote the software and make it easy for software users to find
one another, Microsoft has set up a half-dozen Internet Locator
Server computers.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably 200 public locator servers on the Net. And
those are just the public ones. There may be thousands more on
private, corporate networks, or, perhaps, run by sex-related
businesses that make them available to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   At the servers run by Microsoft, users are asked to assign
themselves to one of three categories: Business, Personal and
Adults Only. The Adults Only site is a catalog of lusts. (No child
pornography was encountered or offered.) The Personal section
appeared to be nearly as heavily visited by sex-oriented users as
the Adults Only area, although a few users specifically requested
``family oriented'' or ``clean'' chat. The Business category
appeared, almost surprisingly, to be almost entirely business
oriented.
</P>
<P>
   On one morning this week, the Adults Only directory on a server
run by Microsoft was fully populated with users who had registered
their home countries as Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Portugal,
Taiwan, Korea, Australia, Mexico, Norway, Peru, France, Spain,
Switzerland, Japan, Britain, Venezuela, Russia, Chile and Turkey,
among others. Users from the United States accounted for about half
of the connections.
</P>
<P>
   Net Meeting users register to be included in a directory that
displays names, e-mail addresses, home locations and special
interests. On the Adults Only directory, very few people use their
real names or e-mail addresses, opting instead to advertise their
own physical attributes, attitudes and sexual proclivities. About
half the directory entries on a recent visit showed a small camera
symbol, indicating that someone at that address was willing to
broadcast pictures of himself or herself while in conference.
Conferences can involve two people or a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The rest indicated that they were open to audio exchanges _ in
essence, to talk dirty to one another, using the Internet instead
of a telephone. There are no long distance charges on the Internet
beyond the basic cost of the Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Laemmel, a product manager specializing in Net Meeting, said
Microsoft did not encourage the use of its products or condone the
use of its software or servers for what he called risque
activities. ``We realize it is a problem, and we're looking for
technology to solve the problem,'' he said. But he added, ``We're
not in the business of trying to police the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Laemmel said users offended by the solicitations of sex-hungry
Net Meeting users have several options to avoid them, such as
screening out other directory entries and getting an unlisted
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use Net Meeting with my mom all the time, and frankly, it
could be embarrassing if she saw all the directory listings,'' he
said, but they bypass the directories and call each other directly.
``Luckily, she never even logs on to the Internet Locator Server.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WWJD is showing up everywhere -- on wristbands, T-shirts and
jewelry -- and on every teenager I meet. Short for ``What Would
Jesus Do?'', WWJD is the latest popular religion fad to engulf
conservative Protestant churches.
 &HT;    The current craze started with a youth group at Calvary Reformed
Church in Holland, Mich. The teenagers dedicated themselves to ask
the question ``What would Jesus do?'' when faced with a moral
decision.
 &HT;    To advertise this commitment, they created bracelets displaying
the letters WWJD. The community embraced the idea and it quickly
spread nationally. To date, more than 14 million bracelets have
been sold.
 &HT;    However popular with trendy Christian teens, the idea is not
new. The youth group was influenced by the 1896 pietist classic,
``In His Steps,'' written by Charles Sheldon. A Congregationalist
minister, Sheldon wrote the book as a series of sermon-stories for
his flock. However, the novel became an all-time religious
bestseller with perhaps as many as 30 million copies in print
worldwide.
 &HT;    The story is simple. On a Sunday morning, ``Into the midst of
perfect accord and concord between preacher and audience, there
came a remarkable interruption.'' A tramp wandered into comfortable
First Church and began to preach.
 &HT;    ``What do you Christians mean by following the steps of Jesus?''
After rehearsing a litany of social ills and repeating the hymn
sung by the congregation he states, ``It seems to me there's an
awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn't exist if
people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I
don't understand. What would Jesus do?''
 &HT;    The good church people, moved by the tramp's plea, pledge to
live their lives for a year asking themselves, ``What would Jesus
do?'' And, of course, their lives, town, and indeed, the nation are
transformed.
 &HT;    As literature, ``In His Steps'' is neither memorable -- steeped
in late Victorian romanticism -- nor a likely draw for teenage
tastes. But WWJD enthusiasts do not care. They find the question --
What Would Jesus Do? -- compelling.
 &HT;    WWJD is a better question than those religious conservatives
have asked in recent years -- such as ``Do you support the
Christian Coalition?'' ``Are you for family values?'' and ``Do you
believe homosexuality is a sin?''
 &HT;    An improvement on the right-wing politics afflicting evangelical
churches, WWJD nevertheless raises some concerns.
 &HT;    Critics accuse the WWJD movement of being a smokescreen for the
religious right's political agenda -- an argument I find
unconvincing. Idealistic and sincere, WWJD teens seem unlikely
pawns in a giant right-wing conspiracy.
 &HT;    Rather, their questions are too narrow and individualistic. For
example, the WWJD CD challenges teens to respond as Jesus would
regarding the death of a father, sexual temptation, rejection by
classmates, and ``little things in life ... like a bandmate who
spends too long in the shower.''
 &HT;    Cruising the WWJD website, http://www.wwjd.com, seekers can find
nary a word about politics. WWJD is private piety and reveals a
certain evangelical ennui regarding public policy. These folks do
not want social revolution; they are just trying to cope with small
problems.
 &HT;    That's the problem. Finally, after years of asking bad
questions, evangelicals are now asking a good question. But they
are not asking it in the correct arena. This question should be
asked of American political life.
 &HT;    Charles Sheldon was not so shy. In his book, those who ask
``What Would Jesus Do?'' embrace numerous progressive causes. The
story climaxes when Trade Unionists and Christian Socialists, led
by an Episcopal bishop, organize the ``common people'' into a
socialist cooperative for Jesus (Really. Read the book).
 &HT;    Sheldon was a theological liberal, a Christian Socialist, an
early feminist, a pacifist and ecumenical minister who condemned
racism and anti-Semitism. What would Jesus do? Jesus would vote
Socialist. Jesus would defend the poor, women, blacks, Jews and
oppressed people. Jesus would oppose the military-industrial
complex. Jesus would stand up for gays and lesbians. Jesus would
not buy products made in sweat shops. Jesus would condemn tobacco
companies.
 &HT;    Moreover, Jesus would not market WWJD junk on the web. Jesus
would not join the Christian Coalition. Jesus would not be caught
dead at a Promise Keepers rally.
 &HT;    WWJD is a dangerous question. Odd that evangelicals are asking
it. Seems as if mainline Protestants and Catholics should be. After
all, their churches are already trying to answer it. And, Jesus
promised, his way would be hard and unpopular. It's that other way
-- the broad, trendy and commercially successful one -- that leads
to destruction.
 &HT;    WWJD: Jesus would not ask a question for which he really did not
want the answer.

<P>
   &UR; A Dearth of Zucchini &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My three zucchini plants have been flowering for the last
several weeks. They have produced only one female flower that
resulted in a zucchini. I had the same problem last year and
harvested only two zucchinis. There are cucumber, pepper, eggplant,
tomato, basil and parsley plants nearby. Can you tell me what's
happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. Are you getting female flowers that don't go on to make
zucchinis? Or are your plants suffering a gender gap?A more common
problem is female flowers that don't produce zucchinis, but both
problems are caused by the same sorts of stress, said Dr. Brent
Loy, a professor of plant biology at the University of New
Hampshire, who has done a great deal of work with the squash
family.
</P>
<P>
   The three most likely culprits are shade (squash is a sun
lover), very hot weather (especially if temperatures do not
moderate at night) and unusually wet conditions. ``If it was very
wet, that might stimulate male flowers,'' Dr. Loy said, adding that
the female ones can abort at such an early stage you might not know
they had ever appeared. But all male flowers are a possibility if
everything goes wrong enough, and that includes starting
transplants and then letting them get pot-bound. ``Plants that have
been stunted by adverse conditions or by delayed transplanting will
tend to produce an abundance of male flowers,'' he said. Squash
plants have to be in pretty good health for the females to form and
prosper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Daylily Care &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read that Stella de Oro daylilies will bloom all summer if
you deadhead them. So I went out every day and scrupulously pulled
off all the spent flowers. About two weeks later, however, I
started seeing what seem to be big green seedpods developing. What
am I doing wrong? Do I need to literally cut off the spent blooms
with a little bit of stem? And when a stem seems finished, should
it be cut back, too?
</P>
<P>
   A. I suppose this isn't the place to say, ``Don't believe
everything you read,'' but these daylilies, like most perennials
that are supposed to be constant bloomers, are more accurately
described as frequent re-bloomers. They will indeed make flowers
over a long season, but usually in waves, called flushes, rather
than all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Deadheading does help encourage this behavior by preventing the
development of seeds. That means you must remove the fruiting body
when you remove the flower. It is usually quite obvious where the
stem stops and the fruit starts, but just nipping off the critical
lump can leave an unattractive cluster of sticks, so careful
deadheaders clip the whole stem that carried the flower that is now
deceased. In the case of daylilies, of course, you don't want to
remove the larger stalk until all its flowers have had their
chance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Slug Combat &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! The slugs are winning, although I have many tuna
can-beer traps all around my shady Brooklyn backyard and I'm
vigilant about picking them off plants and the soil. I also have a
small pond, with small frogs that apparently don't eat slugs. They
must have a natural predator, right? Are there any other antislug
strategies that I can use without resorting to toxic chemicals?  &QL; 
A. There are several things to try, and a combination will probably
provide the best control. Predators include birds _ the robins that
are lunching on your worms  &UR; do &LR;  have their good side _ and toads,
shrews, turtles and, best of all, garter snakes.
</P>
<P>
   All of these creatures will help, and so will a number of
commercial products. Wide copper strips, for instance, which give
the enemy a small electric jolt, are effective barriers if you have
raised beds or well-separated plants. They don't work in dense
plantings, though, because the slugs just find one place to climb
and then ooze from leaf to leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Diatomaceous earth, on the other hand, is the old-reliable of
organic slug repellents. It looks like dust but is actually a mass
of sharp edges, the shells of tiny sea creatures. DE, as it is
popularly known, is widely available in garden centers and is
nontoxic to animals and fish. It should not be inhaled, however,
because it can damage your lungs; wear a mask when applying it.
Unfortunately, to be effective, DE must be used in unsightly
quantities and renewed at frequent intervals, including after every
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entrant on the organic lists is a slug poison called
Escar-go! The active ingredient is iron phosphate, which does not
harm other organisms and has no ill effects on the soil. I have
been using it this year with good results, though like DE it must
be frequently renewed, and unlike DE it is expensive in the
quantities necessary to control slugs in a large garden.
</P>
<P>
   Escar-Go is white, but it is in pellets, so it's easier to
scatter inconspicuously under plants. Escar-Go is sold by Gardens
Alive, 5100 Schenley Place, Lawrenceburg, Ind. 47025; (812)
537-8650; free catalog. A pound and a quarter costs $9.99 plus
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West
43d Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to
gardening(AT)nytimes.com. Those of general interest will be
published. Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.

EELS WELL THAT ENDS WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday July 17)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am trying, but so far I have failed to be catatonically
alarmed by the fact that Florida has been invaded 3-foot-long,
mucus-secreting, fish-eating, poison-resistant Asian rice eels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is the record heat that has reduced my capacity for
alarm. Or maybe the unchecked wildfires, or the sting rays, or the
state legislature's sales tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Asian rice eels are way down the list
of Reasons to Avoid Moving to Florida At All Costs, which is
probably unfair to new residents, not to mention the eels.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't read the papers lately (and who could blame
you for that?), the Asian rice eel is the latest non-native species
to have moved into Florida for the sole purpose of gobbling up
everything in its path, sort of like real estate developers or
bankers, only with even more slime.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began, as so many problems do, with an aquarium
owner who, in keeping with the more rigorous system of
fact-checking in place at newspapers these days, we will identify
as ``Ned.'' Ned, who for reasons that will become quickly apparent
didn't have many friends, decided it would be ``cool'' to add an
exotic new species to his tropical fish tank, preferably a species
that was about as pleasing and relaxing to look at as one of those
formaldehyde-preserved colons on display at the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious choice was an Asian rice eel (No, wait! Make
that two!). This creature is, needless to say, considered a
delicacy in certain quarters. What Ned failed to take into account
was that Asian rice eels can grow to be 3 feet long, so it was not
long before Ned's new pets outgrew their aquarium and took over his
living room couch, where they spent their days watching National
Geographic reruns and hoping that Flipper became infested with
parasitic worms.
</P>
<P>
   Ned's pet eels also had quite an appetite, so it was not long
before they had eaten all the other fish in Ned's aquarium, not to
mention the chicken pot pies, tater tots and leftover lasagna in
Ned's freezer.
</P>
<P>
   We have already established that Ned was not the brightest light
on his block, but it didn't take long for an idea to seep through
his concrete-reinforced cranium: Get rid of the eels.
</P>
<P>
   This was not as easy as it sounds. If Ned had been of Asian
descent, he presumably could have popped his pet eels into the
microwave or a tureen of hot broth and, perhaps accompanied by some
jellied octopus or candied sea urchin, made a tasty lunch. But
Ned's tastes ran more to Chicken McNuggets and cheeseburgers, so
the thought of eating his eels never really crossed his mind.
(Besides, there was the very real possibility that wrestling two
3-foot Asian rice eels into a tureen of hot broth might have ended
tragically for Ned, but we will not go into that.)
</P>
<P>
   So what Ned did is what any humane pet owner would do under
similar circumstances: He emptied a 5-gallon jug of swimming pool
chlorine into his aquarium. While this succeeded in making his
aquarium water crystal-clear, it had no noticeable effect on the
eels, other than to improve their backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Ned poured other poisons into his fish tank, but nothing
bothered the eels, which were reclining contentedly on the couch,
munching pretzels and making sarcastic remarks about Jacques
Cousteau's accent.
</P>
<P>
   At his wit's end (not that far a journey, in Ned's case), he
dumped his eels into Georgia's Chattahoochee River. While this
solved Ned's problem (at least one of them), it created an entire
new set of problems for states from Texas to North Carolina as the
eels bred like, well, eels and ate everything they could wrap their
slimy little eel lips around except Newt Gingrich whom the eels
said tasted like hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   (It should be noted that there is a rock band called the Eels
and their hit single is ``Novocain For the Soul.'' This seems
appropriate, though I'm not exactly sure how.)
</P>

LITTLE WONDER EVERYONE LOVES SHRIMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shrimp is so ubiquitous today that it's hard to imagine when it
wasn't around. As the century closes, even landlocked cities in
broiling climes have a wide choice in every supermarket. And if
supermarkets present shrimp that are a little too processed, Asian
markets offer the same guys with their heads attached. But despite
their availability, shrimp is still special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply Shrimp'' by Rick Rodgers (Chronicle, $16.95) puts the
little pink jewels in the capable hands of an experienced cookbook
author. What the reader gets is recipes for everything from exotica
such as shrimp and fennel bisque to the more everyday, but
certainly no less luscious, American buttermilk biscuits with Low
Country shrimp and ham.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are clear, precise and very cookable. Whether you
want to impress the neighbors or simply treat yourself, here's the
book to do it.
</P>
<P>
   CILANTRO SHRIMP TOASTS
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 30
</P>
<P>
   1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg white
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro, including stems
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, crushed through a press
</P>
<P>
   30 baguette slices, cut on the diagonal 1/4-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable shortening for deep frying
</P>
<P>
   In food processor, process shrimp, egg white, fish sauce, sugar,
salt and red pepper until smooth. Add shallots, cilantro and garlic
and pulse until combined. Transfer to small bowl. Spread shrimp
paste on baguette slices, mounding the paste slightly in the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place a cake rack over a baking
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   In a large, heavy skillet, melt enough shortening over
medium-high heat to come halfway up sides, and heat to 360 degrees.
Working in batches without crowding, deep-fry the toast, shrimp
side down, for 90 seconds, spooning oil over the toasts. Turn and
continue frying, spooning some of the oil over the toast, until
golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer toast to the wire rack and
keep warm in oven while frying remaining toast. Serve immediately,
with the sauce for dipping. (The toast may be kept at room
temperature for up to 1 hour and reheated in a 400-degree oven for
7 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   Dipping sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fish sauce

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's fair to say that Jeffrey Kagan of Atlanta is an expert on
telecommunications. He wrote a book on the subject, gives
interviews and speeches and keeps up with the latest trends. But
like millions of other Americans, he faces a communications
conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with his old cellular phones?
</P>
<P>
   He has six of them crammed in a desk drawer in his office. And
that's after selling two such phones at a yard sale for $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the old elephant graveyard, but it's the old cell
phone graveyard,'' he said. ``It's the same as old computers.
Everyone has a corner in their basement for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Group, a technology research and consulting company
based in Boston, estimates that out of the 50 million people with
cellular phones, 25 percent have at least one other cellular phone
that is not activated and in use, said Mark Lowenstein, the senior
vice president at the company for cellular research. ``Typically,
those phones are melting in glove compartments or collecting dust
in closets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first commercial cellular phone call was made in 1983,
sound quality has improved, and the phones have become smaller,
lighter and more affordable. Between 1992 and 1998, the number of
people using cellular telephones tripled, Lowenstein said. Because
of stiff competition among carriers, many people change carriers
and get new phones.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 15 percent of all cellular customers switched
carriers, he said, and in most cases, they got new telephones. The
newer digital telephones, with a longer battery life, more
sophisticated security and enhanced voice-mail, have also sent many
analog phones to the storage closet.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers retire larger phones and get the smaller models.
The cost of most new cellular phones has dropped so much that there
seems to be little point in continuing to use the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bell Atlantic Mobile will sell a new customer in
New York or New Jersey an analog telephone for $9.99 if the
customer signs a one-year service contract. The company will sell a
digital telephone for $179.99 with a contract.
</P>
<P>
   In some service areas, companies offer a free analog phone with
the contract. Companies recoup their money on the contract charge
and the rates for using the phones.
</P>
<P>
   While some analog phones may be worth $150 to $300, according to
Consumer Reports, the carrier will earn more than $500 a year from
a cellular subscriber who paid little or nothing for the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``With traditional cellular service, you can get the new phone
practically for free,'' Kagan said. ``The phone technology
continues to improve so rapidly that the phones today are much
better than the ones from two or three years ago. Most people would
rather get the new phone. But if the old phone is not broken, you
feel guilty dropping it in a trash can.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are offering trade-ins to new customers or those
who are upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Mobile will give customers a $30 to $50 credit
toward a digital phone if they turn in their analog models. Out of
more than 110,000 new digital subscribers in the last six months,
50 percent turned in their old phones, said Maggie Aloia Rohr, a
spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Mobile sends the phones to companies that
refurbish them or use them for spare parts, she said. The company
has had several thousand phones reprogrammed to dial only 911 and
has donated them, with the necessary service, to domestic violence
organizations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   So let's say you want to give your phone to charity,
sidestepping your local phone company. It is not all that easy.
Many local charities will not take them, probably because the
recipient cannot use the phone without a service contract. But most
Goodwill Industries stores will take donations of cellular phones
that do not need repairs, said Sheila Holt, a spokeswoman for
Goodwill in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel Communications has offered trade-in programs in some
markets. Customers get $100 to $150 off the purchase of a digital
Motorola cellular phone when they trade in their current cellular
phone and get a contract with Nextel. In the Chicago market, Nextel
is offering 500 free minutes of service for each consumer who turns
in an old phone and signs up with Nextel.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast Cellular Communications is working on a trade-in program
for customers in the Philadelphia area and recently offered a
``buddy'' program to encourage people to keep their old cellular
phone in use, said Melissa Nichols, a spokeswoman. For six months,
starting in October 1997, Comcast offered a six-month contract on
an analog phone for $9.99 a month when the customer purchased a
digital phone and contract.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are some repair companies, like Recellular,
based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that recycle cellular phones. They buy
used equipment in bulk from carriers, however, and do not take
cellular phones directly from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, Recellular has refurbished more than a
million phones, said Eric Forster, vice president for sales and
marketing. The company then sells the phones to dealers, carriers,
wholesalers and exporters. The majority of the phones go to
companies that sell prepaid contracts with their cellular phones,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forster urged consumers not to throw the phones away because the
nickel-cadmium batteries in some units might pose an environmental
hazard.``Companies need to have phone trade-in programs to keep
these phones out of landfills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Test Design, a company in West Chester, Pa., that
repairs telephone land-line switching equipment, was in the
cellular refurbishing business for two years but stopped in March,
with the exception of a few contracts with carriers. ``The cost of
refurbishing is so high that we weren't making a profit on it,''
said Joe Boyce, the sales manager for that operation. ``Customers
should try to get the carrier to take the phone in trade.''
</P>
<P>
   If you hold on to your old cellular phone, don't count on
finding a neighborhood repairman if it breaks down. ``There's no
such thing,'' Kagan said. ``It's not viable to set up a cell phone
repair shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Many phone plans come with a warranty to cover any breakdowns
and some companies will give you a replacement phone while your
phone is being repaired. After all, they want you to keep making
calls. Kagan's advice is to take the phone back to where you bought
it, rather than trying to find someone to repair it.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can also try to recycle their phones by selling or
trading them to other customers. The Recyclenet Corporation, based
in Ontario, (www.recycle.net) has a Web site where consumers can
advertise free any items they want to sell or trade. Cellular
phones are popular on the Web site, , said Paul Roszel, the
company's owner.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the price tag says, it can be hard to find a
home for an old cellular phone. Jack Stokvis, a consultant in New
Jersey, said he had offered to give his father his cellular phone
but his father didn't want it. His brother, Robert, has two unused
phones; he bought a new cellular phone three months ago that is
small enough to clip to his belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get them so cheaply you end up collecting them,''
Robert Stokvis said. ``It's a waste. They're still good, but who
needs them?''

   &UR; A Sea and Sun Vacation For Your Trusty Laptop &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm taking my laptop computer to the beach for a month. Do I
need to worry about damage from the salt air?
</P>
<P>
   A. The wind, sun and salt air that all feel so invigorating on
your skin during a beach holiday can have quite a different effect
on your laptop computer. If you've ever seen rust develop on the
metal parts of a bicycle left outside a beach house in the sea air
for a few weeks, you'll know why you should be concerned about the
inside of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, computers work best indoors in an
air-conditioned environment that maintains low humidity and a room
temperature between 65 and 75 degrees. Try to do most of your
computing inside in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
Too much heat or excess moisture from high humidity can cause
electrical components inside the machine to break down, shortening
the life of your laptop. Salt and sand from the beach can also end
up inside your computer through the machine's floppy drive or
connection ports.
</P>
<P>
   To help guard against the corrosive effects of salt air and
humidity, you may want to invest in a good weatherproof laptop case
for storing your computer. Or you can seal it in an airtight
plastic bag along with a packet of moisture-absorbent material like
silica gel (available at camera and electronics stores). With
proper protection, the laptop should be fine, but just remember to
occasionally unplug, relax and enjoy your vacation.
</P>

<P>
   For anybody who wonders what the neighborhood would look like
from the viewpoint of a low-flying aircraft, Microsoft's Terra
Server _ a database of aerial and satellite images _ may provide an
answer. But many who tried to visit the site after it went on line
recently saw absolutely nothing (www.terraserver.microsoft.com).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, that is, except for an hourglass or a spinning ball,
occasionally followed (with some browsers) by ``403.9 Access
Forbidden. Too many users are connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Some futurists (and now, apparently, the cable giant TCI and the
telephone giant AT&AMP;T, which intends to take over TCI) may believe
that the World Wide Web and television will one day be
indistinguishable, but it looks as though some work needs to be
done first. While television programs have always been available to
all who tune in, Web pages too often are not.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons why you may not be able to get to a Web site are
numerous, and the ``explanatory'' phrases that appear on the
monitor are cryptic at best, useless at worst. Like a crowded
highway, the Web often has trouble getting travelers to their
destinations because of heavy traffic. And even when Web surfers
manage to get to a page, many may find the door slammed in their
faces because thousands of people are trying to squeeze
simultaneously through the same narrow entranceway into the site's
computer servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can't access sites, it's usually not the PC's or
the phone line's fault,'' said Igor Shindel, vice president of
technology for Time Inc. New Media, operators of Time Warner's
Pathfinder site (www.pathfinder. com) and linked areas, which
include Time, Fortune and People. ``The problem typically lies in
the general load on the Web, or the load on the actual server
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Requests for a site's material must go to a server, a computer
(or a chain of them) that stores the information. The
www.pathfinder. com site keeps its Web pages on eight Sun
Microsystems multiprocessor computers running Solaris 2.6 and
maintains five copies of the pages to protect the site from
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The 300,000 pages of the Microsoft Web site (www.microsoft.com)
are held on 58 Compaq computers, each with 4 processors. Each of
these $25,000 behemoths contains a 30-gigabyte hard drive and 512
megabytes of RAM. Duplicate (or ``mirrored'') information is held
in similar sites in Tokyo and London, said Tim Sinclair,
Microsoft.com's editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Like someone getting a busy signal when trying to make a phone
call, a user who cannot get into a Web site should keep trying.
Every person who ends a connection instantaneously makes room for
another. Sites that offer software for downloading can get tied up
for even longer periods. While viewing a Web page requires just a
few seconds of connect time, downloading the latest version of
Internet Explorer could require 20 minutes to 3 hours on line,
limiting the number of people who can get to the servers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the large capacities of the more popular Web sites do not
mean easy access. A site may go down for many reasons, like a lost
connection with an Internet service provider or a decision by the
site's administrator to remove it from the Net temporarily to
update its pages. If a smaller site goes down, the reason could be
even more quirky _ a child might have run behind his mother's desk
and tripped over the server's electrical cord.
</P>
<P>
   Sites may also appear to be unavailable when they are actually
just loading at a snail's pace. Pages with lots of graphics will
load slowly, causing some users to hit their browser's Stop button
in the mistaken belief that nothing is happening. Sometimes your
browser will tell you in a small window at the bottom of the screen
just what it is trying to do _ getting in contact with the host's
server or downloading material, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Typing the wrong Web address (the URL, or uniform resource
locator) _ even if it is off by only one letter or digit _ will
also block access to the site. (Some Web site providers, especially
those with pornographic sites, take advantage of misspellings by
registering site names that are just one letter away from the
spellings of popular ones, so unsuspecting users will go there by
accident.)
</P>
<P>
   Or you may click on a link from a home page or Internet search
engine like Yahoo or Alta Vista but wind up going nowhere because
the page is no longer there, even though there is still a record of
it.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the All Things Web site
(www.pantos.org/atw), which explains how to set up Web sites,
Internet pages are getting bigger, and the number of missing links,
pointing to nonexistent pages, has ballooned in the past year.
Today, the average page weighs in at 61 kilobytes, up from 44 a
year ago, while the incidence of missing links has increased by
almost 40 percent. Today, 23 percent of all pages have at least one
dead link.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium is trying to find ways to eliminate many of the
problems with gaining access to Web sites. It is working on
Internet 2, a next-generation service that will increase the size
of the electronic road to Web sites (the bandwidth), making it 10
to 100 times as large, said a consortium member, Mario Gerla, a
professor of computer science at the University of California at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for an Internet that will sense when multitudes
are trying to gain access to a particular site and will
automatically copy that site's pages to another local server. Now
if only someone can figure out how to keep that child from running
into the computer power cord.

LIGHTEN UP _ OR NOT _ WITH THESE RECIPES

<P>
   You've got two ways to approach eating in this weather. One: You
can eat light to feel light. Or two: You can reward yourself for
getting through another day of this misery by eating something
delicious but decidedly not on the debit side of any calorie
ledger.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a recipe that reader Susie Rainey developed for a
cookbook she is writing. As you can see, it weighs in quite low on
the fat scale.
</P>
<P>
   LOW-FAT SPINACH ENCHILADAS A LA RAINEY-AKEN
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>
<P>
   Enchiladas:
</P>
<P>
   9-ounce package Green Giant Harvest Fresh frozen spinach (no
sauce)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons nonfat sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, finely shredded
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely diced sweet yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   2 large low-fat flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons nonfat sour cream mixed with 1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced jalapeno
</P>
<P>
   Garnish:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons diced tomato
</P>
<P>
   Microwave spinach according to directions on package and drain
well in colander. Mash to extract all fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Saute onion in a nonstick pan. Remove seeds from jalapenos
before mincing. Combine drained spinach with 4 tablespoons sour
cream, cheese and onions in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Moisten tortillas under running water and shake off excess
water. Fry quickly using nonstick spray on medium heat until hot.
Split spinach mixture in half and spoon into a long mound down the
middle of each hot tortilla. Roll the tortillas around the spinach
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Lay the enchiladas ``seam'' side down on a plate.
</P>
<P>
   For sauce, combine jalapenos with sour cream/water mixture. Warm
quickly in the microwave (20 seconds should do it). It should be
thin enough to pour.
</P>
<P>
   Top the two rolled enchiladas with sauce and garnish with diced
tomato.

   Requests:
</P>
<P>
   Jack Walter Coots of North Richland Hills would like a recipe he
remembers from the 1920s. It's an old-fashioned banana layer cake
with hard, sugary icing. The bananas are sliced thin and
lengthwise, placed between layers only, with a thin layer of icing.
The top and sides are sealed with the icing that is sort of a
creamy color.
</P>
<P>
   Hurene Morrow of Azle, Texas, is desperate for a coconut
Wheaties cookie recipe. These cookies have no oatmeal or brown
sugar. They are very crisp, and the recipe makes about 6 to 8
dozen. She believes the recipe was from a Wheaties box in the late
1940s or early 1950s. ``The other people who had the recipe are all
dead,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Weldon is requesting a recipe for an Indian corn casserole
that includes bacon and its drippings, corn bread, corn and
jalapenos.

room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really annoyed,'' said Kerr, who found out later that
her doctor misdiagnosed her problem, an acne-like infection known
as rosacea. ``It was demeaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care and hospital mergers are putting increasing
pressure on health care professionals to keep costs down. That
means physicians are packing more patients into the day. Manners
sometimes get lost in the rush.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a time when the health care industry is becoming
more competitive and hospitals and HMOs are fighting for customers.
What they're learning is bad bedside manners can add up to serious
and costly mistakes, from mistaken or missed diagnoses to
dissatisfied patients and malpractice suits.
</P>
<P>
   To improve how doctors juggle efficiency with empathy in the
exam room, medical schools are increasingly turning to professional
patients who play at being sick with everything from hypertension
and diabetes to depression and stress.
</P>
<P>
   Known as standardized patients, they're paid to give aspiring
doctors a chance to practice and polish their clinical and
communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, almost all of the nation's 125 medical
schools have revamped their curricula to include time spent with
these patients in hopes of developing a human and healing touch in
their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the medical profession is finally aware that all is
not well with the patient-doctor relationship,'' said Dr. Irwin
Hassenfeld, a professor of psychiatry and an assistant chairman of
psychiatric education at Albany Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the dissatisfaction with physicians ... is (patients)
don't feel they get listened to,'' Hassenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   In today's competitive health care industry, HMOs are
increasingly paying attention to satisfaction surveys and holding
their doctors accountable for how well they listen and communicate
with patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts pressure on physicians to say this is valued and not
just by the individual patient,'' said Linda Morrison, director of
the standardized patient program at Southern Illinois University
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lessons taught by standardized patient programs are
straightforward: knock before entering the examining room, maintain
eye contact, and acknowledge what the patient is telling you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone says my mother died three months ago, you just
don't write it down and move on to the next question,'' said Dr.
Henry Pohl, the associate dean for medical education at Albany
Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other practical considerations that Pohl wants his
students to consider, such as knowing how to protect a patient's
modesty with one of those flimsy paper gowns, remembering to wash
their hands and presenting a competent demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had dress-code problems, hair problems, body odor
problems, perfume problems,'' he said. ``Patients felt
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Most real patients, however, will keep their mouths shut.
Proponents say that's where the hired stand-ins can make a real
difference by offering students constructive criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a teaching tool,'' said Linda Perkowski, the director of
the standardized patient program at the University of Southern
California. ``It's a safe environment to practice skills.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kerr, the insensitive bedside manner of the doctor she saw
about her skin problem inspired her to try and help medical
students. Now, she heads to Albany Medical College an average of
twice a week to be probed, touched and questioned by aspiring
doctors about imaginary aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the $12-an-hour she earns for her work, Kerr said she
gets the satisfaction of helping future physicians do a better job.
``It gives me the opportunity to try to help them become more
approachable doctors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She plays different roles: an abused woman and a smoker with
hypertension, in hopes of pushing young medical students to realize
that medicine is as much art as science.

IT'S TIME TO SHRINK THE BIG SOFTWARE BOX  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans are used to big boxes packed with cereal or cookies,
but mostly with air. But it's a surprise to see the same packaging
strategy from the computer industry, which constantly boasts of
miracles of compression _ of seven-tenths-inch-thin laptops,
multiple megabytes squeezed onto tiny disks and digital assistants
the size of a Saltine.
</P>
<P>
   So why does a program such as Windows 98 (about $90), recorded
on a single CD-ROM, arrive wrapped in a box that measures 8 inches
by 10 inches by 2 inches and includes a manual, a clutch of coupons
and a cardboard stiffener folded with origami cleverness?
</P>
<P>
   The standard big software box is designed to let vendors build a
bright wall of product to attract customers. Peter Janssen, former
vice president of merchandising of Egghead Software, advises
software companies ``to use the package as your ad to persuade at
the point of sale.'' The big box also discourages shoplifting and,
packagers say, protects the disk from damage during shipping.
</P>
<P>
   But John Ruston, an economic analyst for the Environmental
Defense Fund, who led efforts against McDonald's clamshell
hamburger package, says, ``Generally, most software is egregiously
overpackaged.'' Software packages, Ruston notes, use virgin paper
instead of recycled. The fat manuals are often redundant, since the
information is already on the disk. So why do the packages continue
to be so big?
</P>
<P>
   Ruston attributes the persistence of wasteful software packaging
to industry inertia. ``This is the old outdated mentality of giving
the customer value by providing a lot of stuff,'' Ruston says.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``lot of stuff'' that's the problem. One day not long
ago, I heard a rumble behind my desk and realized that the
Shaq-high stack of software boxes had toppled over. So much
cardboard, so much air. What for? Haven't we been here before?
</P>
<P>
   And not just with the McDonald's clamshell. Eight years ago, an
organization called Ban the Box challenged the notion of the
so-called long box, the 6-inch-by-12-inch package that was devised
to hold music CD's, which were then replacing albums. Peter
Gabriel, Bonnie Raitt and U2 refused to have their music
distributed in long boxes, objecting to wastefulness. As with
computer disks, the complaint was that there was too much material
surrounding the small kernel of product. Eventually, the long box
was phased out. Today, the jewel box shelters CD's, and
electronically tagged against shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of the victory over the CD long box, New York
Assemblywoman Susan John sent a letter two years ago to Bill Gates,
requesting that Microsoft provide leadership in reducing software
overpackaging. She pointed out that reduction would be both
environmentally sound and would save Microsoft money. She never
received a response.
</P>
<P>
   Package designers at Microsoft claim, however, that their
packages are getting smaller as their manuals get smaller. (The one
valid excuse for bigger packages _ the multiple disks that use to
be required for some programs _ is no longer valid; today, it is
rare for a program to require several disks.)
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Rothauser, a Microsoft spokeswoman, says that existing
packaging is still needed for security and protection of the disks.
But, she says, ``We are working to reduce the size of packaging
where possible.'' And there is some progress: The company has
abandoned the interior jewel case that holds the disk itself for
programs like Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's not enough. The New York Times asked Tibor Kalman
of M &AMP; Co., a design firm, to create a dummy package for Microsoft
Word, to show how it could be done. His alternative: a cardboard
slipcase with a much-smaller manual and standard CD-ROM inside. The
big software packages, he says, are like the humongous portions of
pasta some restaurants serve. ``It shows a disrespect for the
intelligence of the audience,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of the software big box may require the same
strategy that defeated the CD long box: software hotshots, like the
rock stars, could refuse to have their Mega-Destructacon game
released in anything other than a smaller, less-wasteful box.

 ALBANY, N.Y.: art as science.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beyond the technical know-how, it's the ability to ask the right
questions, listen, and put physical problems into the context of
someone's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eye contact, you need to work on that a little,'' Kerr
told a student after a simulated encounter where she played the
role of a 40-year-old woman with high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But she praised the student for not being judgmental about her
smoking habit or her lifestyle. ``You didn't lecture me about it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to make such encounters a part of the regular
curriculum at all schools and require doctors to pass a national
licensing exam on their clinical and communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools already require their students to pass a clinical
competency exam before they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Such an exam would evaluate students on everything from how well
they listen, to their ability to ask organized questions and
perform routine physicals and histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have been too caught up in technology,'' Pohl said.
``Schools haven't focused enough on good old-fashioned ways of
getting information.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year for the first time, all foreign medical school
graduates applying to U.S. residency programs have to pass a
clinical test that challenges both medical and language skills
using standardized patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can communicate well with their patients, they're more
likely to come up with the correct treatment,'' said Maysel Kemp
White, the assistant director of education and research at the
Bayer Institute for Health Care Communication in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   She said a ``major reason why doctors are sued is communication
or lack of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the communication gap is detailed in numerous
studies and surveys. In an American Medical Association poll of
more than 1,500 Americans, 54 percent said that doctors care less
about people than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   And patients aren't the only ones who feel slighted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a national poll of 230 physicians found that 61
percent felt medical school or residency programs did not prepare
them well enough to communicate with patients on sensitive topics.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl and other medical education experts believe standardized
patients are part of the answer to bridging the distance between
people and their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standardized patients are real people,'' said Dr. Daniel
Klass, director of the standardized patient project for the
National Board of Medical Examiners in Philadelphia. ``You have to
learn how to apply your medical knowledge with real people.''
</P>
<P>
   By giving students a chance to practice with dying patients,
sexually abused patients or belligerent patients in a simulated
setting, they're less apt to make mistakes when confronted with
real-life problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually people do it better the second time,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they don't mind being put under such scrutiny. Most
of their encounters with standardized patients are videotaped from
a special monitoring room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great way to get actual feedback,'' said Jacquelyn
McConville, a third-year medical student from Long Island. ``The
more we do it, the more comfortable we are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Myers, a medical student from Colorado. agreed. Her
standardized patient recommended she organize her questions a
little tighter. ``I definitely think it's valuable,'' she said.
``There's so much to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers has only to consider her own experience with some
physicians to understand a patient's perspective. ``I've had some
doctors who've had their hands on the doorknob the whole time,''
she said. ``I want somebody who listens to me, who I know is
concerned about me.''

A LOOK INTO THE MIRROR OF REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Elizabeth Branch is talking about trying to
save African-American children when the office door squeaks open
and a child _ a chubby-faced toddler _ waddles in and crawls into
her lap.
</P>
<P>
   She embraces him, and he snuggles against her chest as she
gently rubs his back. But Branch is in another place and time,
remembering another boy she met years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, one of nearly 200 others over the years, had come
to Branch's Alternative School after having been expelled. His
crime: carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me,'' Branch recalls, ``and asked, `What am I
supposed to do? Who's going to watch my back?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Branch, a reading specialist and creator of Man in the Mirror, a
little-known behavioral program that seeks to change the way youths
respond to conflict, is finding it hard to shake that memory
because that boy comes through her doors with haunting regularity,
in many different bodies. What's worse is that his story is almost
always the same.
</P>
<P>
   This is a truth that Branch hopes will finally take hold of her
community, the truth that few people want to accept and to take
responsibility for, or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   It is a truth that would require a hard look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But Branch does it. Nearly every day of the week, for the past
five years, she has looked into the eyes of African-American youths
and seen their suffering. In turn, she tries to get them to see
reasons why they should love themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That, she says, requires them to take responsibility for their
actions and to reach inside for what they need to change the way
they respond to others.
</P>
<P>
   Branch's reach, however, is limited. With the exception of some
Fort Worth school and city officials, few have bought into the
program. Funding is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't be about money,'' she says. ``This is about our
children, and we can't wait any longer to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch is aware of recent news articles describing a drop in
juvenile crime, but she adds, ``when there is a cold in the
majority community, we've got pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what she means by that.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Branch and her program director, Charles Neal, sat
for one hour in a Tarrant County juvenile courtroom. In that one
hour, they saw eight youths brought before the judge. Six were
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so helpless,'' she said. ``Children look to us for
answers, and it used to be that no matter what they came to us for,
we had an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to ignore the fearful aloneness Branch describes in
the children she sees, because you can see it in their eyes. Not
just eyes that have never known support, but eyes hungry for love,
that force and mystery that we both extol and curse, but which none
of us has ever been able to explain, control or live without.
</P>
<P>
   You listen to Branch, and you know how she must feel. It feels
like the fussing little boy who just crawled into your lap, like
the future seeping through your fingers like water, carrying along
with it dreams, possibilities and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Branch said she believes that Man in the Mirror, which promotes
positive attitudes, independent thinking, high self-expectations,
moral values and hope, can counter the self-destructive behavior of
black youths.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the past can seldom be undone, but neither does
it have to be all anyone ever sees. Not if we're willing to see
ourselves as we really are. But that requires a look in the mirror.

 Rodes Fishburne, a former Alaskan fly-fishing guide, is currently
an associate editor at Forbes ASAP.  
 By RODES FISHBURNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a big fish. I knew that as soon as it struck. Perhaps it
would be 15 to 20 pounds, maybe bigger. I clenched my jaw as I
tried to maneuver the leviathan toward the boat. This fish could
win me the tournament _ prizes, cash and all the rewards of being
one of the country's best anglers. Then without warning, my fishing
line snapped under the strain with a sickening twang.
</P>
<P>
   I groaned, leaned back in my chair and watched in astonishment
as a message flashed on the screen: ``Your hook didn't set, you
have lost a 24.5-lb. fish.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems there are no guarantees in the world of fishing
software, just as there are none when fishing for real fish.
</P>
<P>
   Think of fishing software _ in this case a bass fishing
tournament game designed to test skills by presenting realistic
fishing situations on a computer screen _ as simulated angling,
where would-be professional anglers try to outwit Artificially
Intelligent (AI) fish.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of a computer trying to tempt virtual fish into
taking virtual lures may seem like a neo-Luddite nightmare come to
life or evidence that computer game developers have gone completely
walleyed. Interestingly enough, it is neither: fishing software is
simply another example of the ubiquitous computer merging with one
of America's favorite pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   The best fishing programs try to teach anglers how to think
about certain fishing scenarios and how to piece the information
into a winning pattern that can be used to catch fish consistently
in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no guarantee that understanding how to catch
cyberbass in Lake Mead translates into success on the real Lake
Mead _ fish have free will, too _ the games do require you to think
about what you are doing instead of blindly clicking and casting.
</P>
<P>
   Another category of fishing software is river-reference CD-ROMs.
Like their game counterparts, these compendiums are built around
understanding how to fish real rivers. They use practical
information and historical data for each body of water to aid
traveling fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is like a crossword puzzle. Fit a couple of the pieces
together (water temperature, weather conditions) and you will be
ahead of the crowd. Fishing software can help you to understand,
and even practice, how to put the puzzle together.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot, however, replace the real experience of making your
first cast of the year, releasing a large trout or relaxing in the
great outdoors. Or, for that matter, snagging your hat, falling
into a beaver dam or running out of gasoline miles from the boat
dock.

   Pitting Your Wits Against Wiles of the Virtual Trophy Bass
</P>
<P>
   BASS MASTERS CLASSIC: TOURNAMENT EDITION
</P>
<P>
   (THQ Software; $29.95 to $34.95; Windows 95 and 98; to be
released Sept. 8.)
</P>
<P>
   TROPHY BASS 2 DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Sports; $29.95; Windows 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's not going to be easy,'' says Shaw Grigsby, an
eight-time Bass Masters Classic qualifier, in the video
introduction to THQ's new bass tournament game. Fair warning
indeed. Built around the premise that you are vying for the title
of best bass fisherman on the planet, Bass Master Classic lets you
test your skills in the Super Bowl of fishing tournaments against
50 top fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Did I have what it took to catch a cyberbass? Could I outthink
my computer? Well, sort of. My first tournament was on Lake Mead, a
three-day affair that had me zipping over the lake in search of
hungry fish. The early preview copy of Bass Master Classic that I
played uses an over-the-shoulder view of the caster to simulate the
view of a pro fisherman. Controls at the bottom of the screen allow
you to move the boat, set your casting target and watch your depth
finder for changes in bottom structure. A click on the tip button
calls up short video clips featuring Roland Martin, Paul Elias and
Ken Cook, top bass fishermen who try to point you in the right
direction. (According to the manufacturer, the final version of
Bass Masters Classic will have force-feedback support that will
allow the angler to feel a jerk on the joystick when a fish bites.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament, players select their fishing equipment
and rig up to seven rods with lures suitable for landing lunkers.
</P>
<P>
   By the virtual second day of my Lake Mead experience, I was in
50th place and still trying to figure out how to tempt a fish into
the boat. In the final two days, I was able to find and catch five
bass off a rocky point that dropped into deep water. The total
weight was 22 pounds _ hardly enough to win the tournament but
enough to keep me from getting demoted to chief minnow dipper.
</P>
<P>
   After Lake Mead, I looked for another tournament to fish and
found Trophy Bass 2 Deluxe. This software package consists of the
previously released Trophy Bass, Trophy Bass 2, the Northern Lakes
add-on pack and a revised how-to section.
</P>
<P>
   Trophy Bass Deluxe has high-quality production values, including
excellent background sounds, like the splash of jumping fish and
the dreaded crack of snapping line. Sierra Sports' game comes with
a list of 50 actual lakes in the United States. I picked Castiac
Lake in California. In the nonvirtual world, Castiac is one of the
best big-bass fishing lakes in the country, yielding largemouth
bass weighing more than 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   While the action on the water can be challenging, it is not
impossible to catch fish. Kurt Webber, lead designer for Sierra
Sports, said, ``We wanted to make this game as realistic as
possible without fully reproducing the frustration of going out and
not catching anything.'' Thanks, Kurt.
</P>
<P>
   After studying both photo and topographical maps of the lake, I
staked out my spot in a sheltered cove. I maneuvered the boat by
using the cursor keys while keeping an eye out for fish. Bingo!
Hidden beneath a lush aquatic mat of Lake Castiac vegetation was
the largest digital fish I had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got your number, Bubba,'' I whispered. After quickly
making a few tackle adjustments, I sent forth my first cast. A
``STRIKE,'' the screen flashed. But after rapidly reeling in the
fish, I realized that, just as in real fishing, a little
whippersnapper had beaten Bubba to the lure. Because of the
commotion, my behemoth was gone. Rats.
</P>
<P>
   In both games, pulling the mouse quickly after the fish strikes
performs the crucial maneuver known to anglers as ``setting the
hook.'' That mouse maneuver sounds like a good idea in theory, but
in my enthusiasm to land a pixelated bass, I found myself sweeping
all things unbolted from the top of my desk onto the floor. That
noise, followed by my whoop of ``Fish on'' after I successfully
hooked a bass, made it difficult for me to claim that I had been
working when I emerged from my office at home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting and anthropologically fascinating
element of both games is not that you can fulfill your professional
bass fishing fantasy 24 hours a day, or even that you might get so
involved in the game that you accuse your computer of cheating. No,
the most interesting element is that you can fish against other
anglers around the world in Internet tournaments.

   I was quite surprised at the number of people fishing and using
chat rooms to talk to one another on line. Judging from their
familiarity with one another, this wasn't an occasional habit.
Turbo Dog, a 30-year-old man from Louisiana, said he fished every
night after work for an hour, via computer. His largest catch to
date: a 22.6-pound bass. And yes, he did print a screen capture to
save the memory. Computerized taxidermy has arrived.

   For Fly Fishermen, 5 Rivers
</P>
<P>
   TROPHY RIVERS
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Sports; $29.95; Windows 3.1, 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   Trophy Rivers is a new twist on the fishing game genre. It is
geared toward fly fishermen and uses rivers, not lakes, as the
water of choice. To be successful, players must learn how to read
water, consider fly-casting styles and match the appropriate fly
with water conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the game, you must choose from among five well-known
North American rivers. There are more than 200 miles of digital
rivers, replete with rainbow, brown and brook trout as well as
Atlantic, chinook and coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth spending some time on the initial selection screen
reading river information, watching the interactive presentation
and examining the overview map for clues on how to approach each
river.
</P>
<P>
   While designing the game, the creators spoke with local river
experts to gather accurate information about specific insect
hatches on individual rivers. If you're on the Deschutes in June,
for example, you want to throw a stone fly, said Kurt Webber, lead
project manager for Sierra Sports. All the rivers have hatches in
the warmer months, so anglers should keep their eyes peeled.
</P>
<P>
   Trophy Rivers' graphics are impressive, with detailed riverbanks
and realistic fishing conditions. Depending on where you choose to
fish, you will be steering a sturdy drift boat or canoe while
scanning the river for likely lies. It is also possible to leave
the boat and wade if you want to work a piece of water over
especially thoroughly or just want to stretch your legs.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in real fishing, it is important to realize the impact
the current has on the way fish position themselves, just as in
real fishing. I found it helpful to position my boat slightly
upstream of visible fish and cast to them downstream when using a
streamer, and just the reverse, casting upstream, when using dry
flies.
</P>
<P>
   Be conscious of spooking the fish: get too close and your quarry
will scatter. (Just like the bass games, the software uses
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, to give fish their brainpower.) And
big fish make last-second runs near the boat _ as if they see a
vision of a crackling cast-iron skillet over a campfire. But Trophy
Rivers lets you release all fish back into the river, as many fly
fishermen do.
</P>
<P>
   Before it starts to sound as though computer fishing is harder
than the real thing, it is worth noting that in the middle of
writing this review, I took an actual fly-fishing trip to
California's Hat Creek. There I rediscovered, to my chagrin, that
live trout still have a far more powerful operating system than AI:
natural intelligence.

   FLYWATER INTERACTIVE
</P>
<P>
   (Flywater Publishing; $60; Windows 3.1, 95 and 98, and
Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   HATCH MASTER
</P>
<P>
   (Hatch Master Productions; $49.95; Windows 3.1, 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   The Flywater and Hatch Master software packages provide a
glimpse of a new category of specific reference tools that can be
likened to river encyclopedias. If you have ever taken a
long-distance fishing trip to unfamiliar water and wished you had
some native advice on what to expect, these programs could be a
real boon for you.
</P>
<P>
   Flywater Interactive is a project spun off from the popular book
``Flywater'' (Chelsea Green, 1994), now in its third printing. The
CD-ROM contains 200 new photographs, short video clips, a database
of hatches for the United States and the book's text and photos.
Flywater shines once you have picked a river. Here you get
introductory information, including fishing regulations, a list of
local fly-fishing shops, tips and a chart suggesting which flies
should be used on each river.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs on the CD-ROM capture the beauty of the rivers
of the Rocky Mountains. Grant McClintock, the project's
photographer, spent four months visiting six states, fishing every
one of the 50 rivers and speaking with local guides.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch Master's Yellowstone Edition doesn't have the same quality
of photography as Flywater, but it does offer a wealth of
information about the Yellowstone area. Twenty-three fishing spots
are listed here, including the Madison, the Firehole, Slough Creek
and Henry's Fork. The heart of the Yellowstone software is the
Hatch Analyzer, which uses a matrix of date, weather, season and
snow melt information to determine what might be happening in area
rivers. If you have ever been a novice on a trout river and you're
wondering just what the fish are eating, you will appreciate how
helpful it would be to have the entomological history of a place at
your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch Analyzer made a good number of suggestions, often
numbering a dozen, of specific flies to try. It also gives
information for different times of day _ morning, afternoon and
evening _ which is about as comprehensive as anglers can get until
trout start e-mailing us about what's happening in the river.
</P>
<P>
   Because both packages offer advice on which flies to use on
specific rivers, I thought it would be interesting to see what each
said about a river they share in their database, the Yellowstone
River. For July, Flywater suggested using, among others, an Elk
Hair Caddis, Sofa Pillow or Bitch Creek. Hatch Master suggested an
Elk Hair Caddis, Madam X or Bullethead Rubberleg Salmonfly.
</P>
<P>
   Curious as to what was going on right then on the Yellowstone, I
called Bailey's Fly shop in Livingston, Mont., and asked a guide,
John Bailey, for some real-time information. He said, ``For the
last three years, you couldn't fish the Yellowstone in July because
of high, cold water.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he suggest? ``The river does get a large Caddis
hatch,'' he said; score two points for each program. ``Those
products are great for showing people what the rivers look like
but, before you come, talk to someone local,'' he said.

A JUNGLE OUTPOST OFFERS BEER, MAYAN RUINS AND THE NET 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN IGNACIO, Belize _ Pricey coffee and sleek hardware, enjoyed
by high-tech cognoscenti? Forget it. At Eva's cybercafe in San
Ignacio, Belize, the clientele is frayed; the machines are
weather-beaten, and _ as befits a frontier outpost _ the
refreshment of choice is beer, and plenty of it.
</P>
<P>
   But then, San Ignacio is hardly Silicon Alley. Just 10 miles
from the Guatemalan border, it is the last major town (pop. 7,100)
in Central America's least densely populated nation. Eva's cafe,
although no one seems to remember for whom it was named, has been a
San Ignacio fixture for nearly two decades _ a traditional meeting
place for weary backpackers on transcontinental walkabouts,
archaeologists excavating ruins in the jungles that surround the
town and grizzled expatriates far removed from their native lands.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones, 47, a former British army sergeant who is the
proprietor of Eva's, falls into the last category. But in the past
few months, he has seen his ragged bar become a destination for a
new clientele: cyberjunkies. In 1997, he installed a pair of
secondhand 486 computers. Soon, along with a Beliken (Belize's
national beer) and a place to sit, Jones' customers would drop by
for a quick e-mail fix before disappearing into the wild. Then, an
unexpected clientele emerged: local Belizeans, coming from remote
villages _ many with no phones or electricity _ began using the
cybercafe to correspond with friends and business connections all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   On a day last spring, Jones collected a half-hour's usage fee
from a New York computer technician who had just sent 10 rapid-fire
e-mail postcards _ cutting and pasting the same message into each _
to friends back home. In the tourist season, there is often a line
out the door. Customers line up above an open concrete sewer
channel, waiting to pay $8 an hour for a turn at one of Jones'
terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know a thing about computers,'' said Jones, who is
perpetually unshaven and has kept his Cockney accent despite 16
years in Belize. ``What I knew about was guns.''
</P>
<P>
   In Eva's earlier days, that was a useful skill. Jones bought the
cafe in 1982, a year after Belize's independence (it had been a
British colony), and his first job was to evict a regular clientele
that was, as Jones puts it, ``not so charming,'' mostly town drunks
and some ill-tempered post-colonials.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Jones began to offer advice to travelers passing through
the town, arranging trips to Tikal, the ruined Mayan city just over
the Guatemalan border, for example, or recommending local hotels.
Most customers stayed for a drink, or a meal, often stopping back
several times as they crisscrossed the country. Over the years,
Jones added a small souvenir stand and an outdoor patio.
</P>
<P>
   In this corner of Belize, Internet access came largely by
chance. An army buddy of Jones, David Cryer, needed work and, being
technically inclined, suggested a trial online run, with the
profits split 50-50. Jones and Cryer bought the computers from
businessmen who had spent some time in Belize and did not want to
haul the machines they had brought into the country back home.
Cryer has since become the town's cyberguru, maintaining the
computers at Eva's and finessing the relationship between the bar
and Belize's moody telephone monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In the year or so since the computers arrived, Eva's has come to
resemble nothing less than a plugged-in analog to a Wild West
outpost, where residents of vast territories stumble in _ daily,
once a week, every month _ to pick up mail and have a few drinks.
Four times daily, Jones prints out up to 125 pages of messages
addressed to a special general delivery account; the notes are
sorted into folders. Urgent communications are hand-delivered by
four-wheel drive into the bush. Customers pay about 25 cents to 50
cents per page.
</P>
<P>
   On a Tuesday afternoon last spring, the temperature was around
100, nobody was on the street, and a daisy chain of clattering fans
tried in vain to push air around the bar. Gonzalo Pleitez, 24,
tapped furiously at one of Eva's machines. Pleitez had just rumbled
in from his family farm on the Vaca plateau, 20 miles away, in his
1986 Toyota pickup. His message is to an online friend in Long
Beach, Calif. _ a marketing executive with Walt Disney Co. _ who
gives Pleitez informal advice about promoting tours to an ancient
cave on his property.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Pleitez's older brother, William Gonzalez _
members of the family are native Maya Mopan, indigenous to this
part of Belize _ was hunting in the forest when his dog disappeared
into a hole in the ground. Peering in, Gonzalez realized he had
stumbled onto the entrance to a cave 1,000 feet deep. Inside was a
treasure trove of hundreds of intact examples of pre-Columbian
Mayan pottery. The family has been working with preservation
officials to keep the cave intact and open it to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Pleitez says, is the final component in achieving
that goal. He rattled off a list of benefits: education for himself
and his brother; running water and electricity at the farm, which
currently has neither; better health care for Gonzalez's 7-year-old
daughter; the ability to book visits to the property directly,
instead of through outside agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts more control into our hands,'' Pleitez said. As he
signed off, Terry Powis, 33, a Canadian, arrived. He had just come
in from Cahal Pech, a 2,000-year-old Mayan city under excavation,
where he is field director for the Belize Valley Archaeological
Reconnaissance project. He has a list of things to do: pick up
supplies, visit a few local associates and get on line to
straighten out a student loan billing mess that he has just learned
of back in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He sips a Beliken and waits his turn. Powis has been working in
Belize for 10 years. Eva's has radically changed the way his 35
archaeological staff members, most of them from the United States,
live their lives in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot revolves around our visits here,'' Powis said. ``We've
had romances and breakups, family emergencies and financial
crises,'' he said. Noting that old-fashioned postal mail takes two
weeks to reach the United States and direct-dial phone calls cost
$5 a minute, Powis explains that without Eva's Net connection, ``we
probably wouldn't be communicating at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones wants to usher Eva's customers even further into the
online revolution. Next, he says, is the building of Web sites. The
evening of Powis' visit, Cryer held a meeting to familiarize local
businesses with the Web. The cafe was crowded with visitors from 30
miles around. It was an enthusiastic crowd, but one thing struck
Jones as odd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first night I've ever sold more coffee than beer,''
he said.

UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 98? UPGRADE YOUR VOCABULARY, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(th) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, Windows 98 is either the easiest and
most stable operating system upgrade yet for personal computers or
an exasperating experience that plunges many users into the
technical swamps where they have to deal with unfamiliar things
like device drivers, BIOS upgrades, clean installs, registry
corruption and software incompatibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's business as usual for an operating system
upgrade, except that this one is so popular that calls are
overwhelming Microsoft's support lines. In fact, Microsoft did not
expect the sales of Windows 98 to be as healthy as they have been.
</P>
<P>
   Independent market researchers say more than a half-million
copies of the $90 upgrade package were sold in the first few days
after its release on June 25, easily making it the most popular
software product of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Windows 98 was tested by more than 100,000 volunteer
users for many months before the release, reports of trouble with
it began to appear almost immediately after the official
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Several computer makers, including IBM, Compaq, Dell, Toshiba
and Gateway, posted advisories on their World Wide Web sites
cautioning owners of certain models that special steps were needed
to insure a smooth upgrade to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate computer customers reported that the new software
failed to recognize some peripheral devices, network configurations
and plug-in cards. Consumers have occasionally been baffled by
unusual system crashes; inoperative floppy, CD-ROM and removable
hard drives; balky modems, and erratic performance.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of problems appear to be most prevalent during
upgrades on older computers, rather than with new computers that
have Windows 98 installed at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft advises the owners of any computer system, but
especially systems that are more than a year old, to check first
with the computer maker or with Microsoft before installing the
upgrade. Microsoft maintains an extensive (and growing) database of
Windows 98 compatibility notes on its Web site
www.microsoft.com/support and at www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced computer users know that most new software has bugs,
or glitches. Virtually every software maker maintains a customer
support service to help users overcome problems with installation
and operation.
</P>
<P>
   Operating systems like Windows are extremely complex and have to
be written to accommodate hundreds of third-party hardware and
software products. Windows 98, for example, comes with more than
1,200 drivers that allow different computer components to work with
Windows 98 features.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says the number of complaints from users upgrading to
Windows 98 is significantly lower than for any previous system
upgrade, including the much more radical transition to Windows 95
from Windows 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anecdotal experience suggests that in any gathering of
recent Windows 98 upgraders, someone has a horror story about a
missing device driver, a laptop that seems suddenly possessed by
evil spirits or even the dreaded Windows ``Blue Screen of Death''
system crash.
</P>
<P>
   To handle Windows 98 problems, Microsoft increased its staff of
technical support workers by 40 percent, to more than 1,000
engineers, before releasing the upgrade. To accommodate consumers,
it has extended its free technical support hours into the weekends
since it started selling the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But callers often find the free technical support lines, at
(425) 635-7222, to be interminably busy. While the free support
lines were inaccessible, Microsoft was offering swift assistance
for those who were interested in paying for technical help, at
either $35 per call or $295 for a service contract.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials in Redmond, Wash., said that an
unprecedented effort had been made to make Windows 98 software easy
to install and use and that the company had been pleased by the
relatively low number of customer service calls, considering the
number of copies of the software sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made huge progress in the ease of use and capabilities
of Windows PCs,'' said Brad Chase, the Microsoft vice president in
charge of Windows marketing. ``Just compare where we are at today
with where we were with Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS. We know that we
still have a lot of work to do, though.''
</P>
<P>
   With such a large volume of sales with a major Windows release,
Chase said, ``it is only natural that people hear about problems
even if as a percentage of the total they are small.'' But even the
relatively small number of complaints is too many, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials say there have been no reports of errors
leading to the loss of data, which would be the most serious type
of errors. Even so, several computer makers are urging their
customers, especially those with laptop and notebook computers, to
take special precautions before trying to install Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Directions are typically found on the companies' Web sites. Dell
Computer, for example, warns owners of older Latitude notebooks to
postpone trying to upgrade them until updated software patches are
available later this summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BEFORE TAKING THE FIRST STEP ...
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips for a smoother upgrade to Windows 98:
</P>
<P>
   RAM: Windows 98 requires a minimum configuration of 16 megabytes
of RAM (at least 24 are recommended, and 32 are better), a 486DX
microprocessor and at least 195 megabytes of unused hard disk space
(and as much as 295 megabytes). Many users are trying to install
the software on machines that simply can't run it.
</P>
<P>
   VIRUS CHECKERS: Do a complete virus scan of your system. If the
computer is virus-free, then disable any virus-checking software
before installing any new software. Virus checkers will identify
Windows 98 as an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   MAKERS' LISTS: Before you buy Windows 98, call the maker of your
computer, or check the company's Web site, to determine if upgrade
problems have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   PERIPHERALS: If the computer has been upgraded with a video
card, Zip drive or any other plug-in component, check with the
maker of the peripheral before attempting the upgrade to see if new
drivers are needed. Again, many peripheral companies have Web sites
that address Windows 98 upgrade issues.
</P>
<P>
   CLEAN INSTALLATIONS: If possible, do a ``clean install.'' That
involves backing up every bit of important data and all
applications, reformatting the hard disk, reinstalling Windows 95
or Windows 3.1 from the original disks and then upgrading to
Windows 98. The ancillary benefit of a clean install is that it
creates an incentive to weed out unwanted files, improving system
performance.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER INSTALLATIONS: OK, so a ``clean install'' is a lot of
trouble. The next best approach is to install Windows 98 on top of
the existing operating system, trusting Microsoft to handle the
updating of all existing settings automatically. During the upgrade
process, the Windows 98 upgrade Wizard will ask whether the user
wants to make a copy of existing system files, just in case. Say
yes. You can always delete these files later, after Windows 98 has
proved to be stable.
</P>
<P>
   BIOS UPGRADE: In some cases, particularly for laptops, the
computer companies will recommend a so-called BIOS upgrade. The
BIOS, or basic input output system, is the fundamental code that
boots the system, connects the hard drive and manages the
peripheral devices. Many older laptops cannot take advantage of
Windows 98 features without a BIOS upgrade. That cannot easily be
done once Windows 98 is installed. The process typically involves
downloading special software from the computer company's Web site,
saving the downloaded BIOS upgrade software to a diskette and
rebooting the computer from the diskette. Then, if all works as
planned, the software will upgrade itself.
</P>
<P>
   INCOMPATIBILITIES: Check with the makers of any software
applications that you cannot live without and ask about any known
Windows 98 incompatibilities.
</P>
<P>
   TIMING: If you have waited three years for Windows 98, perhaps
another few months won't hurt. Microsoft's first bug-fixing
``service pack'' will be available this fall. &QL;

 UNDATED: we say.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Spielberg, who interviewed veterans and read many
first-person accounts of D-Day in preparation, the violent
intensity of the battle scenes was a debt of honor to the members
of his father's generation who over the years had watched as their
war was buried in sentimentality and feel-good jingoism. ``I really
felt an obligation to honor the courage of what those soldiers went
through,'' Spielberg said. ``Most of the stories I heard from
veterans were honest stories about palpable terror, almost blind
terror. War is not about glory. I felt we needed to be truthful to
do honor to those soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   In between the two battle sequences, the story of ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' which was written by Robert Rodat, is about a squad
assigned to find a single paratrooper, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt
Damon), who is lost somewhere behind the lines in Normandy in the
chaos of the days just after the invasion. Ryan's three brothers
have all died on D-Day in other parts of the invasion, so, unknown
to him, he is the last surviving son of an Iowa farm family. Gen.
George C. Marshall issues orders that he is to be found and taken
from harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and his squad _ Tom Sizemore as a crusty sergeant, Edward
J. Burns as a kid from Brooklyn, Jeremy Davies as a timid pencil
pusher drafted into the mission because he speaks German and
French, Barry Pepper as a devout hillbilly sharpshooter and others
_ are given the mission, but soon begin to question their orders.
Why are their lives worth less than this one missing soldier's?
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's demand for verisimilitude became infectious, Dye
said. He insisted that Hanks and the cast go through a rigorous
boot camp so they would get some idea of what it was like to be
bone-weary, wet and cold. When some of the younger actors voted to
quit the camp before it was finished, it was Hanks, with the
prodding of his close friend Spielberg, who talked them into
staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the film,'' said Burns, ``the first guy I wanted to
thank after the credits rolled was Dale Dye, because we looked like
soldiers, and he did that. During boot camp and even during the
shooting, if you were forgetting the soldier side of your
performance or your training, he'd scream at you. He'd say, we
don't want to dishonor the guys who died on that beach or in that
war, and I don't think we did.'
</P>
<P>
   Burns said that the decision to begin shooting the film with the
D-Day sequence was crucial in helping the actors find their
characters. ``On the page, my character is kind of a wise guy, but
after seeing what it was like on that beach, I felt I had to bring
a much harder edge to it,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Many previous Hollywood movies about World War II were sanitized
and sentimentalized, in part for understandable reasons. ``During
the war, part of the reason was that the films also served a
propaganda purpose,'' Spielberg said. The last thing the military
wanted was to give prospective soldiers and their families an
unblinking look at the carnage they faced. And even at the end of
the war and later, when some Hollywood films like ``The Story of
G.I. Joe'' and ``Attack!'' attempted to hint at the gruesome
reality, there was little appetite among many returning soldiers to
relive the horror or expose their families to it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Spielberg and his team hope that America is ready
for the real deal. ``Perhaps enough time has passed that you can
look at it without blinking,'' said Thomas E. Sanders, the movie's
production designer.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle the filmmakers faced was finding proper
locations to stage their battles. Sanders first scouted beaches in
France, but couldn't find anything suitable. ``It was the hardest
location I ever had to find, because we wanted it to be so
specific,'' he said. ``Most of the beaches were controlled by the
military or were part of a wildlife refuge or were too developed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Spielberg said, French officials seemed to throw up
roadblocks at every turn, leaving him to suspect that they really
didn't want the film shot in France.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin De La Noy, an associate producer on the film, said he felt
from the beginning that the D-Day scenes should be shot in Ireland.
He already had a working relationship with the Irish Army from his
role in filming Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart,'' and knew that there
was a good chance of finding a beach whose shape and tides would
match Omaha Beach's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked all around England and Scotland and Ireland, at
almost every beach,'' Sanders said. ``We'd find one that might
work, but it was too far from a town or place to house all the crew
and extras. The water also had to be of a certain depth, so the
guys could jump out of the landing craft.''
</P>
<P>
   After a search of about three months, Sanders found one in
County Wexford. All that was needed was a sand wall near the base
of the cliffs to match one that existed on Omaha Beach, and the
Irish government gave permission to build that.
</P>
<P>
   The location was near a school where the filmmakers could house
and feed the 850 soldiers who worked on the sequence. The men were
divided into platoons, each with its own leader, and the whole
project was structured to resemble a military operation.
</P>
<P>
   There was a big interplay in the scene between the soldiers and
the special effects, the explosions and things,'' De La Noy said.
``That was where I came down against recruiting ordinary extras
from off the street. We needed guys with some training and
discipline to do what they were told when things were blowing up
around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several amputees were hired as extras, then fitted with fake
limbs that were blown off during the battle sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the heavy equipment and all the explosions and all
the people running around in mock terror, there was only one
serious accident on the set: a Land Rover ran over an extra's foot.
``Other than that, it was just sand flying in people's eyes,'' De
La Noy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the camera was always going to be in the middle of the
action, stylistically we were down on the beach rather than an
omnipotent eye in the sky,'' he said. ``What happened was that you
needed a depth to the background action, so that highly believable
things are happening in the foreground and in the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Before each shot, Dye could give specific instructions to each
of the platoon leaders, who could pass them along to the men. Then,
during shooting, he could talk to them from a loudspeaker system
high on the cliffs. ``We called it the Voice of God,'' De La Noy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dye recalled: ``At the same time, I was on four different
radios, talking to the ships, talking to the armor. I had my staff
down there, three of my NCO's, literally running around down there
on the beach like jackrabbits, trying to keep it all moving. It was
extraordinary. It was like being a battalion commander in combat
and watching your troops maneuver while the cameras are rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg said that he knew that his role in directing the
hundreds of extras in the battle scenes was largely inspirational,
and he tried to convey to them the importance that he felt about
doing it just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven told them that people don't die like they do in Rambo
films,'' Dye said. ``And he's right. People turn inside themselves,
into the pain. There isn't a lot of throwing out their arms and
crying for Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentarylike approach to the filming also allowed Januscz
Kaminski, the cinematographer, and his camera crews to go with the
flow of the action, even if it took an unexpected turn. Just before
filming began, a huge storm hit the coast and tore up some of the
concrete pilings _ the so-called hedgehogs _ that had been placed
along the Norman coast by Germans to vex landing craft. They had to
be reconstructed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   When Spielberg noted that many D-Day survivors had vividly
remembered the thousands of dead fish that washed ashore with the
dead soldiers, he ordered several bushels of fish to be purchased
at a local market and strewn among the immobile extras. Other
specific details were borrowed from the memoirs of survivors of the
battle. One man remembered seeing a Bible floating in the surf, so
Spielberg ordered a Bible added to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The director was just as committed to getting the most authentic
uniforms, weapons and vehicles as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Johnston, the film's costume designer, learned that the
American company that had had the contract to make all the
soldiers' shoes was still in business and had one last batch of the
actual dye that was used. So she ordered 2,000 pairs made on the
old design and talked the company into churning them out under a
tight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we were going to be right in there with the soldiers,
and were going to be getting a close look at the costumes and the
shoes, it was crucial that they be right,'' she said. ``And it
really helped the actors to be anchored like that, wearing the same
shoes that the D-Day soldiers had worn.''
</P>
<P>
   The company shot for three weeks in Ireland on the D-Day scenes,
then transferred to an abandoned British aerospace center in
Hertfordshire, where the rest of the scenes were shot, including
the climactic battle. For that battle, a replica of a Norman
village was built, using photographs of several actual battle sites
as guides. There were fewer soldiers involved in that fighting than
there had been on the beach, but the logistics of the battle plan
that Dye created for the scene were every bit as demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had scouted a lot of towns in France where we could
partially build a set, and scouted a bunch of rivers, but there
were always environmental problems if we got something in the
water,'' Sanders said. ``Finally, we decided the best course was to
build our own village.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a major effort, he said. ``We had to dig a trench 900
feet long that would be our river,'' Sanders said. ``Essentially,
it was our own lake. And it had to be lined, because we had to
control the height of the water very carefully. The design was
based on period research, using pieces of four or five actual towns
where fighting occurred in the weeks after D-Day. Then we blew
20-foot bomb craters all over the place and up the main street.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the goal was the same as the one for the D-Day
scenes: to make it all as realistic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that if we got anything wrong, there were people out
there who would notice it,'' Ms. Johnston said. ``And we wanted to
get it right. I wanted to get it right. My father was in the second
wave in the D-Day landings, and I wanted this to be, in part, an
homage to him.''

LEIF ERICSON'S LEGACY ON THE WEB AND WAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(rm) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tale of the Titanic has drawn a great deal of public
interest since the end of last year, but another North Atlantic
maritime adventure _ and a more successful one at that _ is also
being remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Leif Ericson's discovery of ``Vinland'' during his journey from
Greenland to Newfoundland around the year 1000 is being observed in
a variety of ways on the Web. The Leif Ericson Millennium
Celebration site  &UR; (www.leif2000.org/lemc.dll/Default)  &LR; offers much
information, and a link from the Great Norwegians home page offers
a biography of Ericson , the European who is said to have beaten
Christopher Columbus to the New World by nearly 500 years
 &UR; (www.mnc.net/norway/ericson.htm) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ambitious observers of the event are a group of
adventurers who are setting out to recreate Ericson's journey as
authentically as possible in a replica of a Viking boat. Led by W.
Hodding Carter, 35, a writer, a crew of 10 took off on June 28 from
Nuuk, Greenland, to start a 1,500-mile trip called Viking Voyage
1000. Their final destination is L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland.
Carter first became interested in Ericson's voyage when he read a
book about it in fifth grade. He tried the trip last year but ended
the voyage after six weeks because of a damaged rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop sailors intrigued by the quest can follow along on the
official Viking Voyage 1000 Web site,  &UR; (www.beyond.landsend.com) &LR; ,
which features daily journals, pictures and audio clips from the
ship's crew members. The site, part of the project's sponsorship by
the Lands' End company, also has sections devoted to Viking lore
and ships.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of 10th- and 20th-century technologies melding, the
expedition's ship, an open-decked, 54-foot wooden knarr, is
carrying some sophisticated equipment. ``We have two digital
cameras on board, and we have two laptops that are
water-resistant,'' Carter said via his cellular phone from
Greenland before the launching. ``All the keys are in a heavy-duty
plastic. They seem indestructible with the cases they're in, but
this is a pretty rough boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Rough, indeed. No cruise ship with on-deck shuffleboard and
fancy radar systems for these guys. Navigation will be done the
old-fashioned way, by the sun and stars, along with naval charts,
compasses and a sextant. The boat is powered only by oars or wind;
it has a 35-foot canvas sail.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members will stop on shore an average of every other day to
hike, explore and greet people. Carter said he hoped to complete
the trip in 8 to 10 weeks, but like Ericson, he and the crew are at
the mercy of the elements. ``Some days we can make 100 miles if we
really get lucky, and some days we make about two miles or nothing
waiting for the right wind,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Several sets of traditional Norse clothes are on board. The
outfits weigh 60 pounds each. ``I plan to try to live in the Viking
outfit for one week,'' Carter said. ``I'm dreading that more than
anything.''

OUSTED NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST FOCUSES ON HER POETRY, NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In her writing, Patricia Smith has always played
with fire.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a dynamic performance poet, an iconoclastic writing
teacher and an incendiary newspaper columnist who challenged
attitudes about race as an African-American woman, Smith was
consumed last month in a conflagration of her own making.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to resign June 18 amid a firestorm of controversy as a
columnist for the Boston Globe after she admitted making up
characters and quotes in work that purported to be fact, Smith has
since retreated to straightforward fiction writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm busy working on my novel, looking ahead and not back,''
Smith said in a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake in judgment and freely admitted that,'' she
said. ``I want to move on now. I may never have a better
opportunity than this to write a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The notoriety of her resignation is a double-edged sword. ``My
agent figures it's a good time now to take the novel proposal to
publishers,'' Smith said. ``There's been some interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, spoke in a weary monotone and seemed unnerved about
being in the eye of a storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith affair was only one piece in a recent stew of
breakdowns of journalistic standards that set off a round of media
criticism and reflection. The New Republic recently fired writer
Stephen Glass for fabricating parts of 27 articles. A Cincinnati
Enquirer reporter was fired for unethical conduct and the paper
made a $10 million payment to Chiquita Brands. CNN and Time
apologized and retracted a story alleging U.S. commandos used nerve
gas to kill American defectors during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not wish to discuss these developments or the
counter-accusations that surfaced in the wake of her being forced
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney and Harvard Law School professor Alan
Dershowitz took Smith's side and accused the Globe of applying a
double standard ``based on race, gender and ethnicity.'' Dershowitz
said the newspaper should have demanded that columnist Mike
Barnicle also resign for allegedly fabricating a demeaning quote he
attributed to Dershowitz several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In extensive follow-up stories it published about its own
internal investigation into the veracity of its columnists, the
Globe concluded that there was no evidence to suggest Barnicle
fabricated quotes or people in his columns. Smith admitted to four
fabrications in columns this year.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the end of the story, though. In a message to
readers published in the Globe, editor Matthew Storin said there is
evidence that 48 additional Smith columns since 1995 might have
contained fabrications. Storin said an investigation is ongoing and
Smith will be asked to review those columns under suspicion for
possible inventions of people whose identities cannot be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read any of those stories. I don't see any need to
read them,'' Smith said. She said she has not returned to the Globe
offices since she resigned and has not had contact with her former
editors or co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those colleagues and readers who salivated daily at the
thought of my head on a platter, congrats,'' Smith wrote in her
final Globe column on June 19, a piece at once apologetic and
defiant. She has declined to comment in follow-up Globe stories.

IN FANTASY GAME, REAL CASH FOR VIRTUAL CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the history of paper, playing cards predate the widespread
use of printed currency. So it is with the Internet, where a
fantasy card game called Sanctum is incubating a myth-inflected
form of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Digital Addiction, a software company based in
Maryland, Sanctum is a two-player strategy game. The object is to
capture the other guy's fortress by marching your minions across a
board and casting tactical spells. Each turn, the opponents cast
fresh spells and draw new virtual cards from their respective
decks.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the cards in hand, a player might decide to summon an
army of zombies or cast a cannibalism spell (one of the enemy's
minions starts eating the others) or a complacency spell (enemy
minions stop following orders) or weaken the opponents' defenses
(``Armor to Meat? Body Rot? Decisions, decisions. . . .'') or heal
the player's own fallen soldiers. It's a combination of hearts, gin
rummy and chess, dressed up in chain mail with supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Sanctum is not unlike Magic: The Gathering, a
paper-based collectible-card game that has become a global
phenomenon. Wizards of the Coast, which publishes the game, started
selling Magic cards in 1993. The first 10 million cards, sold in $9
starter packs of 60 and $3 booster packs of 15, flew off the
shelves in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 2 billion Magic cards have been sold, in
nine languages, to an audience of millions. New cards are
continually released. Old ones are periodically phased out, giving
them instant status as collectibles to be bought, sold and traded
in hobby stores and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Sanctum is an online version of Magic. Instead of
sitting across a table, you log onto a Web site
(www.digitaladdiction.com), download the game free, register as a
player, find an opponent in the chat room and go at it. The game
comes with a starter pack of 60 cards, which is adequate for
beginners. If you want more _ there are 250 digital spells in all _
you have to buy them. A pack of 15 costs $1 to $3, depending on how
many you buy. The transaction takes place via credit card on a
secure area of the site, and the cards are registered to your
account.
</P>
<P>
   As with any system of trading cards, there are common cards
(garden-variety bread-and-butter spells), uncommon cards (more
idiosyncratic sorts of magic) and rare cards (highly specialized,
highly sought, one per pack). The more cards you buy, the more
tactics you have at your disposal and the greater your chances of
adding something really exotic to your necromantic arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Digital Addiction is giving away Sanctum and then
selling ways to extend and enhance it _ tools that give the player
a competitive advantage and a more complex experience. These
digital objects are useful and scarce and therefore valuable.
(Stored on site, they can't be copied off line.) You can play with
them. You can ante them. And you can trade them.
</P>
<P>
   That is where it gets really interesting. Because in this game
space, which is also a marketplace, people are trading virtual
objects that are worth real money. Inevitably, new cards will be
introduced, and old ones will be phased out. Anyone who has seen
Beanie Babies blossom into an online commodity knows that
collectibles need no inherent value to fetch ever-increasing
prices. Early Magic cards _ five-year-old pieces of paper _ are
worth hundreds of dollars each. And thanks to the Internet, they
are fairly easy to unload.
</P>
<P>
   Except with Sanctum, the commodities are virtual to begin with.
They don't need to be appraised. There are no transportation
hassles. There are no transaction costs. On the Sanctum site, cards
are the only medium of exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if people want to promise each other money off the server
and trade cards inside,'' said James Harvey, chief executive of
Digital Addiction, ``that's none of our business.'' Already, third
parties have struck deals with the company to set up digital
storefronts to buy and resell cards from players for cash, although
it is far from clear that strategy game fans used to trading
directly on the Internet will bother dealing with middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Collectible trading-card games are an ideal test bed for this
sort of virtual economy for two reasons. The first is that the
people who play games like Magic are highly wired, and they are
fanatic about their games. They're ``MIT students,'' Harvey said.
``Computer geeks. Wall Street geeks. People in their 20s spend most
of the money. They earn $45,000, single, no kids, no mortgage, and
they spend the lion's share of their techie salaries on
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever an audience that could support an online
market for virtual toys, this group is it.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that cards, unlike other sorts of
collectibles, are low-touch items. Their value is not based on
their material characteristics _ their tactile appeal or patina or
even their visual quality. They are not generally fondled or
displayed. They are kept in binders and boxes. The value of a given
card is based on how many were produced, when it was discontinued
and what that card refers to _ the career of a sports star, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these factors have anything to do with the physical
object. The card is just a placeholder. The most important things
about it are the fact that you own it and the information printed
on it. In a sense, trading cards are already virtual.
</P>
<P>
   And collectible-card games are even more so because each card
refers to an act, rather than to an object. The image on the card
doesn't represent a star baseman. It represents the right to take
some kind of action _ to cast a spell _ at a given time in a given
context. It's not a noun. It's a verb. It's like a dollar bill,
which represents the right to buy a cup of coffee at the
convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Currency is, after all, just another kind of playing card.

 ALBANY, N.Y.: follow-up Globe stories.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the telephone interview, Smith was reluctant to meet the
issue of her Globe ouster head-on. She evaded, deflected and
refused to respond to questions about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to talk about poetry, my novel and my other writing.
This is not the forum to get into everything about my
resignation,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A sought-after speaker at writing conferences, Smith said her
remarks would remain unchanged. ``I won't say anything differently
because of this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll continue to say a writer must be fueled by a real love of
writing. You can't let people cage you as a writer,'' Smith said.
``You should write as many ways as possible. I still believe in
blurring the lines between genres.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In her final Globe column, Smith said she lacked traditional
journalism training. She took courses at two universities, but
never completed a degree and instead ``was fueled by a heady
mixture of naivete, ambition, and an almost insane love for the
powers of language.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith shaped and reshaped her lyrical, poetic style into a
variety of forms: columns, poetry, screenplays, drama, jazz songs.
``And as accolades poured in, I strained to accomplish more,''
Smith wrote in her final column. Smith had her biggest year in
journalism in 1997, winning an American Society of Newspapers
Editors distinguished writing award (revoked after her resignation)
and being named a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't establish priorities, and the first casualty was
time,'' wrote Smith, who collaborated with Nobel Prize-winning poet
Derek Walcott on a play, won four national poetry ``slam''
competitions, performed in Brazil and throughout Europe, published
three volumes of poetry and won literary prizes.
</P>
<P>
   She described the fabrications in her column as having arisen
out of the pressure of time to meet myriad writing deadlines and
speaking commitments, which involved frequent travel, and a desire
to make the column sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time in my metro column, to create the desired
impact or slam home a salient point, I attributed quotes to people
who didn't exist,'' Smith wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She did not elaborate in the telephone interview. But she was
happy to talk about the nonfiction book she recently completed, her
first, ``Africans in America.'' It will be published in October by
Harcourt Brace as a companion work to a four-part PBS documentary
on slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was handed all the research from the film and shaped it into
a book,'' Smith said. ``Charles Johnson is a fiction writer who
contributed several short stories to the book. We blur the lines.
It's not totally a nonfiction book or a book of short stories. It's
both.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing project foremost in Smith's mind is her novel,
tentatively titled ``Yummy.'' That was the real-life nickname for
an 11-year-old gang member in Chicago who was executed. Smith said
she plans to base her novel on the youth's life.
</P>
<P>
   Smith knows something of Yummy's world. She grew up on Chicago's
West Side, in a poor black neighborhood. She was the only child of
Annie and Otis Smith, both of whom worked in a candy factory. Her
mother still lives in Chicago. Her father was murdered 21 years ago
during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Smith studied at Southern Illinois University and Northwestern
University, but did not complete a degree. She was a single mother
who raised a son, Damon Smith, now 22, who has a 3-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she would not dismiss out of hand the possibility of
working again for a newspaper. She said she would wait to weigh any
offers she may receive.
</P>
<P>
   Smith admitted to a twinge of loss at ending, at least for now,
her journalism career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for 20 years and I guess I'll miss it, the way I
would miss selling insurance if I did that for 20 years,'' she
said. ``I'm not panicking over what to do next. I'll keep writing
and look at the possibilities.''

   NEW YORK _ I am still trying to repress memories of my own
aborted attempt to use the Internet as a broadcast medium. Back in
1996, I was the host of a weekly online show called ``Web Whirl,''
the goal of which was to take the audience along on a tour of a
dozen or so Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The show didn't work because most home users were at the wrong
end of an information bottleneck. Relying on fickle modem
connections, their online forays resembled uneasy games of Russian
roulette. Would they connect on the first try? Or even the second?
Would their connections fail in the middle of downloading a Web
page? After a few months, the show was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   So when I heard that Intel Corp. was planning to broadcast the
live performances of 300 bands on line this week and call the
adventure a ``music festival,'' my first reaction was skepticism.
After all, not much has changed in the past two years to erase the
obstacles that doomed ``Web Whirl.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, with most home users still relying on finicky modems,
will the so-called streaming video clip from a concert arrive
instead as herky-jerky niblets of image?
</P>
<P>
   I hoped not. But my first glance at the Web page for the
festival (which began Wednesday night and will run through
Saturday) did not reassure me. The broadcast site at
www.intelfest.com instructed me to download the software tool Real
Player from Real Networks so I could hear and see the online
performances. But my first two attempts failed because somewhere
between the computer where Real Player was archived and my own
desktop, the connection failed.
</P>
<P>
   With 300 bands playing live in 20 New York City clubs for the
four-day period, Intel faces an even greater technical challenge.
For each band, the club sets up a microphone to capture vocals and
the softer instruments like flutes and violins, mixing those sounds
at a main sound desk. Another microphone supplied by Intel picks up
other instruments, like drums and guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Then the feeds from both microphones are mixed and prepared for
online broadcast on a personal computer that encodes the sound and
translates it into digital bits. Intel broadcasts the digital
transmission through two dual-Pentium II 333-megahertz servers,
which in turn distribute the signals over the Internet.
Performances at five clubs are also being broadcast in a
simultaneous video feed.
</P>
<P>
   The home users with the best chance of enjoying the performances
are those with newer equipment. While you might technically be able
to connect to the festival's Web site on a poky old 486 machine, I
doubt that you could enjoy the experience with anything less than a
microprocessor that runs at 166 megahertz and employs MMX
technology to enhance audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   As for modem speed? Well, frankly, there is no dial-up modem
that pushes sound and video across the Net reliably enough _ or
fast enough _ to satisfy me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why bother?'' the curmudgeon in me wondered. The whole
venture sounded like a flashback to the early days of radio or TV,
with the broadcasters relying on an uneasy combination of prayer,
spit and willpower to overcome inevitably choppy transmissions. But
then, those early broadcasts, imperfect though they may have been,
were exciting partly because of the unknown limits of raw
technology. The roughness was fraught with endless possibility.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe I was being unfair to the Internet _ and to Intel _ by
expecting too much too soon from this nascent medium. Why not give
everyone points for trying?
</P>
<P>
   During a similar festival that Intel sponsored last year,
125,000 computer users tuned in, er, connected _ five times as many
as attended the live performances. Weren't those numbers an
indication that the experiment was at least somewhat successful in
increasing people's access to music?
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at the schedule on the festival Web site also
swayed me. The musicians in that eclectic group of 300 bands, whose
sounds include rock, punk, rap, jazz and folk _ would surely not
have agreed to participate in this endeavor if they felt that the
medium failed to convey their message. There must be benefits from
playing to an online audience that would outweigh the apparent lack
of intimacy between performer and listener.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to ask a singer, Victoria Williams, who was scheduled
to perform in the festival live (and on line) at the Bowery
Ballroom on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the performance, I spoke on the phone to Ms.
Williams to tell her that I had just been listening to the folky,
lyrical stories she sang on ``This Moment in Toronto With Victoria
Williams,'' recorded live in 1995. ``Do you think that you will
interact differently with an online audience?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment of silence on the phone that lasted just long
enough to make me wonder if the connection had failed. ``I had no
idea that this is an online concert that I'm doing,'' Ms. Williams
said. ``I thought it was a live concert.''
</P>
<P>
   I explained about the computers that would transmit her
performance across the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean that people are going to be able to watch it on their
computers, but it will sound kind of broken up, with herky-jerky
video?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   I told her I wasn't sure whether the Bowery Ballroom was one of
the five clubs that would transmit simultaneous video. (I quickly
tried to check the Web site for her, but my connection stalled.)
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Williams sounded so unhappy about the possibility that I
felt bad for her. ``Maybe it will all work fine,'' I said, trying
to sound as if I had not lived through the broadcast disappointment
of ``Web Whirl.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, I went on, here was a medium that might have the
power to propel her music to a whole new audience _ to millions of
people around the world who could not physically attend her
concert. Maybe the Internet would prove to be as potent a broadcast
tool as television had been in 1964 when Ed Sullivan introduced the
Beatles to 73 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't that be great?'' I said cheerily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just never seen it like that, but it would be
incredible,'' Ms. Williams agreed. She paused again. ``Or maybe the
band and I could just walk kind of herky-jerky in the club, and
shuffle our feet a bit, to give the live audience the Internet
experience.'' &QL;

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

 c.1997 Consumers Digest
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

<P>
   Say you're stranded on a mountain. All you have is the handheld
computer you brought to do some journal writing, a cellular phone
and a few supplies for emergencies. You're lost, and it looks as if
rain is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   To make a shelter, you pull some sturdy rope and a poncho out of
your pack. But after a few feeble attempts to tie a simple but
secure knot to a tree, you turn to the Internet, of course.
</P>
<P>
   You connect the handheld computer to the cellular phone (which
has a wireless modem) and go on line. A Metacrawler search using
``ropes and knots'' calls up a number of promising sites, including
the Ropers Knots page (huizen.dds.nl/erpprs/kroot.htm). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're lost on a mountain or sitting comfortably at home
in front of a PC, the Ropers Knots page is a good primer on rope
tying. Ed Prins, 43, of Delft, the Netherlands, set up the page in
February 1996 in Dutch and English. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my great hobbies is knots,'' Prins said in a phone
interview. ``I like more of the technical side: how I can join two
knots together, why a knot is good in one application and not in
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Prins, who works as an information specialist at the Schiphol
Airport in Amsterdam, said he had built the site with sailors,
climbers, scouts and novices in mind. ``Most people can find what
they want,'' he said, and if not, there are plenty of links for
more specific information. ``My ambition is to have the most
complete knot site. I think I'm best at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ropers Knots page takes a minimalist approach. Prins said he
kept images simple so people with slow modem speeds could load his
site without delays. If you are looking for animation or gimmicks,
you will have to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Ropers Knots page is linked to a site created
by the 42nd Brighton Scout Group of East Sussex, England,
(www.mistral. co.uk:80/42brghtn/knots). (To find it, click on Links
to Other Knot Sites, then, under Knots in Rope, click on Get
Knotted.) There, under Animated Knots, are a number of knots shown
in two dimensions. In the clove hitch, a red rope slithers around a
brown post over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity of the Ropers Knots page, which is divided into
sections with _ what else? _ a rope, both appealed to and
frustrated Celina Monte, 17, a senior Girl Scout who knows a little
something about knots.
</P>
<P>
   Celina is a summer intern at the Girl Scout Council of Greater
New York on West 23rd Street in Manhattan. With a rope in hand, she
sat in front of a computer in the council's office recently to
check out the site. She went to instruction pages and found
hitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big Girl Scout knot is the clove hitch,'' she said. The
diagram looked complicated, but she was able to produce a clove
hitch. ``I think that this page is for people who already know
about knots,'' she said. ``You can't be a knot novice.''
</P>
<P>
   What was easier to follow and more helpful, she said, was her
Scout handbook, which she had by her side. While the site had
little description with its diagrams, the handbook had pictures of
knots being used in a camp setting and a description of how they
were used. Referring to Prins and his page, Celina said, ``He
doesn't put it to a useful purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   When she clicked on the Brighton Scout Group site, she laughed,
impressed by its colorful, animated approach. But soon she was all
business, grabbing her rope and following the pattern until she had
successfully tied the clove hitch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the links, Prins maintains a Books on Knots page
(www.geocities.com/Yosemite/2158/books.htm), where he reviews a
number of books. ``I just think that's fantastic,'' Celina said.
</P>
<P>
   While children can access the Ropers Knots page, there are areas
they shouldn't see, like the section on the hangman's noose. Prins
put in red a warning: ``The noose is not a knot to play hangman
with. Too many accidents already killed children who thought they
could release it in time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ropers Knots site in English gets about 200 hits a day,
while the Dutch site gets about 20, Prins said. He tries to answer
each question he gets via e-mail, which keeps him busy. ``If you're
not stimulated,'' he said, ``you end up with a rope in front of
you, and for what?''

<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

TWO MEDIUMS MAKE LIKE ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 19)  
 (JT)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Only a few years ago, John Lithgow was appalled at
the notion of appearing in a television series. A character actor
with a respectable theater and film career, Lithgow viewed the
prospect of appearing on television with a disdain largely typical
among his acting friends. It was a medium that most serious actors
_ and writers and directors _  &UR; left, &LR;  not entered; a refuge for,
let's face it, actors and filmmakers whose careers had hit a brick
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two of his longtime friends, the successful comedy writers
Bonnie and Terry Turner, told him they had written the pilot script
for an oddball sitcom, ``Third Rock From the Sun,'' about some
brainy, wacky aliens struggling to be human. Lithgow's film career
had stumbled a bit with potboilers like ``Ricochet'' and
``Cliffhanger.'' He was nearing 50. His agent read the pilot and
laughed. The actor nervously told his friends that he was thinking
of signing on. ``They looked at me like I had gone nuts,'' he
recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow has now won two Emmy Awards for the show, which is about
to enter its fourth season. His salary has hit $150,000 per
episode. And he has hardly suffered any loss of esteem in the eyes
of critics or his fellow actors. ``What in the world was I so
afraid of?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly alone. A tide of movie and theater actors, as well
as established film writers, directors and producers, are surging
into a medium that they once scorned. And just as important, the
gates of movie studios have been flung open to television actors
and writers after decades of not-so-benign neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television was once a real stigma,'' said Sally Field, a
two-time Academy Award winner who began her acting career on 1960s
and 1970s sitcoms like ``Gidget'' and ``The Flying Nun.'' ``You
were soiled goods,'' she continued. ``It didn't matter that you had
a built-in audience. I couldn't get in the door. They told me I
wasn't pretty enough, I wasn't good enough to be in movies. There
was this incredible prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Because of a blend of financial, demographic and,
yes, esthetic factors, this sort of Hollywood wall has collapsed,
resulting in the creation of a kind of mega-entertainment universe:
actors, writers and filmmakers flow back and forth between the
mediums in a way that was unthinkable five or six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of VCR's and cable, half the time you're
watching movies on TV anyway, so the whole distinction between
movies and television has blurred,'' said Marshall Herskovitz,
executive producer of television shows like ``Thirtysomething'' and
``My So-Called Life'' and the director of movies like the recent
``Dangerous Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the world of television commercials and music
videos has, in the eyes of studio executives, become a place to
discover young directors makes the confluence of mediums even more
pronounced. And what about ``The X-Files''? Is it a television
series? A film? A little of both?
</P>
<P>
   But while the flow of talent is going in two directions, the
benefits may not be. In this evolution, television seems to be
flourishing and movies floundering.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are plenty of grindingly inane sitcoms on
television, and too many formulaic dramas. But there are also shows
like ``Homicide'' (created by, among others, the acclaimed movie
director Barry Levinson), ``Ally McBeal'' (created by David Kelley,
who moves back and forth), ``E.R.,'' ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and
``Frasier.'' Is there any question that they aren't better each
week than most movies? Whatever compromises are made on weekly
television, the talented writers on the best shows have far more
leverage, control and creative freedom than their counterparts in
feature films, where the stars and directors are the ones treated
like royalty by the studios and producers. And the result is a
surprising number of gutsy, superbly written shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago television's value system was to represent
the broadest spectrum of mass American culture,'' said Herskovitz.
``But as the television world became more fragmented, and people
had far more choice, its look became less bland, less middle-of-the
road, more varied. It became safer for people with a more
individual vision to reveal it.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual vision in mainstream films is left to a handful of
directors like Woody Allen, James Brooks, who began his career on
television, and Martin Scorsese, who has signed a deal with ABC to
create a series. The ever-expanding universe of independent films
has nurtured its own handful of auteurs, but they often move
rapidly into the studio system, as in the case of Quentin Tarantino
(``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Jackie Brown''), or have to pay the way for
their own idiosyncratic movies by rewriting studio screenplays, as
in the case of the veteran John Sayles (``Lone Star'').
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many, the quality of Hollywood films has been
diminished by the ballooning expense of making a mainstream feature
(a $70 million film with a star is considered a steal), the
overseas market's increasing craving for action movies, the
obsession with effects-laden films and the abdication of studio
power to big-name stars, directors, producers and even agents. And
many believe that in this new intermingling, movies have adopted
the worst of television while television has adopted the best of
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more feature films look like episodic television, and
I see a tremendous lack of originality in the way a lot of shots
are composed and the lighting,'' said the director John
Frankenheimer, who has been working in both mediums in recent
years.

<P>
   To spank or not to spank? What kind of a question is that?
</P>
<P>
   My family's favorite proverbs set the tone for our household.
``The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself
disgraces his mother. Discipline your son, and he will give you
peace; he will bring delight to your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about all of that, but he sure will straighten up
and fly right for a few miles. I only mention this because I was
reading about an amazing bit of research the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Some highbrow research group has compiled an impressive stack of
data indicating that a loving whack on the behind won't send Junior
into therapy or turn him into a sociopath.
</P>
<P>
   And get this: Girls who get spankings don't always start barroom
brawls or grow up and marry abusive spouses. Well, I'll be. Do you
know what I find amazing about this research? I'm amazed that
someone spent good money to find out what the casjier over at the
fruit market could have told them for free.
</P>
<P>
   I never really totally bought the notion of time out. Time out
is when you make kids do something really boring, like sit still in
a chair or stand in a corner for a few minutes while they think
about their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Time out is OK for toddlers, but sending a 9-year-old to his
room for punishment is like sending a house dog into the back yard.
On the other hand, if it's 150 degrees like it's been lately, I
suppose that is a pretty severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's a bad analogy, but you know what I mean. The
punishment has to fit the crime. Perhaps that's the problem. Maybe
some parents were actually using an iron rod to spank their kids,
and that's why some experts began to offer the nonviolent theory of
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, 99 percent of the time, a good lecture and the loss
of privileges will result in the appropriate change in behavior for
most children. However, there is that other 1 percent of the time
when all else has failed and a parent's gotta do what a parent's
gotta do.
</P>
<P>
   The current school of thought is that three or four open hand
swats to the behind of older children or the hand of toddlers is
perfectly acceptable parenting.
</P>
<P>
   However, you may want to check with local authorities and your
pediatrician before you make any decisions on behavior modification
for your children.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't, but it's a good idea. Anything other than an open hand
is dangerous and could cause irreparable harm to your child. One of
my good friends has a noticeable limp because her father used to
beat her with a belt buckle. Of course, people like that don't
listen to child rearing experts anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But if our children don't learn discipline at home, where will
they learn it? Will they learn it inside a jail cell? Will they
learn it in detention hall? Will they learn it from the coach who
benches them for being insubordinate or the boss who fires them for
repeated tardiness? How about from the college professor who fails
them because they didn't turn in their homework?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's all related. We all need to learn the boundaries of
acceptable behavior, and the best place to learn that is at home.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your children don't ever need spanking. Good. Great. Bully
for you. I rarely spank my own children. But when push comes to
shove and I've exhausted every other option, I use my last resort.
It always works. And it's certainly nice to know that I've got a
seal of approval from God _ and a few other experts.
</P>
<P>
   Spare the rod, spoil the child.

 LOS ANGELES: recent years.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sydney Pollack, a leading veteran filmmaker, believes the
problem goes deeper. ``The biggest impact has been on the attention
span,'' he said. Pollack's company, Mirage, has produced television
dramas on cable and is moving into network television next season
with the series ``The Last Defense,'' about public defenders in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation of kids has grown up with entertainment being
fed to them in a mosaic pattern: they put on a headset and listen
to rock music while watching television without sound and doing
their homework,'' said Pollack. ``Culture now is being communicated
in a mosaic, not a linear pattern. It's MTV sound bites, and that
has influenced the way we make movies. We make pictures in the form
of bites rather than `once upon a time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The results are, at best, ``Pulp Fiction,'' and, at worst, the
dozens of ``Pulp Fiction'' imitations, by young people who don't
have Tarantino's vitality and audacity. Structurally, these
derivative films are often noisy, jagged and loosely plotted and
carry one message from the chest-pounding directors: pay attention
to me and my style. The contrast between these filmmakers and _ to
cite just one golden age of American movie making _ the supple,
emotionally complex narrative style of directors like John Ford,
Howard Hawks and Billy Wilder is a bleak one.
</P>
<P>
   And it may be getting worse. Implicit in Pollack's comments is
the fact that so many movies are now being made primarily for
teen-agers. Movie studios, even more than television companies, are
obsessed with teen-agers because there are so many of them (in the
year 2010 there will be 42 million, up from 38 million last year)
with vast spending power, amounting to $80 billion or more. The
billion-dollar-plus worldwide box office for ``Titanic,'' coupled
with the ascension of Leonardo DiCaprio as a new James Dean, and
the success of teen-age horror films like ``Scream'' and ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer'' will only reinforce the studios'
tendency to recycle masses-friendly concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous emphasis in the last two years on
the rediscovery of the youth market, and the feature-film industry
is going to turn to one place, television, where all these young
people are,'' said Peter Chernin, president and chief operating
officer of News Corp., which includes Fox Inc. ``So you turn to
`Party of Five' and `Dawson's Creek' and `Buffy, the Vampire
Slayer' and `Friends' and the others.''
</P>
<P>
   With his partner, the director Ron Howard, Brian Grazer is one
of Hollywood's most successful producers (``Liar, Liar,'' ``Apollo
13,'' ``The Nutty Professor''), and their company is producing
three television series next year. When it comes to movies these
days, he said, studios seem to be actually looking to television
for guidance, a dubious tactic. ``Movies,' he said, ``rely so much
on research, on demographics, on who's seeing movies, so when the
movie guys marry that information with what's successful on
television, they say, `Let's rebottle that sensibility into
movies.'''
</P>
<P>
   What this rebottling represents is certainly not auspicious for
films. Studios have been consumed with what Entertainment Weekly
recently called ``the ever-growing slag heap of television shows
being turned into feature films.'' Certainly there have been
commercial successes, like ``The Fugitive,'' ``George of the
Jungle,'' ``Mission: Impossible'' and most of the ``Star Trek''
movies. But there have been far more duds: ``Flipper,'' ``Beverly
Hillbillies,'' McHale's Navy,'' ``Leave It to Beaver'' and ``Dennis
the Menace,'' for example. And coming soon to the local multiplex
are ``The Avengers,'' ``Mod Squad,'' ``Rugrats'' and ``My Favorite
Martian.'' And a half-dozen more television shows are in
development as movies.
</P>
<P>
   If so much of television is such a bad example, why are so many
good filmmakers happily shifting their attention to television? In
addition to directors like Pollack, Levinson and Brooks, reputable
screenwriters like Kevin Williamson, Aaron Sorkin and John Lee
Hancock and top producers like Jerry Bruckheimer, Harvey Weinstein
and Mark Johnson are now going back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, movie people are startled by the speed of
television. ``I couldn't believe how quickly things happen on TV,''
said Mark Johnson, whose producing credits include prominent movies
like ``Rain Man,'' ``Donnie Brasco'' and ``Bugsy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the screenwriter John Lee Hancock, he recently pitched an
idea for a television show about three middle-aged doctors in Los
Angeles. CBS asked for a script to be produced in three weeks.
Hours after the script arrived, Leslie Moonves, the president of
CBS Television, gave the project the green light. It will be
broadcast on Monday nights this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the movie world,'' said Johnson, ``it would take six weeks
just to start finalizing everyone's deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer hunger among network and cable channels for product
and, perhaps most important, the increasing tendency of the studios
to avoid a certain sort of dramatic movie are also crucial factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are kind of like the cities,'' said Frankenheimer.
``They've wiped out the middle class. They're either interested in
$8 million films or $80 million films. A lot of directors like to
do middle-class movies that are character-based films, about real
people, real issues. A great many of these are being done on cable
TV today.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of HBO's recent successful dramas _ ``Don King: Only in
America,'' ``Citizen Cohn,'' ``Barbarians at the Gate'' and ``Miss
Evers' Boys'' _ are precisely the kind of socially aware,
medium-budget films that flourished in Hollywood in the 1970s. At
that time, in the grip of their own confusion about what was
happening in the nation, studios gave young filmmakers like
Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola extraordinary freedom. ( Coppola
is also working on a television show.)
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, European television is way ahead of even HBO. For
years, Channel Four in Britain and Canal Plus in France, among
others, have helped finance and produce the kind of character- and
story-driven movies for theatrical release that are made in the
United States by quasi-independent companies like Miramax, Fine
Line and October Films.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration at the feature-film system seems epidemic among even
A-list film directors. ``Movies are becoming, more and more, just
concept pieces, high-energy and high-voltage pieces,'' said
Levinson, who has struggled to walk a delicate line between making
personal films like ``Diner'' and ``Wag the Dog'' and directing
studio concoctions like ``Sphere.'' ``Studios want sizzle, they
want movie stars. And television is dealing with the society we're
living in.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, would his colleague Pollack be able to make ``They
Shoot Horses, Don't They?,'' his provocative 1969 film about a
Depression-era dance marathon. ``Never in a million years,'' said
Levinson. ``It's a downbeat picture. People would look at it and
say, `This is a downer, how do you sell it, it doesn't fit into an
easy genre.'''
</P>
<P>
   But flexibility, creative freedom and art are hardly the only
factors motivating movie makers to move into television.
Extraordinary amounts of money are being earned there, largely
because of the sale of syndication rights. Paul Reiser and Helen
Hunt, the stars of ``Mad About You,'' recently renewed their
contracts for $1 million per episode. Producers like Marcy Carsey
and Tom Werner (``The Cosby Show,'' ``Roseanne''), Steven Bochco
(``L.A. Law,'' ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'') and Jerry Seinfeld and Larry
David (``Seinfeld'') are far wealthier than, say, Hollywood's
producer-director of the moment, James Cameron (``Titanic'').

 LOS ANGELES: (``Titanic.'')  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As powerful as the flow from films to television is, the hunger
among writers and directors _ not to mention young and not-so-young
actors like DiCaprio and Sarah Michelle Gellar, George Clooney and
Helen Hunt _ to voyage the other way is still great. Films are
still seen as _ sexier. And no matter how lucrative and creatively
freewheeling television may be, some agents, stars and writers
still condescend to the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so ironic _ you can create a half-hour situation comedy
that makes $600 million in profits or make a movie called `Slasher
Bunnies 2' and the sitcom is treated with disdain by some movie
people,'' said Matt Williams, the executive producer of
``Roseanne'' and the creator of ``Home Improvement.'' ``To do a bad
slasher movie has more prestige than a quality half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that television has sent gifted stars, directors and
writers into movies, but the degree to which these people have been
able to influence the way movies are made is difficult to gauge.
Often mentioned as the paradigm is Brooks, the creator of shows
like ``Taxi,'' The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Lou Grant'' and ``The
Simpsons.'' He moved into films with successes like ``Terms of
Endearment,'' ``Broadcast News'' and ``As Good as It Gets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that television does,'' Brooks said with a
tone of nostalgia. ``If you're doing a series it happens so quickly
that it's much more informal and less self-conscious, and
self-conscious is the enemy of creativity. Personal writing is
taken for granted. If a show is successful the bosses go away. You
come in on Monday morning and someone says, `A funny thing happened
this weekend,' and you say, `Let's put it on the show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this sense of improvisation, informality and
risk-taking stamps Brooks' films, but it's perhaps less evident in
the work of other television directors who successfully made the
transition into movies, like Ron Howard, Michael Mann, Penny
Marshall and Rob Reiner. For all these directors' distinctiveness,
the impact of television is not especially evident in their films.
Similarly, the movie stars who began on television, like Clint
Eastwood, Steve McQueen, John Travolta, Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy,
Robin Williams and Jim Carrey, are perceived as movie stars, not
actors who gain anything by being associated with the other medium.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question of whether the new intertwining of
television and movies will yield a new kind of star, whose energy,
presence or mystery will somehow differ from that of yesterday's
kings and queens of Hollywood. Will this new star _ Lithgow and Ms.
Hunt may be the prototypes _ be able to go back and forth regularly
from small screen to large without being condescended to? Will he
or she be a more intimate acquaintance for viewers?
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they really know you on television _ you're familiar
and comfortable to them, not like a movie star at all,'' said
Angela Lansbury, who moved from a long career in MGM films to
Broadway shows like ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``Mame'' to a hugely
successful 12-year-run on CBS' ``Murder She Wrote'' as the
endearing mystery writer Jessica Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up and touch me,'' she said. ``They feel they
really know Jessica, they feel that intimacy. It's scary and very
dear. To be honest, I avoided television like the plague. I felt it
burned actors out. I used to think familiarity bred contempt. But I
was so wrong. Familiarity bred trust. And an enormous audience.''

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So, you figure Curtis Hanson and those slacker
boys, Affleck and Damon, got lucky when they won Best Screenplay
Oscars this year, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Think you could do better but didn't have the money to option a
James Ellroy novel and forgot about your boy-genius buddy from the
projects who ended up at MIT until you saw ``Good Will Hunting''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is Hollywood, so your confidence in your abilities,
however well-placed, is far from unique. But now you and other
budding screenwriters can show off at least a tad of talent online
in the Rough Cut Screenplay Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rough Cut Web site, screenwriter David Goyer _ who has
written such films as ``Dark City'' and ``The Crow: City of
Angels'' _ will post the first 10 pages of a new science-fiction
screenplay beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Then each week, people can submit five to 10 pages of their
version of the script's next chapter through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Rough Cut staff will cull through the entries and post the
best one each week until the tale reaches a suitable size and plot
resolution, typically at around 100 to 120 pages. Then Goyer will
pen the concluding several pages, tying together the script's loose
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it's going to work either; that's the beauty
of it,'' said Andy Jones, Rough Cut's editor in chief. ``It is all
a very brave new world, which is what the Internet is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Each week's winning entry earns its writer $100, a pretty good
chance of winning a grand prize drawing for a laptop computer and,
most importantly, an official writing credit if the screenplay is
made into a movie, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Writers are encouraged to be wildly creative with their plot
twists and to make casting suggestions as well, said Jones, who
described the script's premise so far as ``very much a `Blade
Runner'-esque meets `Dark City' experience so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts out with a character who has an ability to change
appearances and uses a lot of gadgets,'' Jones said. ``All we know
is, he wants to have himself killed off.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, ladies and gentlemen, start your word processors.
</P>
<P>
   Submission rules and all the other fine print are available at
www.roughcut.com. Rough Cut is the film-oriented Web site for the
TNT cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   NET MAGAZINES: Two well-done new magazines have hit the stands
covering aspects of the Internet, though from very different
directions.
</P>
<P>
   One is Business 2.0, Imagine Media's business-minded successor
to the ``suspended'' Internet magazine the Net. Business 2.0
focuses, unsurprisingly, on e-commerce and other financial aspects
of the wired world. But there are nuggets to be gleaned from the
biz talk that are of interest to a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   One story focuses on movie studios' use of Web sites to build
pre-release buzz for films, mentioning how Dean Devlin used the
long-running ``Godzilla'' site as a key part of the mega-buildup
for the movie, which wasn't as good as the Net site. Another
terrific (and still-running) site mentioned in the story is
``Starship Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another story detailing the ``25 most intriguing minds of the
new economy'' includes the founder of Bangladesh's revolutionary
Grameen Bank and Los Angeles Kings co-owner Philip Anschutz, who
also started Qwest Communications, the upstart company whose
state-of-the-art fiber-optic network and dirt-cheap prices are
threatening to turn the long-distance phone business upside down.
</P>
<P>
   And a regular page of Internet statistics includes some
eye-popping numbers: The number of World Wide Web sites quadrupled
between January 1997 and April 1998 to 2.3 million, while the
number of U.S. adults online increased from 31.5 million to 41.5
million between July and December of last year. And the ratio of
women to men is now close to even.
</P>
<P>
   The other magazine of note is Brill's Content, which focuses on
all things ``nonfiction,'' including the Internet, which has earned
a reputation for somewhat woozy distinctions for veracity.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, run by the great journalist Steven Brill, made a
splash recently for Brill's own devastating detailing of
corner-cutting journalists and problematic prosecutors in l'affaire
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine has much else to recommend it, including good
stories on the struggle for survival by Salon, the terrific online
magazine, and how Internet ``portal'' sites such as Yahoo! are
being paid big money to give other sites prime spots on their front
pages while competitors aren't even indexed.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC ON THE WIRES: Fast-moving changes in the music business
caused by the Internet and new recording technology will be the
subject of a panel discussion called ``Downloadable Music:
Revolution or Revitalization,'' 7 p.m. July 23 at the Hotel Nikko
in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists include David Kessel, president of IUMA/Offline
Records, and Wendy Hafner, marketing manager for Intel's music
division.
</P>
<P>
   The event costs $25 for the general public, and tickets must be
purchased in advance. For more information, call (310) 392-3777,
Ext. 214.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA'S DIGITAL OPEN HOUSE: UCLA's Extension program will hold a
free career day and open house on its new media and digital
creation programs on Aug. 29 in Dodd Hall on the UCLA campus.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scheduled guest speakers are specialists in digital
effects, interactive writing, compositing and more from companies
such as AutoCAD, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Cinesite, Area 51 and
others.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact UCLA Extension, (310) 825-9064, or

TWO DIVERSE ADDITIONS TO `B&AMP;B' CAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The long and the short of it is that ``The Bold
and the Beautiful,'' the most-watched daytime drama around the
world, has just added two Pauls to its cast: Agoura actor Paul
Satterfield, a hunky Christopher Reeve look-alike, and Paul
Williams, the Oscar-winning songwriter who makes his home above
Sunset Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   It's a visually unlikely on-screen pairing for the two, who play
best friends and business partners on the CBS soap. Satterfield is
6 foot 4 inches tall; Williams stands 5 foot 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's like lighting two different shows,'' joked
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the physical attributes we possess, we have to try
not to play Mutt and Jeff, Abbott and Costello,'' Satterfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' appearance on the soap marks his first acting gig
eight years into sobriety. During his recovery from a decade of
alcohol and cocaine abuse, he abandoned acting and music to become
a UCLA-certified drug and alcohol counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The stint on ``B&AMP;B'' is a return to soaps for Satterfield, who
previously appeared on daytime's ``General Hospital'' and the
nighttime serial ``Savannah,'' and just finished playing the lead
in an independent theatrical film, ``Duty Dating,'' set for release
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Both actors have signed on with the show for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Satterfield portrays Pierce Peterson, a multimillionaire
motivational speaker (much like real-life infomercial king Tony
Robbins) who arrives to energize the other folks on ``B&AMP;B.''
Williams, as Bailey Masterson, plays the guru's buddy, confidant
and business manager, who is also a recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville-born Satterfield, who has guest-starred on
``Veronica's Closet,'' Murder One,'' ``7th Heaven'' and other
prime-time shows, appeared in a couple of best-forgotten films
before ``Duty Dating.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, in which he stars with Lauren Sinclair as his love
interest, allows fans to see Satterfield's chiseled features
differently for the first time. ``To do this, I didn't have to be
handsome,'' he said. ``My hair's kinda long and scraggly. I wear my
glasses. You'd think, `This guy would never get the girl.' But I
get the girl. It was a romantic comedy, a lot of fun to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the film, he got a call from ``B&AMP;B,'' which his
agent turned down at first because he thought Satterfield would
view daytime drama with disdain. He was wrong; Satterfield was
thrilled. ``I never said I wouldn't go back to daytime,'' he said.
``It's a great gig.''
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, a return to acting signals the beginning of a
whole new life without chemical stimulation. The lyricist, who was
nominated for Best Song Oscars six times and won in 1976 for
``Evergreen,'' and also acted in the ``Smokey and the Bandit''
movies, descended into a nightmare of alcohol and cocaine during
his peak songwriting years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you've got a problem when you lose a whole decade,
and I lost the '80s,'' Williams said. ``There's a fine line between
use to abuse to addiction, and I don't know where I crossed it. I
always said I got better at showing off than showing up. I became a
chronic and habitual liar to hide my addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a look at what his life had become put him on the road
to sobriety. He went from being a patient at various rehab centers
to being a counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly but surely, I sort of fell in love with music again,''
said Williams, who penned Diamond Rio's ``You're Gone,'' which rose
to No. 28 on the country charts last week. ``Then I started doing
the occasional acting job. Then I got a call from (`B&AMP;B' head
writer) Brad Bell, saying, `How would you like to play a recovering
alcoholic before 350 million people a day?' How can you turn that
down?''

WALKING ON THE WILD SIDE, PRISONERS WIN GOLD AT ENGLISH GARDEN
SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Exchanging their confines for a temporary stay in the
open country air, seven prisoners from Her Majesty's Prison Leyhill
in the Cotswolds won their second gold medal last week at the
Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, the Royal Horticultural Society's
summer extravaganza. Their show garden, ``Take a Walk on the Wild
Side,'' included a woodland garden of wildflowers and grasses under
linden and beech trees, with a stream flowing under a stone bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing to make a garden, and another to mimic
nature,'' Adrian Foulkes, a prisoner, said of the difficulty of
forcing bluebells and wild garlic into bloom. Foulkes, who is 39
and is nearing parole on a life sentence for murder, heads the
prison's garden committee this year.
</P>
<P>
   The flower show, which ended last weekend, is an annual event on
the grounds of Hampton Court Palace, in the London borough of
Richmond-Upon-Thames, on the Thames River. The show, which attracts
horticultural groups and garden designers, uses displays that are
designed so that visitors can walk through them. The prisoners'
exhibit, situated on the banks of a long canal with spouting
fountains, seemed like a real woodland in which one could rest on a
willow seat under linden trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Hampton Court prize also honored the prisoners' vegetable
garden display: a kitchen garden (carrots, onions, parsnips and
runner beans) enclosed by cordoned apple and pear trees and a rusty
fence overgrown with blackberry bushes from the prison's grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen and woodland gardens were designed by Gareth
Goundrill _ not a prisoner, but the 18-year-old son of Jeff
Goundrill, who oversees business enterprises at Leyhill. The
younger Goundrill made the designs as his final exam for a high
school technology course, and the prisoners dug the grounds and
planted the flowers, vegetables and trees with the help of the
prison farm foreman, Martin Brookes.
</P>
<P>
   Leyhill, a minimum-security institution, has been participating
in Royal Horticultural Society flower shows at Hampton Court Palace
and Chelsea since 1991. ``It is a real pleasure to work with the
Leyhill team,'' said Stephen Bennett, the director of the shows.
``They have become good friends; they provide much pleasure to the
gardening public, and their skillful use of plants _ all grown at
the prison _ makes a valuable contribution to horticulture and the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyhill is in the town of Wotton-Under-Edge in the Cotswolds,
one of England's best-known garden belts, about 100 miles west of
London. The institution, on about 250 acres, with three acres under
glass, is surrounded by crumbling stone walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to work as a gardener,'' said Tom Williams, the
prison's warden, ``a prisoner needs no horticultural experience.
But he must be quick to learn, work hard and have a sense of humor
under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyhill's grounds include an arboretum with more than 1,000
specimen trees and a stately home, Tortworth Court, a 60-room
mansion that was built in 1853 and is the former seat of the Earls
of Ducie. Henry John, the third earl, created the arboretum from
1853 to 1921. The arboretum has been managed by Leyhill since the
prison acquired it in the 1940s. Leyhill also maintains pasture
land for raising rare Gloucester cattle and runs a museum of old
farm machinery in the prison's Tortworth Visitors' Center, which
also includes a farm stand.
</P>
<P>
   The arboretum is open to the public on weekends and bank
holidays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The visitors' center is open the
same hours daily. Information: 011-44-1454-260-681.
</P>
<P>
   The prison's gardens have become a serious moneymaking
enterprise over the last five years. This year, Leyhill has
supplied a million carpet-bedding plants to nearby towns, and it
distributes organically grown vegetables to 27 other prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a prison serves a bad meal, it sours the whole
atmosphere,'' said Colin Lennox, the farm manager. And the prison
takes the word ``organic'' seriously. Pests are controlled by their
natural predators instead of by sprays and pesticides. A computer
monitors the prison's nine greenhouses along with irrigation and
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   There's an additional enterprise for the Leyhill gardens: They
provide organic salads and sandwich fillings for British Airways
Concorde flights originating at Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
   For all the efficiency of the prison's garden operation, there
is one drawback: As Jeff Goundrill said, ``The best gardeners are
always being released.''

 &HT;    Yearwood's poignant `Road' turns misery into beauty
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trisha Yearwood looks like the all-American girl who grew up
singing along with Linda Ronstadt albums in her bedroom and now
should be approaching middle age in a pretty suburban house with a
couple of kids in the yard. But Yearwood has figured out that most
of us don't wind up with storybook endings, and now, a decade into
her phenomenal career, the onetime Monticello, Ga. schoolgirl has
produced a poignantly beautiful album about growing older, losing
lovers and watching dreams evaporate faster than credit card debt
goes away.
</P>
<P>
   No one can take lyrics like these from ``Heart Like a Sad Song''
and wrap her pipes around them any better: ``There's a wedding
picture she still keeps / Of the girl she was and the man he seemed
to be. / He left her the house with the picket fence / And walked
away with her innocence.'' If anyone has inherited Ronstadt's
mantle as the Mistress of Misery, it's Yearwood, who can belt 'em
out even better than her hippie-era predecessor. And, unlike
Ronstadt, Yearwood has an uncanny ability to pick great material,
then interpret the songs with a sophisticated style as timeless as
Patsy Cline's ``Crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, tunes such as the Top-40ish ``There Goes My Baby'' and
``Powerful Thing'' are more pop than country, and introspective
Mary Chapin Carpenter could have recorded the ethereal ``Never Let
You Go Again,'' a rainy-day, piano-based weeper. But Yearwood seems
to have found her niche in Nashville, and while it may not be the
house with the picket fence, it's a more realistic place to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Your Road Leads''
</P>
<P>
   Trisha Yearwood. MCA. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The Mistress of Misery belts it out.

 &HT;    Beastie Boys grow up a bit with CD worth deep listen
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one of the few outfits to successfully bridge the worlds of
hip-hop, indie-rock, New York's noise underground and, of late, the
Dalai Lama, the Beastie Boys have sustained themselves by observing
a certain distance from the fleeting fortunes of the pop
marketplace. The once-bratty trio never sold more records than at
its most willfully callow _ the hair-raising, if now innocently
pre-``gangsta,'' 1986 debut ``Licensed to Ill'' _ and a subsequent
decade has seen the group mature into a kind of art project not
limited to fractured breakbeats. There's a Beastie record label,
Grand Royal, whose roster includes longtime pals Luscious Jackson,
a magazine also called Grand Royal, a publicity agency called Nasty
Little Man (hence this new album's title) and a charity pop event,
the Tibetan Freedom Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello Nasty,'' the group's fifth full-length album, goes with
this flow. It's more a consolidation than a departure, shamelessly
old-school in its eager display of urban roots (the time-tested rap
introduction ``I don't mean to brag / I don't mean to boast'' is
resurrected on the second cut), scholarly in its ransacking of
record racks for novel samples and sound effects (the steel drums
on ``Body Movin''' are an especially canny touch).
</P>
<P>
   The trio's sonic conservatory begs for deeper listening than its
familiar surface _ loungy exotica on one track, squiggly synths on
another _ seemingly might require. Guest vocalists arrive
unexpectedly from far-off planets (as does reggae wizard Lee
``Scratch'' Perry on the dubwise ``Dr. Lee, Ph.D.''), and there's
always a laugh-out-loud rhyme lurking like a sucker punch: ``I'm
the king of boogie, there is no higher; / I get 11 points off the
word `quagmire.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello Nasty''
</P>
<P>
   Beastie Boys. Grand Royal/Capitol. 22 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: One-time beat brats turn hip-hop classicists.

 &HT;    Audio Reviews: the word on the latest sounds
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge, Doug Hamilton, Al Levine, Sonia Murray,
and Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight No Chase''
</P>
<P>
   P.A. DreamWorks. 16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, mom and dad. This isn't the incredibly offensive
record you might expect from an act called Parental Advisory,
a.k.a. P.A. The only thing violent about P.A. is the Atlanta-based
rap trio's obvious influence: Quentin Tarantino movies. Spaghetti
guitars, soul and rock propel this sample-free and cinematic
sophomore effort. So take a seat and experience their skillfully
detailed and more than likely imagined adventures (``The Lick''),
pleasures (``China White'') and boasts (``Like We Do''). And if,
halfway through, this starts to feel like a Goodie Mob or Outkast
rerun, it's probably because they all share a connection to
production trio Organized Noize.
</P>
<P>
   -- DANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``HereHear''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Wink. Columbia. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Like a techno-savvy Fred Sanford, Josh Wink presides over a junk
shop of electronic music forms on his second album. The
Philadelphia producer and disc jockey dabbles in acid jazz (``Hard
Hit''), high-energy house music (``Sixth Sense'') and clangy
industrial beats (``Black Bomb,'' with vocals by Trent Reznor of
Nine Inch Nails). The result is a bit disjointed and not exactly
forward-looking, but Wink does reach sonic bliss on occasion. The
lovely, liquid drum-and-bass number ``Young Again'' sets sail on a
warm sea of keyboard washes, while ``I'm on Fire'' features the
seductive vocals of former This Mortal Coil singer Caroline Crawley
trickling over a slow-grind trip-hop groove.
</P>
<P>
   -- COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``Burnin' the Roadhouse Down''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wariner. Capitol. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   What do you do to keep busy when you're not selling many
records? For Steve Wariner, the plan went something like this: Sing
a duet with Anita Cochran (``What If I Said'') that goes to No. 1.
Write a tune for Garth Brooks (``Longneck Bottle'') that gets all
over the airwaves. Pretty soon, the record labels notice. And so
here is Wariner back after a three-year hiatus, sounding as strong
as ever. He's all over the board stylistically, from the
sentimental ``Holes in the Floor of Heaven'' to the Texas roadhouse
swing of the title cut. The younger hat acts should take notes.
</P>
<P>
   -- POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Vertical Man''
</P>
<P>
   Ringo Starr. Mercury. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   With a little help from his friends, Ringo Starr just might have
one or two hit singles here. ``Vertical Man,'' the former Beatles
timekeeper's first album of new pop in years, boasts strong
material and appearances by ex-Beatles Paul McCartney and George
Harrison, plus Brian Wilson, Scott Weiland, Steven Tyler, Joe
Walsh, Ozzy Osbourne and even Alanis Morissette. This wisely used
Starr power produces some juicy musical assistance, such as Tyler
and Morissette's soulful contributions to the album's cover of
Dobie Gray's ``Drift Away.'' A great example of irony finds Starr
and friends rockin' on ``Love Me Do,'' a song cut by the Fab Four
before Ringo joined the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try Whistling This''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Finn. Work/Sony. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Known for a Paul McCartney-esque way with melodic hooks as
leader of Crowded House, Neil Finn broke up the band to go it
alone. On his first solo album, his voice has a raspiness and his
delivery an intensity that reminds us for allthe world of ... John
Lennon. That's progress. Fans of the New Zealand singer-songwriter
shouldn't be confused by the title. ``Try Whistling This'' has its
fair share of aural experimentation, but it's more in the densely
layered mode of ``Sgt. Pepper'' than anything dissonant. Finn's
lyrics deal with love and regret, but the interesting darker notes
(``King Tide'') help balance the expected sweet ones (``She Will
Have Her Way'').

   A 17-year-old who can connect both the classic ``Misty Blue''
and the slickest urban contemporary music can't be simply
explained. It takes time to understand and appreciate the
progression that Monica has made from her less vocally challenging
debut singles, ``Don't Take It Personal'' and ``Like This and Like
That,'' to the fellow million-seller ``For You I Will'' from the
``Space Jam'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to be able to believe that she is as sincere about
persuading a boyfriend to stop selling drugs (``Street Symphony,''
with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra) as she is when catching that
guy's eye ``Cross the Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's the simple part: Monica just does it.
</P>
<P>
   Slinky and danceable fun music like ``The First Night,'' the
first single from this album, and ``Ring Da Bell,'' a song about a
girl learning that her boyfriend is having a child with another
woman, are approached with equal emotional depth. The only
disappointing thing about this follow-up to the Atlantan's
million-selling debut is that there aren't a whole lot of songs as
weighty as the compelling talent singing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Is Mine''
</P>
<P>
   Monica. Arista.
</P>
<P>
   13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``The Boy'' is Monica's, and so is the best voice
among young R&AMP;B singers today.

 &HT;    ABC's ads may be better than new fall shows
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif. _ ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The check is in the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   That trio of lyin' lines is part of ABC's current ``We Love TV''
promotional campaign, an extension of last season's ``TV is Good''
schtick. You remember: those school-bus-yellow billboards with
simple _ some said simple-minded _ messages, hyping the medium of
television not as the destroyer of civilization but as its savior.
</P>
<P>
   Although ABC took some hits for the campaign from literal-minded
critics, it worked, arguably better than the network's shows
themselves last season. (ABC was beaten not only by NBC but by Fox
in the crucial demographic of viewers aged 18 to 49.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be smart, urban, fresh and funny,'' ABC
Entertainment chairman Stu Bloomberg said Tuesday to TV critics
meeting here to preview the fall season. ``We think this campaign
establishes that.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's promotional spots _ some of which have already
appeared with another wave coming soon to a TV set, bus or
billboard near you _ include:
</P>
<P>
   ``If TV's so bad for you, why is there one in every hospital
room?''
</P>
<P>
   ``TV: So good they named a frozen meal after it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before TV, two World Wars. After TV, zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The tongue-in-cheek ads last season were named one of the Top 10
ad campaigns of the year by Time magazine, despite the fact that
they appeared not to help ABC at all in the ratings. The network
has been spiralling steadily down since being bought by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   And there's not much about ABC's new fall shows to suggest the
network will halt the slide. Among its new series:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Fantasy Island'' _ An updated version starring Malcolm
McDowell instead of Ricardo Montalban, but with the same basic
premise (9 p.m. ET Saturdays);
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Two of a Kind'' _ A new sitcom with those too-sweet twins
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of ``Full House'' (8 pm. ET Fridays);
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Cupid'' _ Starring ``Ellen's'' Jeremy Piven as the god of
love made flesh, trying to bring people together in a world of
singles bars and ``The Rules'' (10 p.m. ET Saturdays);
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Hughleys'' _ A comedy about a black family moving into
an all-white suburb, one of two shows this falls with that premise
(the other is ``Living in Captivity'' on Fox). It will air at 8:30
p.m. ET Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Vengeance Unlimited'' _ A surprisingly violent drama given
its early time period (8 p.m. ET Thursdays) that stars Michael
Madsen (``'Reservoir Dogs'') as a thinking man's vigilante who
exacts justice for those who don't get it in court.
</P>
<P>
   Or as ABC's ad campaign will soon be telling you: ``Hello? It's
free.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes II'' names excutive producer
</P>
<P>
   After much gnashing of teeth by those at ``60 Minutes,'' CBS
will indeed clone TV's most honored newsmagazine. ``60 Minutes II''
will debut in early 1999. Jeff Fager, who has executive produced
``CBS Evening News with Dan Rather'' since 1996, will be lead the
new newsmag team.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up next on ``Nightline''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, ABC's ``Nightline'' (11:35 p.m. EDT) starts a two-part
look at the reunion in Washington of the Boys Nation class of 1963.
It was during this class that President Clinton, then 17, met
President Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden (film footage of
their greeting was shown at the 1992 Democratic National
Convention). Part two airs at 11:35 p.m. EDT, Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in August ``Nightline'' will go prime time. It will
run for five consecutive Thursdays at 10 p.m.EDT starting Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel moves at ``GMA''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz great David Sanborn is joining ``Good Morning America'' and
will do regular music reports. Sanborn will also sometimes play his
saxophone with musicians he profiles. Also joining ``GMA'' will be
fitness guy Bob Greene, best known as the personal trainer of Oprah
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Smits to stay with ABC
</P>
<P>
   ABC has yet to announce the fate of Detective Bobby Simone on
``NYPD Blue,'' but actor Jimmy Smits, who plays Simone and will
exit the popular cop drama, will stay at the network, according to
The Hollywood Reporter. Smits will star in a future series for ABC.

 &HT;    `Palmetto's' noir served with a sunny Florida twist
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a journalist played by Woody Harrelson leaves prison after
serving time for a crime he didn't commit, we watch him wander into
a setup wearily familiar from a hundred film noirs. You may wonder
how many times we can watch this story of a guy lured into a
double-cross by a standard-issue femme fatale. But director Volker
Schlondorff plays the story with an occasional, self-conscious wink
to the watcher. And his movie has a few genuine twists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palmetto'' exchanges noir's dark urban streets for the sun and
sea breezes of Florida. And it casts against type by giving sunny
Elisabeth Shue the bad-girl role. The wealthy young wife of a dying
tycoon, she asks Harrelson to play the ``voice on the phone'' in a
fake kidnap scheme she's cooked up with her stepdaughter (Chloe
Sevigny). All he has to do is call the tycoon and pretend to have
nabbed his stepdaughter, then the three share the ransom. Simple
enough? Nope. At nearly two hours long, ``Palmetto'' can be as lazy
as one of its own summer days. But it earns its second-act
surprises, and gives noir a new life. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Other Harrelson movies: ``The People vs. Larry Flynt,'' ``White
Men Can't Jump,'' ``Natural Born Killers,'' ``Welcome to
Sarajevo,'' ``Wag the Dog.''

 &HT;    Video Mini Reviews: The latest out on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Nil by Mouth'' (R) _ There's only one problem with Gary
Oldman's riveting debut as a director: Half the time, you can't
understand what anybody's saying. Focusing on a dysfunctional
blue-collar British family, the drama chronicles the ups and
especially the downs of Ray Winstone, whose wages go primarily for
the drugs and alcohol that keep him alternating between rage and
stupor. As might be guessed, this movie's not exactly an upper. But
it features remarkable acting, especially by Kathy Burke, who won
an award at Cannes for this film, as Winstone's beleaguered wife.
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Illtown'' (R) _ Director Nick Gomez (``Laws of Gravity'')
takes a mythological tone with this surreal drama about a couple of
South Florida drug dealers (Michael Rapaport, Lili Taylor). Their
easy, middle-class operation (recruiting kids to sell their stuff
at clubs) turns bloody when old friend Adam Trese shows up from up
North with an old score to settle. Gomez deconstructs the film,
using the sun-drenched, dreamy setting to odd effect, and throwing
in allegorical references to John Milton and the Bible. Even when
it isn't convincing, the movie is compulsively watchable. And where
else do you get to see Tony Danza play a gay drug lord who's also a
gardener?
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Phantoms'' (R) _ This horror film is packed with ominous
shots of sink drains. That makes sense: It seems to have been
edited by a garbage disposal. For reasons unexplained, two sisters
(Rose McGowan, Joanna Going) end up in a tiny mountain town beset
by an unnamed, oily evil living in the ground. The movie draws on
tabloid mythology and some H.P. Lovecraft monsters. But after a
spooky, jarring start, it moves at a quick, incoherent pace,
becoming a clumsy hybrid of ``Outbreak'' and ``It.'' Ben Affleck
and poor Peter O'Toole are also in the cast. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Sphere'' (PG-13) _ A mind-numbing mess that turns Dustin
Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone into B-movie actors and
proves that director Barry Levinson (``Wag the Dog'') shouldn't
dabble in sci-fi. The stars play members of an ad hoc team sent to
the ocean floor to examine what appears to be a spaceship that
crashed 300 years ago. Inside is a floating sphere that soon begins
to exert a spooky power over them. The movie never quite decides
what the sphere is _ good or evil, man-made or alien _ and the
actors are drowned by shoddy special effects and a script that
spins in circles.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Zero Effect'' (R) _ Writer-director Jake Kasdan shares some
of his pop Lawrence's interest in oddball human behavior, quirks
and mystery. But as a first-time director, he paces this off-kilter
comedy-mystery with killing slowness. We get an updated riff on
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in Bill Pullman's brilliant, phobic
detective Daryl Zero and the frazzled intermediary (Ben Stiller)
who has to deal with his employer's quirks. Investigating a problem
for tycoon Ryan O'Neal, Daryl runs into (and falls for) a paramedic
(played with fatal lack of charm by Kim Dickens). The movie has
intelligence and craft, but its identity never congeals. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Winter Guest'' (R) _ An icily pristine character study
starring Emma Thompson and her real-life mother, Phyllida Law. It's
the dead of winter in a tiny Scottish seaside town. Hell hasn't
frozen over, but the ocean has. Law plays the mother of Thompson,
who's recently widowed and considering moving with her teenage son
to Australia to escape her grief. Desire is at the root of this
bleak, subtle film: the desire for human connection in whatever
form it might take. Grade: B

 &HT;    Popular jazz drumer to perform at three day summit
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- James Brown's timeless exhortation to ``give the
drummer some`` is nearly redundant when the percussionist in
question is Hamid Drake.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, the Chicago-based musician is an emerging master whose
versatile skills and quicksilver intuition have made him one of the
most in-demand collaborators inthe sometimes amorphous field of
jazz and improvised music.
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be no musical vectors he hasn't traveled: Drake
has been a frequent member of tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders'
outfits; toured as a teenager with the late trumpeter Don Cherry
and, later, with the ``Rockit''-era Herbie Hancock; and fostered a
fertile partnership with the master kora player Foday Musa Suso. He
gigs and records with multiple combos in his hometown, including
the fluid and sometimes ferocious DKV Trio, which features
fire-throwing multi-reedist Ken Vandermark. He's hopping flights to
Europe on a routine basis, where he has a steady job with the
fabled German saxophone colossus Peter Brotzmann.
</P>
<P>
   As such, few artists amplify the theme of the 10th anniversary
National Black Arts Festival _ ``Art Beyond Borders'' _ quite like
Drake, whose polyrhythms populate all kinds of cultural crossroads.
This week, his path leads to Atlanta, and a unique, three-day
fest-within-the-fest billed as ``(Re)soundings.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tonight, this international jazz summit is a lively,
far-reaching survey of avant-garde concepts as they originated in
Chicago, New York, New Haven, Conn., Great Britain and Germany in
the 1960s and '70s, and how those ideas evolve and mutate in the
ever-present ``now`` of performance.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as abstract as it might sound, insists Drake, whose
global percussive range _ and a narrative knack for creating vivid
scenarios in tone _ capably balances even the most volatile
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music, it's about methodologies by which we can come to
some sort of understanding of various truths,'' says Drake, who
performs tonight with DKV and the unsung Chicago tenor great Fred
Anderson, and again on Friday with the often volcanic Brotzmann.
``It's not necessarily the Truth, but the various truths that might
be operating inside of each human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Louisiana and raised in the Chicago suburb of Evanston,
Drake was not initially drawn to percussion; rather, it was thrust
upon him. ``Lots of schools have these stage bands,`` he says,
reflecting on that fateful day in every young musician's life when
they first get to ``pick'' an instrument. ``But who wants to be in
the back playing the bass drum and the snare drum? I really wanted
to play the trombone but there were only a certain number
available. I still love the trombone, I love that sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Drake reasons that he was compelled to play the drums, he
quickly established a presence _ even while in high school. ``He's
the kind of young man that's very visual,'' reckons Anderson, a
69-year-old elder statesman of the Chicago tenor tradition who was
close friends with Drake's father, and began playing with the
drummer in the 1970s. ``He's sees a lot of things, and listens to
what the horn players are playing, and complements them.``
</P>
<P>
   That's an especially valuable role when the music slips free of
conventional time signatures and pursues open structures. Drummers
not only have to sustain a sense of pulse, but engage in a kind of
game with the other musicians that's part tug-of-war, part
tightrope walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best drummers I've ever seen,`` says Bruno
Johnson, a Chicago bartender and music fan who founded Okkadisk, an
independent record label, to document his favorite players. Drake
appears on no less than six different titles. ``There is so much
happening so quickly that it can be frightening sometimes. It's
something you don't really expect to ever see.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, jazz drummers are supposed to be dynamos. Drake,
however, reaches deeper. Like the best of his peers, he seems to
tap a pipeline directly into his nervous system,
</P>
<P>
   a gift magnified through casual showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a compelling percussionist to watch,`` says Tad
Hendrickson, jazz and world music editor for CMJ New Music Report,
a national trade publication for college radio stations. ``He's got
a smile on his face, he's working his way around the drum kit. His
music comes out of his limbs. There's no difference between what's
going on in his soul and what you hear in the audience.''

   If anything, Drake agrees, playing drums is like writing
autobiography. ``It's an extension of me,`` he says. ``Telling my
story, my joys and ups and downs and pursuits. My fears, my
insecurities, what I'm confident in. It's a way for me to express
my life, my voice, through sound and to somehow go deeper and
deeper into what it is to really be a human being ... and to have
fun.''

INTERNET TAKES TIME AWAY FROM SLEEP, TV AND MUCH ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us know that Internet use is up. But what is down?
</P>
<P>
   With only 24 hours in a day, is cyberspace stealing time from
sleeping, stepping on the Stairmaster, watching television or
working? The answer, according to a new survey, is all of the
above.
</P>
<P>
   The activity taking the biggest hit is television- and
VCR-watching, according to the survey by Strategis Group, a
Washington-based research firm that studies patterns in
telecommunications use. Nearly 65 percent of 500 Net users surveyed
said they had sacrificed time in front of the TV for time in front
of the computer monitor. Forty-eight percent said they spent less
time reading, and 29 percent said they slept less.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results, issued at the end of June, seemed to
validate a trend reported in a similar poll last year by a New York
research company, Cyber Dialogue. It found that in addition to
spending less time with their television sets, 22 percent of
Internet regulars were also spending less time making long-distance
phone calls. Cyber Dialogue further found that 16 percent of Net
surfers were spending less time reading newspapers; an identical
percentage spent less time reading magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the more difficult question: What do these data mean?
</P>
<P>
   John Zahurancik, director of Internet and telephony at Strategis
Group, said the findings that the Internet was stealing time from
other media meant that the Net was sharing their stage. ``The Net
is becoming a mainstream medium,'' he said. ``It is a competition
to all these other traditional sources of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   But scratch beneath the surface and the lessons are not so
obvious or clear-cut, said Stuart Gibbel, director of marketing for
Cyber Dialogue. Gibbel said it might be years before it is known
what activities will suffer, diminish or even die because of the
new medium. For instance, Gibbel said, a computer user may go
online to reinforce outside interests, like checking out a Web site
for background on a favorite television show or ordering a book.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Milford, who owns a New York art-management software
company, Artsystems, and is an inveterate Net surfer, said that
when he first encountered cyberspace, it was a black hole. ``The
Internet took from everything, including reading books, a social
life, sleep,'' he said. ``It's such a deep lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milford says the Net now saves him time because it helps
speed information gathering and other tasks, and that time can be
spent on other activities. Further, Milford, who is 39, says he has
mastered the art of simultaneously watching television and surfing
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Television executives are seeking to capitalize on this sort of
crossover viewing. NBC, for example, hopes to use its television
network to steer Net surfers to its Web site, and vice versa,
according to Edmond Sanctis, senior vice president and general
manager of NBC Digital Productions. In other words, if NBC is going
to lose viewers to the Net, it wants to lose them to its own Web
pages, where visitors can also be directed back to NBC. ``This is a
profound opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is certain is that the Web is being rapidly
adopted by Americans. Allen Goldberg, vice president for business
development at Relevant Knowledge, a research company based in
Atlanta, noted that it took 40 years for radio to gain 50 million
domestic listeners and 13 years each for television and cable
television to each acquire 50 million domestic viewers. While
acknowledging that the population is larger now, Goldberg said it
was nonetheless noteworthy that it has taken only four years for
the World Wide Web to reach that same plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Editor and Publisher magazine recently noted that people were
going on line more frequently, with 61 percent of Internet users
surfing the Net at least twice a week, up from 53 percent last
year. However, that may not mean that people are spending more time
on the Net. Cyber Dialogue found that the total time spent on line
each week _ five hours _ did not change from the beginning of 1997
to the beginning of 1998.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF A HOME AND ITS OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As plots go, it is pure Barbara Cartland. Friends
arrange a blind date between a model (J. Crew, Victoria's Secret)
and a telegenic swain (``The Today Show''). The expected chemistry
fizzles. The intended part amicably, only to give romance another
chance a few days later. Today, a year after their disastrous first
date, there is a pear-shaped diamond the size of a small almond on
Annette Roque's left hand, compliments of Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   But the wedding date is shrouded in secrecy, OK?
</P>
<P>
   The only detail of the pending event that Miss Roque would
divulge is the dress: Think of Audrey Hepburn, in ``Roman
Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be exactly like this,'' Ms. Roque said, showing a
clipping of a ballerina-length gown from a Martha Stewart wedding
guide. ``I'm not an off-the-rack kind of girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Roque, 32, has a not-off-the-rack apartment, too, a
two-bedroom penthouse in TriBeCa. Riding the crest of today's
fascination with multiculturalism, it is exotic without looking
anything like Trader Vic's, thanks to the skills of that newly
minted American arbiter of haute-bohemian chic, Countess Muriel
Brandolini d'Adda. The two women met back in the early '90s, when
Mrs. Brandolini was a photo stylist and Miss Roque was hired to
model for Rodier, the upscale French knitwear company.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Roque may not be this season's It Girl, but she is surely
It by association. The model, with her fresh-scrubbed but exotic
visage, will come down the aisle sometime this fall to marry Lauer,
who is 40. To the continued amusement of his Dutch-born fiancee,
Lauer is a celebrity. ``We don't have television personalities in
Holland,'' Miss Roque said. ``We have people who work in
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Roque (pronounced rock) is a working model as opposed to
the supermodel variety. Hailing from a celebrity-immune country,
whose royal family rides bicycles through the city streets, Miss
Roque is plainly intrigued by her fiance's fame. ``People are
always coming up to him in restaurants to say hello,'' she said.
``The attention is really bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why she wants to walk down the aisle without the
hoopla and hovering helicopters that attended the recent nuptials
of Barbra Streisand and James Brolin. ``Are you crazy?'' she asked.
``I want this to be perfect. I've never had a wedding before. The
only problem is we're having 100 guests. Someone's bound to slip
up.''
</P>
<P>
   She grins and laughs in a sort of breathless way she describes
as ``so girly.'' Girly is a designation that Miss Roque uses
frequently and without respect to gender. Anyone enthusiastic,
funny and given to teasing can be an honorary girl. Even Brian
Williams, the gravely serious MSNBC reporter who is apparently a
cut-up off camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a girl,'' Miss Roque said, who recently met Williams and
his wife through Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   Until they move into Lauer's apartment on the Upper East Side,
where the decor is midlife bachelor, Miss Roque and her two
ankle-hugging Burmese cats will continue to live in the abstract
jungle in the sky that Mrs. Brandolini created for her. ``I'm
really going to miss this place,'' Miss Roque said, looking out to
the terrace where a wooden tub of yellow day lilies were just
coming into bloom. The furniture will go into storage, until the
newlywed Lauers find larger digs in a year or so. And when they do,
Mrs. Brandolini will be ready to tackle that apartment, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brandolini, 38, struck out on her own as a decorator a few
years ago, and since then has been racking up esthetically
broadminded clients like the Italian millionaire Andrea Botta, the
makeup artist Moyra Mulholland and Liz O'Brien, furniture dealer to
the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The decorator's freewheeling brand of supersensuous tropicality
was not exactly the environment that Miss Roque anticipated when
she bought her apartment three years ago. It was typical real
estate Zen: white walls, blond floors, no cornices, big glass
windows, spacious but bland. It was, however, sunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with the light, that's all,'' Miss Roque said.
</P>
<P>
   She had no particular fondness for TriBeCa _ it was the
preference of a former boyfriend _ and though the Edwardian
building was graced with big stone columns in front, all the
historic character had been removed from the interiors. The
boyfriend fell by the wayside, and along came Mrs. Brandolini, who
proceeded to remake the apartment _ in her own image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved Muriel's apartments and wanted to live exactly
like that,'' Miss Roque said. ``They're whimsical but not precious.
Everywhere you look is a surprise. Nothing is matched, nothing is
boring.'' And though they did not pay much attention to it at
first, Mrs. Brandolini's Vietnamese, Venezuelan and French ancestry
struck a chord with Miss Roque, whose mother is Dutch and whose
father, the director of human resources for the city of Amsterdam,
is Indonesian, Chinese and French.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are both cocktails, you know?'' said Mrs. Brandolini, an
earthy, effervescent woman. Still, she can strike fear into the
hearts of the chronically indecisive. Instinct is her guide, and
she cheerfully admits, with an expressive grimace, that she doesn't
know the first thing about sketching out a scheme or plotting a
floor plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do comes from the inside, and if it feels right, I just
do it,'' she said. The result is a multicultural tango that is one
part wire act to two parts real genius. The Upper East Side town
house she shares with her husband, Nuno, her children, Brando and
Filippa, and a Welsh corgi called Saigon is a prime example. Room
after room of hand-locked fabrics designed by Mrs. Brandolini and
manufactured in India rest contentedly alongside 1940s mock-Chinese
furniture, Oriental bronze candlesticks, button-tufted Victoriana
and made-to-order curiosities like a mauve and sage-green painted
armoire topped with an outsize pineapple designed by R. Louis
Bofferding. A vast Chinese bed dominates the dining room (it
doubles as guest quarters), and the ceiling of the den is a quilt
of mismatched sarongs.

 &HT;    COLUMN: New piano puts music in home, town in the dark
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to a friend in New Jersey, my son was getting a new
piano. We all rejoiced, because the one he lovingly but awkwardly
played came from the Salvation Army thrift store.
</P>
<P>
   He had to rehabilitate it, with a book on pianos in hand. The
innards of the piano gave him some difficulty, but he was helped by
his sister, who sent the book and persuaded a friend to let her
have ivory covers for the keys, which a previous owner had
slathered with paint.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, it was a make-do piano, but I thought it was
serving pretty well until the musical friend in New Jersey came
through with a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   He had found a marvelous deal on pianos, and, as my daughter,
his former pupil, assured us all, ``Gus really knows pianos. He has
seven or eight of his own _ and if he says this is a deal. ...''
</P>
<P>
   So after some finagling and financial hocus-pocus, the new piano
was on the way. I wished I could be there to greet it because, as I
explained to a friend, it was the greatest excitement in Alford,
Fla., since Mr. Hamp Pickles' old mule was hit by a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement was greater than I knew. The piano was days
getting there. When the driver of the big tractor- trailer called
and said he was ``somewhere north of Dot-ham, Ala.,'' we recognized
that as New Jersey pronunciation of Dothan, the big town nearest
Alford, and called one another on the telephone, silly with
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what Jimmy is doing,'' his sister in Omaha said.
``It's just like we all do when a baby is due. He's waxing the
floor. I swept the driveway all day before my piano from Georgia
arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   I remembered. I washed woodwork and curtains before my last baby
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But the piano ... a brief 43 miles up the road ... ah, the
to-do, ah, the elation, ah, the tumult!
</P>
<P>
   The report I got was secondhand, because I couldn't hang around
Alford any more days and wait for the piano. The big
tractor-trailer arrived on Jimmy's street, a pretty dirt
thoroughfare until a few years ago, and two big strong, amiable men
deftly got the piano off the truck, and into the yard, after
pulling up the gate post. They laid a ramp up the front steps and
suddenly the long-awaited miracle of music was in the house.
</P>
<P>
   My son went out to bid the truckers goodbye and saw there was a
tangle of wires on their rear bumper and a power pole down and
dragging after them. He ran to catch up with them. They stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Their rig had caught a cable and the whole electrical system of
that end of Alford was on the way to New Jersey. The lights were
out _ and so were the town's fire truck, ambulance, police force
and state patrol. So were the neighbors, plunging out of their dark
houses to see what a new piano in town had wrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid the truckers were going to be in trouble,'' Jimmy
told me. ``But it turned out all right. The police said, after all,
they were making an important delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   And how was the piano? Jimmy said it is beautiful, with a sound
</P>
<P>
   so rich and fine it might have appeased the neighbors waiting
for their lights to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   He had to light candles to play it, he said, but by the gentle
candlelight he could discern the name on the case: Steinway.

 NEW YORK: mismatched sarongs. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That volcanic collision of colors and textures appealed
immediately to Miss Roque, who was raised in Alphen aan de Rijn, a
comfortable but uninspiring suburb of Amsterdam. ``I grew up
between the tulips and the cheese,'' she said. ``Everybody has
white curtains in the window, parted in the middle, and a geranium
on the windowsill.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Roque's family, however, rebelled against the prevailing
cultural humdrum. ``In my family, being different is a plus,'' she
said. Her parents furnished their house with butterfly chairs and
an aquarium full of tropical fish. So when Mrs. Brandolini asked
for carte blanche, Miss Roque eagerly acquiesced and left for three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to her apartment, she admitted sheepishly, ``I
freaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The pristine white walls, blameless reflectors of light, had
been upholstered in an almond-green Indian cotton scattered with
tiny deep blue carnations. Lined with ice-blue cotton, the same $62
a yard material _ one of several of Mrs. Brandolini's designs that
are carried at Le Decor Francais, a shop on Lexington Avenue _
curtained every door and window. The blonde floors had gone pale
green, and an aggressive leopard-print sofa lurked in one corner.
The walls of the guest bedroom, lacquered blood red, were in the
midst of being stenciled with 48 larger-than-life-size purple
Siberian irises. (Mrs. Brandolini had found the image in a book
about the botanical drawings of the 16th-century artist Daniel
Rabel and blown it up to dinner-plate proportions.)
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed, Miss Roque issued a stop-work order.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brandolini was nonplused. ``She told me, `Make this
apartment like yours, make it cozy,''' Mrs. Brandolini recalled.
``Well, I did it.'' Alas, one woman's cozy _ curtained doors and
Sensurround patterns _ was another's claustrophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I just went nuts,'' Miss Roque said, laughing. ``But
Muriel just kept at me, convinced me. And you know, after a while,
I went along with it. She's not really a decorator. She's an
artist, and you really can't stop an artist, especially when you
know what they're doing is right.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, Miss Roque realized that her desires for coziness
had been answered, and more subtly than she had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the apartment didn't seem smaller; strangely, with all
the patterns it seemed larger. The patterns diffused the planes of
the rooms, giving them a sort of vaporous unreality that belied the
mathematics of the floor plan. The floor, as green and shimmering
as a rice paddy just recently irrigated, stretched into infinity.
That landscape-like mirage is enhanced, too, by a pair of lacquered
tables _ one candy pink, the other the green of new leaves _ that
Mrs. Brandolini designed to resemble Pop Art waterlilies.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of spindly see-through bookcases rise from floor to
ceiling like stalks of verdigris bamboo, separate the living room
from a small television viewing area. And as for the light that
Miss Roque was afraid of losing to Mrs. Brandolini's lavish
upholstery, it has only been enhanced. Now instead of blaring into
view, it slinks through the curtains like sun through a canopy of
rain-forest trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels right, here in my soul, though I never really gave it
much thought,'' Miss Roque said. ``It's like when I went to
Indonesia for the first time, where my father is from. I knew
nothing about the country but when I stepped off the plane, I felt
like I had come home in some way. I felt very grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, it is the South of France that is on her mind.
In one week, Lauer (who once described himself as ``a geek with an
overbite'') is to meet the entire Roque family for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be wonderful,'' his soon-to-be bride said. ``They will
be crazy about him. He can be such a girl.''

 &HT;    Reconsidering Shoeless Joe: Supporters seek to have the baseball
great inducted into Hall of Fame
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lyn Riddle
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C.-- The folks who leave bats and balls and white
socks on his grave at Woodlawn Memorial Park have not forgotten
Shoeless Joe Jackson. Nor have those who drive past the tidy brick
house where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have the aspiring athletes taken under the legendary
outfielder's wing in those years when he ran a liquor store on the
unrefined side of this northwestern South Carolina city, the years
he spent banished from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They want Jackson inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, an
honor unbestowed because Jackson and seven White Sox teammates were
accused of accepting bribes to intentionally lose the 1919 World
Series. (This year, five will be inducted into the Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 26.)
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame campaign gained strength with the help of
former Red Sox batting ace Ted Williams and Indians pitcher Bob
Feller, both Hall of Fame honorees. They have asked Major League
Baseball to reinstate Jackson. If it does, Jackson is virtually
assured a place in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   To help promote the cause, Jackson's hometown has declared July
to be Joe Jackson Month and has opened an exhibit in the City Hall
lobby detailing Jackson's career.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the greatest natural hitter ever, Jackson's .356
batting average remains the third highest in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In their application to the baseball association, Williams and
Feller argue that Jackson's banishment ended when he died in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for a pardon,'' Williams said. ``We're asking
for a little swing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson started his baseball career at 13 on the dusty sandlot
outside Brandon Mill here. The oldest son among eight, Jackson
started walking down the hill to sweep floors in the mill at age 7.
The family needed his income. He never learned to read or write,
but he learned how to swing a bat.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, baseball was a respite from the
harsh world of the cotton mill. Every mill had a team. Jackson made
some extra cash each game because with every blast over the
outfield fence, his brothers passed a hat in the audience. Many
nights the Jackson boys took home $25, more money than could be
made in the mill in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Jackson was playing for the Greenville Spinners, a minor
league team, and before too long, he was signed by the major league
Philadelphia Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe had a hard time,'' said Joe Anders, one of the young men
Jackson tutored in his retirement. ``He didn't like the North. The
veteran players made fun of him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was traded to the Cleveland Indians and in his rookie season
batted .408, the best average for a first-year player in the
history of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson went to the Chicago White Sox in 1915. The 1919 World
Series scandal remains a much-debated subject. Some say Jackson
admitted he was part of the fix. Others say he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Anders said that as Jackson was dying, he said, ``I'm going to
the greatest umpire of them all and he will know I'm innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would someone say that on his deathbed if it weren't
true?'' said Anders.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the Sox's leading hitter in the eight-game series,
had 12 hits and batted in six runs. But Jackson did admit to having
$5,000 given to him by pitcher Lefty Williams. Jackson was
acquitted but barred from baseball for life.
</P>
<P>
   With a settlement for back pay from Sox owner Charles Comisky,
Jackson returned to the Brandon Mill area and opened a liquor store
and a pool hall in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Anders remembers seeing Jackson standing in the doorjamb at the
little liquor store on Pendleton Street many, many times before the
teenager had the nerve to talk to him. Jackson immediately took an
interest in Anders, who came up the same as him in Brandon Mill
Village. Jackson gave him tips on batting (level swing, eye on the
ball) and fielding (always use two hands). And every so often,
Jackson and his wife, Katie, went out to watch Anders play for the
Greenville Spinners in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Anders ultimately passed up a chance to play for the Brooklyn
Dodgers to stay here and draw a bigger and steadier paycheck
managing and playing textile baseball. Jackson died of heart
disease in 1951 at the age of 63. Anders and seven others lifted
his copper-plated casket through the window of Jackson's Anderson
Street neighborhood home for viewing and stood by as hundreds
flocked to Brandon Baptist Church for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he wasn't Shoeless Joe, country bumpkin. He was still a
baseball legend, Greenville's finest athlete whose dark bat _ Black
Betsy _ rocketed balls into outfields in Brandon and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give something back to Joe, for what he gave me so
long ago,'' said Anders, now 77, of the Hall of Fame effort. ``Joe
Jackson was ridiculed, called illiterate, dumb. He was not dumb. He
was the best there was.''

HOW TO CURE A HANKERING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hankering to visit Arlen?
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Fox's ``King of the Hill'' can tell you all about Arlen,
Texas: Tom Landry Middle School, Mega-Lo Mart, guys with farmer
tans swilling beer in front of their homes, occasionally grunting
``Yup.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Seal of Ruston, La., is such a fan that he created a
chamber-of-commercelike Welcome to Arlen, Texas
(members.tripod.com/\Pbradseal/arlen) page that brings the
fictional suburb to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was created to help people learn about the town where the
TV show takes place,'' Seal said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Arlen, Texas is not quite virtual reality, but it's a
start. Since May 1997, Seal has been building his concept of Arlen,
going so far as to declare himself mayor and name a library for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Arlen, Texas doesn't quite follow the show _ no
Mega-Lo Mart, no Landry Middle School _ but it is one Louisiana
State University football fan's look at Texas life.
</P>
<P>
   Examples are in the Arlen High School profile in the section
about education. Seal writes that acceptable alibis for excused
absences are Dallas Cowboys games or trailer-park accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Texans will point out that the Cowboys play Sundays, Monday
nights, Thanksgiving or the rare Saturday, so that alibi won't fly.

 &HT;    Need a bite? Feed the facts into Web site
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day, ordering dinner over the Internet may be easier than
phoning the pizza joint down the street.
</P>
<P>
   That day is not here yet. Even Tim Glass, president of the
Internet dining service Cybermeals, will admit that.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Seattle-based Cybermeals allows Atlanta computer users
to place takeout or delivery orders for 200metro Atlanta
restaurants. Its roster includes Mellow Mushroom, Mick's and
Takeout Taxi. In the next week, it will add Buckhead Gourmet
Delivery, which serves 65 restaurants from Alpharetta to
Virginia-Highland. Coming soon: Papa John's Pizza and A&AMP;P delis.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, it has signed up 20,000 restaurants and struck
marketing alliances with some big names on the Net, including
America Online, Yahoo! and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Diners register their addresses at the site
and indicate whether they want delivery or takeout. Mapping
software determines which restaurants are nearby and provides a
list of choices, with menus. Orders can be placed immediately or
saved for repeat use.
</P>
<P>
   Once an order is placed, the site sends it to the restaurant by
fax, computer-voiced phone call or computer-to-computer link. The
customer receives an e-mail confirming the order.
</P>
<P>
   To be listed on the site, restaurants pay a fee or a cut of the
sales, generally 5 percent to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering sounds time-consuming, and it can be, depending on
Internet traffic and use of the site itself. When The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution tried the site two months ago, the ordering
process took 25 minutes. More recently, a lunch order for three
took 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants that have signed up with the service say they want
access to a new market. So far, though, reviews are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely still a work in progress, but it seems to be
getting better and better and better,'' says Karen Jacobson of the
Peasant Restaurant Group, owner of the Mick's chain.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty's Barbecue, near Emory University(Ga.), reports only a few
Cybermeals orders so far. ``It's something that's going to take
awhile to catch on,'' says owner Linda Thompson. ``It's not costing
us very much, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckhead Gourmet, which delivers from such restaurants as
Romano's Macaroni Grill, Tanner's and Tom Tom, is counting on
corporate catering to bring in online business. Owner Harris
Tessler isn't sure about other users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to order online is possibly the wave of the
future,'' Tessler says. ``You almost want to talk to a human being
when you place an order, you want to know how it'll be prepared.
... That's the downside of it. The upside of it is, you don't have
to talk to humans.''
</P>
<P>
   You also don't have to take your hands off the keyboard if
you're at work or log off the computer to use the phone if you're
at home. In fact, that's how Glass, who was casting about for an
Internet business, came up with the idea for Cybermeals.
</P>
<P>
   He was watching a Sandra Bullock movie, ``The Net.'' When
Bullock's character ordered a pizza through her computer,
inspiration struck. A business was born.
</P>
<P>
   While Cybermeals works to add restaurants _ 100,000 is the
national target _ and improve its software, it waits for the
convergence of TV and the Internet. When that happens, ordering
online will be as easy as hitting the clicker, Glass believes _ or
thumbing through the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that we're early,'' he says. ``It's starting to
become more useful for people.''

`SHUT UP AND DEAL': GLIMPSES OF THE GAMBLER'S ABYSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse May is a professional poker player. He was so obsessed
with the game that he gave up studying philosophy at the University
of Chicago to play it full time. He loves the game so much that he
has written a novel about it, ``Shut Up and Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But you won't learn much about the fundamentals of poker from
his book. You won't learn technique or the rules of the different
games or how to rank hands. You won't even learn what the following
passage from the novel means: ``I mean I'm on the button in
Pot-Limit Hold'em and there's a $25 live blind out and the action
goes call call call fold call to me. I mean really.'' If you could
ask May what this means, he would probably tell you, ``Shut up and
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his reticence on poker fundamentals is that May
(or rather Mickey, his protagonist) considers playing (not winning)
so easy. Anyone can walk into the poker room of a casino and play.
The dealer will tell him what to do and, if he's still in at the
end, whether what he's holding wins or loses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, May writes: ``Poker is a combination of luck and skill.
People think mastering the skill part is hard, but they're wrong.
The trick to poker is mastering the luck. That's philosophy.
Understanding luck is philosophy, and there are some people who
aren't ever gonna fade it. That's what sets poker apart. And that's
what keeps everyone coming back for more.''
</P>
<P>
   May imparts these lessons by narrating a series of poker bouts
in casinos like Foxwoods in Connecticut and the Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City. They take place in a timeless vacuum in the 1990s,
when poker had been changed by ``a bunch of things'' that happened
in the late 1980s ``all in a row.'' As Mickey describes them: ``The
Mirage, California, here come the Indians. And the invention of
limit Texas Hold'em poker.''
</P>
<P>
   This meant that the typical game went from a private ante-up
get-together of friends around the dining room table, with each
player chipping in for refreshments, to an anonymous gathering of
professionals at 10-man casino tables, with the house taking a cut
of every pot. And the objective changed from fun and relaxation to
busting your opponent's willpower and pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut Up and Deal'' vividly reflects these changes. Instead of
neat examples of play, you get shapeless stories of obsession.
Instead of charming characters amusing one another, you get
borderlines behaving destructively. Instead of guarantees that
poker is fun, you get assurances that the game is ``all about
cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Or about the revelation of some character flaw. ``This guy
Vaughn is like a lot of people who play poker,'' Mickey explains.
``Most of the time they limit themselves to two options: either
they win a little or they lose a lot. Most of this has to do with
ego. They want to be able more than anything to say that they beat
the game. This is why they're happy to take small wins _ hit and
run as it may.''
</P>
<P>
   What holds your attention reading ``Shut Up and Deal'' is the
bleakly cynical prose. ``All I can tell you,'' Mickey advises an
acquaintance who's considering turning pro, ``is that it's lonely
out there, real ... lonely, and your play doesn't matter so much as
how tough you are and whether or not you fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey himself is tough enough to develop systems. He charts his
rate of winning and ponders the talk of mathematicians on the
subject of standard deviations. ``Then I go on a losing streak''
and ``question everything I know about poker _ no, everything I
believe _ and consider giving up and be scared to go in the card
room and not know when to fold or when to raise or when to play or
when to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he arrives at a bedrock truth. ``You can say what you
like. I maintain winning poker is the changing of chaos to order,
of always perceiving order. But everything associated with casinos
and their effect on people has to do with the loss of order,
perceptions of chaos _ no clocks, no windows, free alcohol, bright
lights, bells. It's the same with gambling, the drug produces chaos
_ rapid heartbeat, adrenaline pumping, things moving fast, chips
instead of money, in, out, bad judgment. And it's tough keeping
yourself under tight control night after night, which is why in the
gambling world there's an entire vocabulary for losing control.
Tilt. Going off ... steaming, hot, the bonkers monster.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mickey's narrative, the bonkers monster eventually wins.
Mickey backs a player he admires, lending him $19,000, only to
learn that the player is blowing his mind apart with cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Shut Up and Deal'' is not a romance. It fails to instruct
in the narrow sense of the term. But it offers a glimpse of the
abyss that threatens every gambler, which is that the chaos will
always get you in the end, and that casinos are ``dirty ...
underneath all the glitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that such revelations will discourage the serious poker
addict. As May concludes:
</P>
<P>
   bitterness and denial aren't
</P>
<P>
   realistic ways
</P>
<P>
   to deal
</P>
<P>
   with something that happens again and again
</P>
<P>
   never to know exactly when
</P>
<P>
   but that the only stop is not to play.
</P>
<P>
   but to play
</P>
<P>
   that's the thing.
</P>
<P>
   shut up and deal.

 &HT;    `Baseball failed to keep faith with me'
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Shoeless Joe Jackson / as told to Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Shoeless Joe Jackson talked at length only once
about the Black Sox scandal. His story, as told to Furman Bisher of
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, appeared in the October 1949
issue of Sport magazine; an excerpt is reprinted here. Jackson was
61 at the time and living in his hometown, where he remained an
idol to the local millworkers.
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. -- When I walked out of that courtroom in
Chicago in 1921, I turned my back completely on the World Series of
1919, the Chicago White Sox and the major leagues. I had been
acquitted by a 12-man jury in a civil court of all charges and I
was an innocent man in the records. I have never made any request
to be reinstated in baseball, and I have never made any campaign to
have my name cleared in the baseball records. This is not a plea of
any kind. This is just my story.
</P>
<P>
   If I had been the kind of fellow who brooded when things went
wrong, I probably would have gone out of my mind when Judge Landis
ruled me out of baseball. I would have lived in regret. I would
have been bitter and resentful because I felt I had been wronged.
</P>
<P>
   But I haven't been resentful at all. I thought when my trial was
over that Judge Landis might have restored me to good standing. But
he never did. And to this day I have never gone before him, sent a
representative before him, or placed any written matter before him
pleading my case. I gave baseball my best and if the game didn't
care enough to see me get a square deal, then I wouldn't go out of
my way to get back in it.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball failed to keep faith with me. When I got notice of my
suspension three days before the 1920 season ended _ it came on a
rained-out day _ it read that if found innocent of any wrongdoing,
I would be reinstated. If found guilty, I would be banned for life.
I was found innocent, and I was still banned for life.
</P>
<P>
   It was never explained to me officially, but I was told that
Judge Landis had said I was banned because of the company I kept. I
roomed with Claude Williams, the pitcher, one of the ringleaders,
they told me, and one of the eight White Sox players banned. But I
had to take whoever they assigned to room with me on the road. I
had no power over that.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I'd heard talk that there was something going on. I even
had a fellow come to me one day and proposition me. It was on the
16th floor of a hotel and there were four other people there, two
men and their wives. I told him: ``Why you cheap sonofabitch!
Either me or you is going out that window.''
</P>
<P>
   I started for him, but he ran out the door and I never saw him
again. Those four people offered their testimony at my trial. Oh,
there was so much talk going on those days, but I didn't know
anything was going on.
</P>
<P>
   When the talk got so bad just before the World Series with
Cincinnati, I went to Mr. Charles Comiskey's room the night before
it began, asked him to keep me out of the line-up. Mr. Comiskey was
the owner of the White Sox. He refused, and I begged him, ``Tell
the newspapers you just suspended me for being drunk, or anything,
but leave me out of the Series and then there can be no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Fullerton, the old-time New York sportswriter who's dead
now, was in the room and heard the whole thing. He offered to
testify for me at my trial later, and he came all the way out to
Chicago to do it.
</P>
<P>
   No `say it ain't so, Joe'
</P>
<P>
   I went out and played my heart out against Cincinnati. I set a
record that still stands for the most hits in a Series, though it
has been tied, I think. I made 13 hits, but after all the trouble
came out, they took one away from me. Maurice Rath went over in the
hole and knocked down a hot grounder, but he couldn't make a throw
on it. They scored it as a hit then, but changed it later.
</P>
<P>
   I led both teams in hitting with .375. I hit the only home run
of the Series, off Hod Eller in the last game. I came all the way
home from first on a single and scored the winning run in that 5-4
game. I handled 30 balls in the outfield and never made an error or
allowed a man to take an extra base. I threw out five men at home
and could have had three others if bad cutoffs hadn't been made.
</P>
<P>
   That's my record in the Series, and I was responsible only for
Joe Jackson. I positively can't say that I recall anything out of
the way in the Series; I mean, anything that might have turned the
tide. There was just one thing that doesn't seem quite right, now
that I think back over it. (Eddie) Cicotte seemed to let up on a
pitch to Pat Duncan, and Pat hit it over my head. Duncan didn't
have enough power to hit the ball that far, particularly if Cicotte
had been bearing down.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was a great control pitcher and they made a lot of fuss
over him walking a few men. Swede Risberg missed the bag on a
double play ball at second and they made a lot out of that. But
those are things that might happen to anybody. You just can't say
out and out that that was shady baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the biggest joke of all was that story that got out
about ``say it ain't so, Joe.'' Charley Owens of the Chicago Daily
News was responsible for that, but there wasn't a bit of truth in
it. It was supposed to have happened the day I was arrested in
September of 1920, when I came out from the courtroom hearing.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't any words passed between anybody, except me and a
deputy sheriff. When I came out of the building this deputy asked
me where I was going, and I told him to the Southside. He asked me
for a ride and we got in the car together and left. There was a big
crowd hanging around in front of the building, but nobody else said
anything to me. It just didn't happen, that's all. Charley Owens
just made up a good story and wrote it. Oh, I would have said it
ain't so, all right, just like I'm saying it now.
</P>
<P>
   They write a lot about what a great team the White Sox had that
year. It was a good team; I won't take that away from them. But it
wasn't the same kind of team Mr. Connie Mack had at Philadelphia
from 1910-1914. I think that was the greatest team of all time. Our
team didn't have but two hitters high in the .300's; Mr. Eddie
Collins, as fine a man as there ever was in baseball, and me. It
wasn't a hard-hitting team, not the kind they make out it was.
</P>
<P>
   Bad fish, bad feelings
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you the story behind the whole thing. The trouble was
in the front office. Ban Johnson, the president of the American
League, had sworn he'd get even with Mr. Comiskey a few years
before, and that was how he did it. It was all over some fish Mr.
Comiskey had sent Mr. Johnson from his Wisconsin hunting lodge back
about 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Comiskey had caught two big trout and they were such
beauties he sent them to Mr. Johnson. He packed the fish in ice and
expressed them, but by the time they got to Chicago the ice had
melted and the fish had spoiled. They smelled awful and Mr. Johnson
always thought Mr. Comiskey had deliberately pulled a joke on him.
He never would believe it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   That fish incident was the cause of it all. When Mr. Johnson got
a chance to get even with Mr. Comiskey, he did it. He was the man
who ruled us ineligible. He was the man who caused the thing to go
into the courts. He did everything he could against Mr. Comiskey.
</P>
<P>
   I'll show you how much he had it in for him: I sued Mr. Comiskey
for the salary I had coming to me under the five-year contract I
had with the White Sox. When I won the verdict _ I got only a
little out of it _ the first one I heard from was Mr. Johnson. He
wired congratulations on beating Mr. Comiskey and his son, Louis.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard the story that Mr. Johnson went to Mr. Comiskey on
his deathbed, held out his hand and asked that they let bygones be
bygones. They say Mr. Comiskey turned his head away and refused to
speak to him.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt if I'd have gone back into baseball, anyway, even if
Judge Landis had reinstated me after the trial. I had a good valet
business down in Savannah, Ga., with 22 people working for me, and
I had to look after it. I was away from it about a year waiting for
the trial. They served papers on me, which ordered me not to leave
Illinois. I finally opened up a little place of business at 55th
and Woodlawn, across from the University of Chicago. It was a sort
of pool room and sports center and I got a lot of business from the
university students.
</P>
<P>
   I made my home in Chicago, but I didn't follow orders
completely. I sneaked out of Illinois now and then to play with
semi-pro teams in Indiana and Wisconsin. I always asked my lawyer,
Mr. Benedictine Short, first, and he told me to go if I could get
that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   They kept delaying the trial until I personally went to the
state Supreme Court judge, after which he ordered that the case be
heard. They tried me and Buck Weaver together, and it took seven
weeks. They used three weeks trying to get a jury, and I was on the
witness stand one day and a half. After it was all over, Katie, my
wife, and I went on back to Savannah, settled down there, and lived
there until we came back here to bury my mother in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Big luck after big leagues
</P>
<P>
   I have read now and then that I am one of the most tragic
figures in baseball. Well, maybe that's the way some people look at
it, but I don't quite see that way myself. I guess one of the
reasons I never fought my suspension any harder than I did was that
I thought I had spent a pretty full life in the big leagues. I was
32 years old at the time, and I had been in the majors 13 years; I
had a lifetime batting average of .356; I held the all-time
throwing record for distance, and still do, and I had made pretty
good salaries for those days. There wasn't much left for me in the
big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   All the big sportswriters seemed to enjoy writing about me as an
ignorant cotton mill boy with nothing but lint where his brain
ought to be. That was all right with me. I think it helped me some.
I was able to fool a lot of pitchers and managers and club owners I
wouldn't have been able to fool if they'd thought I was smarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the truth, though. I was a cotton mill boy, and I still
am. I was born and grew up in Brandon Mill Village and I still live
within sight of the mill. You can see it from my back porch. The
papers always used to want to say that I was from Greenville, but I
always made them put down Brandon Mill, and you'll find I was
registered that way back in my playing days.
</P>
<P>
   I guess right here is a good place for me to get the record
straight on how I got to be ``Shoeless Joe.'' I've read and heard
every kind of yarn imaginable about how I got the name, but this is
how it really happened:
</P>
<P>
   When I was with Greenville (of the Carolina Association) in
1908, we only had 12 men on the roster. I was first off a pitcher,
but when I wasn't pitching I played the outfield. I played in a new
pair of shoes one day and they wore big blisters on my feet. The
next day we came up short of players, a couple of men hurt and one
missing. Tommy Stouch was the manager, and he told me I'd just have
to play, blisters or not.
</P>
<P>
   I tried it with my old shoes on and just couldn't make it. He
told me I'd have to play anyway, so I threw away the shoes and went
to the outfield in my stockinged feet. I hadn't put out much until
along the seventh inning I hit a long triple and turned it on. That
was in Anderson, S.C., and the bleachers were close to the
sidelines there. As I pulled into third, some big guy stood up and
hollered: ``You shoeless sonofabitch, you!''
</P>
<P>
   They picked it up and started calling me that all around the
league, and it stuck. I never played the outfield barefooted, and
that was the only day I ever played in my stockinged feet, but it
stuck with me.
</P>
<P>
   After I left the big leagues I kept on playing ball until 1935
in semi-pro leagues. I managed Americus, Ga., and Waycross, Ga., in
what they called the Million Dollar League because of the high
prices they paid the players. I came back to Greenville and ran the
team at Woodside Mill one year, then I went over to Winnsboro,
S.C., in what they called the Cataswa League, and that's where I
finished my playing.
</P>
<P>
   I have been pretty lucky since I left the big leagues. No man
who has done the things they accuse me of could have been as
successful. Everything I touched seemed to turn to money, and I've
made my share down the years. I've been blessed with a good banker,
too, my wife. Handing money to her was just like putting it in the
bank. We were married in 1908 when I was just 19 and she was 15,
and she has stood by me through everything. We never had any
children of our own, but we raised one of my brother's boys from
babyhood.
</P>
<P>
   He never was interested in baseball, but they used to tell me he
would have been a fine football player. He didn't get to go to
college. The war came along and he went into the Navy as a flier.
He was killed accidentally a couple of years ago when a gun he was
cleaning went off. Katie and me felt like we'd lost our own boy.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't been able to do much work for a year before last July
because of liver trouble. A good doctor in Greenville took my case
when I thought my time was about here, and he brought me back to
good health. I went back to my liquor store last July and I'm
running the business now myself. I had leased it out while I was
sick. I've been doing about $50,000 to $100,000 a year business.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might think it's odd, but I still have a connection
in baseball, sort of a judicial connection, I guess you'd call it.
I am chairman of the protest board of the Western Carolina Semi-Pro
League. I think that is an indication of how I stand with my
people. They have stood by me all these years, the folks from my
mill country, and I love them for their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 61 years old now, living quietly and happily out on my
little street close to Brandon Mill. I weighed 186 and stood
6-foot-1 in my playing days. I still weigh about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's my story. I repeat what I said when I started out _
that I have no ax to grind, that I'm not asking anybody for
anything. It's all water over the dam as far as I am concerned. I
can say that my conscience is clear and that I'll stand on my
record in that World Series. I'm not what you call a good
Christian, but I believe in the Good Book, particularly where it
says ``what you sow, so shall you reap.'' I have asked the Lord for
guidance before, and I am sure he gave it to me. I'm willing to let
the Lord be my judge.

 &HT;    Artists find creative outlet fashioning color, texture in their
pieces
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us think art is something you hang on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sister Mary Kay Finneran. For morning prayers, the nun wraps
her shoulders in an earth-toned wool shawl hand-woven by Atlanta
area artist Judith Krone. ``I don't make fashion statements,'' says
Sister Mary Kay. ``When I wear Judith's shawl, it's like being
wrapped in love. People will come up to me and touch it. They want
to feel its texture, which is what a piece of woven art is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Community volunteer Lucy Hutchinson gets the same reaction when
she wears her cotton fly-fishing vest hand-woven and custom-dyed by
Atlanta weaver Lynn Nickerson. ``Everyone's intrigued by the bright
colors,'' she says. ``I love to wear it with jeans and a
turtleneck. It's a timeless piece that I will keep forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone and Nickerson are two of seven Georgia weavers whose
wearable art will be showcased at fashion shows Friday night during
Convergence '98: Rhythms &AMP; Hues, the international weavers'
conference at the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel and Atlanta Market
Center. Juried by Holly Brubach, style editor of The New York Times
Magazine, the show features one-of-a-kind jackets, dresses, coats
and accessories. The weavers hail from 25 states and six countries.
</P>
<P>
   Brubach evaluated 187 photo entries before paring it down to 92.
Her judging criteria? ``Cut, in terms of how the outfit falls on
the body, color, details and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the outfits can be worn, some run the risk of wearing
you,'' Brubach says.
</P>
<P>
   One that falls into the latter category is the 20-pound
``Penny'' dress, a long black strapless gown covered with
double-weave pockets. Pennies were tucked into the pockets by
student weaver Shannon Hamblett of the Kansas City Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Wearable pieces from Georgians include: Linda Jarrett's colorful
cropped suede-and-cotton jacket; Christine Stanton's cranberry wool
tent coat; and Roxanne Brown's green-gold-rust chenille jacket and
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Judging the weavers' work, Brubach says, was educational. ``I
don't know that much about weaving,'' she admits. ``But I sensed
that the weavers were aiming for fashionable garments, not just
pieces of beautiful woven fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, for me, took the clothes to the next level of
sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the weavers sell their creations through referrals or
through small boutiques. Others sell at festivals and art shows.
Individual pieces take two weeks to two months to weave. Prices
range from $200 for a shawl to more than $3,000 for a
special-occasion dress.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Janet Bealer, who's woven for 25 years, compares the
craft to dance. ``Once you start, there's a rhythm,'' she says.
``And it's meditative.''

 &HT;    All ears
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)

<TEXT>
<P>
   You just don't hear, ``Ooh, girl, those earrings are sharp,''
uttered as often or as enthusiastically as you used to.
</P>
<P>
   Close inspection of the latest looks in earwear proves that
``sharp'' doesn't apply at all. The more apt word to describe the
best earring styles out now is ``nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice as in: classy, compact, feminine and fuss-free.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionable ear wear doesn't cry out for attention by virtue of
its size, color or brilliance. Even the gemstone earrings currently
in style now manage to sparkle without screaming to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Factors to consider when choosing additions to your earring
wardrobe include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Does it hug the earlobe, rather than dangle daredevilishly
from it?
</P>
<P>
   -- Is it delicately crafted, or heavy-duty in construction?
</P>
<P>
   -- Are colored gemstones, pearls or crushed diamonds the focal
point of the earrings; or are they merely tried-and-true hoops or
studs?

   Searing heat will intensify over much of the interior West
during the next few days as an unusually strong zone of high
pressure strengthens and expands over the region. Sunshine will be
plentiful in most areas west of the Rockies, except for the
northern Washington coast where some cloud patches will linger.
Afternoon temperatures above 100 degrees will be common in many
valleys from western Colorado to California. A few thunderstorms
will develop along the eastern slopes of the Rockies during the
heat of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The central and southern Plains will stay very warm, but
humidity will be moderate. Most of the region will have a mixture
of sunshine and a few clouds. A stalled front near the Missouri
River will be the focus for scattered strong thunderstorms during
the afternoon and evening. Farther south, a few thunderstorms will
form in the more humid air from central Texas to the western Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   An onshore flow will bring tropical moisture toward the
Southeast coast encouraging clusters of clouds and thundershowers
from the Carolina coast to Florida. Clouds and showers will also
surround weak low pressure from the eastern Tennessee Valley to the
southern Appalachians. Weak high-level winds will result in
slow-moving thunderstorms that can drop copious rain in isolated
areas.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of showers and thunderstorms will develop in the
warm humid air ahead of a front in the interior Northeast. In the
wake of the front, less humid air will spread across the northern
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes States.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Baked Boston
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the hottest day in Boston since March 31. The
mercury rose to 90 degrees, marking the first time this year that
it has surpassed this level. On the final day of March, an
extraordinary spring heat wave brought the temperature to a monthly
record 89 degrees. However, for the last 104 days, the mercury had
not been able to break the 90 degree mark. In a typical summer,
Boston notices readings in the 90s on thirteen occasions. Balmy
breezes from the Southwest have directed the hot air to the New
England coast, but an approaching cool front should curtail the hot
weather on Friday.

DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF MUSIC IS SPREADING

 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sound that could transform the music business is
the quiet click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, anyone with a mid-level computer and an Internet
connection can hear music in a multitude of forms, from radiolike
Webcasts to snippets of songs. Many of those forms are ephemeral
and in low fidelity, intended primarily for promotion. But it is
also possible to download, free or for a price, high-fidelity songs
and full-length albums that can join a permanent collection.
There's no need to visit a store or wait for mail order; in fact,
there's no need ever to handle a compact disk. David Bowie, Tori
Amos, Duran Duran and other well-known groups have released songs
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been sending and receiving music via the
Internet, digital distribution is a harbinger of a future when
recorded music has been freed entirely from physical form. Sold or
disseminated as strings of 1's and 0's rather than disks, music
joins the worldwide flow of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   For enthusiasts, digital distribution presents utopian
possibilities. Freed of the costs of manufacturing and distributing
CDs, digitally distributed music could be cheaper for consumers and
more profitable for musicians. Music could be geared to more
specialized audiences that may be small but widely scattered; a fan
in Helsinki could download tunes from a band in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   More radical changes have also been predicted by some industry
figures. The possibilities include drastically lower prices for
recorded music by all but a commercial elite; other performers
might simply give away songs to promote albums or sell concert
tickets. Musicians could release music in small or large doses as
they see fit, dealing one more blow to the album as pop's standard
artistic unit. Stores could see their role reduced as digital
distribution allows consumers to skip middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, home music collections could become obsolete, as
recorded music becomes available from central archives on demand.
</P>
<P>
   To travel the Internet, music must be turned into a digital
sound file that can be played through a computer. Electronic, or
digital, distribution of music is still the province of a small but
significant group of computer users. At least 5 million software
``players'' in one music format, MP3, have been downloaded, and MP3
is part of the Netshow multimedia package on Windows 98; 3.5
million players in another format, Liquid Audio, have also been
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Because high-fidelity music involves large amounts of digital
information _ a music CD holds 650 megabytes _ transferring music
over the Internet is slow for most computer users; one song can
take a half-hour to download on a typical modem. Noting the
technical obstacles, Jupiter Media, an online market research firm,
has predicted that in five years the market for digitally
downloaded music will be about $30 million, a minuscule percentage
of the $12 billion recorded-music market.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still think it's something that labels should
aggressively pursue,'' said Mark Mooradian, group director of
consumer content for Jupiter Media. He said digital distribution
could be important for its marketing value, to combat piracy and to
reposition labels as retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Already, students and others with access to high-speed
transmission lines have been sending around enough music to alarm
the recording business.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic distribution is a major topic on the agenda at Plug
In '98, a conference on music in the digital era, organized by
Jupiter Media; Andrew Rasiej, founder of Irving Plaza, and Michael
Dorf, owner of the Knitting Factory, that is taking place alongside
the Intel New York Music Festival through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep your head in the sand forever,'' said Thomas
Dolby Robertson, who made new-wave hits in the 1980s and now runs
Headspace, a company that adds soundtracks to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bowie offered a single, ``Telling Lies,'' as a file
that could be downloaded free; even though it took up to 45 minutes
to transfer the five-minute song, 300,000 people downloaded it. But
that was a give away from an internationally known star. Getting
paid for downloaded music has been more difficult, in part because
of the inconvenience of the process and in part because few
well-known performers have made it available.
</P>
<P>
   But the advent of faster home Internet connections, including
cable modems now being tested that can transfer computer data at
rates comparable to the video and sound signals of cable
television, music could be downloaded in seconds rather than
minutes. And on college campuses, and some in high schools, with
fast T-1 lines (special digital telephone connections to the
Internet) students are already trading and copying music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a look at any dorm at Stanford,'' said David
Weekly, an incoming junior majoring in computer science at Stanford
University, ``people are listening more to MP3's than to radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent labels and individual musicians see digital
distribution as a way to deliver music directly to listeners.
``Record companies have a lock right now on how an artist can get
music out to a global audience,'' said Larry Rosen, the chairman of
N2K, which owns the online retail site Music Boulevard as well as
its own N2K label, which makes some of its songs available for
digital downloading. ``With electronic distribution of music,
there's a break in that kind of power structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital distribution allows musicians to make their newest work
available instantly worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesus and Mary Chain, the English band scheduled to perform
Wednesday night at Irving Plaza as part of the Intel New York Music
Festival, planned to record their set and place a live song on the
festival's Internet site (www.intelfest.com) 15 minutes after
leaving the stage. The song was also to be available Thursday at
Tower Records in Manhattan, transferred to a recordable CD and
given as a bonus with the Jesus and Mary Chain's current album.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rasiej and Dorf organized the music festival and have set out to
create the Digital Club Network, which would place cameras and
recorders in clubs around the world. Performances could be
cybercast live or maintained as archives, with royalties going to
clubs and performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of money is insignificant today, but we're building
a new content source,'' Rasiej said. ``You could create a chat
room, collect your old friends from college and watch and
participate in a concert. You might not be able to slam dance
against one another, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Twin-Tone Records, the independent label that introduced the
Replacements and Husker Du to rock fans in the 1980s, has announced
that it will sell all its new releases through the Internet,
preferably through downloading, and will stop manufacturing new CDs
in bulk; downloading a song will cost $1.50, with albums at $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail market isn't what it used to be,'' said Paul Stark,
the president and co-founder of Twin-Tone Records. ``The number of
releases has gone from 3,000 to 25,000 or 30,000, all competing for
the same shelf space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wholesale a CD for $10, I'll only see about $3 of that
after mailing, returns and advertising,'' Stark explained. ``It
costs me about $1 to manufacture the CD and the group gets $2 in
royalties, which leaves me about 10 or 15 cents. On the Internet,
with no manufacturing or distributing costs, I can cut my sales to
a quarter of what they were and still come out ahead. The economic
model of the recording industry is changing very quickly, and the
Internet is the only future we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Geiger, the founder of Artist Direct, a company that offers
some downloadable music through the Ultimate Band List Web site,
said: ``You might be able to lease music for a certain amount of
listenings, like a jukebox. You might pay a different amount to own
it for an unlimited number of listenings. Or you might have an
arrangement like cable television, where you pay $29.95 to an
aggregater and listen to most of the music you want for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores won't be directly threatened by digital distribution for
some time. Still, the prospect of consumers getting music delivered
instantly at home, without visiting a store, is not a happy
prospect for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me is scared because we don't own any content,'' said
Mike Farrace, vice president for publishing at Tower Records. ``We
are not intellectual property holders; we are brokers and agents
and aggregaters. But I don't see digital distribution taking over.
I can see it becoming a component, absolutely no doubt about it.
The art for us is, How do we incorporate this into the business?''
</P>
<P>
   When Capitol Records announced that it would sell a Duran Duran
single, ``Electric Barbarella,'' over the Internet, retailers
protested, worrying that they were being bypassed. The song was
made available simultaneously at stores and as a digital download,
with one remix available only from the Internet. ``We expect to
have digital distribution be a piece of the pie, not to cause
retail to disappear,'' said Liz Heller, executive vice president
for Capitol Records.
</P>
<P>
   Major labels, which own manufacturing plants, warehouses and
trucks and invest heavily to shape the careers of musicians, are
wary of digital distribution. As with all new technologies for
transferring and copying music, they see the possibility of
widespread piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of digital distribution is the huge market that you
have access to, which you can market and promote to in different
ways,'' said Frank Creighton, senior vice president and director of
investigations for the Recording Industry Association of America,
the trade association that represents the larger recording
companies.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to electronic distribution, he said, the labels
are ``moving with some trepidation in light of the fact that
currently the majority of uses of distributed sound files are
unauthorized. Right now, there is no set standard as to how these
sound files are going to be distributed, protected and
controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three main technologies for digital distribution of
music: Liquid Audio, AT&AMP;T's a2b and MP3. Liquid Audio and a2b are
favored by companies that are worried about unauthorized copying.
In both the music is encrypted so that it can be played back only
by an authorized user and it is watermarked so that its source can
be traced; every download is registered, and royalties can be
deducted. Liquid Audio allows a buyer to copy the music once onto a
recordable CD; a2b does not.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burnett, the vice president of marketing for Liquid Audio,
said that there are about 10,000 songs available on the Internet in
the Liquid Audio format, and that the company will soon establish
the Liquid Music Network, a widely linked Web site that will hold
100,000 songs from independent labels including Rykodisc, Rounder
and Platinum Entertainment, for $1.50 to $2 a song.
</P>
<P>
   N2K, which sells CDs and tapes through mail order online as
Music Boulevard, offers songs from its N2K label in a format it
calls e-mod, using Liquid Audio; Twin-Tone also uses Liquid Audio.
In the year that N2K's system has been in operation, fewer than
10,000 people have downloaded the songs for 99 cents each, said
Rosen on N2K.
</P>
<P>
   But the available songs have been by little-known musicians. N2K
has just signed David Stewart, formerly of the Eurythmics; he plans
to release his next album in downloadable form on the Internet
before it appears in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MP3, which is short for MPEG Audio Layer 3, can
create endless generations of digital copies once a piece of music
has been encoded as an MP3 file. Portable MP3 players, separate
from home computers, are being manufactured. And MP3 files can be
created from any piece of recorded music through encoders, called
rippers, that are downloadable from many Web sites. The combination
has led to an extensive Internet traffic in MP3 songs.
</P>
<P>
   The recording-industry association considers any unlicensed
copying to be piracy. It recently tracked down someone selling the
entire recorded works of the Beatles, compressed into MP3 files on
a single CD-ROM disk, and it has been working to shut down Internet
sites offering large numbers of songs as MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   A new company, Goodnoise, plans to sell songs as MP3 files for
99 cents each. ``Fans don't have access to legitimate content on
MP3,'' said Gene Hoffman, the president and chief executive of
Goodnoise. ``MP3 is never going to go away, the technology is there
and available, and you might as well make it easier to buy it than
to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   But in most MP3 uses, no money changes hands. In 1996, Weekly
used Stanford's computer to offer about 200 songs as MP3 files. ``I
put it up, told a few people about it and it just exploded,'' he
said. ``We were not pirates, we were certainly not making money
from this; we just thought it was a great technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was online for a week and a half before record-company
representatives called Stanford and had it shut down. ``On the last
day,'' Weekly said, ``Stanford network services told me that 80
percent of outgoing bandwidth was my music. It shows that Internet
music wants to happen, in whatever form, and there are people out
there who are ready for it.''

 &HT;    PANEL URGES CAUTION TO AVOID MICROBES FROM SPACE
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plans by the U.S. space agency to retrieve samples
from the surface of Mars and other places in the solar system must
include strict precautions to avoid contaminating the Earth with
extraterrestrial microbes, the National Academy of Sciences said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although an academy committee of biologists and astronomers said
the risk of encountering ``living entities'' on some asteroids and
in interplanetary dust particles appear to be negligible, it warned
of ``a significant potential'' that life forms could be found in
samples from two of Jupiter's moons.
</P>
<P>
   And too little is known about some asteroids to rule out the
possibility that biohazards exist there, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the committee said it had a ``high degree of
confidence'' that no special containment and handling are warranted
for material from the Earth's moon, Jupiter's moon, Io, and certain
types of comets.
</P>
<P>
   With less confidence, the committee said no special containment
practices were necessary for the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos,
Jupiter's moon Callisto and material from still other classes of
asteroids, comets and space dust.
</P>
<P>
   The committee repeated advice from an earlier report that while
it thought it unlikely that Martian soil samples would contain
living organisms, the possibility cannot be ruled out and the
material should be handled as though they were ``potentially
hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also said the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) needs to collect data on environments where
some of Earth's toughest microbes are able to survive in order to
better assess the chances of survival in space.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has scheduled four missions aimed at retrieving material
from elsewhere in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Stardust,'' to be launched next year, would visit the comet
Wild-2 (pronounced ``vilt-two''), when it is 242 million miles from
the Earth to take pictures and try to snag about 1,000 grains of
the dust that swirls around it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Genesis,'' which would attempt to trap charged particles
that make up ``solar wind,'' would be launched in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``MUSES-C,'' a collaboration between NASA and the Japanese
space agency, would land a tiny craft on the asteroid 4660 Nereus
and attempt to catch material kicked up when pellets are fired into
the surface. The craft would be launched in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A mission to Mars planned for 2005 would attempt to retrieve a
sample of the Martian soil.
</P>
<P>
   NASA spokesman Don Savage said that although ``there have been
discussions'' inside the agency of possible missions to retrieve
material from Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, none has been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Indications that Europa may be surrounded by a relatively thin
sheet of ice overlaying a deep ocean, along with the fact that
gravitational stresses from Jupiter may give it heat, suggest that
two of the main conditions for life exist there, the committee
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended that samples from Europa, its fellow
moon Ganymede and some asteroids be treated with the same
precautions it recommended for material and spaceships returning
from Mars. They are that no uncontained material, including
spacecraft surfaces exposed to the Martian environment, be returned
to Earth until it had been sterilized en route.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Orgel, a research professor at the Salk Institute in San
Diego, Calif., and chairman of the committee, said in an interview
that if material were returned to earth from Europa, a body only
slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, it should be handled
``extremely carefully.''

   CZAR-ROYALTY _ PETROVSKOYE, Russia _ This heir to Russian
royalty lives in a palace without a roof, with no windows and the
plumbing shot on an estate strewn with garbage. His government says
he has no legal claim to the property no matter what his last name.
Still, Yevgeny Meshchersky, 47, a former engineer in a ceramics
factory, remains wedded to his land and vows to restore the family
estate to its former elegance. Since the Soviet Union disintegrated
in 1991, royalty has made a half-hearted comeback in Russia,
seeking to reassert its legal rights and property taken in the
Bolshevik revolution of 1917. The lot of the Russian nobility and
their descendants has gained renewed attention with this week's
(Fri. July 17) burial of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his
family. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   SAN IGNACIO, Belize _ Pricey coffee and sleek hardware, enjoyed
by high-tech cognoscenti? Forget it. At Eva's cybercafe in San
Ignacio, Belize, the clientele is frayed; the machines are
weather-beaten, and _ as befits a frontier outpost _ the
refreshment of choice is beer, and plenty of it.
</P>
<P>
   But then, San Ignacio is hardly Silicon Alley. Just 10 miles
from the Guatemalan border, it is the last major town (pop. 7,100)
in Central America's least densely populated nation. Eva's cafe,
although no one seems to remember for whom it was named, has been a
San Ignacio fixture for nearly two decades _ a traditional meeting
place for weary backpackers on transcontinental walkabouts,
archaeologists excavating ruins in the jungles that surround the
town and grizzled expatriates far removed from their native lands.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones, 47, a former British army sergeant who is the
proprietor of Eva's, falls into the last category. But in the past
few months, he has seen his ragged bar become a destination for a
new clientele: cyberjunkies. In 1997, he installed a pair of
secondhand 486 computers. Soon, along with a Beliken (Belize's
national beer) and a place to sit, Jones' customers would drop by
for a quick e-mail fix before disappearing into the wild. Then, an
unexpected clientele emerged: local Belizeans, coming from remote
villages _ many with no phones or electricity _ began using the
cybercafe to correspond with friends and business connections all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   On a day last spring, Jones collected a half-hour's usage fee
from a New York computer technician who had just sent 10 rapid-fire
e-mail postcards _ cutting and pasting the same message into each _
to friends back home. In the tourist season, there is often a line
out the door. Customers line up above an open concrete sewer
channel, waiting to pay $8 an hour for a turn at one of Jones'
terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know a thing about computers,'' said Jones, who is
perpetually unshaven and has kept his Cockney accent despite 16
years in Belize. ``What I knew about was guns.''
</P>
<P>
   In Eva's earlier days, that was a useful skill. Jones bought the
cafe in 1982, a year after Belize's independence (it had been a
British colony), and his first job was to evict a regular clientele
that was, as Jones puts it, ``not so charming,'' mostly town drunks
and some ill-tempered post-colonials.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Jones began to offer advice to travelers passing through
the town, arranging trips to Tikal, the ruined Mayan city just over
the Guatemalan border, for example, or recommending local hotels.
Most customers stayed for a drink, or a meal, often stopping back
several times as they crisscrossed the country. Over the years,
Jones added a small souvenir stand and an outdoor patio.
</P>
<P>
   In this corner of Belize, Internet access came largely by
chance. An army buddy of Jones, David Cryer, needed work and, being
technically inclined, suggested a trial online run, with the
profits split 50-50. Jones and Cryer bought the computers from
businessmen who had spent some time in Belize and did not want to
haul the machines they had brought into the country back home.
Cryer has since become the town's cyberguru, maintaining the
computers at Eva's and finessing the relationship between the bar
and Belize's moody telephone monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In the year or so since the computers arrived, Eva's has come to
resemble nothing less than a plugged-in analog to a Wild West
outpost, where residents of vast territories stumble in _ daily,
once a week, every month _ to pick up mail and have a few drinks.
Four times daily, Jones prints out up to 125 pages of messages
addressed to a special general delivery account; the notes are
sorted into folders. Urgent communications are hand-delivered by
four-wheel drive into the bush. Customers pay about 25 cents to 50
cents per page.
</P>
<P>
   On a Tuesday afternoon last spring, the temperature was around
100, nobody was on the street, and a daisy chain of clattering fans
tried in vain to push air around the bar. Gonzalo Pleitez, 24,
tapped furiously at one of Eva's machines. Pleitez had just rumbled
in from his family farm on the Vaca plateau, 20 miles away, in his
1986 Toyota pickup. His message is to an online friend in Long
Beach, Calif. _ a marketing executive with Walt Disney Co. _ who
gives Pleitez informal advice about promoting tours to an ancient
cave on his property.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Pleitez's older brother, William Gonzalez _
members of the family are native Maya Mopan, indigenous to this
part of Belize _ was hunting in the forest when his dog disappeared
into a hole in the ground. Peering in, Gonzalez realized he had
stumbled onto the entrance to a cave 1,000 feet deep. Inside was a
treasure trove of hundreds of intact examples of pre-Columbian
Mayan pottery. The family has been working with preservation
officials to keep the cave intact and open it to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Pleitez says, is the final component in achieving
that goal. He rattled off a list of benefits: education for himself
and his brother; running water and electricity at the farm, which
currently has neither; better health care for Gonzalez's 7-year-old
daughter; the ability to book visits to the property directly,
instead of through outside agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts more control into our hands,'' Pleitez said. As he
signed off, Terry Powis, 33, a Canadian, arrived. He had just come
in from Cahal Pech, a 2,000-year-old Mayan city under excavation,
where he is field director for the Belize Valley Archaeological
Reconnaissance project. He has a list of things to do: pick up
supplies, visit a few local associates and get on line to
straighten out a student loan billing mess that he has just learned
of back in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He sips a Beliken and waits his turn. Powis has been working in
Belize for 10 years. Eva's has radically changed the way his 35
archaeological staff members, most of them from the United States,
live their lives in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot revolves around our visits here,'' Powis said. ``We've
had romances and breakups, family emergencies and financial
crises,'' he said. Noting that old-fashioned postal mail takes two
weeks to reach the United States and direct-dial phone calls cost
$5 a minute, Powis explains that without Eva's Net connection, ``we
probably wouldn't be communicating at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones wants to usher Eva's customers even further into the
online revolution. Next, he says, is the building of Web sites. The
evening of Powis' visit, Cryer held a meeting to familiarize local
businesses with the Web. The cafe was crowded with visitors from 30
miles around. It was an enthusiastic crowd, but one thing struck
Jones as odd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first night I've ever sold more coffee than beer,''
he said.

 By SCOTT MORRISON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TORONTO _ Scotiabank's foray into Latin America has been
something of a rude awakening for Chairman Peter Godsoe. The bank
got off to a poor start in the region in the early 1990s when it
acquired an 8.4 percent interest in Mexico's Grupo Financiero
Inverlat for US$110 million. Scotiabank got two seats out of 50 on
its partner's board, leaving the Canadian bank with virtually no
voice.
 &HT;    To make matters worse, the quality of Inverlat's outstanding
loan portfolio became all too apparent following the 1994 Mexican
peso crisis, forcing the bank to write off its investment. The bank
spent millions of dollars more and now has a 55 percent share. In
Argentina, the bank found itself in a similar situation when it
took full ownership of Banco Quilmes last year in order to
recapitalize it. The bank's experience in both countries exposed
many of the pitfalls foreign bankers face in the region. And the
Bank of Nova Scotia, widely known as Scotiabank, certainly learned
its lesson, says Godsoe, 60, who has been chairman since 1995. He
joined the bank in 1966.
 &HT;    Lesson number one: Scotiabank will move more aggressively to
gain control of its acquisitions, or, at the very least, have
substantial influence over its partners. Such a strategy may have
given the bank enough time to fully review Inverlat's outstanding
loans and corrected problems prior to the bank imploding, says
Godsoe. Lesson number two: Scotiabank will insist on conducting
more extensive due diligence of prospective partners. The strategy
was put into practice recently when the bank backed away from
acquiring Banco Bandeirantes because the Brazilian bank would not
meet Scotiabank's terms.
 &HT;    The painful, costly lessons learned in Latin America have not
soured the bank's taste for doing business in the region, says
Godsoe, who says the Brazilian banking market remains top priority.
Godsoe says he will focus on closing a ``do-able'' deal at the
right price, even if it means again taking a minority position. But
it would insist on an arrangement enabling it to increase its
investment over time.
 &HT;    Analysts say the time Scotiabank spent learning its lesson may
have cost them precious market share. Spanish competitors Santander
and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya are spending billions in acquisitions,
placing them as leaders in several Latin American markets. In
comparison, Scotiabank has invested $750 million to acquire
holdings in seven Latin American countries.
 &HT;    Industry observers say niche markets exist for smaller
institutions specializing in corporate banking or wealth
management, but only the top five retail banks in each market will
thrive. Not so, says Godsoe. ``You can do very well even if you are
not number one or two because you get higher spreads and strong
growth (in Latin America),'' says Godsoe.
 &HT;    Godsoe remains confident, citing recent policy reforms, reduced
government intervention, increased domestic savings and a vastly
under-banked market. He notes that in Argentina, for example, only
25 percent of the population even has a bank account, meaning that
plenty of opportunities exist to grow.
 &HT;    Godsoe expects Latin American revenues to grow by about 15
percent annually, adjusted for inflation, due to rapid growth and
the financial sector's unfulfilled market potential. Such
expectations are important because Scotiabank derives about half of
its profits from overseas business. Latin America also has become
all the more important to the bank in the wake of two proposed
Canadian bank mergers. One other criticism of the bank is that it
has failed to demonstrate a coherent regional strategy similar to
that taken by it Spanish competitors, who have launched uniform
franchises throughout Latin America. Godsoe argues that unlike
investment banking and the credit card business, retail banking is
essentially a national business that varies from country to
country. He says Scotiabank's red S-shaped logo will slowly appear
throughout the region once it is confident that its subsidiaries,
or partners, can deliver quality service. ``What we are trying to
do is put down roots. We're a Chilean bank in Chile and a Peruvian
bank in Peru,'' says Godsoe.
 &HT;    To critics who disagree with the bank's ``deliberate'' approach,
Godsoe says it will take time to see if the roots planted by
Scotiabank will take hold and flourish. ``Only in the long, long
run will we know,'' he says.

<P>
   ``GodStories''
</P>
<P>
   By H. Stephen Shoemaker
</P>
<P>
   Judson Press, $16
</P>
<P>
   Depicted on the cover of H. Stephen Shoemaker's ``GodStories''
is a statue of the prophet Elijah. But the cover could have used a
drawing of a sack of oranges and lemons _ a mixed bag, in other
words, for that is what the book sometimes is.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth minister's latest work explores some of the
best-known tales and personalities of the Bible. Shoemaker can
provide exquisite bits of insight or commentary; he notes, for
instance, that like the ancients, we have our Baal worship: ``It is
the religion of success (if it works _ do it), self (if it serves
me _ do it), and sensuality (if it feels good _ do it), that is, of
pragmatism, egoism, and the pleasure principle.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``GodStories'' is also prone to the occasional statement
that is questionable at best: that Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness
were ``a kind of `vision quest,' '' for instance, or that ``God not
only understood what Tamar (who seduced her father-in-law, Judah)
had to do to survive; he called her righteous. She had done nothing
evil in the sight of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   There are good things to be found in ``GodStories.'' Just be
sure to sort the fruit carefully.

   ``Keep Your Mind on Jesus''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mass Choir
</P>
<P>
   CGI Records
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the Chicago Mass Choir has established
itself as one of the better mass choirs in the country, mainly by
standing true to traditional sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The old school gospel styles are still here on this, the group's
latest CD, but there are more modern touches _ and mainly to the
good. ``Keep Your Mind on Jesus'' is a strong CD, one that can
appeal to both older and younger gospel fans, although the former
will probably enjoy it a bit more, as some of the more modern
touches (synthesizers draped everywhere, funk bass lines) come off,
at times, as just a touch underwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The choir's strengths, however, outweigh these slight glitches.
The vocal arrangements are sure, and the group does an uncommonly
good job of picking the right lead vocalist for a given song:
Shanta McSwain, for example, provides just the right mix of
understatement and fire for the opener, ``I Promised the Lord,''
and Teddy Campbell's big, rich pipes give the stomping,
traditional, organ-driven ``Keep Your Mind on Jesus'' the kick it
needs.

 Por SCOTT MORRISON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TORONTO _ La incursion de Scotiabank en America Latina ha sido
una especie de despertar brusco para el presidente del directorio,
Peter Godsoe. El banco tuvo un mal estreno en la region a
principios de los anos 90, cuando adquirio un interes del 8.4 por
ciento en el Grupo Financiero Inverlat, de Mexico, por US$110
millones. Scotiabank obtuvo dos asientos de los 50 de la junta
directiva, con lo que el banco canadiense quedo practicamente sin
voz.
 &HT;    Para empeorar las cosas, la calidad de la cartera de prestamos
por cobrar de Inverlat se hizo muy evidente con la crisis del peso
de 1994, que obligo al banco a cancelar su inversion. El banco ha
invertido millones mas y ahora tiene una participacion del 55 por
ciento. En Argentina se hallo en una situacion similar cuando
adquirio la propiedad total del Banco Quilmes el ano pasado con el
fin de recapitalizarlo.
 &HT;    La experiencia del banco en ambos paises expuso muchos escollos
que los banqueros extranjeros enfrentan en la region. Y Bank of
Nova Scotia, mas conocido como Scotiabank, aprendio la leccion,
dice Godsoe, ejecutivo de 60 anos que es presidente del directorio
desde 1995.
 &HT;    La primera leccion: Scotiabank procurara mas activamente obtener
el control de sus adquisiciones o, por lo menos, ejercer una
influencia sustancial sobre sus socios. Esa estrategia puede
haberle dado tiempo suficiente para revisar completamente los
prestamos por cobrar de Inverlat y corregir los problemas antes que
el banco se desplome, dice Godsoe.
 &HT;    La segunda leccion: Scotiabank insistira en hacer una diligencia
debida mas amplia de los posibles socios. La estrategia se puso
recientemente en practica cuando el banco decidio no adquirir Banco
Bandeirantes porque la entidad brasilena no cumplia con los
terminos de Scotiabank.
 &HT;    Las penosas y costosas lecciones aprendidas en America Latina no
han cambiado la decision del banco de hacer negocios en la region,
indica Godsoe, al afirmar que el mercado bancario brasileno se
mantiene entre las prioridades de Scotiabank.
 &HT;    Godsoe dice que se concentrara en cerrar un acuerdo al precio
correcto, aunque ello signifique aceptar de nuevo una participacion
minoritaria. Pero reiterara su deseo de lograr un acuerdo que les
permita aumentar su inversion a largo plazo.
 &HT;    Los analistas dicen que el tiempo que Scotiabank paso
aprendiendo la leccion puede haberle costado una valiosa
participacion de mercado. Los competidores espanoles Santander y
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya gastan miles de millones en adquisiciones, lo
que los situa como lideres en varios mercados latinoamericanos. En
cambio, Scotiabank ha invertido US$750 millones en la adquisicion
de valores en siete paises latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Los observadores del sector dicen que hay mercados de nicho para
instituciones menores especializadas en banca empresarial o en
administracion de patrimonios, pero que solo prosperaran los cinco
mayores bancos minoristas de cada mercado.
 &HT;    No es cierto, responde Godsoe. ``A uno le puede ir muy bien
aunque no sea el numero uno ni el dos porque en America Latina se
consiguen margenes mas altos y un crecimiento vigoroso,'' apunta.
 &HT;    Godsoe justifica su confianza con las recientes reformas, la
reduccion de la intervencion estatal, mayores indices nacionales de
ahorro y un mercado con pocos servicios bancarios. Y en Argentina,
donde solo el 25 por ciento de la poblacion tiene una cuenta de
banco, ese cambio ofreceria grandes oportunidades.
 &HT;    Godsoe espera que los ingresos latinoamericanos de Scotiabank
crezcan un 15 por ciento al ano, ajustados a la inflacion, debido
al crecimiento rapido y al potencial de mercado del sector
financiero. Esas expectativas son importantes porque casi la mitad
de los ingresos de Scotiabank provienen de sus operaciones en el
extranjero. La importancia de America Latina para el banco tambien
ha aumentado por dos propuestas fusiones de bancos canadienses.
 &HT;    Otra critica es que no ha mostrado una estrategia regional
coherente similar a la de sus rivales espanoles, que han lanzado
franquicias uniformes en toda Latinoamerica. Godsoe alega que a
diferencia de la banca de inversion y del negocio de las tarjetas
de credito, la banca minorista es basicamente un negocio que varia
de pais en pais. Dice que el logo rojo en forma de S de Scotiabank
aparecera lentamente en toda la region a medida que aumente su
confianza en que sus filiales o asociados puedan brindar un
servicio de calidad.
 &HT;    ``Tratamos de echar raices en cada pais. En Chile somos un banco
chileno y en Peru, un banco peruano,'' explica Godsoe.
 &HT;    A los criticos que no concuerdan con el enfoque ``deliberado''
del banco, Godsoe les responde que hace falta tiempo para ver si
las raices que ha echado Scotiabank se afianzan y fortalecen.
 &HT;    ``Solo el tiempo dira,'' concluye.

 &HT;    TORONTO _ La incursion de Scotiabank en America Latina ha sido
una especie de despertar brusco para el presidente del directorio,
Peter Godsoe. El banco tuvo un mal estreno en la region a
principios de los anos 90, cuando adquirio un interes del 8.4 por
ciento en el Grupo Financiero Inverlat, de Mexico, por US$110
millones. Scotiabank obtuvo dos asientos de los 50 de la junta
directiva, con lo que el banco canadiense quedo practicamente sin
voz.
 &HT;    Para empeorar las cosas, la calidad de la cartera de prestamos
por cobrar de Inverlat se hizo muy evidente con la crisis del peso
de 1994, que obligo al banco a cancelar su inversion. El banco ha
invertido millones mas y ahora tiene una participacion del 55 por
ciento. En Argentina se hallo en una situacion similar cuando
adquirio la propiedad total del Banco Quilmes el ano pasado con el
fin de recapitalizarlo.
 &HT;    La experiencia del banco en ambos paises expuso muchos escollos
que los banqueros extranjeros enfrentan en la region. Y Bank of
Nova Scotia, mas conocido como Scotiabank, aprendio la leccion,
dice Godsoe, ejecutivo de 60 anos que es presidente del directorio
desde 1995.
 &HT;    La primera leccion: Scotiabank procurara mas activamente obtener
el control de sus adquisiciones o, por lo menos, ejercer una
influencia sustancial sobre sus socios. Esa estrategia puede
haberle dado tiempo suficiente para revisar completamente los
prestamos por cobrar de Inverlat y corregir los problemas antes que
el banco se desplome, dice Godsoe.
 &HT;    La segunda leccion: Scotiabank insistira en hacer una diligencia
debida mas amplia de los posibles socios. La estrategia se puso
recientemente en practica cuando el banco decidio no adquirir Banco
Bandeirantes porque la entidad brasilena no cumplia con los
terminos de Scotiabank.
 &HT;    Las penosas y costosas lecciones aprendidas en America Latina no
han cambiado la decision del banco de hacer negocios en la region,
indica Godsoe, al afirmar que el mercado bancario brasileno se
mantiene entre las prioridades de Scotiabank.
 &HT;    Godsoe dice que se concentrara en cerrar un acuerdo al precio
correcto, aunque ello signifique aceptar de nuevo una participacion
minoritaria. Pero reiterara su deseo de lograr un acuerdo que les
permita aumentar su inversion a largo plazo.
 &HT;    Los analistas dicen que el tiempo que Scotiabank paso
aprendiendo la leccion puede haberle costado una valiosa
participacion de mercado. Los competidores espanoles Santander y
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya gastan miles de millones en adquisiciones, lo
que los situa como lideres en varios mercados latinoamericanos. En
cambio, Scotiabank ha invertido US$750 millones en la adquisicion
de valores en siete paises latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Los observadores del sector dicen que hay mercados de nicho para
instituciones menores especializadas en banca empresarial o en
administracion de patrimonios, pero que solo prosperaran los cinco
mayores bancos minoristas de cada mercado.
 &HT;    No es cierto, responde Godsoe. ``A uno le puede ir muy bien
aunque no sea el numero uno ni el dos porque en America Latina se
consiguen margenes mas altos y un crecimiento vigoroso,'' apunta.
 &HT;    Godsoe justifica su confianza con las recientes reformas, la
reduccion de la intervencion estatal, mayores indices nacionales de
ahorro y un mercado con pocos servicios bancarios. Y en Argentina,
donde solo el 25 por ciento de la poblacion tiene una cuenta de
banco, ese cambio ofreceria grandes oportunidades.
 &HT;    Godsoe espera que los ingresos latinoamericanos de Scotiabank
crezcan un 15 por ciento al ano, ajustados a la inflacion, debido
al crecimiento rapido y al potencial de mercado del sector
financiero. Esas expectativas son importantes porque casi la mitad
de los ingresos de Scotiabank provienen de sus operaciones en el
extranjero. La importancia de America Latina para el banco tambien
ha aumentado por dos propuestas fusiones de bancos canadienses.
 &HT;    Otra critica es que no ha mostrado una estrategia regional
coherente similar a la de sus rivales espanoles, que han lanzado
franquicias uniformes en toda Latinoamerica. Godsoe alega que a
diferencia de la banca de inversion y del negocio de las tarjetas
de credito, la banca minorista es basicamente un negocio que varia
de pais en pais. Dice que el logo rojo en forma de S de Scotiabank
aparecera lentamente en toda la region a medida que aumente su
confianza en que sus filiales o asociados puedan brindar un
servicio de calidad.
 &HT;    ``Tratamos de echar raices en cada pais. En Chile somos un banco
chileno y en Peru, un banco peruano,'' explica Godsoe.
 &HT;    A los criticos que no concuerdan con el enfoque ``deliberado''
del banco, Godsoe les responde que hace falta tiempo para ver si
las raices que ha echado Scotiabank se afianzan y fortalecen.
 &HT;    ``Solo el tiempo dira,'' concluye.

SPECULATING ON SCIENCE, HITLER AND THE BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 19)  
 (JT)  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Why did Werner Heisenberg, the German who formulated
the uncertainty principle, pay a visit to Niels Bohr, the Dane who
made key discoveries in quantum theory, in the occupied Copenhagen
of 1941? A layman might think this the sort of topic that
history-of-science students come up with when their search for a
doctoral thesis is getting desperate. Yet the meeting of the two
Nobel Prize-winning physicists could help explain why you and I are
not now living in a world controlled by Son of Hitler and his
cybernetic Gestapo. It certainly supplies Michael Frayn with the
material for one of the boldest, meatiest plays the Royal National
Theater has staged this decade: ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Frayn has been creatively quietish in the 1990's, but he had his
successes in the previous two decades, notably with the sublimely
funny ``Noises Off,'' which crossed the Atlantic in 1984 to
brighten a notably gloomy Broadway season. That's a farce about a
touring theater company's attempts to perform a nonsensical but
technically demanding piece of dramatic knockabout, and, on the
face of it, is about as different as could be from ``Copenhagen,''
which is a dryly witty but ultimately somber post-mortem on
Heisenberg and his possibly deliberate failure to develop an A-bomb
for the German war machine. Yet there are moments even in ``Noises
Off'' when Frayn hints at what has always been his overriding
theme: our feverish, frantic, invariably frustrated efforts to
bring order to the world's chaos and give shape to its confusions.
That's the idea at the very core of ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a philosophical play, then, but it's not dry, not
impersonal and, despite a forbidding set, not abstract. True, Peter
J. Davison has transformed the Cottesloe auditorium into a blend of
debating chamber, physics lab and war crimes tribunal, with part of
the audience sitting like jurors behind actors who pace a spare
white circle. True, mesons, protons, cyclotrons and names like
Wirtz, Diebner, Houtermanns and Pauli drop as easily from the
scientists' lips as talk of ``Titanic'' and Leonardo DiCaprio does
from Hollywood groupies. But the emotional stakes for the two main
characters are high, since Bohr was Heisenberg's mentor, surrogate
father and, after that fateful meeting in 1941, estranged
ex-colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Since Heisenberg was also the head of Hitler's nuclear program,
the future of the planet is an issue too, which is about as high as
stakes can reasonably get. Intellectually taxing though the piece
can be, it is more engrossing than Tom Stoppard's 1988 play
``Hapgood,'' which drew jokey analogies between the behavior of
particles in quantum mechanics and the similar unpredictability of
Le Carre-style spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copenhagen'' _ already seen for several performances in the
United States in June as part of the International Festival of Arts
and Ideas in New Haven _ occurs in the future. However, the
dialogue veers between past and present tenses as Matthew Marsh's
wan, tense Heisenberg, David Burke's genial but wary Bohr and Sara
Kestelman's tough, spiky Mrs. Bohr remember, argue and revisit key
events from the limbo they now inhabit. These restless shades want
to make sense of all that preceded and followed their meeting in
1941, and, Frayn being Frayn, there are more questions than
answers. It seems to be common ground that Heisenberg asked Bohr if
it was ethical to exploit atomic energy and that Bohr speedily
terminated the conversation. But what was the German's aim in
raising the subject and what else was said?
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, Heisenberg wanted to recruit Bohr or to pick his
scientific brains. Maybe he hoped to learn what if anything the
Allies were doing with nuclear fission. Perhaps he planned to use
Bohr to get a surreptitious message to his fellow physicists in
America. Maybe he wanted to tell them that Germany had made so
little progress on the Bomb that they could save their consciences
by scaling down their program.
</P>
<P>
   All and more of these possibilities have been suggested by
biographers and are repeated in the play. In the end, you don't
know if Heisenberg was a loyal German who failed to make a crucial
calculation out of sheer incompetence, a heroic anti-Nazi who
prevented Armageddon by subtly sabotaging his own work, or, as the
cynical Margrethe Bohr suspects, a boyish showoff who came to
Copenhagen to brag of his importance to a man he worshiped.
</P>
<P>
   The play is packed with subtleties and ironies, not least that
Heisenberg's physics never hurt a fly, while Bohr, acknowledged by
all as a good and great man, escaped to Los Alamos and helped
design the trigger that set off the Nagasaki explosion. It leaves
you feeling what ``Constructions,'' the book of pensees that Frayn
published in 1974, persistently suggests. We're always trying to
find coherence in human experience that is too intricate and
elusive for explanation of any kind: ``Our complexity is such that
we can understand many things. But not our own complexity!''
</P>
<P>
   Memory is so subjective, motives so mixed and thoughts so
evanescent that nobody, not even the man himself, can finally say
why Heisenberg went to Nazi-occupied Copenhagen. In other words,
the scientist might almost have been a particle in one of his own
quantum experiments, a weird, inscrutable dot capable of morally
existing in two places at once. As Margrethe says, he is ``here,
there, everywhere, nowhere.'' The play's accomplishment is to make
such ideas fascinating and concrete. The achievement of Michael
Blakemore's robustly acted production is to convince you of the
exhilaration of scientific discovery and the torment of the
scientists themselves.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TORONTO _ La incursion de Scotiabank en America Latina ha sido
una especie de despertar brusco para el presidente del directorio,
Peter Godsoe. El banco tuvo un mal estreno en la region a
principios de los anos 90, cuando adquirio un interes del 8.4 por
ciento en el Grupo Financiero Inverlat, de Mexico, por US$110
millones. Scotiabank obtuvo dos asientos de los 50 de la junta
directiva, con lo que el banco canadiense quedo practicamente sin
voz.
 &HT;    Para empeorar las cosas, la calidad de la cartera de prestamos
por cobrar de Inverlat se hizo muy evidente con la crisis del peso
de 1994, que obligo al banco a cancelar su inversion. El banco ha
invertido millones mas y ahora tiene una participacion del 55 por
ciento. En Argentina se hallo en una situacion similar cuando
adquirio la propiedad total del Banco Quilmes el ano pasado con el
fin de recapitalizarlo.
 &HT;    La experiencia del banco en ambos paises expuso muchos escollos
que los banqueros extranjeros enfrentan en la region. Y Bank of
Nova Scotia, mas conocido como Scotiabank, aprendio la leccion,
dice Godsoe, ejecutivo de 60 anos que es presidente del directorio
desde 1995.
 &HT;    La primera leccion: Scotiabank procurara mas activamente obtener
el control de sus adquisiciones o, por lo menos, ejercer una
influencia sustancial sobre sus socios. Esa estrategia puede
haberle dado tiempo suficiente para revisar completamente los
prestamos por cobrar de Inverlat y corregir los problemas antes que
el banco se desplome, dice Godsoe.
 &HT;    La segunda leccion: Scotiabank insistira en hacer una diligencia
debida mas amplia de los posibles socios. La estrategia se puso
recientemente en practica cuando el banco decidio no adquirir Banco
Bandeirantes porque la entidad brasilena no cumplia con los
terminos de Scotiabank.
 &HT;    Las penosas y costosas lecciones aprendidas en America Latina no
han cambiado la decision del banco de hacer negocios en la region,
indica Godsoe, al afirmar que el mercado bancario brasileno se
mantiene entre las prioridades de Scotiabank.
 &HT;    Godsoe dice que se concentrara en cerrar un acuerdo al precio
correcto, aunque ello signifique aceptar de nuevo una participacion
minoritaria. Pero reiterara su deseo de lograr un acuerdo que les
permita aumentar su inversion a largo plazo.
 &HT;    Los analistas dicen que el tiempo que Scotiabank paso
aprendiendo la leccion puede haberle costado una valiosa
participacion de mercado. Los competidores espanoles Santander y
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya gastan miles de millones en adquisiciones, lo
que los situa como lideres en varios mercados latinoamericanos. En
cambio, Scotiabank ha invertido US$750 millones en la adquisicion
de valores en siete paises latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Los observadores del sector dicen que hay mercados de nicho para
instituciones menores especializadas en banca empresarial o en
administracion de patrimonios, pero que solo prosperaran los cinco
mayores bancos minoristas de cada mercado.
 &HT;    No es cierto, responde Godsoe. ``A uno le puede ir muy bien
aunque no sea el numero uno ni el dos porque en America Latina se
consiguen margenes mas altos y un crecimiento vigoroso,'' apunta.
 &HT;    Godsoe justifica su confianza con las recientes reformas, la
reduccion de la intervencion estatal, mayores indices nacionales de
ahorro y un mercado con pocos servicios bancarios. Y en Argentina,
donde solo el 25 por ciento de la poblacion tiene una cuenta de
banco, ese cambio ofreceria grandes oportunidades.
 &HT;    Godsoe espera que los ingresos latinoamericanos de Scotiabank
crezcan un 15 por ciento al ano, ajustados a la inflacion, debido
al crecimiento rapido y al potencial de mercado del sector
financiero. Esas expectativas son importantes porque casi la mitad
de los ingresos de Scotiabank provienen de sus operaciones en el
extranjero. La importancia de America Latina para el banco tambien
ha aumentado por dos propuestas fusiones de bancos canadienses.
 &HT;    Otra critica es que no ha mostrado una estrategia regional
coherente similar a la de sus rivales espanoles, que han lanzado
franquicias uniformes en toda Latinoamerica. Godsoe alega que a
diferencia de la banca de inversion y del negocio de las tarjetas
de credito, la banca minorista es basicamente un negocio que varia
de pais en pais. Dice que el logo rojo en forma de S de Scotiabank
aparecera lentamente en toda la region a medida que aumente su
confianza en que sus filiales o asociados puedan brindar un
servicio de calidad.
 &HT;    ``Tratamos de echar raices en cada pais. En Chile somos un banco
chileno y en Peru, un banco peruano,'' explica Godsoe.
 &HT;    A los criticos que no concuerdan con el enfoque ``deliberado''
del banco, Godsoe les responde que hace falta tiempo para ver si
las raices que ha echado Scotiabank se afianzan y fortalecen.
 &HT;    ``Solo el tiempo dira,'' concluye.

 LONDON: scientists themselves.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the National's Lyttelton auditorium there is a play, or
rather a stage adaptation of a well-known book, that is also much
concerned with teachers and pupils, parent figures and those they
influence. But in ``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' it is the guru
who seems contaminated by fascism.
</P>
<P>
   The title character of Muriel Spark's novel is an Edinburgh
schoolteacher of the 1930's who proudly proclaims, ``Give me a girl
at an impressionable age and she is mine for life.'' That's fine
when it's Renaissance painting that she is impressing on their
unformed minds, a little less fine when it's her own love life, and
positively sinister when it's Mussolini, Hitler or Franco. The
result of her naivete is that the dopiest of her acolytes goes off
to the Spanish Civil War and is killed; her favorite pupil betrays
her to her great enemy, the dourly unimaginative head of Marcia
Blaine Academy _ and Miss Brodie ends up a broken woman.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the denouement slightly distorts Muriel Spark's
original; but in all other respects the American writer Jay Presson
Allen's new adaptation is more faithful to the original than her
own earlier versions for stage and screen. That is one
justification for reintroducing Jean Brodie to London only some
three years after the lady last appeared on a West End stage. The
others are the energy of Phyllida Lloyd's production, which packs a
sparsely furnished stage with schoolgirl bustle and scattiness,
and, especially, the skills of the principal performer.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Shaw isn't as well known in America as she should and
surely will be (her acclaimed one-woman stage version of the T.S.
Eliot poem ``The Waste Land'' was presented all too briefly in New
York in 1996), but any visitor to London would do well to see her
Brodie. She is more serious than Maggie Smith, who comically winced
and minced her way through the role on the screen in 1969, and less
chilling than her most recent stage counterpart, Patricia Hodge,
who came across as the steely Eva Braun of Scots education. In Ms.
Shaw's charismatic, scarlet-clad Brodie, warmth and teacherly
commitment are so strong that you're ready to overlook the
narcissism, the perverse romanticism, the dangerous misuse of power
and all her other faults: which makes Ms. Allen's play, like Ms.
Spark's novel, a reproach to those who like good and evil glibly
packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Globe _ meaning the loving replica of
Shakespeare's most celebrated theater that now stands across the
Thames from St. Paul's Cathedral _ has opened its second season,
most impressively with Lucy Bailey's brisk, sprightly revival of
``As You Like It.'' Anastasia Hille, seen at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music in 1995 as Webster's doomed Duchess of Malfi and at the
New Victory Theater last year in ``The Two Gentlemen of Verona,''
begins by looking a bit like the wan, tall, pinched maiden in
distress in Uccello's famous picture of St. George and the dragon:
which is apt, for the court of David Rintoul's grim Duke Frederick
is peopled by sleazy aides in reptilian doublets. But when she puts
on male clothes and cavorts in the Forest of Arden with Jonathan
Bond's lithe, nervy Orlando, the red comes to her cheeks and the
fun to her eyes _ and she skips about as exuberantly as some
innocently sexy teen-ager in her first nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to see so able an actress on a stage that has still to
attract many of Britain's brightest and best performers and has not
yet proved it can bear Shakespeare's weightiest plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Wooden O's open roof, thrust stage and yardful of
groundlings below combine to make subtlety difficult and audience
participation inevitable, at times worryingly inevitable.
Reportedly, Norbert Kentrup's Shylock, who appears in a production
of ``The Merchant of Venice'' running in rep with ``As You Like
It,'' has sometimes been booed during the performance. Let's
presume that is less a display of anti-Semitism than of distaste
for a potential butcher.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when spectators hiss villains who join in the fun
by making menacing gestures back at them, or chorus ``ahhh'' when
events get poignant or characters look forlorn, there is reason for
concern. But what is harmless enough in the case of ``As You Like
It'' or last year's ``Two Gentlemen of Verona'' may turn out to be
catastrophic when the theater eventually risks a tragedy. Angry
heckling when Iago threatens to destroy Othello? Sympathetic groans
when Lady Macbeth rubs at the invisible spot on her hand? Oh, dear.
Oh, no.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TORONTO _ Scotiabank's foray into Latin America has been
something of a rude awakening for Chairman Peter Godsoe. The bank
got off to a poor start in the region in the early 1990s when it
acquired an 8.4 percent interest in Mexico's Grupo Financiero
Inverlat for US$110 million. Scotiabank got two seats out of 50 on
its partner's board, leaving the Canadian bank with virtually no
voice.
 &HT;    To make matters worse, the quality of Inverlat's outstanding
loan portfolio became all too apparent following the 1994 Mexican
peso crisis, forcing the bank to write off its investment. The bank
spent millions of dollars more and now has a 55 percent share. In
Argentina, the bank found itself in a similar situation when it
took full ownership of Banco Quilmes last year in order to
recapitalize it. The bank's experience in both countries exposed
many of the pitfalls foreign bankers face in the region. And the
Bank of Nova Scotia, widely known as Scotiabank, certainly learned
its lesson, says Godsoe, 60, who has been chairman since 1995. He
joined the bank in 1966.
 &HT;    Lesson number one: Scotiabank will move more aggressively to
gain control of its acquisitions, or, at the very least, have
substantial influence over its partners. Such a strategy may have
given the bank enough time to fully review Inverlat's outstanding
loans and corrected problems prior to the bank imploding, says
Godsoe. Lesson number two: Scotiabank will insist on conducting
more extensive due diligence of prospective partners. The strategy
was put into practice recently when the bank backed away from
acquiring Banco Bandeirantes because the Brazilian bank would not
meet Scotiabank's terms.
 &HT;    The painful, costly lessons learned in Latin America have not
soured the bank's taste for doing business in the region, says
Godsoe, who says the Brazilian banking market remains top priority.
Godsoe says he will focus on closing a ``do-able'' deal at the
right price, even if it means again taking a minority position. But
it would insist on an arrangement enabling it to increase its
investment over time.
 &HT;    Analysts say the time Scotiabank spent learning its lesson may
have cost them precious market share. Spanish competitors Santander
and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya are spending billions in acquisitions,
placing them as leaders in several Latin American markets. In
comparison, Scotiabank has invested $750 million to acquire
holdings in seven Latin American countries.
 &HT;    Industry observers say niche markets exist for smaller
institutions specializing in corporate banking or wealth
management, but only the top five retail banks in each market will
thrive. Not so, says Godsoe. ``You can do very well even if you are
not number one or two because you get higher spreads and strong
growth (in Latin America),'' says Godsoe.
 &HT;    Godsoe remains confident, citing recent policy reforms, reduced
government intervention, increased domestic savings and a vastly
under-banked market. He notes that in Argentina, for example, only
25 percent of the population even has a bank account, meaning that
plenty of opportunities exist to grow.
 &HT;    Godsoe expects Latin American revenues to grow by about 15
percent annually, adjusted for inflation, due to rapid growth and
the financial sector's unfulfilled market potential. Such
expectations are important because Scotiabank derives about half of
its profits from overseas business. Latin America also has become
all the more important to the bank in the wake of two proposed
Canadian bank mergers. One other criticism of the bank is that it
has failed to demonstrate a coherent regional strategy similar to
that taken by it Spanish competitors, who have launched uniform
franchises throughout Latin America. Godsoe argues that unlike
investment banking and the credit card business, retail banking is
essentially a national business that varies from country to
country. He says Scotiabank's red S-shaped logo will slowly appear
throughout the region once it is confident that its subsidiaries,
or partners, can deliver quality service. ``What we are trying to
do is put down roots. We're a Chilean bank in Chile and a Peruvian
bank in Peru,'' says Godsoe.
 &HT;    To critics who disagree with the bank's ``deliberate'' approach,
Godsoe says it will take time to see if the roots planted by
Scotiabank will take hold and flourish. ``Only in the long, long
run will we know,'' he says.

more extensive due diligence of prospective partners. The strategy
was put into practice recently when the bank backed away from
acquiring Banco Bandeirantes because the Brazilian bank would not
meet Scotiabank's terms.
 &HT;    The painful, costly lessons learned in Latin America have not
soured the bank's taste for doing business in the region, says
Godsoe, who says the Brazilian banking market remains top priority.
Godsoe says he will focus on closing a ``do-able'' deal at the
right price, even if it means again taking a minority position. But
it would insist on an arrangement enabling it to increase its
investment over time.
 &HT;    Analysts say the time Scotiabank spent learning its lesson may
have cost them precious market share. Spanish competitors Santander
and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya are spending billions in acquisitions,
placing them as leaders in several Latin American markets. In
comparison, Scotiabank has invested $750 million to acquire
holdings in seven Latin American countries.
 &HT;    Industry observers say niche markets exist for smaller
institutions specializing in corporate banking or wealth
management, but only the top five retail banks in each market will
thrive. Not so, says Godsoe. ``You can do very well even if you are
not number one or two because you get higher spreads and strong
growth (in Latin America),'' says Godsoe.
 &HT;    Godsoe remains confident, citing recent policy reforms, reduced
government intervention, increased domestic savings and a vastly
under-banked market. He notes that in Argentina, for example, only
25 percent of the population even has a bank account, meaning that
plenty of opportunities exist to grow.
 &HT;    Godsoe expects Latin American revenues to grow by about 15
percent annually, adjusted for inflation, due to rapid growth and
the financial sector's unfulfilled market potential. Such
expectations are important because Scotiabank derives about half of
its profits from overseas business. Latin America also has become
all the more important to the bank in the wake of two proposed
Canadian bank mergers. One other criticism of the bank is that it
has failed to demonstrate a coherent regional strategy similar to
that taken by it Spanish competitors, who have launched uniform
franchises throughout Latin America. Godsoe argues that unlike
investment banking and the credit card business, retail banking is
essentially a national business that varies from country to
country. He says Scotiabank's red S-shaped logo will slowly appear
throughout the region once it is confident that its subsidiaries,
or partners, can deliver quality service. ``What we are trying to
do is put down roots. We're a Chilean bank in Chile and a Peruvian
bank in Peru,'' says Godsoe.
 &HT;    To critics who disagree with the bank's ``deliberate'' approach,
Godsoe says it will take time to see if the roots planted by
Scotiabank will take hold and flourish. ``Only in the long, long
run will we know,'' he says.

 &HT;    Triple threat to homer record worries Aaron
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ You might have overheard someone at the water cooler
mention in passing this Mark McGwire fellow. He's hit a few fly
balls over guys' heads this season _ 40 of 'em, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've seen a clip of Ken Griffey Jr. booming one of his
37 homers into the nether reaches of stadiums here and far. He's
got pop. And Sammy Sosa's 35 long balls are longer than the ivy at
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Women are swooning. Fifty-year-olds are taking gloves to
ballparks. Kids want to be just like Mac. And the Kid. And Sammy.
Three sluggers in chase of history and the 37-year-old record of 61
home runs in a season. This chase of Roger Maris is, in a word,
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   But what really gets the heart pumping for one senior vice
president of the Atlanta Braves, what really fills his tank are ...
are ... triples.
</P>
<P>
   Triples?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come out and take a survey of 1,000 people in the
stands and ask them what they'd rather see, I'd bet 90 percent
would rather see a home run,'' the front-office executive said by
telephone Tuesday. ``Me, I get more excitement out of a triple. It
lasts longer. Fans have more time to cheer. When you hit a home
run, it's out of the park, you cheer, that's the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A triple is like a guy breaking away from the 1-yard line and
running 80 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but what does Hank Aaron know? Well, he knows a thing or
two about home runs because he hit more of them than anyone who
ever wiped pine tar on his hands. Don't get him wrong. Baseball's
all-time home run king didn't hit 755 balls out of stadiums without
developing a lasting appreciation for his sport's equivalent of the
touchdown bomb or the coast-to-coast slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   But the 64-year-old Hall of Famer who made Babe Ruth the most
famous runner- up in sports history gets juiced every time he sees
Jose Offerman and Delino DeShields leg out a three-bagger.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron is to be forgiven if he considers homers more mundane than
tarp crews. Triples are much more rare, as his 23-year career with
the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves and Milwaukee Brewers can attest. He
spliced in only 98 triples among his 1,477 extra-base hits, but
once had 14 in a season.
</P>
<P>
   He never approached Maris' home run record _ the most he ever
hit in one season was 47 in 1971 _ but no one could approach his
consistency. Aaron hit at least 30 home runs in 15 seasons and
topped 40 homers eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron recognizes the public's fanatical obsession with
gargantuan shots, no matter if it's drooling over John Daley's
drives or John Elway's bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pennant races are practically over with, but fans have
always been fascinated by people hitting the ball out of the park,
and they always will be,'' Aaron said. ``We've got one of the best
pitchers in baseball in Greg Maddux, who's having a fantastic year,
but he can't put a dent in the publicity. It's second-page stuff.
Home runs just have that mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron likes the possibility that Maris' record will fall, but he
is hoping it doesn't crumble. Triples thrill him, but he doesn't
think that applies to the treasured home run mark.
</P>
<P>
   A three-headed champion would make the record seem too
commonplace, unbefitting the swell of attention. Aaron marvels at
McGwire's prodigious power, Griffey's consistency and Sosa's
improved knowledge of the strike zone, but he thinks to catch
Maris, they have to be at least five homers ahead of the Yankee's
pace entering September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very good chance it will be broken,'' he said,
``because McGwire hits 'em in bunches. The sad part about it is if
all three break the record, it would take away some of the hype. If
Griffey hits 65, Sosa hits 63 and McGwire hits 68, it wouldn't be
the same. It'd be better if one broke it.''
</P>
<P>
   Their pressure cooker won't begin to compare to Aaron's assault
on Babe's 714-homer mark, when he had to shrug off death threats
and register at hotels under assumed names. Even so, Aaron
considers Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak and the 57-year gap
since Ted Williams became the last hitter to bat .400 more
unreachable standards than 61 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron watched a reluctant Griffey win the home run contest at
the All-Star Game in Coors Field. Aaron has never cared for such
theatrics, even though he outdueled Maris and Mickey Mantle and won
$30,000 in the Home Run Derby filmed in Los Angeles, money he used
to buy his father a grocery store in his hometown of Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   That was six times his major-league salary when he broke in with
the Milwaukee Braves in 1954. Although Aaron pulled down $250,000
before he retired in 1976, he wonders if today's sluggers will have
the perseverance for such longevity records, given their enormous
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   While he gives Griffey the best chance of dethroning him as the
career home- run champion, the 28-year-old Mariner would have to
average about 40 homers for the next 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Does a four-year, $34-million contract diffuse Griffey's will?
Aaron played to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players have enough money to buy a city,'' Aaron said.
``It's not that players aren't capable of doing all these things,
but they're making so much damn money they can't keep their eye on
the prize. If I had to pick one or the other, I'd still take the
longevity because money and a fool part quick, and there are some
things you can't put a value on.''

 &HT;    Let's get the manslaughter out of hockey
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A thug pleaded not guilty recently in Plymouth, Mich., to a
felony charge of assault to do great bodily harm less than murder.
</P>
<P>
   The thug's name is Jesse Boulerice. He's 19, and a prospect with
the Philadelphia Flyers. During an Ontario Hockey League playoff
game in Apri46 Boulerice, playing for the Plymouth Whalers,
apparently took violent exception to a check delivered by Andrew
Long of the Guelph (Ont.) Storm.
</P>
<P>
   According to a wire-service report on police review of the
incident, Long, a 19-year-old Florida Panthers prospect, was
skating away after the check when Boulerice swung his stick in
baseball fashion. Long, knocked unconscious, went into convulsions
and was hospitalized with blood on the brain and a broken nose,
nasal cavity and cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty stitches were required to close a gash from the tip of
Long's nose to his lip.
</P>
<P>
   Read the charge again _ assault to do great bodily harm less
than murder _ and shudder one more time at the reality that those
nine words actually exist within the context of a law.
</P>
<P>
   The felony carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a
$5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is about to go on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Because if Boulerice's unconscionable act doesn't result in
substantial change of hockey's rules as they apply to everything
from fighting to retaliation, then the message is clear _ on ice,
anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest hockey reduce itself to a polite
exercise. It is a physical game, and anyone able to gain an edge
through intimidation establishes a considerable advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But that edge can and should be gained through checks delivered
hard and clean. There is no place, or shouldn't be, for even one
stick-swinging player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect guys who play tough and straight-up,'' said Long in
a telephone conversation Tuesday night from Guelph, Ontario, where
he says he is fully recovered from the injuries. ``But this almost
seemed like a psychotic rage. It's a scary thing when you've grown
up dreaming of being a hockey player and realize someone can take
it away from you in a second.''
</P>
<P>
   A no-tolerance line needs to be drawn. Immediately. Make it
simple _ no swinging the stick with the intention of making contact
with another player. No more ankle chops. No more swipes at the
back of a leg. No more using the butt end, either.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little chance such strict rules will be adopted. K
The unfortunate assumption is that hockey needs to be savage beyond
its natural ferociousness. The unfortunate accompanying and
prevailing attitude is that bruta 7/8ity has a place in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think so?
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing awaits Boulerice, who is serving a
one-year OHL suspension. According to reports, Boulerice's
attorney, James Howarth, has suggested that his client's actions
are nothing out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens everywhere from pee-wee to the NHL,'' Howarth has
been quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   He's absolutely correct.
</P>
<P>
   Stick-swinging does happen everywhere from pee-wee to the NHL.
That's precisely the point.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to change the notion that it's permissible, even
reasonable, to use a piece of equipment as a weapon. It's time to
abandon the idea that an ambush is to be expected, even tolerated,
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Or settle on the chilling concept that, in hockey, anything less
than murder is OK.

 &HT;    Report: Cap Metro ran out of control
 &HT;    By Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Capital Metro is ``a dysfunctional organization'' that
has become mired in a culture of lax spending, inefficiency and
complete lack of accountability, the state comptroller's office
says in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-plus page performance review cites numerous problems,
from poor planning to negligent accounting and spending of
taxpayers' money. Examples include spending more than $25,000 for a
casino-theme employee Christmas Party, and six-figure consulting
contracts that have produced little useful data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital Metro's board and managers have made expensive,
embarrassing mistakes,'' the report states. ``More to the point,
however, they have been allowed to go on repeating them, year after
year, with no consequences and no apparent ability to learn from
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   While previous reviews and audits have pointed out problems,
today's report by State Comptroller John Sharp's Texas Performance
Review team discloses numerous problems that have never been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Among the revelations in the report:
</P>
<P>
   The agency is top-heavy, with administrative costs consuming
18.1 percent of its $70 million annual operating budget. In 1995,
when administrative costs were 19.7 percent of the budget, the
costs were 23 percent higher than the average in a group of 18
comparable transit authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Spending is excessive and inefficient because of a lack of
accountability. The agency was unable to locate $79,000 worth of
assets, such as computers and printers, during a recent inventory.
For a 1996 Christmas party at a local hotel, the agency spent
almost $19,000 on food for 650 employees and nearly $7,000 for
other costs. The report also cited excessive travel costs, $60,000
worth of cellular phone use last year, and spending on perks
ranging from from movie tickets to $8,000 for shirts and caps.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Metro has exaggerated its ridership figures. The agency
estimated there were 29 million passenger boardings last year,
which may be inflated by 6 million. Capital Metro reports 120,000
boardings a day, but because the agency counts transfers from one
bus to another, the actual number of people riding the buses each
day is closer to 42,000, the review says.
</P>
<P>
   There are significant and unexplained discrepancies between
farebox reports of revenue collection and actual cash collected.
Capital Metro does not routinely investigate such discrepancies,
which can be as much as 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Operating costs have risen in recent years at a higher rate than
ridership. Board decisions ``have been based largely on a simple
desire to increase ridership with little or no examination of the
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor planning has resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars
in wasted consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   The human resources department ``has repeatedly failed to meet
the most basic expectations for its mission.'' Training and
performance processes are ``largely ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital Metro has not managed its railroad well, using public
money to do work on the tracks that the review team suggests should
be done by the rail freight operator, Longhorn Railway. In
addition, the agency is unable to account for the leases and
licenses that allow others to use the railroad right-of-way.
</P>
<P>
   The staff and board have been slow to complete strategic plans
that outline long-term goals and performance measures for the
agency as a whole and by departments.
</P>
<P>
   The report makes several recommendations. Capital Metro would
save $4.2 million in the upcoming budget year and $22 million over
five years if it applied the recommendations, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   While the report appears to blame most problems on previous
administrators and board members, the current management and board
have much more work to do to turn the agency around, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Interim General Manager Gerald Robichaux, who reviewed the
report last week but had not seen a final copy or recommendations,
said many issues it raises have been corrected or are being
corrected under his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical, but it's nothing really different from what
we'd been told in several other audits,'' he said. ``If that's read
to believe those things still exist, I have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance review comes at a crucial time for the agency,
as it tries to regain community credibility before presenting a
light-rail system to voters as early as next spring. The transit
authority is not obligated to comply with the state team's
recommendations, but board members, who had not seen the review
Tuesday, have said the review would be valuable in their efforts to
improve the transit system.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Metro's credibility has suffered amid allegations of
mismanagement and an ongoing FBI investigation into its business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Metro requested the review in part to stave off critics,
including some in the state Legislature who considered legislation
to allow voters to reduce Capital Metro's 1-cent sales tax levy.
The agency collects about $90 million a year, an average of $350
from each household in its service area.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledges recent improvements: a new contracts and
procurement manager who is improving the problem-plagued
department, a more aggressive board that has begun to streamline
spending, better budgeting, and recent work to begin compiling data
on riders and routes. At the root of many of Capital Metro's
problems, according to the review, is a failure to make management
and employees accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers generally do not face any consequences for
substandard performance,'' the review states. In addition, ``with
its growing stream of local tax revenues, Capital Metro has had the
luxury of complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   To curb wasteful spending, the review recommends reinstating an
internal audit position that was eliminated this spring. The review
says former auditor Tony Tegbe told top management about examples
of waste, but that his reports were rarely acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   The position should be strengthened by allowing the auditor to
report directly to the board instead of to the general manager, the
review states.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Metro will spend the next few weeks looking over the
report's findings and recommendations, Robichaux said. He said the
critical report is another difficult blow for a staff that has been
battered by more than a year of controversy, from major management
overhauls to the FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep our heads up and keep turning this around,''
he said. ``A lot of this stuff these people (still at the agency)
were not involved with. They're involved with turning this
around.''

 &HT;    Florida insurance commissioner ``did not know'' Swiss bank
connection to Holocaust victim money
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Bill Nelson affirmed that he is prepared to ask
for sanctions against Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse
if the banks do not reach a satisfactory settlement with Jewish
groups.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Nelson, Florida's insurance commissioner, mentioned
the possibility of sanctions to The Palm Beach Post in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those banks don't treat people correctly, I'm going after
them,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he did not know about accusations that the banks
stole Holocaust victims' assets when he signed off on contracts for
them to provide credit to a state insurance concern.
</P>
<P>
   He was unaware, Nelson said, that a lawsuit against the banks
had been filed four months before he approved the second contract
in 1997. The suit did not exist when the first contract was
approved in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have offered $600 million to settle Holocaust claims
but negotiators are asking for $1.5 billion. California has banned
the banks from state business and New York is threatening do so by
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Union Bank of Switzerland became the lead bank or
``syndication agent'' in a consortium of international banks
providing $1.5 billion in credit to Florida's Joint Underwriting
Association, a state-created home insurer of last resort. The
agency can tap the money to pay claims in the event of a hurricane.
Fees to the Swiss banks total an estimated $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he has asked attorneys to explore his legal powers
to ask the JUA to stop doing business with the banks. The current
contract runs through 1999 and Nelson said he would consider
breaking that contract if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Tuesday he did not recall signing any documents
mentioning Swiss banks in 1995, but Union Bank of Switzerland is
mentioned in a one-page document he signed on Sept. 7, 1995
certifying the credit arrangement. J.P. Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
of New York served as managing agent for the banks in both
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Jewish groups favor sanctions. Nelson said he would also
have to consider the financial best interest of the 270,000
homeowners protected by the JUA before making any final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the banks said sanctions would be the wrong move
considering the progress that has been made to rectify a
50-year-old problem.

SENATE REPUBLICANS BLAST RENO, CHARGE COVER-UP IN CLINTON FINANCE
PROBE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno drew unrelenting fire
from Senate Republicans on Wednesday as she sought to defend her
decision not to call for an independent counsel to investigate
alleged campaign finance violations by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, in which Republicans suggested she may be part of a
White House cover-up, became so intense that Reno told Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, ``You don't have
to be so fierce at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, rejecting the cover-up charge, said she has called for
independent counsel examinations of Clinton, including allegations
about the failed Whitewater land deal and his purported affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch asked the attorney general how she could expect Clinton's
own Justice Department to investigate the president vigorously and
said Reno has an apparent conflict of interest in overseeing such
an examination of her boss. He said Reno's failure to seek an
independent investigation of Clinton would forever mar her
otherwise laudable tenure as attorney general because people would
wonder if she was part of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, in my opinion, is going to be your legacy,'' said Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reno responded, ``I didn't come into the job for my
legacy.'' Saying an attorney general's job is to follow the
evidence and the law, Reno added she has yet to see evidence that
would require her to call for a special investigation under the
independent counsel statute.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general also took strong exception to Hatch's
reading from an editorial in Wednesday's New York Times that
suggested she was trying to protect the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do things based on editorials,'' Reno said. ``I don't
do things based on pressure ... I am going to always listen to you,
but not when you wave editorials at me.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said she reconsiders her decision every day
and would call for an independent counsel only when the evidence
and law indicated one was necessary. However, she declined to
specify what evidence she has seen, citing the department's policy
of not commenting on pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Democratic donors have been indicted as a result of the
Justice Department's investigation of alleged campaign finance
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel statute, the attorney general must
ask a panel of three federal judges to name an independent counsel
when a Justice Department investigation indicates an administration
official might have committed a crime; the law also states that an
attorney general may seek an independent counsel when a conflict of
interest between the department and the president suggests one
should be named.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at the hearing, Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., criticized Reno for failing to name an independent
counsel to investigate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson faulted the attorney general for discounting the advice
of FBI Director Louis Freeh, who called it a conflict of interest
for the Justice Department to investigate alleged presidential
misdeeds. As chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,

   Reno replied that ``informed judgments should dictate public
policy. I've seen a lot of evidence other than that chart.'' &QL;

MONTGOMERY PLACE GIVE GLIMPSE OF LIFE IN 19TH CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ Situated high on the eastern bank of
the Hudson River in Annandale-on-Hudson, Montgomery Place, a
434-acre estate, remains one of the best-documented architectural
landmarks of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery Place is the prototype of the American Country
Seat,'' said J. Winthrop ``Winty'' Aldrich, a descendant of Robert
Livingston, the First Lord of Livingston Manor. Aldrich is co-owner
of nearby Rokby, another historic riverfront mansion that has been
in his family for 11 generations. Aldrich serves as deputy
commissioner for Historic Preservation for the New York Office of
Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery Place was a working enclave. You see the property
in evolution and refinement, reflecting the taste of the era for
nearly 200 years. In its own way, Montgomery Place has always been
recognized for the importance of the people who lived there, who
shaped its design,'' Aldrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Named in memory of Gen. Richard Montgomery (1738-1775), the
first hero of the American Revolution, who was killed in the battle
for Quebec, Montgomery Place features a Classical Revival mansion,
open-to-the-public farm market, woodland hiking trails, historic
gardens and fetching views of the Hudson River and distant Catskill
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In continuous family ownership since 1805, Montgomery Place was
given to Sleepy Hollow Restorations (now Historic Hudson Valley) by
descendents of the Delafield family, the last clan to live there,
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. John Ross Delafield, a Livingston relative born in 1874,
inherited Montgomery Place in 1921 and lived there summers with his
wife, Violetta White Delafield (1875-1949), until his death in
1964. Then, various descendants used it on a summer basis.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Place became a National Historic Landmark in 1992; it
has been open to the public since June 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion has been retained the way the family heirs left it,
rather than the way it was originally built by the general's
(Richard Montgomery) 59-year-old widow, Janet Livingston Montgomery
(1743-1828).
</P>
<P>
   A working farm at the time, she built a straightforward
Federal-style house at the terminus of a half-mile-long allee of
deciduous trees and fruit orchard. Many of the trees stand today.
She named the homestead Chateau de Montgomery in memory of her
husband, the French a reference to her brother's tenure as minister
to France from 1801 to 1805.
</P>
<P>
   Black locust trees that are 200 years old and 75 feet tall line
the west side of the house and are fragrant when in spring bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch considered these trees good luck,'' said Lucy
Kuriger, site manager of Montgomery Place. ``They actually act as
lightning rods. They take hits all the time. Even if they get split
they just keep on growing.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a tulip poplar tree that could easily date back to the
virgin forest, before colonial settlers, according to Timothy
Steinhoff, director of horticulture for Historic Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The facade of the house started out as stuccoed fieldstone, to
make it look like stone blocks, with a five-bay window front view
and center door with slender side-light windows flanking each side
and a six-bay river (west) front topped by a hipped roof. It was a
simple rectangular house with no flanking wings.
</P>
<P>
   The floor plan consisted of two equally shaped rooms on the
(west) river side and two rooms to the front on the east side. The
center-hall entrance does not go all the way through to the west
side of the house. The spacious front center hall was used as a
receiving room before ushering guests into the library or drawing
room.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the stairway to the second floor was placed off of
a hall to the left side of the main entrance hall, making for a
clean, stairless front entry decorated with large oil portraits of
family members and furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   The hall was heated in winter with a large, ornate Federal-style
cast-iron stove that was placed at the end of the hall between the
formal dining parlor (as it was traditionally called) and the
parlor (drawing room). The stove pipe went up through all the
floors and out the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The original exterior entrance to the center hall was never
sheltered. The elegant semi-circular portico, with composit
capitals, that graces the front was added in 1863, as part of the
first phase of renovations designed by noted American architect
Alexander Jackson Davis, who based his design on the Temple of
Vesta in Tivoli, outside Rome. This portico was only a fraction of
the embellishments that Davis would add to this once-plain
Federal-style house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yellow drawing room is one of the most exquisite in the
Hudson Valley,'' said preservationist architect Doug Bucher, with
the Albany firm of John G. Waite Associates, who did the historic
structures report for Montgomery Place.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Many of the current wallpapers are probably French,
as the family spent a great deal of time in France and other parts
of Europe. They cover several other layers of papers that were
applied through the years. To clean up the white background on the
paper, you can see where they spruced it up with white paint or cut
out new pieces and applied them in an attempt to make repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The brick-and-wood kitchen, with its full brick fireplace that
was used for cooking, stood over a sub-basement that was most
likely used as a root cellar originally and later for perhaps a
wine cellar or furnace.To muffle the sounds of cooking and clinking
of pots and pans, the floor between the kitchen and first-floor
dining room above is padded with mud and straw to absorb any
noise.The kitchen also included a stewing stove, which is a very
old cooking device.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``You burn charcoal in it to cook delicate sauces that you could
never make in a fireplace,'' said Bucher. ``They provided a slow,
refined way of cooking delicate things such as sauces. The French
used these in the 18th century, and the Romans had similar kinds.
They are usually built of brick under a window and contain two to
five openings covered with little metal grills. Montgomery Place
has four openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used this stewing stove as the model for the Octagon House
in Washington. The one at Montgomery Place is one of the few to
survive in the country. These weren't unusual. Thomas Jefferson had
one at Monticello, because he had a French cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Janet Livingston Montgomery's guidance, Chateau de
Montgomery was transformed into a lucrative year-round working farm
with orchards, gardens, nursery and greenhouse in a sylvan setting.
</P>
<P>
   But with no direct family heirs, Janet left it to her youngest
brother, Edward Livingston (1764-1836), mayor of New York City,
U.S. representative and U.S. senator from Louisiana and secretary
of state and minister to France under Andrew Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   His worldly widow, Louise Livingston (1782-1860), a
French-speaking native of Haiti, and their daughter Coralie
Livingston Barton (1806-1873) used it as a summer retreat. It was
during this 40-year period that Montgomery Place, as they renamed
it, would enlist the services of noted American architect of the
romantic movement A.J. Davis (1803-1892) and further enhance the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1842, Davis would make several changes, including
the addition of a conservatory, beautiful flower gardens and
several architectural follies.
</P>
<P>
   He also added porch extensions to the east, west and north sides
of the house. It was the open-arched columned porch on the north
side of the house that was designed for use as an outdoor room.
A.J. Downing (1815-1852), landscape architect from Newburgh, served
as consultant on the gardens and other landscape and statuary
features of the property and believed this to be the first outdoor
living space in America.
</P>
<P>
   An enclosed wing was added to the south side of the house, and
to link these all together, Davis designed classical detailing and
ballustrades along all of the roof lines, including the original
hipped roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current exterior creamy beige paint scheme with dark green
shutters was also designed by Davis,'' said Bucher. ``These colors
were meant to make the house rest comfortably in the landscape. The
porches were also painted with a sand-based paint to give it the
rich texture of stone like the rest of the house. This was a
trademark of Davis'.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of renovations, by Davis, began in the early
1860s. During this time he would design a classical-style coach
house, an Italianate farmhouse and a Gothic Revival-style Swiss
cottage on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was Coralie Barton who designed the ornamental flower gardens
surrounding the conservatory, carriage roads, bridle paths and
nature trails that were designed for walks for different times of
the day that were also marked with follies and resting spots.
</P>
<P>
   The repeating floral patterns and examples of symmetry are often
repeated inside the mansion, which can be seen on furnishings,
fabrics, porcelain and wallpapers.
</P>
<P>
   Downing, who was perhaps the foremost American writer on
landscape and garden subjects, wrote extensively about it.
``Montgomery Place is second as it is to no seat in America, for
its combination of attractions . . . all its varied mysteries of
pleasure-grounds and lawns, wood and water,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Place would experience a brief decline during the
post-Civil War period, when it was occupied by relatives who never
owned it outright, but lived there under life tenancy. In 1921,
Gen. John Ross Delafield, a Livingstone descendant, inherited
Montgomery Place and used it as his country house to escape the
heat of his family home in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. John Ross Delafield's wife, Violetta White (1875-1949), was
an accomplished botanist. She created the terraced landscaping on
the west side of the house, looking out to the west and the open
river and to the north to Tivoli South Bay. She was also
responsible for the roses, herbs, perennials, artificial stream and
woodland plants and ellipse pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Delafields also brought the house into the 20th century by
adding electricity, plumbing and heat, without altering much else
in the house,'' said Bucher. ``They also added a clay tennis court,
squash court and greenhouse. The woodland walks were restored and
orchards improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``While renovating the house, they also started preservation of
Montgomery Place by cataloging everything and keeping extensive
records, which even included early receipts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delafield family left the house to Historic Hudson Valley
fully furnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is way too much to fit in all the rooms and still
leave room for visitors and guides to get around,'' said Kuriger,
site manager. ``Interior designer Mark Hampton selected all of the
pieces for the rooms, taking the house up to the Empire period.''
</P>
<P>
   Every family member who ever lived at Montgomery Place had a
huge attachment to the house and left their personal mark.``As each
family inherited Montgomery Place, they would make tasteful
additions that would build on past improvements to the house and
grounds,'' said Kathleen Eaagen Johnson, curator of Historic Hudson
Valley. ``They continued to create this incredible playground that
people still enjoy today. It's a very happy place, with interiors
filled with family memories and personalized belongings from each
family that lived here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that the second floor still has to be restored
before it can be open to the public, and some sort of safety
decision must be made concerning access, as there is only one
staircase. So for now, the second floor serves as storage for
furniture amassed through the years. The third floor, which is also
closed to the public and filled with furnishings, had served as
servants quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But the public has full access to the grounds for picnics,
walks, guided moonlight tours through the gardens. There's also an
abundance of fresh produce from the farm which is 46 acres in
actual production and 100 acres of open field at a stand that's
open seven days a week to the public from late June through Oct.
31. There you can buy fresh-picked peaches, apples, pears,
apricots, plums, four kinds of raspberries, seedless table grapes
and jams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite special when you stop and think about it,'' said
Wint Aldrich. ``That the farm stand has been publicly accessible
and operating for 190 years as a fruit farm. When Janet Montgomery
began, there was just a peach orchard. It was never a family
enclave that was closed to the outside world. There were always
people coming and going, including lots of family and house
guests.''

BOOK TALK: DOES SYNERGY REALLY WORK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To most writers, synergy is just a word in the dictionary. It's
the buzzword, to be sure, in book publishing and other media in
this era of conglomeration and consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But nonetheless, to those churning out magazine work, the
concept of an article's or a short story's growing into a book and
then a movie or a television series _ all within the same company _
has been little more than a whimsy. And that doesn't seem likely to
change despite Hollywood's ravenous need for material.
</P>
<P>
   Still, last week Tina Brown pumped new hope into the fancy. She
quit as editor of The New Yorker to start up a company affiliated
with Disney's Miramax Films to create a monthly magazine that would
then be the main strand in a wickerwork of books, films and
television shows. Synergy. Upward from the magazine piece. So far,
the details have been nil, but writers, worried about the loss of
outlets because of the recent mergers of book publishing companies,
may feel a bit better having this new publishing venture as an
added consumer, no matter what it turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Will the synergy work? It hasn't anywhere else, and most people
in book publishing feel it can't, although Ms. Brown's creativity
always gives hope where others have failed. What marches against it
is the very way in which a writer's writing is sold.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when a magazine buys a story, 99 percent of the
time what it has purchased is its one-shot publication in North
America. Nothing more. All other rights for that work _ overseas
sales, expansion into a book and its sale, movie and television
sales, electronic rights _ are retained by the writer, if the agent
is not in a coma. (The same is mostly true if the work starts out
as a book rather than a magazine article.)
</P>
<P>
   This simple system allows for a lucky writer to wallow in
multiple bidders offering increasing amounts of cash as they try to
buy the property for movie development, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The synergy faith, in essence, says, Give up all this for some
more money up front, and hope you'll someday see your work on the
screen or the tube. In fact, there would have to be a lot more
money in the beginning to buy up all these rights, plus a movie
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Newberg, an author's agent, summed up the simple economy
of it all this way: ``Why would I ever wrap up a client's work in
one place? The first time a writer is called by a movie company and
told, `Too bad you didn't retain those rights; we would have paid
you more,' that's trouble for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gottlieb, an agent, said: ``This is the difference
between wishful thinking by the synergists and reality. I never
want to find that I've given up all the rights up front and the
author is sitting somewhere two years later asking me, `What's
going on?,''' wondering where is the movie. ``That's why we refused
to give the publishers electronic rights because of fear of their
warehousing them.''
</P>
<P>
   And that refusal to give away rights is why few, if any,
articles in Time Warner's array of magazines and few, if any, books
from its book publishing houses have become movies for Warner
Brothers or television shows for HBO or TNT, all of which it owns.
Similarly, Disney's magazines and its Hyperion Books have provided
nearly naught for Disney movies; nor has HarperCollins been able to
use synergy to whip books into movies or television mini-series for
Fox. (Disney-owned ABC-TV does get first crack at buying
Disney-produced movies, and TNT gets first look to buy Warner
Brothers movies, but that's synergy of a different kind.)
</P>
<P>
   Is there a way out of this box for the new company? Jean Naggar,
an agent, thinks probably not, except perhaps for a work by or
about a celebrity. She said that if the new company saw from the
first that the piece it was buying for its magazine could be made
into a movie, it might make the deal for the whole package right at
the start. But that, of course, means paying a lot more up front
than is given to even the highest-paid magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Ms. Brown could probably buy the right to top the
highest bidder, Ms. Naggar said. ``But an agent is going to retain
a maximum amount of rights; and to be willing to give away any of
those rights, the agent needs to be convinced it's good for the
author's career,'' Ms. Naggar said. ``It's not just about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb said that synergy was ``a great Wharton business school
idea, but welcome to the entertainment world.'' He added that this
could work only if Miramax actually made a commitment to MAKE the
film, not just put it into development. ``It takes a tremendous
amount of energy and money to develop something into a movie,'' he
said, ``and you can't put too many into development.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, most movie projects never get out of development, if
they actually get that far, even when the story idea was purchased
in a flurry of competition. This year Miramax itself actually
produced about 14 of the 38 movies it distributed. Will the new
company get a Disney commitment for Miramax to make even more
movies, those growing out of the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems for the writer in the synergistic
world. With Ms. Brown's fame, for instance, she could very likely
get some writers to consider giving her topping privileges, but
that could dampen the enthusiasm of other movie companies to make
meaningful bids if they know the bids could be topped.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what happens when the writer is required to have the
manuscript run past the new company's movie-making machinery, and
it's rejected? The rejection would be no secret in Hollywood; the
writer is then left exposed and vulnerable, since another studio
will not often jump to buy what has been turned down by a
competitor. And television executives are even less prone to risk
taking than movie people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have aggressive ideas on how to create a new
pipeline into the development of features, but the mechanics of
publishing and movies are very different, and only so many articles
or books can make it into development,'' Gottlieb said.
</P>
<P>
   Synergy, if it would ever work, would certainly be corporate
friendly, but for a writer it would be like being handed a mitten
to shake.

   They're at it again: John Kander and Fred Ebb, who gave the
theater musicals like ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago.'' Now comes word
that their new musical, ``Over and Over,'' with book by Joseph
Stein (``Fiddler on the Roof,'' et al.), is to have its world
premiere on Jan. 6, 1999, at the Signature Theater in Arlington,
Va. The show, to run through Feb. 14, is based on the Pulitzer
Prize-winning Thornton Wilder play, ``The Skin of Our Teeth,''
about the Antrobus family and their maid as they survive floods,
war, the Ice Age and the double feature. Eric Schaeffer, artistic
director of the Signature, will direct.

   Just as Broadway pumps millions of dollars into New York City's
economy, so does London's West End theater nourish Britain's.
According to the Wyndham Report, just published and said to be the
first study of the scale of the theater industry, the total impact
of West End productions in 1997 amounted to about $1.76 billion.
The report said 41,000 jobs depend on West End theater;
theatergoers spent $410 million on tickets for 11.5 million seats
and $710 million on restaurants, hotels, transportation and
merchandise. The theater, a major tourist attraction, contributed
some $369 million to Britain's balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: The report calls London Theater Capital of the World, with
more shows and bigger audiences than anywhere else, including
Broadway.

   NEW YORK _ Tiffany &AMP; Co., celebrating the 150th anniversary of
the birth of Louis Comfort Tiffany, has opened an exhibition of the
jewelry he designed for the 160-year-old firm founded by his
father, Charles Lewis Tiffany. Situated on the second floor of the
store at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street through Aug. 29 and titled
``The Jewelry of Louis Comfort Tiffany: Explorations of Color,
Nature and the Exotic,'' the display of 34 objects, including a
pink sapphire brooch, a green tourmaline-and-pearl necklace and an
Australian black-opal brooch, explores the artisan's love of color,
his fascination with exotic culture and his inspiration from
nature.

   In ceremonies Wednesday at the Turkish Embassy in London,
Britain returned to Turkey seven ancient sculptures from a Scottish
steamer bound for Amsterdam, Netherlands, that sank in 200 feet of
water after a collision in the English Channel in 1894. The Castor
Marbles, named for the ship, are second-century works that include
a figure of Venus, a bust and five funeral monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The marbles have been valued at $40,000 but are considered of
priceless significance to archeologists. They were taken illegally
from Smyrna, now Izmir, by the Dutch Vice Consul Alfred van Lennep,
who acquired many treasures for European museums. The marbles were
retrieved from the Castor in 1994 by a team of divers.

 &HT;    The modest millionaire
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- His newest passion is the sport of golf, and while
Keith Brooking continues to learn the nuances while strolling the
links at Chateau Elan, he has yet to find out how it feels to lose
a $5 golf bet.
</P>
<P>
   Bogeys are frustrating enough for Brooking, a first-round draft
choice of the Atlanta Falcons. He can afford to lose a bet or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a kid who suddenly has a lot of money, and his biggest
concern is like, 'Can I buy a new pair of jeans every month?' ``
said agent Gary Wichard, who negotiated Brooking's landmark
five-year contract totaling $7.9 million. ``Most guys who are
first-round prospects, very early in the process, are worrying
about a line of credit, a new car or whatever. Keith was just
totally oblivious to the money element. And, believe me, that is
the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the inquiring minds who privately wonder what it is like
to turn out the lights a member of middle-class America and wake up
the next morning a millionaire, this bit of advice: It would be
better to find out from a lottery winner than from Brooking, a
former Georgia Tech linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster who could buy just about anything hasn't spent a
penny of his $3.8 million signing bonus -- the most the Falcons
have ever paid a rookie. Outside of the new Lincoln Navigator sport
utility vehihicle he leased a couple weeks before the draft, and a
dark $500 suit purchased from a Men's Wearhouse store so he'd look
good on the banquet circuit, there have been no luxuries for
Brooking or his family.
</P>
<P>
   The suit expense still bothers him. ``Still a lot of money for
something that you aren't going to use very much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking refused to get the Navigator, recalled Wichard, until
he completed his on-campus workout for league scouts and was
assured by personnel directors that he rated as a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Richie Rich of The Flats is more like the Scrooge
McDuck of Suwanee, his trademark football savvy perhaps equalled by
a dollar-wisdom rare for his age.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Falcons signed Brooking, coach Dan Reeves
suggested that maybe too much attention was being paid by others to
the player's money matters. One element in the Falcons' selection
of Brooking, however, was the likelihood that his work ethic and
passion would not be diminished by sudden wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I can't see myself doing anything outrageous,''
Brooking said earlier this week. ``When I was growing up dreaming
about playing in the NFL, I thought to myself, 'Gosh, that's all I
want to do is be like those guys.' I can't ever recall thinking,
'Hey, I wonder how much money they make in the NFL.' Even though
this is my livelihood now, I never think about the money, except in
terms of how, if I'm smart with it, I should never have to worry
about a payday when I'm done playing. After 10 or 12 years, if I do
the right things, I'll be able to sit back and enjoy (the money)
then.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern NFL is filled with stories of
prospects who squandered big money from short careers. Brooking
said he has read those stories. He vows not to become another
chapter (seven).
</P>
<P>
   During training camp, he will continue to live in the tiny
second-floor room of the Falcon Inn that he has shared with wide
receiver Tim Dwight, a fourth-round pick. He may move to an
apartment close to the team's complex at the beginning of the
season and then hunt for a townhouse next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives aren't surprised that Brooking has
eschewed the instant gratification provided by material
possessions. Raised by middle-class parents, Brooking learned at an
early age the ``sweat equity'' process and readily embraced the
concept.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Brenda Hembree of Senoia, and father, Harvey
Brooking of Forest Park, both agreed recently that their son has
simple tastes and appreciates the little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in school, I think it was the 10th grade, we
surprised him with a Blazer,'' said Harvey Brooking. ``It wasn't a
new one, you understand. But it was pretty sharp, and he loved that
thing. ... I don't think Keith ever wanted for anything as a kid.
But if he did, he sure never asked for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooking plans to buy both parents a new car, and he's thinking
of other ways to enhance their middle-class lifestyle. But first,
he'll have to come to grips with the fact that he has enough money
to make a difference in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   It won't come easy. Somewhere amid the rubble of his room in
Suwanee is a color photocopy of his bonus check. The original was
sent via overnight delivery to Judd Rothman, a Long Island,
N.Y.-based financial planner who will help secure Brooking's
future. Two weeks after signing, Brooking still has a problem
comprehending his new tax bracket and what it means.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the government took something like $1.4 million out
of my bonus, and that's probably more money right there than I ever
thought I'd make in a lifetime,'' he said. ``I still shake my head
thinking about it. Then I still have (Wichard's) commission to pay
and some other management fees, so it all adds up. I'm realizing
that if you aren't careful, all those zeroes run out in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooking, a management major at Tech, has instructed Rothman to
grow his nest-egg conservatively. ``I guess,'' he joked, ``I'm 'Mr.
Low-Risk.' `` He said he will be satisfied to live off just a
fraction of his annual base salaries, which start at $550,000 for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That conservative bent is refreshing to Rothman, who manages
dozens of professional athletes, many of whom don't share
Brooking's restraint. A lot of Brooking's bonus money already is in
tax-exempt bonds. Much has been invested in low- to moderate-risk
stocks and bonds that won't yield as much in a strong market, but
won't suffer significantly if the economy suddenly spirals
downward.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said he was retained by another young client about the
same time Brooking hired him. One of the first things the other
youngster did with a bonus was to purchase a $12,000 sound system
for his car. Brooking went for a few options on the Navigator, but
nothing extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he seems to know, unlike a lot of guys who miss the
obvious, is that his playing career won't last forever,'' Rothman
said. ``Because of the way Keith was raised and the discipline he
has, he doesn't need as much as some other guys. It's kind of like
this for him: He's not going to crave a lot of material things to
make him happy in life, because he is pretty happy with how his
life is already.''

 &HT;    AirTran taxis into profitability, looks forward to growth
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- AirTran Airlines completed a long climb back to
profitability in the second quarter, and the carrier's chief
executive said he expects a ``meaningful expansion'' of flights
from Atlanta later this year.
</P>
<P>
   D. Joseph Corr, who has led the revival of the former ValuJet
under a new name and marketing strategy, declined to say how many
flights or new destinations AirTran might add.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're busy in the planning of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran now has 120 daily departures to 28 cities from Atlanta,
which remains the focal point of its operations despite a
headquarters move to Orlando last winter. That followed the merger
of the old ValuJet and Orlando-based AirTran Airways, and the
formation of a new holding company, AirTran Holdings Inc. The
carrier has 24 daily flights from Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, the airline rolled out a new marketing plan
that includes business-class sections, full travel agent booking
links and slicker advertising. Behind the scenes, it improved
computer systems controlling the number of seats offered at certain
fares.
</P>
<P>
   Corr said the moves produced ``dramatic improvement this past
year in load factor, yield and overall unit revenue, particularly
at our Atlanta hub.'' Favorable industry conditions of heavy travel
demand and low fuel prices have helped.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Holdings said it had second quarter net income of $8.6
million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.2 million,
or 17 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $124 million from
$47.8 million. For the six months, AirTran's income rose to
$686,000, or 1 cent a share, compared with a $27.7 million loss, or
51 cents. Prior-year results include only the old ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   The profit ended eight consecutive losing quarters since the
carrier resumed flying in fall 1996. It was shut down by federal
regulators that summer, following the Flight 592 tragedy that was
later blamed on mistakes by a contractor and ValuJet's lax
oversight of the work. The company survived on cash reserves, which
stood at about $170 million at the time of the shutdown and now
total $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have taken an airline that was shut down and had
a very, very negative image and brought it back,'' said analyst
James D. Parker of Robinson-Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker remains ``a bit cautious'' because AirTran still is
filling fewer seats than other carriers. ``Revenue is a bit soft
relative to the industry,'' he said. Corr, who joined the airline
after the restart, predicted the second quarter profit, which
exceeded analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran stock rose 37 1/2 cents to $7.12 1/2 on Wednesday.

 &HT;    Hurt shoulder leaves Lehman uncertain
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ It figures. After battling winds and
beating balls out of the heather for three days, American Tom
Lehman, 39, strained his right shoulder when falling on it while
``messing around with his kids'' Tuesday night and jeopardized his
status for today's first round of the British Open at Royal
Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's right arm was put in a sling after receiving treatment
from Dr. Michael Allen, chief medical officer of the Royal &AMP;
Ancient Golf Club. Although Lehman earlier in the day said the
shoulder was OK, indications Wednesday night were that he might not
be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the shoulder feels today, Lehman has some extra
time to recover. He goes off at 2:45 p.m. (9:45 a.m. EDT) with Mark
James and Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   Watson interests tabloids
</P>
<P>
   Five-time champion Tom Watson's personal life has been
significantly more turbulent than his golf game in recent months,
having been in the midst of a divorce from his wife Linda. Watson
also has quit drinking, fueling speculation that it had reached a
problem stage. Asked about his ``battle with alcohol,'' Watson
said, ``I don't want to discuss that. It's a private thing with
me.'' ... Told he was listed at 50-1 in local odds and asked how
much he might bet on himself, Watson said, ``I would go out and put
20 pounds on it.'' ... Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who shot an
opening 76 last year at Royal Troon and never seriously contended
at his home course, admits to feeling less pressure at Royal
Birkdale. ``I've put a lot of pressure on myself in the past,''
Montgomerie said. ``I've learned that I do play better when I'm
more relaxed.'' ... England's Lee Westwood, who probably would have
been Britain's favorite even without a win at Loch Lomond last
week: ``I'm not afraid of winning; I'm not afraid of losing. If I
don't win the Open this year, it won't be the end of the world to
me. I would dearly love it, but it's not life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Love says backimproved
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III's problems this week have been more with
fractured travel plans than with his tender lower back. Love got to
the Jacksonville airport Monday for a flight to Manchester only to
discover he had forgotten a travel wallet that contained his ticket
and passport. ``I was already packed,'' Love said, ``and then Drew
(his son) wanted to throw and hit some baseballs. I just got
distracted and forgot it.'' Love arrived Tuesday and received
treatment on his back from Columbus physical therapist Tom Boers.
It felt strong enough Wednesday for Love to hit range balls after
his round. ``I feel like I'm ready to go,'' said Love, who tied for
33rd at the Masters and missed the cut at the U.S. Open. ``Now I
think I can really get after it. He (Boers) just had to get all
that inflammation and pain out of it first.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, wife back together
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, always a favorite with the British tabloids _ and why
not with three marriages, a weight problem, alcoholism and a Claret
Jug on his resume? _ said Wednesday he has been back with his wife
Paulette for the past two months. She had filed for divorce after a
March 1997 incident at The Players Championship, when Daly went on
a drunken rampage in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. Daly said he has lost
about 20 pounds, dropping from 247 to about 225, but still looks
quite heavy. ``Actually, my right arm hugs this fat belly here,''
Daly said of his backswing. ``When I lose weight, it flies all over
the place.'' ... All vehicles were searched in parking lots
Wednesday by Merseyside police as a precaution against a possible
incident. The Grand National horse race at nearby Aintree last year
was postponed because of a bomb threat phoned in by the IRA,
prompting Merseyside police to be ``better safe than sorry.''

 &HT;    Wachovia follows leaders with double-digit earnings
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Like the other major banks doing business in Atlanta,
Wachovia reported a double-digit earnings gain, posting a 17
percent rise in second-quarter operating income.
</P>
<P>
   From operations, which exclude non-recurring charges, the
Winston-Salem-based banking company earned $230.3 million vs.
$196.8 million a year ago, and $1.09 per share, a penny ahead of
the First Call consensus estimate, against 98 cents last year, on
more shares.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia wrote off acquisition costs of $30.8 million, which
reduced second-quarter net income to $209.9 million, or $1 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia, with total assets of $64.7 billion, earned 1.44
percent, up from 1.38, percent on all its money-making assets, and
had a 17.7 percent return on equity, or the shareholders' stake,
down slightly from 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its peers, Wachovia got a big lift from
non-traditional banking revenue, such as financial services fees,
which rose 15.6 percent to $486.1 million. The higher personnel
costs associated with these business lines helped boost
non-interest expenses 23 percent to $517 million. Overall, however,
Wachovia only spent about 53.5 cents for each dollar of revenue it
captured, unchanged from a year ago and an indication it managed
overhead efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many peers, Wachovia posted a two-digit increase in loan
revenue, banking's traditional bread and butter business. Net
interest income rose 14.5 percent to $514.3 million. Also bucking
the trend, Wachovia improved the spread between what it pays for
money and earns from money, to 4.21 percent, up from 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for these gains is Wachovia does a lot of profitable
credit card lending, but the downside is a relatively high
percentage of slow-pay and no-pay customers. Charge-offs increased
8.2 percent to $68.2 million. Excluding credit card losses in the
quarter, Wachovia's write-offs would have declined 43.3 percent to
$5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Non-performing loans rose 30.2 percent, to $127.4 million
because of acquisitions, and Wachovia increased its provision for
loan losses 8.6 percent to $68.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, Wachovia's operating income was $448.4
million, or $2.13 per share, versus $390.3 million, or $1.94 per
share. Net income was $405.2 million, or $1.93 per share, in the
latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On a day many bank stocks were down, Wachovia closed at $86.18
3/4 down 56 1/4 cents.

BANDERAS QUITS CONTROVERSIAL FILM ABOUT TURKISH LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Debate over the political legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the
founder of modern Turkey, has upset plans for a film about him that
was to have starred Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   After an intense letter-writing campaign led by Greek-Americans,
Banderas withdrew from the project. His agent, Lisa Baum, said he
wanted to devote his full energy to another project, ``The Phantom
of the Opera.'' Producers of the Ataturk film, however, say
Banderas was reacting to pressure from Greek-Americans and others
who consider Ataturk unworthy of favorable portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The principal figure behind the film is Tarquin Olivier, 61, a
son of Laurence Olivier. Olivier, a financier, hopes to begin a new
phase of his career by producing the film, which he said would cost
$25 million exclusive of Banderas' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to keep Banderas in the film because much of the financing
is contingent on his participation, Olivier plans to fly to
Hollywood this week to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very enthusiastic, but obviously he was very put
off by these letters,'' Olivier said in an interview in New York,
where he stopped on his way to Hollywood. ``Our contacts with
people in the Greek community here tell us that this campaign only
involves a small number of people. It's motivated by a feeling of
hatred not only toward Ataturk but toward Turkey in general. I'm
very much hoping that we can make him see this, and that we don't
get into a situation which undermines freedom of speech and freedom
of the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Notices of Banderas' intention to play Ataturk began appearing
in Greek-American publications several weeks ago. One of them
published a letter signed by ``a member of the Greek community of
N.Y.'' describing Ataturk as a ``savage maniac'' who was also ``a
child molester of both sexes, a mass murderer, a destroyer of Greek
civilization and in general a disgrace to human civilization as we
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were accompanied by appeals to readers to send
protest letters to Banderas and his wife, actress Melanie Griffith.
Olivier estimated that they might have received as many as 1,000
letters.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has not been universally welcomed by
Greek-Americans. An editorial in this week's edition of The Greek
American, a weekly newspaper published on New York's Long Island,
said it had caused many Greeks ``to cringe in embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All-out demonization is not serious,'' the editorial said.
``The end result is to make us look like ethnic hysterics, with
these groups' objections usually showing up our own chauvinism and
narrow-mindedness more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to make a film about Ataturk, an early 20th century
military leader who won glory in battle and went on to forge a
modern nation on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, have a long
history. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Omar Sharif were among actors
involved in such efforts at various times.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the project is apparently falling victim to
contemporary politics. Some Greek-Americans and Armenian-Americans
fear that the film will be reverential, portraying Ataturk as a
hero and ignoring what they consider his evil deeds. They fear that
such a portrayal might lead to a warming of popular feeling toward
Turkey, a historical rival of both Greece and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   Ataturk was responsible for pushing Greek forces from Anatolia
after World War I, but then he pursued a peaceful policy toward
Greece. His friendship with the Greek prime minister of the time,
Elevtherios Venizelos, became so strong that Venizelos nominated
him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934, praising him as ``a great
reformer'' who made ``a precious contribution to the cause of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The script for the planned Ataturk film is by an American
writer, Timothy Prager, and is based on a 1964 biography by Lord
Kinross that is generally considered less than definitive but the
best available. Bruce Beresford, whose films have included
``Breaker Morant'' and ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' has agreed to
direct.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish government officials were wary of the idea for many
years, fearing that any portrayal showing Ataturk as having human
failings might undermine the veritable cult that has grown up
around his memory. But Olivier and his Turkish-born wife, Zelfa,
said they had won pledges of cooperation from President Suleyman
Demirel and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz. They said they had not
shown the script to either one or to any other Turkish official.
</P>
<P>
   Ataturk, who died in 1938, is a naturally appealing subject for
a film biography. A brilliant military officer and social
visionary, he was also a ruthless national leader with little
patience for the niceties of democracy. His array of personal
quirks and his relationship with a European woman add spice to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier said he hoped to make a film comparable to ``Gandhi,''
which gave many filmgoers a positive view not only of Gandhi but
also of India. That prospect is precisely what upsets people who
believe that any story favorable to a Turkish historical figure
would improve the image of modern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   As far as is known, the letter-writing campaign was generated
entirely within the United States. There is no indication of any
involvement by government or private figures in either Greece or
Armenia.

YELLOW JERSEY ELUDES HINCAPIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The yellow jersey in the Tour de France once again eluded
American rider George Hincapie, who started the day just two
seconds back and is now separated from the race's overall leader by
11 seconds. Still, his third-place position keeps the team
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain hopeful,'' said team spokeswoman Margot Myers from
France Wednesday night. Besides, she said, look at Erik Zabel, the
leader three days ago who is now a minute back. In other words, in
the race where every second counts, leaders can fall _ or be
created _ in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's 157-mile stage, the longest of the three-week Tour,
started in Plouay in the Brittany region and made its way southeast
over flat roads to the finish in Cholet.
</P>
<P>
   Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands raced to the sprint finish
in 5 hours 45 minutes, while Australian Stuart O'Grady took over
the yellow jersey. He became the fourth different rider to lead the
overall standings in the five days of racing, and only the second
Australian _ besides Phil Anderson _ to wear the jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And even though O'Grady finished eight seconds behind in the
main pack, he won two of the three sprints and came in third in
another to gain an extra 14 seconds that moved him to the top of
the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie took third in the first sprint of the day, but later
crashed when the pack piled up around a tight corner just two miles
from the finish. Still, he and most of his US Postal Service
teammates finished with most of the pack that was eight seconds
behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   O'Grady's lead was especially satisfying for his GAN team after
Chris Boardman, who won the prologue and held the yellow jersey for
a day, crashed Monday and is out of the race. He is recovering from
a concussion and cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly flat course seemed tailor-made for O'Grady, a sprint
specialist who has won cycling medals on the Olympic track events
and was a world team champion with Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's 142-mile stage that moves farther east is again flat.
And like Wednesday, the race has three bonus sprints that Hincapie
can hope to capitalize on to move up in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the racing at the Tour, the drug controversy
involving the Festina team continued. The team's main sponsor, the
Festina watch company, is threatening to leave the team if there is
evidence of drug use among the riders.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Belgian member of Festina's team was arrested after
police found a large quantity of performance-enhancing drugs in the
Festina car he was driving.

BRITISH FIRM AGREES TO BUY MCI'S INTERNET BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless PLC of Britain said Wednesday, as expected,
that it had agreed to acquire MCI Communications Corp.'s Internet
business for $1.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was also accompanied by the Justice Department's
approval for MCI's pending $37 billion acquisition by Worldcom Inc.
The Federal Communications Commission is the only major regulatory
body that has yet to rule on the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had been worried that a combined MCI and
Worldcom could dominate the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The main beneficiary of those concerns has been Cable and
Wireless, which under its first American chief executive, Richard
Brown, has been trying to expand into the U.S. market and into
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   By buying MCI's Internet operation, Cable and Wireless, which
has far-flung telecommunications interests in Asia and the
Caribbean, would immediately become a significant player in the
American Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a transforming deal for Cable and Wireless,'' Brown said
in an interview. ``We pick up over 3,000 major U.S. corporate
accounts where we have the Internet contracts, and being as global
as we are we can build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said MCI and Worldcom had agreed to refrain from trying to
win back those customers for 18 months. Brown said he expected the
Internet unit to generate revenue of about $650 million in the
fiscal year beginning next April.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said the sale was the largest corporate
divestiture in merger history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger as originally proposed would have given
Worldcom/MCI a significant proportion of the nation's Internet
traffic, giving the company the ability to cut off or reduce the
quality of Internet services that it provided to its rivals,'' Joel
Klein, the assistant attorney general who runs the department's
antitrust division, said in a statement. ``This divestiture
benefits anyone who relies on the Internet because it preserves
competition among major Internet service providers.''
</P>
<P>
   In May MCI agreed to sell its wholesale Internet unit to Cable
and Wireless for $625 million. That operation provides high-speed
cyberspace links to smaller Internet providers. But regulators in
the United States and Europe insisted that MCI also sell off its
units that provide cyberspace services directly to business and
residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.75 billion price includes the previous $625 million.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union signed off on Worldcom's acquisition of MCI
earlier this month. Few telecommunications experts expect the FCC's
review to hold up the deal for long.

STATE OFFICIAL SAYS BANNING ATM FEES HELPS CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Stands for D'AMATO-BANKS on budget.)  
 (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Connecticut's attorney general told Congress
Wednesday that his state's experience banning automated teller
machine fees shows that banks wouldn't be hurt by a federal ban on
such charges.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal told the Senate banking committee that banks
are doing a flourishing ATM business in Connecticut, despite the
fact that the state bans all ATM transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``ATMs in Connecticut are as common as in other states,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified in favor of pending federal legislation
that would prohibit extra transaction fees incurred when a consumer
uses another bank's ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a customer using an ATM at a bank where the customer
doesn't normally do business incurs two transaction fees, one from
his or her regular bank and one from the bank whose ATM is being
used.
</P>
<P>
   Not all banks levy the extra charge. According to a 1998 survey
by the General Accounting Office _ the investigative branch of

at least some of their ATMs, up from 39 percent in 1997. In
addition, the number of ATMs with fees increased from 59 percent in
1997 to 79 percent in 1998.

   The size of the ATM fees also increased, rising from an average
of $.69 in December 1997 to $1 in February 1998, according to the
GAO report.

<P>
   Consumers would benefit from the federal ban, Blumenthal said,

in locations outside of banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago's Wrigley Field had just a single ATM before the 1997
advent of (transaction fees) in Illinois,'' he said.``There are now
at least five at the park. This sort of relentless competition
clearly benefits consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted consumers have other methods of avoiding the
additional charges, including cashing checks and using ATM machines
that do not have transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   Government interference would ``only distort the marketplace and
hurt both banks and their customers,'' Ward added.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Meat trucks growl, shifting their gears as they
lumber down the avenues around the Lincoln Tunnel. Empty taxis dash
across West 36th Street in a race to the corner gaseteria. Carriage
horses plod the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Toward 10th Avenue, brick tenements overlook the tunnel ramps,
their fire escapes silhouetted against huge warehouses. The
late-afternoon sun bathes a dozen parking lots, and rush-hour packs
thousands of cars into the crawling jam that nudges commuters back
and forth from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As commuters edge into the tunnel, few are likely to ponder the
fate of the buildings around them. But some 6,000 people live in
this 16-block area hemmed in by the Lincoln Tunnel, the Jacob
Javits Convention Center and two of Manhattan's most famous
thoroughfares, 34th Street and 42d Street. And the population is
growing, slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In this gritty pocket, a sense of comradeship and
interconnection is emerging. There is also an awareness sprouting
like a seed through rocky ground that something is happening. The
city is abuzz with often-warring proposals for megadevelopments,
although plans to expand the Javits Center to 42d Street seem less
likely now that the owner of a key site said on Monday that he
would start to build 1,800 units of housing in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Developers have greedily eyed the tenements and parking lots;
one has four proposals on his desk. Two weeks ago, a bright orange
lozenge of a sign went up for new loft rentals on 34th Street
between 10th and 11th avenues _ a first. While the high-tech lofts
(with marble baths) will rent for $4,000 to $6,000 a month, that's
still 33 percent below comparable places in Chelsea and TriBeCa.
There's new pressure to change the zoning to allow river-view
apartment towers and loft conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Among residents, a play is unfolding: 6,000 Neighbors in Search
of a Neighborhood. There's a new community garden and a new
playground on West 39th Street, and rooftops with sunflowers
growing in wooden kegs. New-style residents, like Jene and Kitty
Highstein, a sculptor and a nurse, have rented here in the last
year. Chelsea, to the south, was their first choice; but this
place, they say, is more authentic, more peaceful _ and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The new people brag about buying quail and skate and
fresh-ground paprika in the shops along Ninth Avenue; about finding
the perfect late-night car service; about making friends. They
fancy they've discovered the place; but some famous names in
architecture _ Richard Meier, Lella and Massimo Vignelli, Charles
Gwathmey and Robert A.M. Stern _ carved out offices here years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vignelli calls her part of town the Wild West. Others call
it Clinton South. Or Hell's Kitchen. One enterprising realtor dubs
it Chelsea Heights. Call it TunJav: between the Lincoln Tunnel and
the Javits Center.
</P>
<P>
   Leni Schwendinger, a lighting designer who lives on West 35th
Street, helped found the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association,
which estimates the area's population at less than 6,000. In the
bleaker blocks toward the Javits Center, Ms. Schwendinger said,
``There's been a change in both spirit and energy within the last
seven years.'' She points to volunteer cleanups, community gardens
and 50 sidewalk trees planted by her group. ``We're becoming more
connected,'' she said. ``We're becoming a small village.''
</P>
<P>
   Until March, Antonio DaMotta, a Brazilian-born furniture and
interior designer, lived in the heart of chic: Manhattan's flatiron
district, at 22d Street and Broadway. ``It was wonderful for the
first five years,'' he said. ``Then it became so overrated, so
overcrowded.'' When his lease was up, he and Robert Ketterman, a
public relations consultant, decided to team up.
</P>
<P>
   The designer wanted a two-bedroom apartment with light and
outdoor space _ and a rent under $2,000. ``Well, that's kind of
tough,'' his real estate agent conceded, ``but because you're a
designer, there is one place that isn't even on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it was a wreck,'' DaMotta said, as he surveyed his
now-elegant decor from a splendid oversize tomato-red damask couch
that he designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one look at it and said `No way!' '' Ketterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Their apartment is at 525 West 36th Street, a late-19th-century
brick row house that has been gut-renovated and painted blue-green.
An ornate wrought-iron door has been added by the landlord, a
filmmaker who lives there and runs his business from next door. The
building is a name tag's throw from the vast black-glass convention
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't kid you,'' Ketterman said. ``It's a shlep when you
need a quart of milk sometimes. But in the morning, I just yell out
the window to Hanna's across the street, and if she has some,
she'll send a delivery boy across the street with it.''
</P>
<P>
   DaMotta added: ``I'm glad it's weird. It's like leaving town _
it feels like you're someplace else. But with Chelsea encroaching
up and Disney encroaching down, this is the only place for anything
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm foreseeing this great development,'' he speculated. ``And
I'll grow sick of it all and have to move out.''
</P>
<P>
   He is on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that parking lot,'' said Robert Skolnick, the development
director for a large Queens-based real estate organization, as he
cruised by the corner of 38th Street and 10th Street in his black
Mercedes. ``Parking and signage, parking and signage,'' he recited
like a mantra, referring to the big billboards over the lots.
``Underutilized,'' he explained. ``This area is ripe for housing.
Imagine the river views. Condos, rentals, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Skolnick said that at least a half-dozen developers were
interested. ``I keep running into the same seven or eight
characters,'' he said, smiling. He has four proposals for housing
developments, he said. ``Three new construction and one rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   The community board has filed recommendations with the City
Planning Commission to change the zoning from predominantly
manufacturing to mixed use, including midrise residential.
Otherwise, developers of new housing are limited to 42d Street and
most of 34th Street, Ninth Avenue and a part of 11th Avenue that
includes the Imperatore land.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Joseph Rose, director of the commission, said the
area ``has the potential for a new wave of development.''
</P>
<P>
   But residential zoning changes will take a back seat to
decisions about a new Pennsylvania Station, Javits Center
expansion, Yankee Stadium and job creation. ``It's an important
growth corridor,'' he said. ``It's something we're looking at
carefully.''

 NEW YORK: at carefully.''

<P>
   While City Hall considers, apartment prices are soaring. Vera
Lightstone, president of the co-op board at a loft building on West
37th Street, says prices have tripled since she bought in the
mid-1980s. And Michael Goldenberg, sales director of the Halstead
Property Company's Greenwich Village office, said owners are asking
for the moon. The price of an 1,850-square-foot loft in Ms.
Lightstone's building is $625,000; a five-story walk-up with 20
rent-stabilized apartments on West 36th Street is $675,000. A
vacant two-story commercial building on West 36th Street is $3.1
million. Five years ago, he said, prices might have been less than
half.
</P>
<P>
   But TunJav will never be TriBeCa, with its unbroken rows of
magnificent late-19th-century cast-iron commercial buildings. There
are too many parking lots and nondescript tenements. Like TriBeCa,
however, the district still feels very bleak _ although it doesn't
feel dangerous, even on a Tuesday at midnight in July. The
community board said crime has decreased substantially in TunJav,
with drug-dealing down about 85 percent in the last two years. Ms.
Lightstone, who retreated to the Upper West Side for a year, moved
back. ``The crack was so bad,'' she said. ``Now it's safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lella and Massimo Vignelli, the internationally known designers,
work on the top floor of a 1906 warehouse building on 10th Avenue.
``The situation has improved quite a lot,'' said Ms. Vignelli, as
she moved across her charcoal grey carpet to look down on what is
now a fairly well-groomed lot. ``When we first came, the lot was
overgrown, and the streetwalkers used it to turn their tricks.
There was an old sofa, and sometimes they would look up and see us
all staring down _ and the woman would shake her fist at us!''
</P>
<P>
   ``And now we really do have a Wild West,'' she said with a
laugh. ``Did you see that log cabin and the saloon across the
street?'' They're part of the new wave: a bar called The Gold Rush,
complete with cacti, and a log cabin, Christinae's Country Kitchen,
complete with water wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Massimo Vignelli is convinced that ``the entire Hudson River
over the next 50 years will become like Rio de Janeiro, apartment
houses all the way down to the Battery, sensational.'' Along with
almost everyone interviewed, he hopes that Yankee Stadium isn't
built in the area, once the favorite plan of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. ``See that parking lot?'' he said, peering out the
window. ``At four o'clock, the roads will look just like that
parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people are moving in. Isabelle Bosquet, 32, looks out
at the ramp of the Lincoln Holland Tunnel from her rented studio
apartment. Unlike DaMotta and many of the loft dwellers, she lives
in a white brick, postwar building on West 34th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bosquet, who is French, is a flower arranger whose business,
she says, is just starting to take off. She wanted to live in
Chelsea, to be near the Flower District, but she didn't want to pay
the high prices. Here, her L-shaped studio isn't dirt-cheap but it
is affordable: $1,075.
</P>
<P>
   Jene and Kitty Highstein moved into the building next door to
DaMotta. Highstein, a sculptor, tracked down the rental himself.
``I spent several days a week just walking up from 14th Street.''
he said, ``following construction workers into buildings, asking
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first saw his two-bedroom apartment, he said, it was
rubble. Although Highstein had lived in TriBeCa for 25 years, he
and his family had moved to the country. ``Then I decided the
schools in New York City were better for my sons, 8 and 12,'' he
said. The boys were accepted into magnet schools. Highstein, a
rugged-looking man who wields a mean-looking sculptor's hammer,
praised his surroundings. ``It's a cul-de-sac with no through
traffic, so everybody knows you on the street. There's a dry
cleaner right on 34th Street, and there's a great health club on
43rd Street.''
</P>
<P>
   After snagging the apartment, Highstein found a cavernous studio
only two buildings away for $1,600 _ the only artist in a classic
industrial loft owned by an auto-parts dealer.
</P>
<P>
   His windows overlook his family's apartment, including their
brand-new picket-fenced deck with a blue and white tablecloth on
the table. ``This is a neighborhood,'' he said. ``This is basic New
York.''

STATE OFFICIAL SAYS BANNING ATM FEES HELPS CONSUMERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Connecticut's attorney general told Congress
Wednesday that his state's experience banning automated teller
machine fees shows that banks wouldn't be hurt by a federal ban on
such charges.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal told the Senate banking committee that banks
are doing a flourishing ATM business in Connecticut, despite the
fact that the state bans all ATM transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``ATMs in Connecticut are as common as in other states,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified in favor of pending federal legislation
that would prohibit extra transaction fees incurred when a consumer
uses another bank's ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a customer using an ATM at a bank where the customer
doesn't normally do business incurs two transaction fees, one from
his or her regular bank and one from the bank whose ATM is being
used.
</P>
<P>
   Not all banks levy the extra charge. According to a 1998 survey
by the General Accounting Office _ the investigative branch of
Congress _ 64 percent of banks with ATMs charge transaction fees on
at least some of their ATMs, up from 39 percent in 1997. In
addition, the number of ATMs with fees increased from 59 percent in
1997 to 79 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the ATM fees also increased, rising from an average
of $.69 in December 1997 to $1 in February 1998, according to the
GAO report.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers would benefit from the federal ban, Blumenthal said,
because they would not have to search for ATM machines that do not
charge transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said the fees are unnecessary because the ATMs save
banks money by reducing the payroll for tellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fees are nothing more than an additional bite at the
consumer's financial apple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a sponsor of the legislation, said
additional ATM fees ``continue to spread like a plague across the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the only choice the consumer has is to pay
up or go home,'' D'Amato said, adding that he will bring the bill
to the Senate floor later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience of ATMs has made them extremely popular. The
number of ATMs rose from fewer than 100,000 in 1993 to over 165,000
in 1998, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the bill say the fees are necessary to finance ATM
access around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   John Ward, representing the Consumers Banking Association, an
organization with approximately 750 members from financial
institutions, testified that the additional fees help pay for ATMs
in locations outside of banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago's Wrigley Field had just a single ATM before the 1997
advent of (transaction fees) in Illinois,'' he said.``There are now
at least five at the park. This sort of relentless competition
clearly benefits consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted consumers have other methods of avoiding the
additional charges, including cashing checks and using ATM machines
that do not have transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   Government interference would ``only distort the marketplace and
hurt both banks and their customers,'' Ward added.

   WHAT HEAT DOES TO YOUR BODY
</P>
<P>
   When July temperatures soars above 100, the heat index is
usually 5 to 10 degrees above that. But it gets worse: The heat
index, which factors in the relative humidity to tell us what it
really feels like out there, is measured in the shade. Walk through
an unshaded area _ especially a sidewalk or parking lot _ and you
can add 15 to 20 degrees to that heat index.
</P>
<P>
   After the heat index hits 105, the body loses its ability to
cool itself properly. And when the temperature outside is higher
than body temperature, it's more difficult for the body to release
heat. In fact, the body starts absorbing heat.
</P>
<P>
   High temperatures can cause two health conditions: heat
exhaustion and heatstroke. Both are serious, but heatstroke is
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Sufferers of heat exhaustion feel hot, but their body
temperature isn't any higher than normal; they are sweaty and tired
and may complain of dizziness or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   To treat heat exhaustion, take the victim out of the heat and
provide plenty of cool fluids. Cold water or a cold wet towel will
help cool the body.
</P>
<P>
   With heatstroke, body temperature is higher than normal.
Sufferers are not alert and may not be aware of what is happening
around them, or they may faint. Other signs are hot, dry skin _ you
stop sweating _ and paleness. Heatstroke victims should be given
fluids, cooled down and taken immediately to an emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DRINK
</P>
<P>
   Lots of water. You need 32 ounces an hour in weather like this,
no matter what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Sports drinks are also beneficial because they replace
electrolytes and other materials that keep the body in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Soft drinks and tea don't help; the caffeine acts as a diuretic,
which gets rid of fluids, and the carbonation in soft drinks does
nothing to replace the body's fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Don't drink alcohol. Alcoholic beverages also take away fluids,
and the heat speeds up its effect on the body.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO WEAR
</P>
<P>
   Lightweight, light-colored and loose clothing. Light colors
reflect the sun's rays, and loose clothing keeps air circulating
around you.
</P>
<P>
   A hat. It's the same concept as wearing a hat in winter to keep
warm: You lose heat through your head, and you absorb heat through
your head as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreen _ at least SPF 15. Any part of your skin that's not
covered up should be protected by sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO FEEL COOLER
</P>
<P>
   If you have a kiddie pool, break it out. Fill it with water and
soak your feet, sit in it, dunk your head. Throw in some ice blocks
and play ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardware stores sell misters for less than $20 that transform a
stream of water from a garden hose into a cool, wispy mist.
</P>
<P>
   The low-tech approach also works. A wet towel or cloth on the
back of your neck will bring your body temperature down.
</P>
<P>
   Zoos keep polar bears cool by freezing fish in blocks of ice.
You may not want to eat uncooked frozen dinners, but frozen treats
like an Astro Pop or a fudge bar will keep you cool. Ice cream
melts too fast.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS AND HEAT
</P>
<P>
   Parents watching their kids play outside should remember that
the children are more active and will begin to suffer from the heat
sooner than adults.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to how kids are acting. If they're acting abnormal
or confused, check it out: If they have a fever, especially if
they're not sweating, they should receive emergency care for
heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Never lock a child in a car for any amount of time. Within
minutes, the temperature inside a car can reach the outside
temperature and beyond, as high as 120 to 150 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   KEEPING PETS COOL
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor dogs, especially those with dark coats, need a good
breeze. If possible, place a fan to blow on your dog's resting
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs need plenty of water and shade. A plastic kiddie pool
filled with clean water every day is perfect for dogs to lie in, as
long as they don't chew the pool to shreds instead.
</P>
<P>
   Run the sprinkler for a while to cool off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Or give outdoor dogs a thorough soaking with the hose in the
morning. They might not like it at first, but they'll be a lot
cooler through the day. Experts say never to put ice-cold water on
a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Outside cats are usually OK with high temperatures, as long as
they can find a shady spot to hide in and have access to clean
water.
</P>
<P>
   Never leave a pet in the car or a hot house. Trapped in a car,
even with windows cracked, a dog or cat will bake very quickly.
Inside the house, they need just a little bit of air conditioning
to be comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Shaving a dog in summer can do more harm than good. One vet said
that doing that to a long-haired dog is comparable to taking all
the insulation out of your home's attic. It increases the risk of
heatstroke. Remember, dogs don't sweat; they pant for self-cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Birds shouldn't be moved repeatedly between inside and outside.
When inside, they should be kept out of direct sun and away from
direct vents. Be sure to give birds lots of fresh water and food
daily.
</P>
<P>
   BEYOND AC
</P>
<P>
   Some tips to cool your house, besides running the AC for 24
hours a day:
</P>
<P>
   In ancient India, people hung damp floor mats in the doorway
that received the most wind.
</P>
<P>
   Other ancients sprayed water on the walls of their huts.
</P>
<P>
   Plant trees. Many older homes, built before air conditioning,
used natural shade. It can feel 10 degrees cooler in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   Quick-growing vines and flowers, such as morning glory or
hollyhocks, will provide a cooling effect around windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
   Insulated window shades and awnings can keep the heat out. Even
a bedsheet hung over a window will help.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to daydream about snow. Studies show that the
body reacts to daydreams. So cool your thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   CAREFUL, HOT CAR!
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the best way to cope with no air conditioning in your
car is to have your friends drive. But here are some survival tips
for when you have to go your own way:
</P>
<P>
   When getting into a hot car, lay something over the vinyl seats.
A large T-shirt can fit nicely over the back of a bucket seat.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a beaded seat cover, take it out. It'll make your
bare skin itch.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to drive naked (legal unless you're lewd about it
or offend someone), bring something to cover yourself in case you
must use a drive-through window, or a thin-skinned trucker passes
you.
</P>
<P>
   Drive with an icy drink in hand. At least your hand will be
cool. (But be careful with the slushes. Gulping can cause brain
freeze, which can make ordinary driving difficult.)
</P>
<P>
   When you park, use a sun shield in the windshield. The blockers
can be awkward, but they'll keep your car a little cooler.

FARMING BOXWOODS IN CHANGING COTILLION OF GREEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By MAC GRISWOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLDWICK, N.J. _ Say ``boxwood,'' and what comes to mind are
Colonial Williamsburg's precise edgings, green billows at English
country houses _ in short, an air of tradition and control. Boxwood
has tempted the gardener's shears since Egyptians first clipped
formal hedges around 4000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's origins are wilder than its conventional image
suggests. Buxus sempervirens, the best known species, originated in
the forests of southern Europe and the Caucasus and can still be
seen, airy and glittering, in the woods of the Luberon, in France.
Garden hybrids like Suffruticosa, called dwarf edging box, are
denser and more compact.
</P>
<P>
   Easygoing boxwood can live for three centuries. It needs a half
day of sun and prefers no cultivation because it has delicate
surface roots. But for many gardeners the plant's overriding
attraction is that deer don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   For Claire and George Weiss, the need for a cash crop inspired a
three-quarter-acre field in Oldwick planted with slow-growing
boxwood that endorses change and succession, a sharply contemporary
notion. Come back in five years, and the severe, serene patterns of
boxwood will have changed, as plants are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Weisses' landscape architect, Margie Ruddick, whose company
is in Philadelphia, was responsible for dragging boxwood into the
1990s. Her early '80s Harvard landscape training led her to be
suspicious of what she calls ``heroic projects, closed systems and
single viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   In its pristine practicality and quotidian layout, the Weisses'
10-acre property in Hunterdon County was a joint project by Ruddick
and Steven Harris, an architect who worked the new luxurious
compound around a spare farmhouse that dated back to 1797.
</P>
<P>
   Selling boxwoods allows the Weisses to benefit from New Jersey's
Farm Assessment Program, which entitles landholders who sell plants
and produce to a sizable tax break. In a former pasture, 850 small
boxwoods are laid out in two patterns, which intersect and merge
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The first pattern, a grid, evokes farm fields and echoes the
agricultural forms Harris used for the 3,500-square-foot house and
outbuildings. The second pattern, a diagonal, forms two
forced-perspective allees that widen from four feet near the house
to eight feet at their terminus, reversing the usual effect of the
optical trick by telescoping distance instead of lengthening it.
</P>
<P>
   Allees are part of ``power gardening,'' a style that dates to
Louis XIV, when far horizons seen from a central point symbolized
royal power. But here these long axes are used as a playful, ironic
commentary. They don't emanate from a central point, turning
perspective on its head, and they refuse to lead anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said she feels as if the boxwoods ``are moving with me''
when she walks through the boxwoods. Sometimes both patterns seem
to disappear, like moire fabric. ``It's like a dancer,'' Ruddick
explained. ``You are involved in one pattern, and when you
encounter another pattern, that encounter changes the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss looks at the farm every morning from the window at her
upstairs dressing table. ``It's like an aerial shot of a ballroom
scene,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rows are spaced at least four feet apart so the mower can get
between them. (Even a dream farm's design must bow to the
everyday.)
</P>
<P>
   Ruddick recommended crosses of Korean littleleaf boxwood, Buxus
microphylla var. koreana, with Buxus sempervirens, choosing the
hardiest cultivars and the ones most in demand: Green Gem, a
two-foot mound; Green Mountain, a pyramidal oval five feet tall,
and Green Velvet, a slightly larger version of Green Gem. (A good
cultivar guide is the ``Boxwood Handbook: A Practical Guide to
Knowing and Growing Boxwood''; $15 from the American Boxwood
Society, P.O. Box 85, Boyce, Va. 22620.)
</P>
<P>
   Three bigger Suffruticosas stand on a stone terrace at the heart
of the farm as permanent witnesses to what will be a ceaselessly
changing harvest of their fellows. It's this bracing brush between
agriculture and ornamental gardening that makes the boxwood farm a
work of art. Farm pattern is based on change _ crops are reaped and
replanted. Ornamental gardens have always represented a struggle
for permanence in the face of aging, their most touching aspect.
</P>
<P>
   The Weiss farm, which is also a garden, celebrates the
subversive but lovely truth that every garden is what Ruddick calls
``a series of gardens over time.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOOINOOI, South Africa _ Barely 15 minutes after Jeanne Pereira
hit the panic button on her new radio system, she could see her
neighbors' banged-up trucks tearing down the approach roads to her
avocado farm here, leaving clouds of dust that would linger long
after two bedraggled suspects had surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Laborers on the farm had spotted two black men, kneeling in the
tall grass, surveying the main house from the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response was so quick, it was very nice,'' said Mrs.
Pereira. Within minutes of the capture, she had her maid handing
out mugs of coffee to the farmers, who mingled casually in her
yard, shotguns and automatic rifles hanging from their shoulders.
``I was so nervous when my workers said they saw there were two
boys out here with guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers around here, like many elsewhere in the country, are
numbering their farms on color-coded maps and setting up command
posts in their basements where automatic weapons, helmets, gas
masks and bulletproof vests are at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on white farmers have been mounting. In the last four
years, nearly 500 farmers have been killed. Since January there
have been 371 attacks on farms resulting in 75 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Some assaults have been particularly brutal. In May, for
instance, a 60-year-old farmer recovering from a hip replacement
operation was tortured and had his throat slit; he died as he sat
in his wheelchair. The intruders then waited an hour for his
52-year-old wife to get home; they raped and killed her, too.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers may well be feeling the brunt of a crime wave that
has swept across the country, leaving many South Africans living
behind high fences and barred windows. But many farmers believe the
attacks are more calculated _ the work of black militants aiming at
a group that remains among the most right-wing in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The gang that assaulted the 60-year-old farmer, Donald de la
Field, took nothing from the house but a revolver and left behind a
note saying ``Kill the Boers,'' a phrase that was popular during
the struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   In March, men who attacked a farm outside Pretoria told a
mixed-race woman who tried to protect her white husband that they
killed only whites, not ``coloreds,'' the South African term for
those of mixed race.
</P>
<P>
   In other incidents, including one outside Cape Town, the
attackers reportedly claimed they were members of Umkhonto we
Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the armed wing of the African
National Congress when it was fighting apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   South African police and army officials say they have no
evidence that there is anything like a coordinated effort against
the white farmers, but special investigators studying the attacks
are supposed to report to President Neslon Mandela at the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far our investigations have not revealed any orchestrated
efforts,'' said Martin Aylward, a spokesman for the South African
Police Service. ``We think that farmers are just easy targets for
criminals. They are in rural areas. They tend to have weapons that
criminals want. They have some money. It's really in only a few
instances that nothing has been taken.''
</P>
<P>
   But many farmers are not convinced. In Mooinooi, a small town
about 45 miles west of Pretoria, farmers shake their heads at all
that has happened to the country since apartheid was abolished.
</P>
<P>
   They say their very way of life is under attack, from the
sprawling squatter camps that have sprung up nearby to the changes
in the schools that may make it more difficult for their children
to be taught in the Afrikaans language.
</P>
<P>
   Most of South Africa's 50,000 commercial farmers are Afrikaners,
the descendants of Dutch, German and French settlers who ruled the
country for most of the century and were the authors of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are among the most conservative South Africans. They
fiercely opposed the transition to majority rule and are among the
most vociferous supporters of efforts to establish a ``homeland''
in South Africa for Afrikaners.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers say the assaults are an effort to push them off
that land. ``Farm attacks are political,'' said Hannes
Bezuidenhout, 45, who has had a flower farm in this area for 10
years and answered Mrs. Pereira's call. ``They want the land. But
even when they have land they don't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the farmers demanded a meeting with Mandela, who
responded by creating the Rural Safety Plan. Actually, it is a
dusted-off apartheid-era idea: Training and arming civilians as
army commandos ready to respond to the communist threat _ only
these days, the threat is crime. Most of the farmers who went to
Mrs. Pereira's farm were part of the area's commando force.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have always been heavily armed. But now they are adding
to their weapons as never before. The farmer-commandos receive a
few weekends of training as army reservists and are each given an
assault rifle. When they respond to an incident, the police do,
too. But the police force is stretched thin in farm areas, trying
to cover vast areas with few men or vehicles. The farmers often get
there much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the commandos are to supposed to catch the suspects,
hold them and protect the area so that no one disturbs any
evidence. In many cases, this has in fact happened. But in others,
the suspects have ended up dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny town of Makwasie, in the northernmost province,
eight people recently attacked a farmer when he opened his door to
a knock. His wife was able to hit the panic button. The attackers
ran off and a huge search party was sent out. Several hours later,
five men were in custody and three were dead. One was shot in the
head and one in the groin, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into whether the farmers murdered them is under
way.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those involved in the new commando groups say the
results in that case prove that the Rural Safety Plan works. ``If
there were mistakes done, this has to be looked at,'' said Col.
Hans Swart, who oversees the area's civilian commandos. ``But it
has to be looked at as a success. `'
</P>
<P>
   The South African Agricultural Union, which represents most of
the country's commercial farmers, has been outspoken about
suspicions that the farmers are being selected as targets. By their
calculations, farmers are attacked four times as often as other
South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility that farmers are special targets cannot be
overlooked,'' said Kobus Visser, the spokesman for the
organization. ``A lot of recent attacks, farmers are dead but very
little has been taken _ a revolver or just a little bit of money.
Or the perpetrators wait for days, just to kill it seems. That is
the factor that bothers us.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Visser acknowledged, the attacks appeared to be
related to past disputes over money or treatment. But in others, he
said, no connection was found. In Middleburg recently, he said, the
perpetrators waited four days for a farmer to come home, sleeping
outside in the freezing weather. They could have broken into the
house anytime, but instead they waited, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same occurred in Bothaville, where an ambush was laid for a
farmer and his children. The attackers had apparently already
gotten the keys to vehicles on the property and could have loaded
up and left anytime. But they waited until the family came home at
6:30 p.m. and fired more than 19 shots at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these are plain criminal acts, why like this?'' asked
Visser. ``Waiting around, that is just not how criminals behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezuidenhout, the flower grower, said about half the farmers in
the Mooinooi area were joining the commandos or had bought special
radio equipment to reach them when in need. Those in the commandos
have radios at home and in their cars, so they can hear the alarm
no matter where they are on their properties.
</P>
<P>
   The two young men caught on the Pereira farm said they were
Mozambicans who had been working as miners nearby but had been laid
off. They spoke no English or Afrikaans, but told police
translators that they had been looking for work and were just
trying to figure out how to approach the house to ask for jobs when
they were surrounded. Privately, the police officers said they
believed this. The commandos, however, did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were they doing on their knees in the grass?'' said Sarel
Minnaar, who farms tobacco. ``That's not going to get you any work.
They were planning something.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in the area have also been meeting on weekends to practice
shooting. Mrs. Pereira, carries her gun in her pocket. When her
laborers told her about the two men in the orchard, she got out her
own revolver and lay down on the porch where she could position
herself to watch their approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell you to keep the gun in the safe,'' said Mrs.
Pereira. ``but what good does that do you?''

DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF MUSIC IS SPREADING

 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sound that could transform the music business is
the quiet click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, anyone with a mid-level computer and an Internet
connection can hear music in a multitude of forms, from radiolike
Webcasts to snippets of songs. Many of those forms are ephemeral
and in low fidelity, intended primarily for promotion. But it is
also possible to download, free or for a price, high-fidelity songs
and full-length albums that can join a permanent collection.
There's no need to visit a store or wait for mail order; in fact,
there's no need ever to handle a compact disk. David Bowie, Tori
Amos, Duran Duran and other well-known groups have released songs
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been sending and receiving music via the
Internet, digital distribution is a harbinger of a future when
recorded music has been freed entirely from physical form. Sold or
disseminated as strings of 1's and 0's rather than disks, music
joins the worldwide flow of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   For enthusiasts, digital distribution presents utopian
possibilities. Freed of the costs of manufacturing and distributing
CDs, digitally distributed music could be cheaper for consumers and
more profitable for musicians. Music could be geared to more
specialized audiences that may be small but widely scattered; a fan
in Helsinki could download tunes from a band in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   More radical changes have also been predicted by some industry
figures. The possibilities include drastically lower prices for
recorded music by all but a commercial elite; other performers
might simply give away songs to promote albums or sell concert
tickets. Musicians could release music in small or large doses as
they see fit, dealing one more blow to the album as pop's standard
artistic unit. Stores could see their role reduced as digital
distribution allows consumers to skip middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, home music collections could become obsolete, as
recorded music becomes available from central archives on demand.
</P>
<P>
   To travel the Internet, music must be turned into a digital
sound file that can be played through a computer. Electronic, or
digital, distribution of music is still the province of a small but
significant group of computer users. At least 5 million software
``players'' in one music format, MP3, have been downloaded, and MP3
is part of the Netshow multimedia package on Windows 98; 3.5
million players in another format, Liquid Audio, have also been
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Because high-fidelity music involves large amounts of digital
information _ a music CD holds 650 megabytes _ transferring music
over the Internet is slow for most computer users; one song can
take a half-hour to download on a typical modem. Noting the
technical obstacles, Jupiter Media, an online market research firm,
has predicted that in five years the market for digitally
downloaded music will be about $30 million, a minuscule percentage
of the $12 billion recorded-music market.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still think it's something that labels should
aggressively pursue,'' said Mark Mooradian, group director of
consumer content for Jupiter Media. He said digital distribution
could be important for its marketing value, to combat piracy and to
reposition labels as retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Already, students and others with access to high-speed
transmission lines have been sending around enough music to alarm
the recording business.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic distribution is a major topic on the agenda at Plug
In '98, a conference on music in the digital era, organized by
Jupiter Media; Andrew Rasiej, founder of Irving Plaza, and Michael
Dorf, owner of the Knitting Factory, that is taking place alongside
the Intel New York Music Festival through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep your head in the sand forever,'' said Thomas
Dolby Robertson, who made new-wave hits in the 1980s and now runs
Headspace, a company that adds soundtracks to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bowie offered a single, ``Telling Lies,'' as a file
that could be downloaded free; even though it took up to 45 minutes
to transfer the five-minute song, 300,000 people downloaded it. But
that was a give away from an internationally known star. Getting
paid for downloaded music has been more difficult, in part because
of the inconvenience of the process and in part because few
well-known performers have made it available.
</P>
<P>
   But the advent of faster home Internet connections, including
cable modems now being tested that can transfer computer data at
rates comparable to the video and sound signals of cable
television, music could be downloaded in seconds rather than
minutes. And on college campuses, and some in high schools, with
fast T-1 lines (special digital telephone connections to the
Internet) students are already trading and copying music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a look at any dorm at Stanford,'' said David
Weekly, an incoming junior majoring in computer science at Stanford
University, ``people are listening more to MP3's than to radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent labels and individual musicians see digital
distribution as a way to deliver music directly to listeners.
``Record companies have a lock right now on how an artist can get
music out to a global audience,'' said Larry Rosen, the chairman of
N2K, which owns the online retail site Music Boulevard as well as
its own N2K label, which makes some of its songs available for
digital downloading. ``With electronic distribution of music,
there's a break in that kind of power structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital distribution allows musicians to make their newest work
available instantly worldwide.
</P>

   The Jesus and Mary Chain, the English band scheduled to perform
Wednesday night at Irving Plaza as part of the Intel New York Music
Festival, planned to record their set and place a live song on the
festival's Internet site (www.intelfest.com) 15 minutes after
leaving the stage. The song was also to be available Thursday at
Tower Records in Manhattan, transferred to a recordable CD and
given as a bonus with the Jesus and Mary Chain's current album.

 UNDATED: current album.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rasiej and Dorf organized the music festival and have set out to
create the Digital Club Network, which would place cameras and
recorders in clubs around the world. Performances could be
cybercast live or maintained as archives, with royalties going to
clubs and performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of money is insignificant today, but we're building
a new content source,'' Rasiej said. ``You could create a chat
room, collect your old friends from college and watch and
participate in a concert. You might not be able to slam dance
against one another, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Twin-Tone Records, the independent label that introduced the
Replacements and Husker Du to rock fans in the 1980s, has announced
that it will sell all its new releases through the Internet,
preferably through downloading, and will stop manufacturing new CDs
in bulk; downloading a song will cost $1.50, with albums at $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail market isn't what it used to be,'' said Paul Stark,
the president and co-founder of Twin-Tone Records. ``The number of
releases has gone from 3,000 to 25,000 or 30,000, all competing for
the same shelf space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wholesale a CD for $10, I'll only see about $3 of that
after mailing, returns and advertising,'' Stark explained. ``It
costs me about $1 to manufacture the CD and the group gets $2 in
royalties, which leaves me about 10 or 15 cents. On the Internet,
with no manufacturing or distributing costs, I can cut my sales to
a quarter of what they were and still come out ahead. The economic
model of the recording industry is changing very quickly, and the
Internet is the only future we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Geiger, the founder of Artist Direct, a company that offers
some downloadable music through the Ultimate Band List Web site,
said: ``You might be able to lease music for a certain amount of
listenings, like a jukebox. You might pay a different amount to own
it for an unlimited number of listenings. Or you might have an
arrangement like cable television, where you pay $29.95 to an
aggregater and listen to most of the music you want for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores won't be directly threatened by digital distribution for
some time. Still, the prospect of consumers getting music delivered
instantly at home, without visiting a store, is not a happy
prospect for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me is scared because we don't own any content,'' said
Mike Farrace, vice president for publishing at Tower Records. ``We
are not intellectual property holders; we are brokers and agents
and aggregaters. But I don't see digital distribution taking over.
I can see it becoming a component, absolutely no doubt about it.
The art for us is, How do we incorporate this into the business?''
</P>
<P>
   When Capitol Records announced that it would sell a Duran Duran
single, ``Electric Barbarella,'' over the Internet, retailers
protested, worrying that they were being bypassed. The song was
made available simultaneously at stores and as a digital download,
with one remix available only from the Internet. ``We expect to
have digital distribution be a piece of the pie, not to cause
retail to disappear,'' said Liz Heller, executive vice president
for Capitol Records.
</P>
<P>
   Major labels, which own manufacturing plants, warehouses and
trucks and invest heavily to shape the careers of musicians, are
wary of digital distribution. As with all new technologies for
transferring and copying music, they see the possibility of
widespread piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of digital distribution is the huge market that you
have access to, which you can market and promote to in different
ways,'' said Frank Creighton, senior vice president and director of
investigations for the Recording Industry Association of America,
the trade association that represents the larger recording
companies.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to electronic distribution, he said, the labels
are ``moving with some trepidation in light of the fact that
currently the majority of uses of distributed sound files are
unauthorized. Right now, there is no set standard as to how these
sound files are going to be distributed, protected and
controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three main technologies for digital distribution of
music: Liquid Audio, AT&AMP;T's a2b and MP3. Liquid Audio and a2b are
favored by companies that are worried about unauthorized copying.
In both the music is encrypted so that it can be played back only
by an authorized user and it is watermarked so that its source can
be traced; every download is registered, and royalties can be
deducted. Liquid Audio allows a buyer to copy the music once onto a
recordable CD; a2b does not.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burnett, the vice president of marketing for Liquid Audio,
said that there are about 10,000 songs available on the Internet in
the Liquid Audio format, and that the company will soon establish
the Liquid Music Network, a widely linked Web site that will hold
100,000 songs from independent labels including Rykodisc, Rounder
and Platinum Entertainment, for $1.50 to $2 a song.
</P>
<P>
   N2K, which sells CDs and tapes through mail order online as
Music Boulevard, offers songs from its N2K label in a format it
calls e-mod, using Liquid Audio; Twin-Tone also uses Liquid Audio.
In the year that N2K's system has been in operation, fewer than
10,000 people have downloaded the songs for 99 cents each, said
Rosen on N2K.
</P>
<P>
   But the available songs have been by little-known musicians. N2K
has just signed David Stewart, formerly of the Eurythmics; he plans
to release his next album in downloadable form on the Internet
before it appears in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MP3, which is short for MPEG Audio Layer 3, can
create endless generations of digital copies once a piece of music
has been encoded as an MP3 file. Portable MP3 players, separate
from home computers, are being manufactured. And MP3 files can be
created from any piece of recorded music through encoders, called
rippers, that are downloadable from many Web sites. The combination
has led to an extensive Internet traffic in MP3 songs.
</P>
<P>
   The recording-industry association considers any unlicensed
copying to be piracy. It recently tracked down someone selling the
entire recorded works of the Beatles, compressed into MP3 files on
a single CD-ROM disk, and it has been working to shut down Internet
sites offering large numbers of songs as MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   A new company, Goodnoise, plans to sell songs as MP3 files for
99 cents each. ``Fans don't have access to legitimate content on
MP3,'' said Gene Hoffman, the president and chief executive of
Goodnoise. ``MP3 is never going to go away, the technology is there
and available, and you might as well make it easier to buy it than
to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   But in most MP3 uses, no money changes hands. In 1996, Weekly
used Stanford's computer to offer about 200 songs as MP3 files. ``I
put it up, told a few people about it and it just exploded,'' he
said. ``We were not pirates, we were certainly not making money
from this; we just thought it was a great technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was online for a week and a half before record-company
representatives called Stanford and had it shut down. ``On the last
day,'' Weekly said, ``Stanford network services told me that 80
percent of outgoing bandwidth was my music. It shows that Internet
music wants to happen, in whatever form, and there are people out
there who are ready for it.''

FORD'S PROFIT UP 6.7 PERCENT IN 2ND QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday that its operating profit rose 6.7
percent in the second quarter, easily surpassing Wall Street
estimates despite a decline in car and truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   The robust report, however, also included some cautionary notes,
including Ford's projection that domestic auto sales were not
likely to continue at the blistering pace of the second quarter and
confirmation that sales in Latin America and Asia were weak. In
addition, the company's market share fell in both Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford's market share is something to watch,'' said David
Bradley, who follows the auto industry for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that its decline in market share _ to 24 percent from
25.6 percent in North America and to 10.4 percent from 11.7 percent
in Europe _ reflected a deliberate reduction in low-margin fleet
sales and the elimination of foundering products like the Aspire,
Probe and Aerostar so that it could concentrate on its more
profitable products, like light trucks. Devine noted that the
company's North American share had climbed back to 25.5 percent in
June and that July had started well.
</P>
<P>
   Ford sold 1,786,000 cars and trucks in the quarter, down nearly
5 percent from sales in the quarter a year earlier, and revenues
from those sales fell 4.6 percent, to $31.31 billion. But pretax
income from the automotive business jumped 16.5 percent, to $3.01
billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Ford earned $2.38 billion, or $1.91 a diluted
share, compared with $2.23 billion, or $1.82 a share, in the
quarter a year earlier before one-time items and earnings from
Associates First Capital, a finance company spun off to
shareholders earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   With those items, which included a $269 million profit on the
sale of 19.1 percent of Hertz Corp. to the public, and a $169
million charge to streamline manufacturing and sell its heavy-truck
business, Ford earned $2.53 billion, or $2.06 a diluted share, in
the quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent results topped Wall Street forecasts of earnings
of $1.81 a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call
Corp., which tracks company results.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ford fell $1 Wednesday, or 1.7 percent, to $59.50. For
the year, Ford's shares are up 84.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenue for the company, including Ford Credit Corp. and
Ford's share of Hertz's results, fell 7.4 percent, to $37.29
billion, from $40.27 billion in the quarter a year earlier, because
of lower automotive sales and the spinoff of Associates First
Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the biggest surprise was the strong improvement in
Europe, where automotive earnings jumped to $310 million from $153
million in the quarter a year earlier. The company, which has lost
money in Europe for much of the last decade, appears to be on track
to finish in the black there.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force in the strong quarter was the North American
market, where automotive earnings hit a record $1.7 billion for the
quarter. The popularity of the new F-series Super Duty truck, the
phasing-out of poor performers and a reduction in sales to rental
car fleets helped lift the average profit margin on vehicles in
North America to 7.3 percent from 6.2 percent in the period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of a more profitable mix of products were
reinforced by cost-cutting measures in manufacturing and purchasing
that saved $900 million compared with spending rates in the second
quarter of 1997. Total cost reductions in the first half reached
$1.3 billion, well ahead of the $1 billion goal Ford had set for
the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company making tremendous strides in gaining control
of its costs,'' said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Devine, the company's chief financial officer, said that
Ford would announce a plan later this year to reduce its salaried
work force through a buyout program to encourage voluntary
retirements. That program will result in a charge against earnings
toward the end of the year once details are worked out, Devine said
in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One of Wall Street's chief questions is what Ford plans to do
with its cash reserves, which grew to more than $14 billion in the
second quarter from $9.87 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be very careful in how we spend the cash,''
said Devine, deflecting questions about increasing Ford's
investment in its Japanese affiliate, Mazda; buying all or part of
the financially troubled Kia Motors of South Korea, and other
possible investments.

 &HT;    Atlanta's inaction on offer from Turner upsets Pitts
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlanta City Council President Robb Pitts says he is
``embarrassed'' for the city and hopes to revive the Turner
Foundation's offer to finance a $1.5 million conservation program
that could save taxpayers at least $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts is the only Atlanta official to call the Turner Foundation
in the wake of the revelations the city ignored the organization's
repeated efforts to finalize plans for the energy program. ``I
haven't heard from anyone in the administration,'' said Peter
Bahouth, executive director of the Turner Foundation. ``We have
gotten calls from everyone but the city,'' said Bahouth, who added
it would be difficult to resurrect the initiative at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Since a story appeared in the newspaper last week, dozens of
people have called the Turner Foundation to express their concern
about the city's rejection of the proposal. The foundation even got
a call from an official at Fulton County expressing interest in
having the program implemented there.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell initially embraced the program, even
highlighting it in his state-of-the-city address in January 1997.
But the proposal fell through the cracks at City Hall as key people
left the administration, others changed positions and the mayor
focused attention on his re-election. A Turner official called the
city's chief administrative officer 47 times over several months
last fall without getting a call back.
</P>
<P>
   The Turner Foundation, frustrated by the lack of response from
the city, withdrew its offer in January, only to receive a
rejection letter in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened never should have happened,'' said Pitts, who
may sense political opportunity in the embarrassing episode for the
Campbell administration. Pitts has called executives of the Turner
Foundation to apologize for the city's lack of responsiveness to
their offer. ``It is a loss for us, and it is an embarrassment,''
Pitts said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts asked the foundation ``whether there still was any
opportunity'' to proceed with the original contract. The foundation
is sending him a copy of the drafted contract for his review. Pitts
said he believes the City Council could pass legislation to act on
the Turner offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to see if we can work something else out,'' Pitts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if we could revive it at this point,'' said
Bahouth. ``There were several other groups involved. We were all
stepping off the curb at once, and we were left standing in the
road. People have moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Turner Foundation would need assurance from Campbell
and his administration they are committed to working with the
energy conservation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would need to have a commitment,'' Bahouth said. ``There's
nothing that says to me that things have changed and the city is
going to want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bahouth said the foundation remains open to
discussing ideas with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to use the Turner resources to make the
community a better place and to improve the quality of life in any
way we can,'' Bahouth said. ``We always stand ready to look for
ways to help make the city a better place to live.''

 &HT;    `Think small' among latest investor themes
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The mid-year review of investment strategy continues
in the business press.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Investor (August) explains most stocks never attract
the attention of financial analysts. They may be too small to show
up on Wall Street's radar screens, but such ``stealth stocks''
could have growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for a $50 million company to double (in size) than
a $1 billion company,'' the magazine says, listing five ``off the
radar'' companies: Aasche Transportation (ticker ASHE), Deb Shops
(DEBS), DSP Technology (DSPT), InKline Pharmaceutical (INKP) and
Laser Technology (LSR).
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (August), which rates and
ranks 3,000 mutual funds, suggests investors take a page from the
playbook of many mutual fund managers _ don't try to predict the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, set a course and stick to it. To protect yourself,
invest conservatively for short-term needs and aggressively for
long-term goals _ those 10 or more years down the road,'' the
magazine suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Funds Magazine (August) looks at a new trend: ``focus''
funds, which include only 25 or 30 stocks, unlike the typical fund
that may have 150 or 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory is that the managers of those funds can limit their
portfolios to their very best investment ideas, creating greater
market-beating potential,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Examples are Stein Roe Large Company Focus, Mosaic Focus, Janus
Twenty, PBHG Large Cap 20 and Neuberger &AMP; Berman Focus.
</P>
<P>
   Who's on first: second act
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (July 27) and Fortune (Aug. 3), which disagreed on which
was the biggest domestic corporation earlier this year, now
disagree on which global company is biggest.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune, which ranks 500 companies by revenue, says it's General
Motors _ which, logically, also tops its domestic list.
</P>
<P>
   Just as logically, Forbes, which ranks 500 companies according
to a five-component score, says it's General Electric, its domestic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   They do agree on the revenue the companies reported.
</P>
<P>
   New retirement rules
</P>
<P>
   Many tried-and-true formulas no longer apply, Business Week
(July 20) says in a special edition on retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   People are living longer after they retire, which puts a strain
on finances. And baby boomers retire from one job only to start a
second career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transformation of retirement from kick-back-at-60 to a
more active period of life can give you a new degree of flexibility
in planning your financial future,'' says Business Week.

`REAL DIANA': DIANA RETURNS, WITH HER MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Time, channel are for New York area. Check local
listings.) 
(nk) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Princess Diana's brother, the ninth Earl Spencer, is seated in a
wicker chair on the grounds of Althorp, the family estate,
recalling the walk last September through the streets of London
behind his sister's coffin, alongside Princes Philip, Charles,
William and Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult part was feeling everyone's grief weighing
down on you,'' he says, ``and not being able to look right or left
to see where it was coming from.'' The crowd's reaction seemed to
be different on every block, he said. ``It was very traumatic,
actually.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the most gripping moments in ``The Real Diana,''
Thursday night's premiere episode of News Corporation ``Fox
Files,'' that network's hourlong news-magazine program. The
producers have been unable to resist voice-over pronouncements
about ``Diana, as you've never seen her before,'' and ``the
conspiracy theories that refuse to go away'' and melodramatic
camera movement now and then. Interviewer Catherine Crier tells
viewers a little more than most will want to know about her own
reaction to Diana's death last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   And Earl Spencer may have agreed to the exclusive interview
partly for the opportunity to show off the new museum he has
created at Althorp in Diana's honor. The home movies, advertised as
never having been seen by the public before, are charming, although
many scenes are shown again and again, as if to fill time. But in
the end, there is enough insightful, thoughtful material here to
satisfy Diana's many admirers, ranging from kindergarten teachers
to high-powered businesswomen who all profess to feel intense
connections with the Princess of Wales in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Spencer is on his best, most admirable behavior, wisely
declining to answer questions about what he would say to Diana if
he could speak with her again and what he thinks of comments made
by Mohamed al-Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed, who died with Diana
in that Paris car crash. But Earl Spencer is straightforward when
he chooses to address an issue, like the astonishing depth and
breadth of public mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost some spiritual reaction, I think,'' he says,
pointing out the relatively small role that organized religion
plays in English life these days. ``I just wonder if people had to
connect with a part of themselves that was probably dormant.'' And
of course with their own mortality, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's other exclusive is a brief interview with Diana's mother,
Frances Shand Kydd, who says absolutely the right thing when she
notes: ``I think that far too little has been said about what
people all over the world gave to her. They nourished her. They
made her smile. They gave her strength.'' Mrs. Shand Kydd recalls
her own similar experience, taking ``enormous comfort'' in being
near the crowds at Kensington Palace, Diana's home in London, in
the days after her death. ``We were sharing,'' she says, ``a very
deep hurt.''

   Earlier this month London newspapers ran articles about the
``cult of Diana.'' It continues to grow.

COOL IT TO BEAT THE TEXAS HEAT WAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GALE M. BRADFORD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOL, Texas _ It was high noon and scorching hot, and a Mineral
Wells welder sat in the only cafe in this tiny town sipping iced
tea from a quart Mason jar served by Cool city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool's the place to be,'' Matt Schnabel said as he finished
his lunch at The Farmhouse, south of the blinking yellow light on
U.S. 180 about 12 miles west of Weatherford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always 2 to 3 degrees cooler in Cool,'' Mayor Marsha
McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When settlers came here in the early days at the turn of the
century, they found it to be just a little cooler. Folks would
gather on porches here on Sunday afternoons and talk, and it was
always cooler than in Weatherford or Mineral Wells.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald and her business partner, City Secretary Cindy Serrano,
spent about two years renovating the old Army barracks and
converting it into a diner, said former Cool mayor and lunchtime
regular Jim Heineman, who noted that the Parker County town is not
alone in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Star-Telegram ran stories about our city some years
ago, we found out that there was a Cool, Calif., and they contacted
us asking to be our sister city,'' Heineman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still write us a couple of times a year,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The cities have similarities. Both are described as ``wide spots
in the road'' with blinking signal lights, and both have had
trouble keeping their ``Cool'' city limit signs from being stolen.
</P>
<P>
   But because of El Nino, summer has just arrived in Cool, Calif.,
Postmaster Jeff Greene said in a telephone interview yesterday. He
said temperatures just recently reached the mid-90s in the town of
4,000, a metropolis compared with the Texas Cool and its population
of 238.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the same old little quiet place, except it does have
a deli and a pizza place now,'' Greene said of the unincorporated
community that has no city officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas Cool, folks still gather on front porches, where
it's usually cooler than nearer the Metroplex, said cafe customer
Jim Williams of Weatherford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a business meeting here on the front porch last week
and it was comfortable. There's plenty of shade, and it was really
pleasant,'' Williams said. It was so cold inside the cafe one day
that he asked for the air conditioner thermostat to be adjusted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their city positions and cafe jobs, McDonald and
Serrano are both teachers, McDonald in Mineral Wells and Serrano in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's mother, Peggy McDonald, 69, makes some of the cafe's
specialties: biscuits, pies, and peach and vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pies bring folks back again and again. She's one of the
reasons we count this 2-week-old venture a success,'' Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our largest crowds on the hottest days,'' Serrano
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it's cool in Cool, McDonald said.

   &UR; New shaver expensive step for mankind &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There was probably a time not long ago when the only
organization to spend more than $750 million designing a piece of
equipment was NASA.It says something _ probably something really
silly _ about society that Gillette has just spent that much
developing a shaving razor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, it's not a shaving razor, it's a `shaving system.`
According to the truckload of hyperbole that was released into the
atmosphere at the launching of Gillette's new `shaving system,` the
Mach3 is `the first and only shaving system with three
progressively aligned blades, forward pivoting action and
innovative cartridge architecture.`
</P>
<P>
   You would think by that description that the Mach3 is something
only Chuck Yeager could operate. And with the kind of
publicity-saturation bombing accompanying this new gizmo, you'd
think it's nuclear powered, or at least electrically powered.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a hand-held, manual, non-electric shaving razor.
With three blades. It's the three blades that make the Mach3 much
more advanced, not to mention funny-looking. Think of it this way:
The old one-bladed safety razor, like the little plastic Bic, could
be considered one of those manual lawn mowers that you have to
push. Then they came out with two-bladed razors. They were, of
course, heralded as the the most advanced shaving razors ever
invented.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking with the lawn-mower motif, the two-bladed razors were
like gas-powered push mowers. How shaver designers can call the
idea to go to three blades `a quantum leap in shaving technology`
is beyond me. I'd say it falls under the heading of obvious, like
going from two-slot toasters to four.
</P>
<P>
   But anyway, the Mach3 has three blades. It looks as weird as you
can imagine anything with three blades looking. And, to go back to
the lawn thing, it rides over your face like one of those big
riding lawn mowers from Sears -- the kind you always sit in when
you are going through the hardware section but never have enough
lawn to merit buying.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way I felt when I tried the Mach3. I mean, I have a
lot of face, yardage-wise, but do I have a face that really merits
using a shaver that cost more money to develop than the cure for
polio?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no. No one has that kind of face. But the Mach3 is
here and so I tried it.
</P>
<P>
   I know you will be shocked to find out that the Mach3 gave an
incredibly close shave. For 7 big ones, it had better give a close
shave. Hell, it might even be expected to take the hairs out by the
roots.
</P>
<P>
   It did feel a little strange to have this big old raft of blades
sliding over my face, but the shave was undeniably close. If you
have one of those deep Kirk Douglas chin clefts, you might have a
problem. And though they aren't pushing this shaver for women, I
think it'd probably zip down legs faster than the Jamaican bobsled
team.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly $7, the Mach3's a little pricey. But that just means
you'll treat it with the care and respect you give your other large
appliances. As for the future, I plan to submit my design to
Gillette for the next quantum leap in shavers: the 15-blade Super
Advanced Hair-Cutting Justice System Shaver. The first blade reads
the hair its Miranda rights, the second places it under arrest, the
third smacks it around and makes it confess, the fourth books it,
the sixth arraigns it, the seventh sets bail, the eighth tries it,
the ninth . . . well, you get the idea. After the hair's final
appeal is denied (Blade 14) the hair is cut. If anyone from
Gillette is out there reading this, call me quick. Otherwise I
might just sell the idea to Bic.

Lewinsky case?,
</P>
<P>
   After Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, announced his
resignation, Mr. Clinton phoned him to wish him well. Even at a
dime a minute, it's a nickel just to say his name.,

There's been

   &UR; I MADE ALL OF IT UP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's a bad time for magazine writers and newspaper columnists,
some of whom have recently been fired for making up quotes or
inventing sources.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe columnist who was fired for making stuff up wrote
a final column explaining her actions and apologizing to her
readers, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   It is just a matter of time before management discovers that my
column has been an unbroken string of lies, fabrications and
blatant exaggerations since its debut in 1984 (Or was it 1983? Ah,
who cares.) I figure I may as well write my apology now in case my
heave-ho is too sudden to allow for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, I would like to apologize for an April 24, 1984,
column in which I suggested that rubbing Spam all over yourself
makes a terrific shark repellent. There is absolutely no scientific
basis for that statement, and it was also brought to my attention
that that would be a cruel and unusual thing to do to sharks, many
of which have felt unloved and insecure ever since the release of
the movie ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, I would like to grovel in as obsequious a manner as
possible for a Nov. 20, 1986, column in which I suggested that you
cook your Thanksgiving turkey with the plastic wrapper still on as
that not only gives the turkey that traditional
dragged-through-the-refinery petrochemical aroma, but also
dramatically increases the chances that your oven will catch fire
and/or your smoke alarm will go off, thereby hastening the
departure of your guests. Many cooks and fire safety officials
vehemently disagreed with my advice, though they all advised
staying as far away from giblets as possible.
</P>
<P>
   I also wish to distance myself as far as possible, preferably
upwind, from a March 15, 1988, column, in which I compared the
Easter bunny to Godzilla, only with poorer personal hygiene.
Contrary to what was printed in the paper, I have never,
personally, seen a 20-foot-tall Easter bunny lumbering through my,
or any other, neighborhood late at night. I have no supporting
evidence that the Easter bunny's eyes are bloodshot and big as
dinner plates, nor can I honestly claim that its ``cavernous jaws
and cruel yellow fangs'' make the lawyer-gulping dinosaur in
``Jurassic Park'' look about as lethal as a baby duck.
</P>
<P>
   I sincerely regret any misunderstanding or lifelong psychotic
episodes this may have caused.
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite possible that I was asleep or not even in the
building at the time when I wrote a Nov. 4, 1990, column suggested
that Snooty the manatee would be a better choice for vice president
than Dan Quayle. Although Snooty may be a better speller than
Quayle, he does not play golf very well, if at all, and doesn't
have anywhere near the magnificent head of hair that Quayle does.
Quayle has the kind of good looks that movie stars are made of,
while Snooty has all the sex appeal of an Idaho potato (potatoe?),
only with more gas. Snooty also likes to roll over on his back to
have his stomach scratched, which is probably not a good quality
for a vice president to have in light of the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   I would also (almost) be willing to crawl on my hands and knees
and lick the bacteria-infested shoes of any New Yorkers who took
umbrage with my Aug. 10, 1992, characterization of their native
cockroaches as ``weenies'' compared to Florida cockroaches.
Independent testing _ which I conveniently chose to disregard _ has
proven time and again that New York cockroaches are every bit as
big and fiesty as Florida cockroaches, even though Florida
cockroaches _ the ones that live in Sarasota, at least _ have
better manners and are more stylish dressers than their northern
counterparts.

 &HT;    '91 Baker-Finch's last hurrah
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England -- One of the voices you shall be hearing
from the British Open this week will have a touch of Australia in
it and will belong to Ian Baker-Finch, who is exempt to play,
rather than to be talking, of the British Open through the year
200l. It is a matter of some significance, for Baker-Finch stands
as a symbol of how fragile life at the top can be in the
teeter-totter world of golf. This is one of the rare occasions, if
not the first, on which the player who won the British Open has not
returned to the scene of his triumph to defend his honor.
</P>
<P>
   (No, on second thought, Tony Lema, who won at St. Andrews in
1964 was killed before he could get back again.)
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch's is a tragedy of another nature. His game went
away. Almost like overnight. Mark O'Meara, who was paired with him
on the Sunday round in 1991 here at Royal Birkdale, was speaking of
it yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just Ian's day. He played a tremendous round of golf,
about as good a nine holes as I've ever seen on the front side.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch went out in 29 and won by two strokes over Mike
Harwood, another wallaby. O'Meara shot 69 and felt like a marker, a
playing scorekeeper. Baker-Finch never won again, except for one
tournament in Australia. It's pure irony that Harwood has faded
from the scene as well, but for other reasons. Domestic turmoil led
to a divorce that ripped his life apart. Baker-Finch is still well
married. It was his swing that divorced him.
</P>
<P>
   As I hear it, this is what happened: So elated was he after
winning the Open here that he wanted to win more. He decided he
needed to get more length off the tee, parted company with David
Leadbetter, his mentor, and went off to another coach in Australia.
After about six months he was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in his swing that I recognized,'' Leadbetter
has said. The curse was upon this handsome, intelligent gentleman,
now 37 years old and a rookie in the telecast booth of the ABC
network.
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch had one last fling at it a year ago at Royal Troon.
As the story goes, the fellow Aussie, Peter Thomson, who won the
British Open five times, twice at Birkdale, convinced him he should
give it a go. Not cave in to failure. ``Carry on, stiff upper
lip,'' and all that stuff. It could hardly have been more
embarrassing. Baker-Finch shot 92, looked awful doing it, should
never have been on the course. He withdrew, hasn't attempted to
play since, hasn't earned a dime on tour since 1994 and turned to
the broadcast side in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   There is no harder field on the planet to make than the British
Open. The Masters, for instance, is by invitation. Here, they come
from all over the world, some with faint chance, but always
nurtured hope. They are required to play two hard rounds of
qualifying on adjacent courses, and this week the wind blew and
rain lashed them. Even Larry Mize, a Masters champion, and David
Frost had to qualify; Philip Walton, Christy O'Connor, David
Gilford and Howard Clark, stars of Ryder Cup, and Wayne Riley and
Carl Mason, Scottish Open champions. Only Walton and Clark made it.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Michael Campbell and Steven Bottomley finished
in a tie for third at St. Andrews. Campbell's game has gone to seed
but he managed to qualify. Poor Bottomley, played the wrong ball
and was DQ'd, wouldn't have made it if he hadn't. Jarmo Sandlin,
the Swede who challenged O'Meara's honor, flunked. Three years ago
Paul Broadhurst was knocking on the door, England's hot new hope.
He failed. Some oddball Americans made the trip for nothing, Mac
O'Grady and Howard Twitty. An Argentine named Jose Coceres turned
in a round of 105 at the Hesketh course. This guy is no turkey. He
plays the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   So I was walking the course with Mark McCumber, a player of some
prominence on our side, onetime Players Championship winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago I was second to Tom Lehman at Royal Lytham,'' he
said. ``Now I'm walking the course with a mike in my hands.''
Something happened to his spinal column and he's just hoping he
doesn't lose the ability to walk. Makes Baker-Finch look the lucky
one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Just off the Royal Birkdale practice green
Wednesday, A.D. Hadley of Wolverhampton sensed that clearly
something was missing. A British Open without Jack Nicklaus, he had
decided without hesitation, hit him squarely as fish without chips.
</P>

Tigermania here today, but if Jack walked in here right now, Jack
would would be better than that.''

   No disagreement came from his older friend, William Campbell of
Belfast, who termed it ``very disappointing'' that Nicklaus, 58,
decided to end his string of 154 straight major championships
because of an arthritic hip that will not allow contending up to
his standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best golfer in the world ever,'' said Campbell, ``and
I've been coming to Opens since 1963. Winning 20 majors, that
speaks for itself, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus is not gone from British Opens forever. He'll probably
get his moment to wave on the bridge at St. Andrews' 18th, the same
as Arnold Palmer did in 1995. Barring any physical deterioration,
Nicklaus plans to play all four majors in 2000 _ the Masters, the
U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, the PGA at Valhalla and the British Open
at St. Andrews, where he won in 1970 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A special moment that will be for Hadley, who met Nicklaus at
the Open at Royal Lytham in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood next to him as close as I am to you,'' said Hadley,
who wore a purple Royal Troon sweater. ``I shook Jack Nicklaus'
hand, and I don't mind telling you, just talking about it right now
brings a bit of a flutter to me heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came last week from Nicklaus' Golden Bear
offices in North Palm Beach,Fla., but apparently word did not reach
all parts of the British Isles. Ken and Joy Woodward of Southport
came to Royal Birkdale and said Wednesday, ``We were just looking
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Having heard vague rumors of a Nicklaus withdrawal, they were
not totally stunned. Still, they had not planned to draw only on
memories of a young Nicklaus, blond hair blowing in the breeze,
prowling the fairways of Royal Birkdale four times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine told me many years ago, 'You need to see this
young American and the way he strides up Birkdale's fairways like a
Goliath,''' Ken Woodward said. ``We always watched him and we so
much liked his terrific personality. We loved seeing him coming up
to the last green waving to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a certain charisma, didn't he?'' Joy Woodward
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was perhaps no better than some of his competitors,'' Ken
Woodward said, ``but it was his persona that was different. He was
all go.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Nicklaus was in nearby Chester, England, this week to
open a new golf course designed with son Steve at the Carden Park
Hotel and to play an exhibition. Maybe it offers some solace to
those who miss Nicklaus that he feels it's time to spend time with
his family _ especially if his game is suspect. Although there are
indications Nicklaus might have regretted his decision to skip the
British after his hip improved last week, it's doubtful he has the
strength to handle the heather and high grass of the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost 60,'' Nicklaus told reporters this week. ``I'm not
going to compete against the kids. That's silly.''
</P>
<P>
   A great rival and friend of Nicklaus, Tom Watson said flatly of
the man's absence, ``It's sad. It's sad that it has to end, but I'm
sure that if he was in good health, he'd be here. I don't think the
streak is as important to Jack as it is to feeling like he can
compete. If he can compete, he'll be here again.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of the streak are staggering even to Watson, who
believes he had a streak of 66 from 1975 to 1996. Two years ago
Nicklaus even briefly contended at Royal Lytham.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about the game over here,'' Watson
said. ``They embrace somebody who plays well, no matter where
they're coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the millennium appearance at St. Andrews, Watson said,
``He'll be at St. Andrews for that if he has to play in a
wheelchair. That's his favorite golf course over here.''
</P>
<P>
   For a player not entered in the Open, Nicklaus has been high
profile. A typically tabloid story in Wednesday's London Daily Mail
had Nicklaus fearing that money might ruin Tiger Woods. Many
columnists reflected on Jack's past performances.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Nicklaus streak and his impact on golf, Woods
said this week, ``He has put a level of expectation on all of us
and what we are trying to achieve. He's a living legend, like
Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he feels bad missing it because of the streak and what
it means to everyone else,'' said Davis Love III, ``but it's going
to take one of the best players in the world to win on this golf
course this week. Which Jack was, but he would have struggled
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it seems, that wouldn't have bothered A.D. Hadley of
Wolverhampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said Jack Nicklaus wasn't going to be coming,'' he
said, ``it was like a part of the Open was not here.''

<P>
   MOUNTAIN HOME, Idaho _ As it scrambles to find new or expanded
places to train fighter and bomber pilots, the Air Force is running
into intensifying opposition from ranchers, environmentalists,
sportsmen and Native Americans who believe the roar of fast,
low-flying jets is disrupting some of the nation's last refuges of
peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of legal and political challenges, the Air Force has
already had to scrap several recent efforts to build new bombing
ranges or to carve out more space in the nation's increasingly
crowded skies for exclusive military use. Virtually every proposal
now on the table faces opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, McCoy Land &AMP; Cattle Co. filed suit in May to block
plans for a new low-level training route over its property, arguing
that the jets upset the cows. In New Mexico, ranchers and
environmentalists have teamed up against a proposal to expand areas
used by pilots at Holloman Air Force Base, including a squadron of
Germany's Luftwaffe. The Air Force's plans to locate a new range
for its big bombers at one of three spots in New Mexico or west
Texas have already stirred outrage, even though no decision has
been made.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to the Air Force's expansion plans has raised
alarms among the service's top commanders, who say the need for
additional airspace and bombing ranges has become one of the most
critical issues facing them today.
</P>
<P>
   They fear further restrictions on their training space at a time
when new tactics and new weapons _ including missiles that can be
fired 20 or 30 miles from their targets _ are creating new demands
for more room. Right now, they say, they do not have enough
training space for the F-22 fighters that are supposed to start
rolling off the assembly line in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the service's two largest training ranges _ the
Nellis Range in Nevada and the Barry M. Goldwater Range in Arizona
_ require new leases by 2001 from the Bureau of Land Management,
which controls public land use. And that means new environmental
studies, opening the door for what are expected to be strong legal
and political challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you send combat airplanes and crews into harm's way, if
they are going to survive and emerge victorious, they require
rigorous training day to day,'' Gen. Richard Hawley, commander of
Air Combat Command, said in an interview at Langley Air Force Base,
on the southern coast of Virginia. ``In order to do that, you've
got to have a place for them to train.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Idaho, the Air Force has proposed enlarging the vast
expanse of desert that pilots from Mountain Home Air Force Base use
to hone their skills, attacking a mock airport, evading ``enemy''
missile batteries and fighting air-to-air duels. Although the base
has free run of 7,000 square miles over Idaho, Nevada and Oregon,
the Air Force says it needs still more room and new ``targets'' to
better simulate today's warfare.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely coalition of opponents, however, has rallied against
the proposal. They say the expansion would worsen the already
constant rumble and roar of jets in the area, which encompasses the
Owyhee Canyonlands, one of the largest undeveloped wildernesses
outside of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   After the Air Force announced its proposal in March, a group
calling itself the Greater Owyhee Legal Defense went to court to
block it, contending that the service had not adequately studied
the impact the changes would have on the scattered residents and
abundant wildlife, including sage grouse and California bighorn
sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is some of the most incredible, remote wilderness left,''
said Roger Singer of the Sierra Club's Idaho chapter in Boise. ``It
shouldn't be a bombing range.''
</P>
<P>
   With the overarching threats of the Cold War having passed,
people seem far less willing to tolerate jets skimming 100 to 500
feet off the ground, not to mention the quake of sonic booms, which
can shatter windows and crack walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Cold War, we said, `Hey, I need this for training,'
and you got it to train the troops,'' Hawley said. ``There has been
a shifting in priorities. And the other issues, which we try to
accommodate, tend to get a more sensitive hearing sometimes than
our needs do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and, to a lesser extent, the Navy, Marine Corps
and Army are all having to vie against new and competing claims on
the nation's increasingly crowded airspace, as well as on the
public lands needed for bombing itself.
</P>
<P>
   The steady growth of commercial airline traffic has increased
pressure on the Federal Aviation Administration to free up routes
reserved for military use. Also, small cities once located far from
training areas have sprawled, bringing residents much closer to the
jets. Las Vegas, for example, has virtually overrun the boundary of
Nellis Air Force Base, established in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have also raised objections to the noise and
the impact of flares and chaff, the small aluminum coated fibers
jets jettison to confuse incoming missiles. One of the Air Force's
biggest headaches at ranges in the East has been trying to not to
disturb the red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force _ and the Army's Air Forces before it _ have been
training pilots here in southern Idaho since 1942. The conditions
are ideal: The weather is clear, the skies uncrowded, the land
beneath it sparsely populated.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit of an F-15E, roaring back and forth over the
buttes and rolling hills, the sparse desert seems to stretch as far
as the eye can see. For the Air Force, though, it stretches not
nearly far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The existing airspace and the bombing range within it, known as
Saylor Creek, date to the Vietnam era, and that, the base's
commanders said, is the problem: They were designed for slower,
less agile jets with shorter ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, though, Mountain Home has been the base of the 366th
Wing, with 80 F-16 and F-15 fighters, B-1B bombers and KC-135 air
tankers. The ``composite wing'' is the only one of its kind,
created to allow pilots and crews of different aircraft to work and
train together. Those jets, according to the base's commander,
Brig. Gen. Randall Schmidt, need more space.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion proposal is the fourth since 1989; among other
things, it would expand the air space by 7 percent, create a new
12,000 acre bombing range and place 30 transmitters throughout the
area to simulate anti-aircraft batteries. The Air Force abandoned a
similar proposal three years ago after a legal challenge by the
same coalition fighting it now.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Land Management initially opposed the plans, but
relented after extracting promises to restrict low-level flights
over the area's canyons and rivers, especially during the spring,
when the bighorn sheep give birth in the canyonlands and the rivers
are full of kayaks and canoes.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fight has turned to Congress. Sen. Dirk Kempthorne, a
Republican who is running for governor of Idaho in November, pushed
through an amendment last month that approved the Air Force's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky to have the composite wing in Idaho,'' said
Kempthorne, whose Democratic opponent in the election, Bob Huntley,
opposes the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., called the expansion ``an absolute
waste of taxpayers' money and citizens' air space.'' He said the
Air Force plans to spend $31 million to expand an existing range,
when pilots could easily train at ranges in Nevada and Utah only a
few minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   The House has not yet taken up the issue. The FAA, meanwhile,
must still consider whether to approve the Air Force's request for
the airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the area is remote, it is not uninhabited. About 1,500
members of Shoshone-Pauite Tribes live in the Duck Valley
Reservation, right in the middle of the training area.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Gibson, one of seven members of the reservation's
governing council, said the Air Force did not appreciate the land's
significance. The tribes' homelands, he explained, included most of
the Owyhee Canyonlands, and the area is peppered with burial sites,
as well as plants and animals considered part of a spiritual world.
The jets, he said, sorely disrupt that, though the Air Force has
promised never to fly below 5,000 feet over the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them, this is all desolate _ rocks and scrub land,'' he
said. ``But to us, this is our bible.'' &QL;

A LOOK AT THE CHURCH OF CHRIST, SCIENTIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History: Christian Science developed out of the writings and
leadership of founder Mary Baker Eddy, who recovered from a serious
injury in 1866 after reading a biblical account of Christ's healing
of a man with palsy. Eddy soon began informally teaching a
scientific approach to divine healing; she did not plan to
establish a denomination, but hoped to spread her message through
existing churches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1870, Eddy published a booklet, ``The Science of Man.'' Soon
after she published ``Science and Health With Key to the
Scriptures,'' a textbook that explained the beliefs of Christian
Science. Eventually, Eddy sought dismissal from the church in which
she was raised and founded the Christian Science Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Christ, Scientist, was established in Boston in
1879; the church dissolved 10 years later but was reorganized in
1892. The church's bylaws, called the Church Manual, were developed
in 1895. The Church Manual and Eddy's textbook are key documents in
Christian Science today.
</P>
<P>
   Membership: The church has approximately 2,500 congregations
worldwide, most of them in North America. No formal membership
statistics are published because Eddy believed that statistics do
not reflect the church's true spiritual growth.
</P>
<P>
   Beliefs: The Church of Christ, Scientist, identifies itself as
Christian in essence. The church's tenets affirm its members'
belief in the Trinity and in the Bible as the guide to eternal
life.
</P>
<P>
   The key element in Christian Science is the belief that all God
creates is good, so evil does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reality of sin, sickness or death is the awful fact
that unrealities seem real to human, erring belief, until God
strips off their disguise,'' Eddy wrote in ``Science and Health.''
``They are not true, because they are not of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing, therefore, is considered not miraculous but natural.
Humans are not mortal and material, Christian Scientists believe,
and viruses and germs are false causes of sickness. Disease is
considered to be a mental fabrication, a delusion that can be
eliminated through prayer and full spiritual understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has surrounded the Church of Christ, Scientist,
because of its spiritual healing practices. Courts have both
limited Christian Science healing and given it legal protection as
a form of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Church members revere Eddy as founder but carefully distinguish
her as discoverer of Christian Science from Jesus as Savior.
Likewise, Eddy's textbook is a key part of worship but is not
considered a second Scripture or an authority equal to the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Daily life: Worship at local branch churches is led by two
elected readers who read from the Bible and Eddy's textbook,
``Science and Health.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptism is not a traditional Christian Science ceremony; it is
considered a continuing individual spiritual experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Science Monitor'' is the most famous publication
of the Church of Christ, Scientist, but the church publishes
numerous other periodicals.

positive ground. Proponents say it shifts the U.S. relationship
with Africa from aid to trade. But the Africa trade bill before
Congress, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Philip M. Crane, R-Ill., has

   MXFACTORY _ MEXICO-FACTORIES _ TIJUANA, Mexico _ One of
Tijuana's maquiladoras, the Korean-owned Han Young auto parts
factory, is making history that could affect Mexico's entire
maquiladora industry. Han Young factory workers are the first to
vote to join an independent labor union _ defying the traditional
government-controlled labor movement. With some American labor

Half an hour later, the massive sea turtle begins to deposit more

SEEN ANY BAD MOVIES LATELY?

<P>
   If you're one of those who finds fault with any kind of movie,
the creators of Bad Movie Night (www.hit-n-run.com) might be
looking for you ... as a reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Movie Night is a clearinghouse for reviews of bad movies and
bad impressions of good movies. A movie can be either an overhyped
summer release or a 49-cent rental from the local video store.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Movie Night was created last fall on the night that movie
buffs Ken Wilson, Chris Bjuland and Scott Murdock, of Kansas City,
Mo., saw ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We began making it our goal to see a bad movie each week and
post our reviews,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   The site's stated goal is to create a Bad Movie Academy, an
elite group of 100 people who are allowed to post movie reviews on
the site and participate in other events such as the annual Bad
Movie Night Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``To become a member, a person must complete a rather difficult
100-question trivia quiz and then submit a sample movie review from
a list of bad movies of our choosing,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   The site is similar to the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation,
which tracks the worst movies and performances of the year and
awards its Razzies. The difference is that Bad Movie Night
maintains a database of bad movies.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Movie Night isn't the only site to examine bad movies. A
sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Oh, The Humanity! The Worst Movies on Earth
(www.ohthehumanity.com): This elaborate site takes a different
tack: It posts reviews of B movies, not A movies that are bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ken's World of Awful Movies (www.nrx.net/badmovies): This
well-organized site has lots of reviews of B movies and the best
network of links, including a couple to B-movie queen Chesty Morgan
worship pages.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Turkey Awards:
(members.tripod.com/\Pcosmics/TurkeyAward): This site is for
B-movie fans who want to look up the Turkey Awards given by Harry
and Michael Medved, authors of ``The Fifty Worst Films of All
Time.'' _ Tommy Cummings dragon\Nstar-telegram.com

COMMENTARY: A LONG-RUNNING BETRAYAL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A teen-ager, concocting a lie and hoping to make it
convincing, smears feces on herself, scrawls racial slurs on her
body and crawls half-naked into a filthy garbage bag. She does this
outdoors in the cold of November. Her story is that a gang of white
men abducted and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   When Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox realized that
Tawana Brawley's story had been made up, that it was all a lie,
they should have recognized that this was a very disturbed child, a
child in deep psychological trouble and in need of immediate
professional help, and they should have seen that she got it. They
claimed, after all, to be ``advisers'' to her family.
</P>
<P>
   Instead these grown men clambered gleefully onto Tawana's wild
tale and rode it for all it was worth. They became stars, trailed
by television cameras and cheered by their supporters as if they
were heroes. They had a fine time making their outrageous comments
and crazy charges, and seemed unconcerned that they were defaming
people, damaging lives and further poisoning race relations. In the
process they betrayed and exploited a teen-age girl who really
needed their help.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to know about their relationship with Tawana
Brawley is contained in a comment Sharpton made a few months ago.
He said he had never questioned Miss Brawley about the alleged
rape. As he put it: ``I would not engage in sex talk with a
15-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The three so-called advisers were never interested in what had
really happened. The spotlight beckoned, and not one of them had
the strength of character to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley's most recent public appearance was at a church in
Brooklyn last December. At 25, she still looked immature, even
childlike. It was both weird and painful to watch her continue to
insist after all these years: ``I'm not a liar. I'm not crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley was not the only one betrayed. Maddox, Mason and
especially Sharpton have proclaimed to all who would listen that
they were ``leaders'' of the black community in New York. To some
extent that was true. Without question Sharpton stepped into a
leadership void, running for office, comforting families victimized
by police excesses, paying attention to some of the powerless and
voiceless people that politicians of all backgrounds have largely
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again I have heard black residents say of Sharpton:
``At least he bothered to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of leadership did he provide? It's awfully hard to
make the case that you are serving the interests of black New
Yorkers by spending more than a decade's worth of energy in the
service of a mammoth and destructive lie.
</P>
<P>
   When it suits him, Sharpton offers himself as a statesman. He
had the opportunity to be one in the Brawley case. When he found
out that Miss Brawley was lying, he could have met with his inner
circle and explained why it was necessary and much better in the
long run to 'fess up.
</P>
<P>
   He could have taken the lead in securing the help Miss Brawley
needed. He could have explained to the public, truthfully and
convincingly, how the story of a troubled teen-ager had spiraled
dangerously out of control and what he and his colleagues were
doing to curtail the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's base of support among black residents would not have
been hurt by that kind of admission. And it is very likely that
such an example of tough leadership would have gained him admirers
among the wider public.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not Al Sharpton. He is drawn to the quick score, the
reckless remark, the provocative radio or TV appearance, and most
of all the laughter and applause of the crowd. His supporters get
plenty of entertainment but no real leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people have said they continue to support Miss
Brawley because she is a latter-day example of the black women who
have been systematically raped by white men over the centuries. I
disagree. This case is a mirror image of those many terrible cases
in which black men were falsely accused of rape by white women.
Sharpton, Mason and Maddox are all deeply aware of the tragic
consequences of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   But that awareness did nothing to temper their behavior. If they
learned anything from history, it was the worst possible lessons.

<P>
   Last year, Chase Manhattan, the country's largest bank, lent
about $890 million to an Australian utility, Loy Yang B. Typically,
to avoid putting too many eggs in one basket, banks try to get
other banks to assume part of the risk by taking portions of big
loans.
</P>
<P>
   But Chase gave Loy Yang such generous terms _ a maturity of at
least 15 years and a rock-bottom interest rate _ that it found few
takers. And now, with the Australian economy squeezed by Asia's
financial crisis, most of the Loy Yang loan is gathering dust on
Chase's books.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chase nor Loy Yang said the loan was troubled. Chase
said it was saddled with few loans that it had been unable to divvy
up with other banks and that it had ample resources to protect it
from loan losses.
</P>
<P>
   But bountiful lending like this _ whether to overseas customers,
builders in booming hotel markets like Las Vegas or nuts-and-bolts
operators like heavy manufacturers _ still gives some bankers and
federal regulators the jitters. They have criticized freewheeling
practices in certain markets, including the trillion-dollar
business of splitting up big loans _ a business, known as
syndicated lending, that is dominated by Chase, Citicorp, J.P.
Morgan, BankAmerica, Nationsbank and other big banks.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern is that banks are lending too freely, either to
rack up one-time fees or to generate other business. Banks can do
all sorts of things to keep the lending mill churning. They can
lend at artificially low interest rates, perhaps too low to reward
them for their risks, and they can stretch out repayment schedules,
leaving themselves exposed to unforeseen economic tumult. In
addition, covenants _ standards borrowers must meet to avoid having
the bank demand repayment _ can be loosened or ignored entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Some liken the zealousness to the heady days of the 1980s, when
banks chased real estate loans with all the determination and
earnestness of lemmings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of getting better, it just gets crazier and crazier,''
said Richard Kovacevich, chief executive of Norwest Corp., a big
Minneapolis bank. ``The basics of banking are just being filtered
away in order to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   John Medlin, former chairman of Wachovia Corp., a bank in
Winston-Salem, N.C., said in a December speech that lending
practices were the worst he had seen in nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   A letter the Federal Reserve sent to banks on June 23 offered a
rare glimpse into how some banks now do business. The Fed, while
noting that there is still little evidence that problem loans are
on the rise, said it was concerned that lending standards were
slipping _ presenting dangers should the economy stall and
borrowers have trouble paying what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said that only 20 to 30 percent of several hundred loans
it reviewed earlier this year had been thoroughly screened by banks
to see how well they would hold up during a slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely a startling number,'' said Charles Peabody,
a bank analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. ``The Fed
said the pricing was getting narrower and maturities were being
lengthened. If you are cutting the prices of loans and extending
the terms, you better be darn sure what the future holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Why such hand-wringing when the economy is the most robust it
has been in decades, and banks, whose lending is buttressed by
newfangled computer safeguards, are enjoying record profits?
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and others are still haunted by the ghost of the
1980s banking debacle, when scores of major banks were brought to
their knees by reckless lending. When the Bank of New England
collapsed in 1991, most regulators were caught by surprise. By the
time the smoke cleared in the early 1990s, 11 of the nation's 0
largest banks had to be closed or sold because of bad loans. As a
result, it became harder than at any time since the Depression for
businesses and consumers to get loans.
</P>
<P>
   With many analysts now warning that the U.S. economy cannot
surge indefinitely, especially if Asia's woes have more impact
here, regulators are concerned that imprudent lending could once
again wreak havoc if the economy hits a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the rush to lend, the creditworthiness of borrowers is
moving rapidly down scale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, only about 12 percent of syndicated loans went to
companies already carrying heavy debt and subpar credit ratings,
according to the comptroller of the currency. By 1997, fully 17
percent of syndicated loans were to such indebted borrowers. And at
the end of this year's first quarter, that figure had soared to 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Williams, the acting comptroller, said in an interview
that she was ``very uneasy'' about lending standards at banks,
citing lax standards in syndicated lending, lending to midsized
companies and commercial real estate lending. She said that the
comptroller's office had addressed its concerns in discussions with
banks, and that some senior executives had been surprised to learn
about questionable lending decisions made by their underlings.
</P>
<P>
   But big banks said they were vigilant about their lending
practices and constantly reviewed loans to make sure they were
sound. They said the Fed's lending survey was skewed by loans from
smaller, regional banks that they said might be less cautious in
their lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've appropriately priced and structured the
deals,'' said Robert Strong, Chase's chief credit officer. ``We're
comfortable with what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts consider Strong a sober-minded and effective manager.
But some current and former Chase employees, and some analysts,
worry that James Lee Jr., who oversees Chase's syndicated lending
business, can override the bank's credit managers when he wants to
complete a deal. Chase orchestrated some $474 billion in syndicated
loans last year, a small but undisclosed portion of which remained
on the bank's books.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lee declined to be interviewed. But Strong said Lee does not
have the authority to approve loans and cannot circumvent the loan
review process at Chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of quick, informal handshake kind of
deals,'' Strong said, adding that Chase regularly takes months to
scrutinize and ``stress test'' large loans. Strong pointed out that
since the 1980s, Chase has diversified its lending and sharply
reduced the number of loans it holds.
</P>
<P>
   Other big banks say they are similarly disciplined. Citicorp,
which flirted with collapse in the early 1990s because of errant
lending and has since instituted tougher lending policies, has
expanded its commercial and industrial loan portfolio to $59.3
billion last year from about $36 billion in 1992. But analysts and
the bank said they were comfortable with the quality of those
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate lending, the perennial bogeyman of the banking
business, appears to be relatively sound throughout the industry,
but analysts said there were early signs that lending guidelines
were drooping. A recent study by the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche observed that construction loans that once had conservative
maturities of one, three or five years now involve ``almost
permanent lending of seven to 10 years,'' thus exposing banks for
longer periods to the notoriously boom-and-bust nature of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Banks had about $400 billion in commercial mortgages last year,
up from $300 billion in 1993, Deloitte said. Banks' exposure to
related forms of lending, including loans to real estate investment
trusts and the packaging and selling of mortgage-backed securities,
is harder to quantify because no comprehensive, entirely accurate
statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a large increase in real estate lending, and when
you put it all together _ adding in whole loans, REIT debt, and
mortgage-backed securities _ it has grown significantly,'' said
Dennis Yeskey, Deloitte's managing director for real estate
services. ``Whatever one does today is locked in for the next few
years at a minimum, and that's not something that is easy to get
off your books.''
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas, the nation's fastest-growing city, has enjoyed a
building boom fueled by such huge projects as Mirage Resorts Inc.'s
$1.6 billion Bellagio casino. The Bellagio will open this fall, but
gambling industry analysts question whether there will be enough
demand to support such huge hotels.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica Corp., the largest lender to Las Vegas operators and
a backer of the Bellagio, said it was confident in the Bellagio's
prospects and in the quality of outstanding loans to other gambling
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say we haven't relaxed a covenant here or
there,'' said William Newby, a managing director in charge of
BankAmerica's gambling portfolio. ``But we're not giving away cheap
money with no covenants at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage-backed securities are an example of real estate
investing that gives banks greater flexibility in managing risk.
After all, the securities, which represent an ownership stake in
mortgages made by banks and others, can be sold to investors and
swept off a bank's books _ as long as investors want to buy them.
Should the economy or interest rates swing against them, banks
could be left holding the bag.
</P>
<P>
   First Union Corp. and Nationsbank, two of the most active
participants in this market, have seen their holdings rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
   First Union now holds about $24 billion in mortgage-backed
securities, up from about $11 billion in early 1997. First Union
said the credit quality of all of those securities was excellent
and that the investments were used to manage risk, not to
speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Nationsbank declined to discuss the quality of its loans or
investments, citing a pending merger with BankAmerica and a coming
earnings announcement. It owns $29.5 billion of mortgage-backed
securities, up from $9.9 billion early last year, and attributes
part of the growth to acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Norwest's Kovacevich said that historically
problems in bank lending first emerged in consumer loans _ like the
recent downturn in the credit card market _ and then appeared in
large-scale commercial lending. If current lending standards
continue to deteriorate, Kovacevich said he was unsure that big
commercial lending snafus could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   And if serious lending problems do emerge down the road, only a
handful of people will be the first to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has learned many lessons from past excesses, and
the average bank is exercising more diligence than was the case in
the late 1980s,'' said James McCormick, president of First
Manhattan Consulting Group, which specializes in financial
institutions. ``But ultimately only the regulators will know
whether some banks are pushing the lending envelope too far.''

SAN LUIS (SAN LUIS, Sonora, Mexico) - It's been one year since a
crusading San Luis, Sonora, newspaper publisher was murdered.
Journalists from throughout northern Mexico converged on the
burgeoning border community. It is dangerous being a journalist in
Mexico these days and they are determined to change that, just as
they are determined to see that justice is served in the
newspaperman's murder. It is so dangerous that the publisher from
Tijuana, ambushed last year, decided not to make the trip, fearing
for his safety in San Luis. He is under constant guard, and his two
sons, photographers for the paper, wear bullet-proof vests and are
escorted round the clock by federal authorities trying to keep them
alive. Story will include some color from a graveside memorial

IN SHIFT, EASTMAN KODAK CITES BIG EARNINGS GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co. reported nearly a 35 percent gain in
second-quarter earnings Wednesday, reversing a six-quarter-long
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The photography giant, based in Rochester, N.Y., earned $495
million, or $1.51 a diluted share, compared with $368 million, or
$1.11, a year earlier. Even excluding a one-time gain of 13 cents a
share, from the sale of Kodak's stake in Gretag Imaging, the
earnings were well above the $1.13 a share that Wall Street
analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Although losses from digital photography remained high, and
total revenue declined 4.9 percent, to $3.7 billion, investors
reacted as though the quarter had been perfect. Kodak's shares
soared $8.75, or nearly 12 percent, to $82.50, as analysts pushed
up their earnings estimates for all of 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured they could beat us, but never by this much,'' said
Jonathan Rosenzweig of Salomon Smith Barney, who had expected the
quarter's earnings to reach $1.15. ``I am a very happy camper.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts took the figures as proof that Kodak was making
good on its pledge last fall to cut research costs, stanch its
hemorrhaging digital portfolio and eliminate almost 20,000 jobs _ a
fifth of its work force. The company's stated goal was to reduce
$500 million from costs both this year and next. Costs are already
down $350 million for the first half of 1998, putting Kodak ahead
of schedule. Indeed, even its line of writable compact disks, which
lost $100 million last year, is nearing the break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even over $100, this wouldn't be an overvalued stock now,''
said Peter Enderlin, an analyst with First Albany Corp.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The quarter did have disappointments. Kodak's domestic film
volume in units was up 10 percent, but continued pressure on prices
kept revenue growth to just 3 percent. Sales in emerging markets,
which had been one of Kodak's fastest-growing areas, plunged 14
percent, in good part because of Asia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from digital cameras was down about 5 percent, and the
company's digital-photography portfolio lost $64 million for the
quarter _ much reduced from the $102 million it lost in the second
quarter of 1997, but up from a $55 million loss in 1998's first
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two growth levers just didn't deliver for us,'' said
Harry Kavetas, Kodak's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Kavetas maintains that these are short-term setbacks. Kodak
continues to pump money into emerging markets, particularly China,
and expects growth to resume there soon.
</P>
<P>
   It is working with Intel Corp. to create photo-writable CDs, and
with America Online to allow the Internet access provider's
customers to receive digital versions of photographs by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   More important to analysts, Kodak is quitting ancillary products
and businesses. It sold a chain of photofinishing stores that it
had bought less than two years ago, aborting a retail strategy that
was pushing it into competition with its photofinishing customers.
It trimmed slow-moving products from its digital-photography line,
and folded its graphic arts business into Kodak Polychrome
Graphics, a joint venture with Dainippon Ink &AMP; Chemicals of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And it bailed out of sundry small businesses _ Cineon, which
makes special-effects equipment for movies, is one example _ that
served as little more than a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got rid of businesses we never even knew they were in,
and they got rid of them fast,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst
with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reider.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kodak-watchers also see happier news in the domestic film
picture. Although Kodak continues to reduce prices on packs of
slower-speed film, it is maintaining its price on the higher-priced
APS and high-speed Max lines. Indeed, Max films accounted for 31
percent of film sales, up from 27 percent in the second quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Max lines cost a few extra grains of silver to make, but
they get more than double the price,'' Yannas said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the general euphoria remains tempered by basic worries
about the outlook for the photography business. ``It's one thing to
stem digital losses or to steal film share from competitors,'' said
Jack Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. ``To really make money,
they've got to find a way to get people to take more pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavetas acknowledged that Kodak's revenue needed help. ``We
can't save our way to long-term growth,'' he said. ``But this
quarter has finally confirmed that we're getting our act
together.''

<P>
   ROME _ All fashion feeds on the new _ and the shocking _ and
Italian fashion even more than most. But in a world inured to
political scandal, nudity, profanity, sexual flamboyance and
celebrities' eternal falls from grace, there are very few taboos
left to break.
</P>
<P>
   That is perhaps why the Roman Catholic Church is an irresistible
theme for Italian designers seeking to make a splash. As
fall-winter collections got under way in Rome this week, fashion
designers sprinkled their shows with religious symbols.
</P>
<P>
   One designer announced he would send a model prancing down the
runway to the accompaniment of Pope John Paul II _ a CD recording
of the pope singing a Gregorian chant at Mass that was
electronically woven into a hip-hop background beat. Perhaps only
the Vatican, which threatened to sue the designer if he persisted,
was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Another designer had his models drinking holy water.
</P>
<P>
   From the ``Jesus Jeans'' of the early 1970's _ marketed with
provocative advertisements of a model in tight cutoffs under the
New Testament words, ``He who loves me, follows me'' _ to today's
shock-value Benetton ads, irreverence, or blasphemy to some, has
become a perennial of Italian fashion and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Italian pop artists, advertisers and designers seem
so inclined to invoke and provoke the Vatican is that the Catholic
Church in Italy is more closely woven into the fabric of secular
life than in almost any other Catholic country.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Fellini may have pioneered the trend in his satirical
1972 film ``Fellini's Roma,'' which featured an ecclesiastical
fashion show. But even today, offending the Vatican is one of the
surest ways of attracting publicity in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference with the iconoclasm of today and 20 years
ago is that they are driven by opposite fads. Fashion now is
invoking the Lord's name not in vain, but out of New Age vanity.
</P>
<P>
   If in the '60s and '70s the fashion industry was echoing a
social mood of rebellion and nonconformism, today's designers say
they are seeking to tap into the culture's yearning for spiritual
values, and in so doing happen to get the publicity they are after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a certain New Age dimension to my shows,''
said Kean Etro, the Milan-based designer, who said he wanted to
include the pope in Friday's show as ``my homage to the world of
introspection.''
</P>
<P>
   Etro, whose family-owned company, Etro, has a store in New York
on Madison Avenue, said he would respect the Vatican's wishes and
find some other music for his show. ``I'm not looking for a
clash,'' he said, sounding a bit hurt by the church's response. ``I
meant this as a tribute to the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, however, was not flattered. ``This is outrageous
and offensive to believers,'' said Archbishop John Foley, head of
the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, any comment only gets them more attention,
which is what they seek, but I personally cannot let something like
this go by,'' he said. ``They are guilty of sacrilege _ using a
sacred part of the liturgy for a very secular event _ a fashion
show.''
</P>
<P>
   The church is far less influential in Italian politics and
social life than in years past (Catholicism ceased to be the state
religion of Italy in 1984), but its views on issues ranging from
homosexuality, school curriculums, birth control and divorce are
widely heard. The Holy See is an independent nation-state in the
center of Rome, with its own newspapers, television stations and
publishing houses and vast real-estate holdings. In a country where
politicians and most secular institutions carry little weight with
ordinary citizens, the church is the country's most imposing and,
to some, oppressive institution.
</P>
<P>
   When newspapers first announced Etro's intention, Vatican Radio,
which owns the copyright to the pope's recordings, immediately
threatened to sue the designer and the producers of the CD,
insisting the music was a copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   While based on the pope's a cappella singing of the preface to
the Mass, the arrangement, titled ``Forgive Us,'' sounds less like
a Gregorian chant than a slightly solemn summer pop tune. It is
highly unlikely that the pope would give his blessing to such an
endeavor, but the composers were also aggrieved by the Vatican's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't meant to be blasphemous or even ironic,'' said
Andrea Mariotti, one of the composers. ``It is very beautiful and
emotional.'' He selected the pope, he said, ``because I was
searching for the big idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariotti, who said he began his project with cooperation from
the church, now charges that the Vatican moved to prevent him from
selling his CD in stores not out of religious concerns, but
commercial ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to block me so they can steal the idea and
sell it themselves,'' he said. Certainly, there are people in Rome
who believe that this recording of the pope's singing could be
profitable. ``This CD could be gigantic if it is ever released,''
Etro said. ``Bigger than Elton John's tribute to Princess Diana.''

<P>
   The publicity payoffs of iconoclasm are mixed with odd snippets
of New Age sincerity. Guillermo Mariotto, the designer for the
Rome-based fashion house Gattinoni, made headlines during last
year's fashion week by holding his show inside an Anglican Church
(no Catholic church would accept such a proposal) with a runway
model dressed as the Virgin Mary. Mariotto said he had planned to
have the model wear a crown of thorns, but was gently dissuaded by
Anglican officials, who told him such a gesture might offend the
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the sacristy of a consecrated church, on a telephone
conference about the crown of thorns with the office of the
Archbishop of Canterbury,'' Mariotto recalled. ``I felt like the
most important person in the world. I was crying with happiness.''
He switched to a crown of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   This year Mariotto, who said he was a believing Christian,
substituted holy water for beer in the show on Monday night. The
theme was unfinished fashion, a tribute to the hundreds of
construction sites all over Rome that are being made ready for the
year 2,000 jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   One scene called for models, dressed as construction workers, to
spill out of a bar, guzzling beer. ``I put holy water in the
models' bottles instead,'' he confided. ``I wanted to save the
girls in the show from feelings of envy and bad energy.''

DALLAS AREA GRAPPLES WITH DEADLY HEAT WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ With 16 deaths here already tied to the heat this
summer and with temperatures of 100 degrees or more for 10 days in
a row, county health officials have declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency measures were imposed Tuesday after eight
heat-related deaths were reported in two days, said Betty
Culbreath, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human
Services Department. Most of the victims have been the elderly who
had other health problems, Ms. Culbreath said, although children 5
and under are also at risk. ``People are taking better care of
their children than their elderly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave has been blamed for more than 50 deaths in all,
including 23 in Texas and 20 in Louisiana. Oklahoma's state
epidemiologist, Mike Crutcher, said he had received reports of six
heat-related deaths in the past month, compared with four for last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The county health agency has set up a hot line so the elderly,
the disabled and the poor can call to get air conditioners
repaired, to receive a free fan or to get help in paying utility
bills, Ms. Culbreath said. City recreation centers and other public
buildings were open during business hours to people who needed a
place to cool off, and six of the centers were prepared for
overnight use if needed, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 deaths in Dallas are the most heat-related fatalities in
recent memory, Ms. Culbreath said. In comparison, for all of last
year there were 17 heat-related deaths in the entire state, said
Doug McBride, the public information officer with the Texas Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service also reported that the Dallas area,
through Wednesday, has had 23 days when the high reached or topped
100 degrees. But that is far from the record set in 1980 of 69 days
of temperatures of 100 degrees or more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael Foster, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service
in Fort Worth, said the recent heat wave has been caused by an
upper-level high pressure system that covers the area, preventing
cloud formation and rainfall and blocking other weather patterns
from moving in. Laredo, Texas, on the border with Mexico, recorded
a high Tuesday of 113 degrees, Foster said, the highest reading.
</P>
<P>
   The heat, combined with a lack of rain, has already cost Texas
agriculture $1.5 billion _ which translates to a $4.6 billion loss
to the state's economy _ as cotton plants shrivel and ranchers are
forced to sell hungry livestock, the Texas Agricultural Extension
Service reported. The losses could go higher unless there is
cooling rain soon, an agricultural economist said, perhaps
surpassing the record $1.9 billion in losses from the drought of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat, most Dallas residents, accustomed to summer
temperatures in the mid-90s, went on with business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Rodriguez, a 91-year-old who received national attention
last year when a drive-through bank was built around his modest
house, said he sat under a shade tree in his back yard Sunday,
watching the bank's time-and-temperature sign as the temperature
rose to 110 degrees. The weather service said that temperature
broke a record for the date, set in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   At Sammy's Bar-B-Q, a smattering of diners sat on the covered
area outside to eat barbecued beef and brisket, potato salad and
fried okra. ``We're accustomed to it,'' said Jane Mills, 37, who
moved to Dallas from Boston in that sizzling summer of 1980. ``I
remember my first summer in Texas, eating Popsicles and laying on a
bed and thinking, `I'm going to die.' Last weekend, I was playing
tennis and it was 105.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a 23-year-old man died after bicycling in the heat
here, John Lauck of Plano, Texas, took his customary noontime run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to stay well hydrated and stay in the shade to
run,'' Lauck said. ``I haven't missed a day yet because of the
heat.''

TUMOR-STARVING DRUG FOUND TO BOOST RADIATION TREATMENT IN MICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angiostatin, a tumor-starving drug from the laboratory of
Harvard's Dr. Judah Folkman, dramatically boosts the anticancer
effect of radiation treatment in mice without causing additional
side effects, researchers are reporting today.
</P>
<P>
   When the experimental drug was combined with standard doses of
radiation, human tumors implanted in mice stopped growing or shrank
to a far greater degree than with either treatment alone, say the
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   If effective in humans, the synergistic combination ``could make
radiation much more effective at providing local control of
cancer'' including prostate, brain, head and neck cancers,
soft-tissue sarcomas and others, said Dr. Ralph Weichselbaum,
chairman of radiation oncology at the University of Chicago, and
lead author of the report in the current Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The other authors are from Harvard Medical School and
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, and Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin was discovered in Folkman's laboratory at Children's
Hospital in Boston. It is one of the most potent of substances
known as ``angiogenesis inhibitors'' that work by blocking the
growth of small blood vessels tumors need to grow; the drugs don't
directly attack tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin has not yet been tested in humans, but it and
another drug from Folkman's lab, endostatin, have shown powerful
tumor-shrinking effects in mice. The drugs are being developed by
the National Cancer Institute and a biotech company with hopes of
initial human trials sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give it to patients tomorrow'' if it were available, said
Weichselbaum of angiostatin. He noted that the substance, a natural
protein found in the body, is apparently non-toxic in mice and that
it worked even when given for only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   At present, angiostatin is available only in minute amounts from
researchers who make it through a laborious process in their
laboratories. It won't be available for testing in combination with
radiation or other therapies until it passes stringent safety tests
in a small number of patients, which will be in 1999 at the
earliest. The angiostatin used in the experiments was made at
Northwestern University, said Weichselbaum.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists tested radiation and angiostatin separately on
mice, some that had mouse lung cancers and others that had human
tumors created by injecting them with human cancer cells. The
resulting tumors were large, in some cases weighing as much as 5
1/2 percent of the animal's body weight.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers combined injections of angiostatin in low
doses with radiation therapy. In one group of experiments using
mice with transplanted human larynx cancers, the combination
treatment shrank tumors by an average of 64 percent compared with
reductions of 16 percent and 18 percent respectively with
angiostatin alone or radiation alone.
</P>
<P>
   When they carried out autopsies on the mice, the researchers
discovered something surprising: the angiostatin and radiation had
shrunk the tumors by destroying the blood vessels, not by killing
the cancer directly. This was a surprise, said Weichselbaum in a
telephone interview, because radiation usually works by damaging
the DNA, or genetic material, in cancer cells _ not by targeting a
tumor's blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The angiostatin, he said, apparently made the blood vessels more
sensitive to radiation, so that the radiation ``really poops out''
the vessels and causes them to shrivel away.
</P>
<P>
   The results point in the future to combining angiogenesis
inhibitors not just with radiation but also with other DNA-damaging
agents like chemotherapy drugs as a new way to increase the potency
of cancer treatment without adding toxic side effects, said
Weichselbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, in an interview, termed the findings ``a beautiful new
phenomenon'' that underscores the likely role of angiogenesis
inhibitors as team players in future cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking well-known conventional therapies (such as
radiation), which are OK in themselves but have a lot of side
effects, and increasing their power'' through angiostatin's ability
to focus the radiation damage on the tumor's blood vessels, while
sparing the surrounding normal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they're doing,'' Folkman said of the report's
authors, ``is making anti-angiogenic radiotherapy'' _ in effect, a
new form of cancer treatment.

BATTLE OVER MANAGED CARE HEATS UP AS SENATE GOP UNVEILS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The political battle over managed care intensified
Wednesday as Senate Republican leaders unveiled their own
legislative ``patient bill of rights'' to rein in cost-conscious
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate GOP measure sets up a procedure for patients to
appeal when their health plan refuses to cover a particular
treatment. Patients could first appeal to officials of the plan
and, if not satisfied, take their complaint to an independent
appeal body that the plan has arranged for. The outside body's
decision would be binding.
</P>
<P>
   If they are still not satisfied, patients could sue the plan.
</P>
<P>
   This procedure contrasts sharply with a Democratic plan,
introduced in March, that permits lawsuits against health plans
without the appeals process when coverage decisions lead to more
illness or death.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Democratic measure, the Republican plan would make
the cost of health insurance fully tax deductible for the
self-employed. And it envisions a dramatic expansion of special
savings accounts for medical needs, which are encouraged through
tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP appeals plan and its expansion of medical savings
accounts would cost the U.S. treasury about $11 billion over 10
years, said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a position to say how we will pay for it,'' he said
at a news conference at the U.S. Capitol. ``But we will pay for it
in a non-controversial manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the Democratic proposal, the Senate Republicans said
their measure addresses concerns about managed care without the
Democrats' government mandates that they said would drive up
premium costs and lead employers to drop coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in the political game,'' said Sen. Don
Nickels, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Republican task force that
developed the Republican alternative. ``We're interested in
improving quality health care.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said
he intends to bring the GOP plan to the Senate floor before the end
of the month. At the news conference, Nickles said Republicans are
willing to consider the Democratic measure and vote on it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been asking for it,'' he said. ``We're willing to
comply.''
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between the GOP and Democratic Senate
proposals is that the Republicans would leave most regulation to
states and cover only those patients whose health plans are exempt
from state law.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' bill would cover all people in a managed care
plan, regardless of whether their health care is exempt from state
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican plan focuses almost exclusively on the 48
million Americans who receive health coverage from so-called
employer self-insured plans. These employees represent about a
third of the estimated 150 million Americans covered by some kind
of managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   In these self-insured plans, employers can contract with managed
care companies to provide health care for employees, but it is the
employers _ not the health plan _ that assumes the financial risk
if, say, a worker comes down with a rare form of cancer that
requires costly treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the employer self-insured plans are exempt
from state regulation and state court lawsuits for damages.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Senate plan would rely primarily on state
regulations to address the complaints of those 100 million or so
Americans in so-called fully insured plans, in which a managed care
company contracts with an employer to provide health care coverage
and assumes all the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would amend federal law to permit workers in
self-insured plans to receive obstetric or gynecological or
pediatric care without a referral from a primary care
``gatekeeper.'' It would also require such plans to cover most
emergency room service in hospitals not affiliated with the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Self-insured employers also would have to offer employees a
so-called point-of-service option, in which a patient pays extra to
choose a doctor outside the plan's physician network.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill would make these guarantees part of all
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the GOP news conference, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, offered an
impassioned plea for expanded medical savings accounts, saying they
guarantee that patients can see the doctors of their choice _ a
major complaint about managed care _ without the Democratic bill's
reliance on government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our bill, when you want to see a doctor, you don't have
to call a gatekeeper, you don't have to get a lawyer, you don't
have to see a government bureaucrat,'' he said. ``You simply have
to call up and say, `Do you take Visa or Master Charge, or do you
take a check?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm drew laughter when he said President Clinton, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and other Democrats ``draw back from (medical
savings accounts) like a vampire from a cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at a separate news conference, Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., called medical savings accounts a ``disaster''
that favors those who are well off and healthy over those who are
poorer and less healthy. When asked to respond to Gramm's reference
to vampires, Daschle said the GOP proposal, if adopted, would
result in ``sucking the blood out of the American health care
system.''
</P>
<P>
   After Daschle spoke, Kennedy, the primary Senate author of the
Democrats' bill, said of the GOP version: ``(It's) not a bill of
rights; it's a bill of wrongs.''
</P>
<P>
   With most polls showing high levels of voter anxiety over
managed care, Republican senators were under immense pressure to
release a plan in order to avoid being caught empty-handed and open
to Democratic finger-pointing on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care now accounts for more than 80 percent of
employer-based health care coverage in the United States. Under
managed care, health plans monitor services provided to patients to
ensure they are medically necessary. Increasingly, however,
patients are complaining that managed care too frequently denies
them thorough medical attention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS _ STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both pro-regulation consumer groups and anti-regulation managed
care industry representatives reacted negatively to the Republican
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a leading
proponent of managed care regulation, said the GOP measure was
``much ado about very little.'' The bill's emphasis on medical
savings accounts is ``great for the healthy and wealthy, disastrous
for everyone else,'' he said. Refusing to permit lawsuits by
patients against managed care companies means ``there's no
deterrent effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Benefits Coalition, representing more than 30 managed
care companies, insurance firms and employers, said the Republican
bill would ``only increase health care costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans, which represents more
than 1,000 such plans, said that while the GOP bill avoids some of
the ``micromanagement'' of the Democratic plan, it ``still relies
heavily on government mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the managed care front, President Clinton took part
in a roundtable discussion with doctors, nurses and families who
described problems they have encountered with the system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said horror stories of denied coverage showed that
Congress needs to pass a patient's bill of rights this session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a political issue, and anybody who has personally
experienced it feels the same way,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton is expected to attack the GOP measure when
he goes to Capitol Hill to join Democratic lawmakers and
representatives of the American Medical Association and the
American Nurses Association to pitch for passage of the Democrats'
bill.

ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG COSTS IN US TWICE THOSE IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promising new drugs to treat schizophrenia, depression, and
other severe mental illnesses typically cost twice as much in the
United States as they do in the rest of North America and in
Europe, according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The US price was higher for each of eight drugs sampled _ more
than six times higher in one case. And while the study focused on
antidepressants and antipsychotics, its authors say the disparity
in prices likely is as stark for antibiotics, heart drugs, and
other medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of people, if not tens of thousands, for
whom the impact of this price gouging is that they don't get
treated,'' said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's
Health Research Group, a Washington nonprofit that conducted the
study.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association of America, said that ``our companies
take on the extraordinary risk of drug discovery because the
American free-market system offers incentives and potential
rewards. In other countries around the world, especially Europe,
when the free market is stifled by price controls or patent piracy,
the lights in the laboratories go out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Public Citizen study was prompted by anecdotal reports of
big gaps in drug prices between Europe and America, said Dr. E.
Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and one of the authors. The reports
dealt with the new generation of drugs to treat mental illness, he
added, and since his organization long has been concerned about
problems of the mentally ill, he and others decided to run an
in-depth study.
</P>
<P>
   Five antidepressants and three antipsychotic drugs were selected
for the survey, and the costs to pharmacists in the United States,
Canada, Mexico, and 14 European countries were compared for an
average 30-day supply of each medication available there. The
findings were dramatic: For most drugs in most countries there was
a relatively narrow cost difference. The big exception was the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The widely touted antidepressent fluoxetine (Prozac), for
instance, cost an average of $317.03 in America and $111.20 on
average in the 16 other countries. Fluvoxamine (Luvox), used to
treat obsessive-compulsive disorders, was 2.3 times more expensive
here, while clozapine (Clozaril), used for schizophrenia, cost 2.9
times more.
</P>
<P>
   Why the huge differences?
</P>
<P>
   All the other countries have national health insurance of some
form, which gives them clout in negotiations with big
pharmaceutical companies, the study authors say. That same clout
applies in the United States in the case of agencies, such as the
Veterans Administration, that get drugs at prices as low as those
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers of the drugs studied earned more than $12
billion annually in profits in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States they basically can charge what the market
will bear,'' said Torrey. ``These are not drugs just to enhance the
quality of your life, like Viagra. These are drugs people need to
not be suicidal, to not be homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Tarutis, a board member of the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill, was equally alarmed by the findings. ``Why should the
same product cost twice as much in this country as it does in
European countries?'' he asked. ``That's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holmer, whose group represents the makers of the eight drugs
studied and the rest of the US pharmaceutical industry, said that
some of the price differences may be a result of the
newly-strengthened position of the US dollar, differences in costs
of living in countries studied, variations in medical practices,
and other methodological issues involved in the Public Citizen
study.
</P>
<P>
   Price controls like those in the other countries, he added,
``are a dagger aimed at the hearts of America's patients. If price
controls are imposed there will be less investment in research and
development and far fewer new cures and treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, however, said that drug companies ``use research
blackmail to cover everything. ... Those companies would neither go
out of business nor would they have to retrench on their research''
if prices to US consumers were brought in line with those of our
industrial partners.

COMMENTARY: HELL FREEZES OVER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno told the Senate
Judiciary Committee's Arlen Specter on Wednesday she was prepared
to take _ and in reality evade _ his questions about Chinese
penetration of the White House ``until hell freezes over.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was an apt metaphor for an investigation long encased in
ice. Twenty-one months ago, journalists discovered evidence of
financial corruption in the 1996 political campaign led by a band
of Asian-Americans close to Clinton-Gore who were fronting for
illegal overseas money.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even after the FBI reported a connection to Beijing
intelligence, the Reno Justice Department hid its head in the sand.
First the investigation was assigned to ``Public Integrity''
incompetents. After newspapers dug up facts unknown to her
time-servers, she again avoided independent counsel by appointing a
supposedly hotshot San Diego prosecutor _ who indicted small fry
identified earlier in press reports but then hastily bailed out as
the trail led into the White House.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week the New York Times reporters Don Van Natta Jr. and
David Johnston revealed that the revolving-door Justice team was
now disheartened and floundering. A Times editorial nailed down the
reason: ``If you want to prevent a ship from reaching its
destination, just keep changing the navigators.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with this, the attorney general sniffed: ``one
newspaper editorial should not dictate public policy.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this investigation was initiated by ``leaks'' in print from
journalism to Justice, not the other way around. And the need to
take it out of the hands of a deeply conflicted Justice Department,
it turns out, is supported by the man best in a position to know:
FBI Director Louis Freeh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freeh has been worried all along that secret intelligence
gathered by the Bureau and the National Security Agency would make
its way back to the top White House policy makers close to the
Chinese operatives and most interested in shutting down the
investigation. In November of last year, this former federal judge
sent a 27-page legal memo to Reno urging her to seek independent
counsel that could safely work with the FBI. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reno has that report in her deep freeze. Freeh won't make public
his disagreement with her cover-up. But on June 19, the FBI general
counsel briefed Sens. Fred Thompson and John Glenn in detail on the
contents of Freeh's dissent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult'' the FBI counsel reported Freeh to have
written, ``to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an
independent counsel. . . . it's a conflict for the attorney general
to investigate her superiors.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did the law require Reno to have an actual conflict, as she had
told the Senate, and not merely the appearance of one? Not true,
according to Freeh; such a Justice Department proposal was
specifically rejected by a then-Democratic Congress as recently as
1994. ``The Attorney General can consider appearance,'' wrote the
FBI director, ``as well as actual conflict, might weaken public
confidence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senator Thompson reported that the ultimate conclusion by Freeh
was that the independent counsel law, which arose from Watergate
and was closely tied to campaign finance law, ``should be triggered
under both the mandatory and discretionary provisions of the
statute.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The discretionary part is inescapable, Freeh pointed out,
because ``the attorney general's chief investigator has concluded
that there is a political conflict of interest.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To these revelations of direct opposition from the FBI to her
unlawful misjudgment, Reno took refuge in her power to impose
secrecy: ``Our understanding was that the briefing was confidential
...'' Thompson disagreed; though Freeh's detailed opinion was hers
to suppress, ``As far as the oral part was concerned, we were under
no restraints ...'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a time when journalists are agonizingly examining our own
sources and methods, we do well to remember that this fund-raising
corruption affecting our national security was unearthed by
responsible reporters and is driven by fearless editorialists.
Clinton justice would rather await sub-zero in Hades.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a recent embassy reception, I ran into Louis Freeh. The only
thing he would say was, ``You guys led the way.''
</P>

FLEET FINANCIAL'S HIRING OF LATINAS CITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Latina Style magazine has named the Boston based
Fleet Financial Group on its list of 50 companies that offer
Hispanic women the most career opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based magazine, aimed at professional Hispanic
females, released the Latina Style 50 Wednesday in its July-August
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet was noted for having 11 Hispanic vice presidents, mentor
programs, 12 weeks of maternity or adoption leave, career
counseling, and training for Hispanic female employees, said Anna
Maria Arias, the magazine's publisher and editor. Fleet was the
only company that has its headquarters in New England to make the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Arias said the survey was based on questionnaires and interviews
with Hispanic women employees from Fleet and about 200 other
Fortune 500 businesses that cater specifically to the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of hearing the same thing from Hispanic women
about how hard it was to find a good job or to find one they're
happy with, the magazine decided to conduct this survey to let our
readers know which companies are best for Hispanic women,'' Arias
said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine used reader questionnaires to find out what
Hispanic women thought were the most important characteristics of
employers, and judged the businesses according to those qualities.
Arias said readers' top concerns included the number of Hispanic
women executives, child care, maternity leave, and mentor programs.
</P>
<P>
   Christie DeMichael, Fleet's director of diversity, said that the
company pays managers bonuses forreaching diversity goals, and that
Fleet has a diversity council. She also pointed to flexible work
programs and time off for volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs and policies make Fleet an employer of choice
for Latinas, one that offers challenge, support, and the
flexibility we all need to grow personally and professionally,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   To help select the top 50 businesses, the magazine also
conducted anonymous interviews with Hispanic women who work at each
of the companies surveyed, Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times companies look really good on paper, but when
it gets down to the day-to-day experience, Hispanic women are not
getting the treatment or opportunities they deserve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bard, the magazine's director of public relations and
marketing, said although the survey is geared toward Hispanic
women, it should apply to other groups as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic women are generally among the lowest in pay, rank,
and benefits, and if companies are good for them, they should be
good for all women and for men as well,'' Bard said.
</P>
<P>
   Helping Hispanic females find the best companies to work for is
important, Arias said, because the women have been known for being
loyal to their employers more than to their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic woman usually do not leave their jobs unless
something really bad happens to them or unless they hit the glass
ceiling,'' she said. ``So we're trying to help these women get
their careers off to the best start possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias said she hopes businesses take heed of the survey and use
it to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a heck of a lot of companies that are having a hard
time recruiting Hispanic women or keeping the Hispanic women that
are working for them, and this survey can help those businesses see
what they need to do to change that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of word of mouth in the Hispanic culture,''
Arias said. ``When one company is bad-mouthed or praised, word gets
out pretty fast, and people listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies on the list include Ford Motor Co., General
Motors Co., NationsBank Corp., SBC Communications, State Farm
Insurance Cos., The Walt Disney Co., and McDonald's Corp.

NEW NETSCAPE BROWSER AVAILABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. unveils Thrusday a preview version
of its latest Navigator Web browser, on the heels of a new study
that claims the company is still losing market share to bitter
rival Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Navigator 4.5 will be available free by downloading from the
Netscape Web site and numerous other sites on the Internet. The new
browser is being rolled out in conjunction with a major upgrade of
Netscape's Netcenter Web site. Indeed, some features of the new
browser are designed to keep the user coming back to the Netcenter
site. Netscape hopes to establish Netcenter as a popular portal to
the Internet, thus attracting millions in revenues from companies
wishing to display ads on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Navigator 4.5 will include a ``smart browsing'' feature that
will let the user go to a Web site without having to type long and
complicated addresses. Instead of http://www.boston.com/globe, the
user could type the words ``Boston Globe.'' The new browser would
connect to Netcenter, which stores a listing of 1.5 million proper
names, linked to particular Web pages. Netcenter would look up the
right Web address and send that information to the browser.
</P>
<P>
   The new Netscape browser will also have an e-mail program that
automatically looks up a person's e-mail address by checking a
Netcenter database. And it will contain a new feature that lets the
user store personal information at Netcenter, such as a personal
address book and bookmarks for favorite sites. A user could store
this information on Netcenter, instead of carrying around an
address book or laptop computer. Then he could get access to the
information by logging onto Netcenter from any Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Herendeen, Netscape's director of client marketing, said
that the company's decision last year to give away its browser for
no charge has slowed a sharp decline in market share. Netscape
formerly charged between $29 and $79 for versions of the browser,
while Microsoft gave away its Internet Explorer software.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Herendeen confirmed recent survey data that found
that Navigator, which once held 80 percent of the browser market,
is now hovering in the 50-percent range. Indeed, according to the
Internet advertising firm AdKnowledge, Netscape now holds about 52
percent of the market, with Microsoft at 45 percent and gaining.

ECONOMIC SCENE: PUERTO RICO AT A CROSSROADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To most Americans, the idea of a government-owned telephone
system is no doubt as alien, say, as driving on the left side of
the road. But to Puerto Ricans the proposed privatization of the
state-run telephone company is a fighting issue, with a majority
apparently preferring Big Brother to big business. ``We're children
of the New Deal,'' explained Marcos Rodriguez-Ema, president of the
government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More is at stake here than political symbolism, or even the
efficiency of the telephone system. Puerto Rico is under enormous
pressure to hew more closely to the capitalist road, in part
because it is losing special tax breaks and welfare subsidies from
Washington, and in part because no island can remain an island in
the increasingly integrated global economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of whether the Puerto Rican economy will
change, but how and when,'' said Jose Berrocal, a director of BT
Wolfensohn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Telephone Co. uses modern digital switching
equipment and, it is widely agreed, provides good service.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't particularly efficient. The company operated 204
lines per employee in 1996, compared with more than 300 at Bell
Atlantic. The return on capital is far below that of mainland
providers. And ominously, it has rapidly lost share in cellular
phones, the fastest-growing part of the business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when Congress opened local and intra-island telephone service
to competition in 1996, Puerto Rico's government decided to auction
it off. ``Our primary concern is that the managers of the
government enterprise didn't have the vision for a deregulated
market,'' Rodriguez-Ema said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to sell the system to GTE Corp. for $1.85 billion
(challenged at the 11th hour by another bidder, Spain's Telefonica
Internacional) led to a strike by the telephone workers' unions.
Last week, the strike made headlines nationwide when 50 other
Puerto Rican unions staged a two-day sympathy walkout that shut the
airport in San Juan, along with major shopping centers. And polls
show that the strikers enjoy considerable support in their
opposition to the sale of the ``national patrimony.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (According to news reports, one of the two telephone unions will
vote Thursday on ending the strike, though both still oppose
privatization.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a protest against a style of government,'' argued
Heidie Calero, an economic consultant in San Juan who favors
privatization but objects to the government's ``high-handed''
manner in decreeing the sale without bothering to explain the
necessity.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government of Puerto Rico is apparently holding fast to the
decision to sell the phone company _ though the unspecified bid
from Telefonica does put in doubt who will end up with the prize.
And whoever does buy it will likely go partway to relieve the
union's anxiety about job security. ``The buyers will need labor
peace, and they know it,'' Rodriguez-Ema acknowledged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more formidable challenge, illustrated by the resistance to
telephone privatization, is to shake the economy out of its
dependence on government. While the island's gross domestic product
per capita is one-third that of the mainland, transfers through
Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and a variety of other social
programs keep living standards within hailing distance. Indeed, a
combination of the social safety net, the application of the
national minimum wage and federal tax breaks for manufacturing keep
competitive wages quite high. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Therein lies a rub. High wages make it difficult for Puerto Rico
to compete with the rest of the Caribbean in both tourism and
labor-intensive products. Unemployment, now at 14 percent, topped
20 percent for much of the 1980s. Yet the tax breaks, which led to
the development of a huge pharmaceutical and electronics
manufacturing sector _ not to mention the creation of tens of
thousands of white-collar jobs _ will be phased out over the next
six years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-Ema plays down the impact of losing these so-called
Section 936 benefits, which the current, statehood-minded
administration of Puerto Rico viewed as a crutch. ``The
pharmaceutical makers are hiring, not firing,'' he pointed out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is hard to look at economic trends and come up an
unalloyed pessimist. Total employment, below 700,000 as recently as
1985, now hovers around a million. Per capita income is close to
$8,000 and has been growing more rapidly than on the mainland for
several generations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in Berrocal's view, Puerto Rico is at a crossroads. The
welfare state, he acknowledges, has provided good jobs for a
minority and an adequate living standard for the majority. But it
has also robbed the island of the opportunity to break out
economically. And it has created vested interests with a great deal
to lose from change.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world is not standing still, though, and the repeal of
Section 936 suggests that Congress isn't either. ``We've just got
to declare it isn't going to be business as usual,'' Berrocal
concluded. &QL;

COMPAQ REPORTS LOSS FOR QUARTER DUE TO DIGITAL ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (rm)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. reported a second-quarter loss of $3.63
billion Wednesday, resulting largely from its acquisition of
Digital Equipment Corp.. But Compaq eked out a tiny operating
profit that beat analysts' expectations of a break-even quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While the quarterly results had few surprises, Compaq, analysts
said, appeared to have made progress at reducing the excess
inventory at distributors and dealers that has eroded earnings in
recent quarters. The challenges now are to maintain sales momentum
amid tough competition and to successfully integrate Digital into
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, based in Houston, said last month that it was closing
six plants overseas and eliminating 5,000 jobs, including 1,000 at
its Houston headquarters. The company is planning to cut 17,000
jobs as it absorbs Digital, and another recent acquisition, Tandem
Computer. The cuts will leave Compaq with a work force of 67,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Compaq lost $3.63 billion, compared with
earnings of $257 million, or 17 cents a share, fully diluted, in
the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 7 percent, to $11.52
billion, from $10.79 billion in the second quarter of 1997. Second
quarter 1998 earnings include charges of $3.63 billion related to
the Digital acquisition; without these charges, Compaq had earnings
for the quarter of $32 million, or 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts expected the company to break even,
according to a survey by First Call Corp., an investment research
company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Compaq ended down 12.5 cents, at $33.5625, in very
heavy trading on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has struggled to compete with Dell Computer Corp., which
sells direct to customers, builds each computer to order, maintains
very little inventory and thus has lower costs. Last year Compaq
announced it was moving to a build-to-order business model but
retaining the dealer channel, and that it would reduce its
inventory. In the transition to the new model, however, Compaq
flooded the dealer channel with product, leading to a glut of PCs
and fierce price cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made good progress in driving down the inventory
during the quarter, but my sense is it needs to come down a little
further,'' Todd Bakar, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist of San
Francisco, said. He said he was also concerned about ongoing
pricing pressure. ``A lot of the sell-through in the quarter came
with very aggressive pricing and promotions, so you have to ask
what sort of unit growth they can sustain going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq executives said the third quarter would be a transitional
one as the company managed the integration of Digital and worked to
bring that company's cost structure in line with its own. Analysts
noted that at 24 percent of sales, Digital's sales, general and
administrative costs were roughly twice those of Compaq, and would
have to be reduced sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the decisive steps taken to position our products
competitively in commercial channels worldwide and reset goals for
the newly combined companies, we are now moving aggressively to
achieve targeted levels of performance and growth,'' Earl Mason,
Compaq's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said.
``We continue to believe earnings for the combined companies will
be accretive as early as the fourth quarter.''

FOLDEROL OUTWEIGHS BASEBALL AT ALL-STAR EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They held a luncheon at Fenway Wednesday to trumpet the
1999 baseball All-Star Game, and the ratio of non-baseball people
to baseball people in attendance was about 10-1. In other words,
just about the modern norm.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the way it was the first time around, back in
'46. At that time the attraction was baseball, baseball, and, in
case you were tired of that, how 'bout a little baseball? The idea
that Stan Musial and Rapid Robert Feller and Joe D were coming to
town was enough. There was no attendant folderol, just baseball,
the greatest game ever to spring from the mind of mortal man.
</P>
<P>
   That was Tom Yawkey's opinion, anyway. As relayed by the Globe's
Gerry Moore, here was Yawkey's basic outlook on the 1946 All-Star
Game, the first ever played in Fenway: ``Because host Tom Yawkey
feels fans are interested mainly in baseball, the extracurricular
activities will not be too lengthy.''
</P>
<P>
   So I wonder what Mr. Yawkey was thinking around noontime
Wednesday as he gazed down from Diamond Heaven at the Fenway Park
proceedings. For every Dominic ``Little Professor'' DiMaggio, there
were five guys in suits. Marketing guys. Advertising guys.
Broadcast guys. Guys who, in some cases, wouldn't know third base
from a naval base, I'm sure. And when there weren't suits, there
were skirts. (Not that there's anything wrong with that).
</P>
<P>
   There were nice little welcoming speeches by the likes of Dan
Duquette, American League president Dr. Gene Budig, mayor Tom
Menino and Pat Moscaritolo, the Cheese of the Greater Boston
Convention and Visitors Bureau. Of course, this being 1998, the
dissertations were mainly about m-o-n-e-y. Specifically, the
economic impact of the All-Star Game, which will apparently be
considerable, how much so depending on which version you favor.
</P>
<P>
   Menino: ``$40 to $60 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscaritolo: ``Over $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Budig: ``Significantly better than that (i.e., $50 million).''
The AL prexy also paid Hizzoner a stunning compliment. ``You are,''
he said, ``an interesting politican because you understated how
good it is going to be, because it is off the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball? What's that?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, it's nobody's fault; it's just the way it is. Don't ask
if it makes any sense to have an All-Star Game in a park that seats
33,000 and change. The All-Star Game is irresistible, because it
means major moolah for the local economy. Let's just hope we get
through the day without anyone being forced to acknowledge that
there will be no public sale of tickets for the game in question,
or that there is not even a guaranteed seat for every current
season ticket holder.
</P>
<P>
   There would be if the game had anything whatsoever to do with
baseball. It does not. The game itself has to do with taking care
of sponsors. It has zero to do with the baseball fans whose
interests are theoretically being served by bringing the best
baseball players in the world to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Having the final All-Star Game of the 20th century in Updike's
``lyric little bandbox of a ballpark'' (or Clark Booth's ``Baseball
Basillica,'' take your pick) is a wonderfully romantic notion. Not
too long ago they went to Wrigley, Fenway's soul brother. So why
not go to Fenway?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right thing to do,'' says Dr. Budig. ``The people
in this community clearly deserve an All-Star Game. The time was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly will Joe Fan get out of it? There are two
possibilities. The first would be the Home Run Contest. I am
assuming there will be some sort of ticket possibilities there (or
am I being naive?). The second is ``Fan Fest.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is the interactive exhibit that is an integral part
of the All-Star deal these days. People will be sold the idea that
``Fan Fest'' is their All-Star Game. And I do hear good things
about ``Fan Fest.'' People returning from Denver spoke only in
superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   They're hoping to get Hynes Auditorium for ``Fan Fest.'' That
would make good geographic sense. Problem is, they have what you
call your prior committments. Let's just say that the folks at the
Hynes are working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Wednesday. We're waiting for the good baseball talk. The
supposed highlight of the day was the of the official logo. Who can
get excited about a logo? To me, a logo is about as exciting as
American cheese on white, hold the everything. And a glass of
water.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 and 1961 no one knew from logos. Geez, it was just a
baseball game. The issue in 1946 was how many of the eight Red Sox
players on the 25-man American League roster would start (the
answer was four). The issue 15 years later was weather. Nobody was
talking about anything a year before the game. Aside from getting
the needed hotel rooms (and the total was a bit shy of the
estimated 14,000 they'll need next year) and planning a little
dinner, what else was there to do? Oh, yeah, print the ducats. By
the way, bleacher tickets were available the day before the '46
game.
</P>
<P>
   In '46 and '61 it was all baseball, not ``the economic impact on
the community.'' It was the All-Star Game, not just another
convention for Pat Moscaritolo's people to hype. Baseball, like,
for example, the idea that only one man played in both previous
Fenway All-Star Games and that was Stan Musial. Baseball, as in did
you know that in 18 innings of Fenway Park All-Star baseball a
National League player has yet to hit a ball either off or over The
Wall?
</P>
<P>
   So let me throw out a baseball thought. Will they even bother to
invite a lefthanded hitter into the Home Run contest? ``Thome and
Griffey,'' says Dan Duquette, ``I don't think even Yellowstone can
hold those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Danny, I love it when you talk dirty like that. Lighten up
on the money chatter. Lemme hear more of that good baseball banter.
We (itals)are(unitals) talking about the All-Star Game.

SOUTH AFRICAN ARTS FESTIVAL MAKES FUSION ITS FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAHAMSTOWN, South Africa _ Africa's premier arts festival, 24
years old this year, is having a little trouble defining itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Grahamstown Festival, which ended July 12, was founded as a
fortress of the English language when professors of English and
politicians feared that the Afrikaner nationalists in power would
subsume their tongue. It started life as a Shakespeare festival,
but now presents the country's _ and sometimes the continent's _
best in jazz, classical music, film, theater, opera, dance and
visual art.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the fastest-growing festival in South Africa is
the much smaller, four-year-old Oudtshoorn Festival, in an
ostrich-farming town not far away. It was founded to celebrate the
Afrikaans language, which Afrikaners fear will fade away. The
government is slowly but steadily removing it from official
documents, army marching orders and the national airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel threatened, especially when they see Afrikaans
taken off television,'' said Karen Meiring, the coordinator of the
Oudtshoorn festival, who was visiting its larger rival. Her
festival is trying hard to appeal to mixed-race ``coloreds,'' most
of whom speak Afrikaans as a first language.
</P>
<P>
   And a small festival of Sotho-language work is planned for
September.
</P>
<P>
   Balkanization of the arts isn't a serious threat because
virtually every educated person speaks English. That leaves
Grahamstown more grand dame than guerrilla, but it clearly reigns,
with 400 works performed up to 5 times each in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, it was at its hottest in the 1980s when it was
full of anti-apartheid theater. The police attended plays but never
shut any down in this remote town around Rhodes University, where
white liberals could be left to shout slogans at each other. That
way the government that banned books and censored newspapers could
boast that free speech was alive.
</P>
<P>
   In attendance, Grahamstown's biggest year was 1996. Now there is
a sense that the festival, lacking the camaraderie produced by
linguistic or political threats, is groping for a theme.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's artists are sick of the question: What are you
going to write about now that apartheid is dead?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the answer has been emerging for a while. Formerly
taboo subjects like gay and lesbian love are common. Crime, in a
country where political violence has given way to hijacking, murder
and rape, is a popular topic. And last year there were two major
dramas about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the theme clearly on the rise is the one the festival had
hoped would emerge: the tentative fusion of two very disparate
South African cultures _ black and white.
</P>
<P>
   There were always such possibilities _ jazz, for instance, where
whites and blacks have long played together. And in dance there is
an interesting phenomenon: white South African ballet companies
always had plenty of female dancers but few males, while black
township troupes were almost strictly for men. Now the two are
beginning to fuse.
</P>
<P>
   And the fusion theme has been explored in new South African
movies. In one darkly funny film, ``Sexy Girls,'' a white man
trying to kill himself with exhaust fumes is kidnapped from a
``colored'' neighborhood by a girl gang that needs his car to
escape a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger budget film, ``Letting Go,'' features a black South
African woman who grew up in Los Angeles and returns to South
Africa, where she learns about her roots from a ``white Zulu,'' a
hunky anthropologist born deep in Zululand who not only dances but
also rescues her in a stick fight from the overbearing Zulu prince
who wants to marry her. Unfortunately, the movie quickly
degenerates into a mawkish travelogue with lines like, ``That's the
real Africa that I love,'' and overt plugs for soft drinks and
hotels that underwrote the film.
</P>
<P>
   In theater, Aubrey Sekhabi, an emerging young black playwright,
twisted the audience's expectations by writing a grim drama in
which four young black professionals catch a desperately poor
Afrikaner burglarizing their house during a bachelor party and
debate whether to treat him as they would once have been treated:
beat him to death.
</P>
<P>
   But the festival's most coveted ticket was to ``Ipi Zombi?'' by
Brett Bailey and his Third World Bunfight troupe, a musical so far
off Broadway that it is conducted around a fire in an abandoned
power station before an audience squatting on milk crates.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey is a young white South African given a grant by Standard
Bank, the festival's chief sponsor, to build a theater troupe in
Grahamstown's black township. Before that, festival participation
by blacks in the area was limited to guarding parked cars, waiting
tables and singing and dancing on street corners for pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's first production of ``Ipi Zombi?,'' in 1996, had 60
actors, including a chorus of 20 and 5 sangomas, the health
professionals formerly known as witch doctors. He has now cut his
traveling Bunfight to 15 actors, the number that can pack into a
minibus and his pickup.
</P>
<P>
   His text comes from a real 1995 event. Twelve schoolboys were
killed in a bus crash, and a rumor spread that 50 naked witches
beside the road had caused it. Mass hysteria spread, like that
during the witch trials in Salem, Mass., and in the next three
months two local women were ``sniffed out'' as witches and
murdered; many more were forced to flee. The boys' friends halted
their funerals, saying their spirits were walking the earth as
zombies. The killings only ended when the bodies were chopped up to
release their souls.
</P>
<P>
   The Bailey-Bunfight production led to a tempest in the
festival's in-house paper, which is produced by Rhodes University
journalism students, but dragoons the country's top critics into
writing and editing.
</P>
<P>
   The first review called it ``a work of genius.'' An angry
response from a critic for The Sowetan called Bailey a racist, and
wrote, ``If you are into seeing black people portrayed like savage
morons tinseled with calabash boobs and a dance on a coffin, then
go ahead, indulge.'' A Rhodes student counterattacked, calling the
play ``a true picture of African spirituality.'' Because
professional theater in this country was long made by whites for
white critics, the paper's editors were relieved to have three
black critics in the fight, which then split along a new South
African schism, urban black sensibilities versus rural ones.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who speaks perfectly rationally although he appears for
interviews with an orange fright wig atop his shaved head, shrugged
off the dispute, saying: ``We live in an ideological minefield. No
matter what step you take, you get into conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he added, ``the festival's Young Artist of the Year is
a black guy working with white classics, and he's being hailed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Bongani Ndodana, a 22-year-old classical
composer whose oratorio ``Uhambo: The Pilgrimage'' was one of the
festival's most heavily publicized events. Ndodana's work was based
on the epic poem ``Pilgrimage to Dias Cross'' by Guy Butler, the
80-year-old professor of English at Rhodes University who founded
the festival. It mixes images from 400 years of Grahamstown
history, including the stone cross erected in 1488 by Portuguese
navigator Bartholomeu Dias and the apocalyptic visions of
15-year-old Nongqause, the Joan of Arc of the Xhosa, a tribe whose
dreams of driving out British settlers led disastrously to the
Great Cattle Killing of 1857, which destroyed the Xhosa nation.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, for its 25th anniversary, the festival will take
fusion even further, lengthening its run to two weeks and spending
a bigger budget to bring in artists from all over Africa.

ABUBAKAR TO ADDRESS NATION ON NIGERIA'S POLITICAL FUTURE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, took several steps Wednesday to dismantle the elaborate
apparatus put in place by his predecessor to create a veneer of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled Nigeria with an iron hand for almost
five years until his death last month, had created a five-party
system while insuring that he became the sole candidate of all five
parties for a presidential election that was to be held on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Without criticizing his predecessor's acts, Abubakar Wednesday
dissolved the Transition Implementation Committee, the National
Reconciliation Committee and the National Committee on the
Devolution of Powers, agencies that had been created to prepare the
ground for the one-candidate election.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar did not say what would take their place. But he is
widely expected to address the nation later this week and lay out
plans for the country's return to a genuine multiparty democracy.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been ruled by the armed
forces for 28 of the 38 years since its independence.
</P>
<P>
   Given the extreme impatience of most Nigerians with what has
amounted to ruinous military rule, Western officials believe that
Abubakar must promise a return to democracy by early next year at
the latest. So far he has convinced American and other Western
officials that he is acting in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   But there are disagreements as to whether Nigeria should go
straight to elections, or first should put in place a civilian
government of national unity to organize the voting, and the
discord appears to be delaying an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The army's cancellation of 1993 elections which Moshood K.O.
Abiola appeared to be winning, has left many Nigerians convinced
that, as one opposition leader put it, ``the armed forces cannot be
the midwife of democracy.'' Abiola was imprisoned in 1994 and died
in detention last week.
</P>
<P>
   But there is concern among some Western diplomats that a large
and diverse government of national unity could degenerate into
squabbling and chaos, providing a pretext for yet another military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar also announced the release Wednesday of more than 300
prisoners who have completed their jail terms _ normal practice in
most countries, but something of a departure in Nigeria. He did not
say whether these included political detainees.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the government said the move was ``part of the
total efforts of the administration to decongest our prisons and
its determination to defend and protect the freedom and basic
rights of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 30 political prisoners have been freed since
General Abubakar took office, many more remain in jail. Among these
are several journalists, including George Mbah, an editor at Tell
magazine, Kunle Ajibade and Begauda Kaltho of The News magazine,
and Ben Charles Obi of Weekend Classique, a now defunct
publication.

TALLAS, KHRISTICH, TAYLOR COULD BE HEADED FOR ARBITRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Bruins goalie Rob Tallas and forwards Dmitri
Khristich and Tim Taylor have elected to file for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   If the players, who gave up their Group 2 restricted free-agent
status to file, can't come to an agreement before their hearing
dates next month, an arbiter will decide how much they will make
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed three players today,'' said Bruins president-general
manager Harry Sinden. ``We just don't know for how much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said assistant GM Mike O'Connell plans to take another
stab at reaching an agreement with Taylor, and that Taylor was just
protecting himself by filing. Two other players, Steve Heinze and
Ted Donato, were also eligible to file. Donato opted not to and
Sinden said he hadn't heard about Heinze as of late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' history with arbitration has proven to be a mixed
bag. Ray Bourque filed prior to the start of the 1993-94 season and
found out on opening night that he had lost. Since then, the Bruins
have had a reputation as being a formidable opponent in arbitration
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to Al Iafrate, he might have a different
perspective,'' said Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   Iafrate is one of the few who has beaten Boston in arbitration;
he was subsequently traded to San Jose for Jeff Odgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hit-or-miss when you get a third party deciding your
affairs,'' Sinden said. ``They can't evaluate a player in terms of
his value to the team except through statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and their agents use a comparable theory method when
trying to formulate their demands. For example, if Player A thinks
he's as good as Player B from another team and Player C from a
third team, he will use that formula to come up with a salary
demand. Sinden said the Bruins won't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't dare base it on comparables,'' he said. ``Or we'd be
broke like the other 25 teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he'd be open to discussing a resolution before the
hearings in any of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always open to that,'' he said. ``One thing is we've
made up our mind we're not going to run away from arbitration. Too
many people in the league fold before arbitration. The teams either
give them what they want or they compromise for a little less than
what they think the arbitrator is going to give them. We've done
our homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said this season may represent a high for potential
arbitration cases with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it reflects what the players think the market is and
what the agents think the market is, and what they think they can
get through arbitration,'' he said. ``But this is not a giveaway
stop on the way through their careers. If they want a giveaway
stop, they'd better not stop at 617. We're not going to give it
away without a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato's attorney, Mark Witkin, said he plans to get together
with the Bruins soon to discuss his client's status with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in our mutual interests that he play a lot,
whether it be in Boston or somewhere else,'' said Witkin.
``Sometime soon we'll sit down with the Bruins. I think it's in
everyone's best interest to keep talking.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hamburg Ballet from Germany, which made its
Manhattan debut on Tuesday night with a crop of striking young
dancers as part of Lincoln Center Festival '98, is essentially a
creative outlet for its American director, John Neumeier.
</P>
<P>
   As a choreographer, Neumeier is hardly an unknown. Many of his
ballets have been seen here in American and foreign companies,
including American Ballet Theater. The Hamburg Ballet, which he has
directed since 1973, performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in
1983 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, his works have been more popular in Europe than in
the United States; he is, one suspects, a choreographer who wants
less to count to the music than to ``feel'' it, to quote Antony
Tudor. Americans have not always shared his taste for the kind of
symphonic-philosophical ballet that is his signature.
</P>
<P>
   But sensibilities and even choreographers can change. This first
of two programs, enthusiastically received at the New York State
Theater, was devoted to Neumeier's favorite composer, Gustav
Mahler, and it showed the choreographer in firmer command than ever
of an expressive vocabulary. ``Soldier Songs,'' the shortest
ballet, is especially strong in its emotional impact and was
exceedingly well led by Rose Gad and Lloyd Riggins.
</P>
<P>
   The company itself looked fabulous, thanks to an international
influx of highly trained classical dancers (including Americans).
Some come from the Royal Danish Ballet and the Kirov Ballet and
some, recruited as winners in the Prix de Lausanne Ballet
Competition in Switzerland, have been groomed by Neumeier to
project a clear individuality and distinctive fluency.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Hamburg Ballet's last visit to New York in 1985,
Neumeier has choreographed seven of Gustav Mahler's symphonies: the
Brooklyn Academy seasons included his ballets to the third, fourth
and sixth. The last included film clips from ``Gone With the
Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The current program, entitled ``All Our Yesterdays,'' begins
with ``Soldier Songs,'' choreographed to 10 of the songs Mahler set
to folk poetry from the ``Wunderhorn'' anthology, and is completed
by ``The Fifth Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between the two ballets is tenuous, but the anti-war
images of ``Songs'' are occasionally recapitulated in the first two
movements of the symphonic ballet, and the occasional soldier from
the first work is seen passing through the second.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, Neumeier uses whatever program content exists in
the music as a springboard for his own scenario. Created in 1989,
both pieces are related to political events, according to
Neumeier's program note. World War II, which began in 1939, is
remembered 50 years later in ``Soldier Songs,'' with its images of
generic soldiers (no side indicated) in battle and in death,
mourned by women left behind. ``The Fifth Symphony'' ends with a
marvelous jumble of dancers in white tunics and tights (posing
casually or raised high in staggered lifts) that Neumeier relates
to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this scene recalls the jubilation in Berlin. The program
note, ``The opening of borders and boundaries inspired the ballet's
end _ endless movement!,'' conveys the striking tone that follows
the somber first two movements and the ensuing pas de deux.
Neumeier originally choreographed it for Natalia Makarova and Erik
Bruhn at Ballet Theater in 1975, to Mahler's over-played Adagietto
from this symphony (``Death in Venice'').
</P>
<P>
   That duet in the fourth movement is now danced with a muscular
plasticity by Anna Polikarpova, a statuesque dancer once with the
Kirov, and Otto Bubenicek, who like his twin, Jiri Bubenicek in
``Soldier Songs,'' exhibits a dynamic quality that shows him
plunging into the movement and partnering with finesse. At the end,
Ms. Polikarpova lay arched over her partner's lap, her head resting
on the floor. The Ballet Theater version looked more refined and
elegiac, but the sensuality and passion of the Hamburg dancers work
on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor Klauspeter Seibel (Marin Alsop will conduct the
Mahler program later in the week) gave Mahler's rambling Fifth
Symphony the swirl and contrast that dancers require. Anna Grabka,
Laura Cazzaniga and Joelle Boulogne led a mainly female corps in
the first movement before the ensemble in the second and third
broke up into couples. Ivan Urban and Heather Jurgensen (once with
New York City Ballet) exhibited the new fluency, full of spiraling
configurations, that colors Neumeier's brand of neoclassicism.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its use of toe work, the effectiveness of ``Soldier
Songs'' stems from a fusion of ballet and modern dance idioms.
Starting a bit simplistically with its marching soldiers and women
in white frocks, giggling over a panel serving as a fence, the
ballet gains in emotional intensity. One remembers Urban's
passionate dancing, and the flow in the formal structure as the men
lie down one by one to die. There is the way Gad slips to the floor
and lies prostrate after Riggins exits and ends their tender and
shattering duet. Yvi Janicke and Dietrich Henschel were the fine
singers in a moving ballet.

   NEW YORK _ The show must go on, even in a death camp. Adam
Stein, formerly a Berlin circus star, is ordered to perform for the
concentration camp commandant. Told to play a clown, he plays a
clown. Ordered to impersonate a dog, he does that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a Jew won't do,'' the commandant sneers, ``for a bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowd-pleasing acts of humiliation are what the degraded,
taunting Nazi is after in ``Adam Resurrected,'' a lavishly
hallucinatory rendering, by the Gesher Theater from Israel, of one
man's Holocaust odyssey, from a sheltered existence as a popular
German entertainer to his postwar confinement in an Israeli
psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Subtlety is not the Gesher's strong suit: to illustrate the
depth of Adam's moral dilemma, for example, the director, Yevgeny
Arye, has him walk a tightrope that extends the length of the
stage. And yet, overall, the company's treatment of this dense and
abstracted material, adapted from a 1968 novel by the Israeli
author Yoram Kaniuk, is frequently ingenious and occasionally
inspired. Staged in an air-conditioned tent adjacent to the
Metropolitan Opera House, the nearly three-hour production is a
wildly evocative excursion through the three houses of the absurd
in which Adam spends much of his life: a circus, a concentration
camp and an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The three staging grounds are reflections of aspects of Adam's
tortured psyche, where, in a sense, all of ``Adam Resurrected''
takes place. It is not a play told in conventional style, but
through the re-creation of the kind of interior narrative everyone
composes in the course of their lives, that highly personal
assortment of analytical musings, warm and traumatic memories and
recurring nightmares, that amount to a running existential
conversation with some idea of God.
</P>
<P>
   What gives order to this chaotically conceived life story are
the difficult ethical issues posed by the novelist and his adapter,
Alexander Chervinsky. After the terrible complicity forced upon him
in the camp, where he entertained the inmates, including his own
wife, as they were herded into gas chambers, can a man like Adam
reclaim his humanity? Is he worth the time and attentions of a
nation filled with so many victims of less dubious standing?
</P>
<P>
   Arye's central image for the joyless events of ``Adam
Resurrected,'' presented as part of Lincoln Center Festival '98, is
that of the circus ring, which may not be the most original
metaphor, but it is nonetheless useful here in releasing the
Gesher's creative energy. Through the center of the ring,
inventively realized by Elena Stepanova, runs a set of railroad
tracks onto which the troupe places the rolling stock of props,
from hospital beds, prison cells and animal cages, to Adam's
performance platforms and the Nazi officer's black leather couch.
The tracks, of course, are also a monument to death, the skeletal
remains of the cattle cars that transported millions of Jews to the
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The production, in Hebrew with simultaneous English translation,
is a panorama of oppressiveness. Nazis in black patent-leather
raincoats and fishnet stockings, performing innocent-sounding
novelty numbers about springtime in the Fatherland and, even more
menacingly, cutting off granny's long braids, are refugees from the
Kit Kat Klub; the nod to ``Cabaret'' in general and Sam Mendes'
outrageous revival in particular, seems conscious, even if it
isn't. The Jews, meanwhile, wear the faded stripes of the camps,
whether they are inmates of the camp or the Israeli hospital, where
the patients are under the pathetically misguided delusion that
Adam is the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Adam, played vigorously by Igor Mirkurbanov _ the vibrant Gesher
Theater, a seven-year-old company, is made up primarily of Russian
Israelis _ vaults from country to country and era to era on the
high-flying trapeze and other apparatus that Arye and Ms. Stepanova
supply. Mirkurbanov, sleek and agile, wanders pitiful and
ashen-faced across the landscape of his own life (he begins the
play in clown's makeup), unsure whether his fate is to be counted
among the Nazis' martyred victims or their soulless collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of ambiguity, he turns for advice to the play's most
bizarre character, Mrs. Seizling, a garish American Jew portrayed
in drag by the excellent Vladimir Halemsky. Having given $6 million
to the psychiatric hospital in memory of the six million dead, she
is anything but conflicted over the Holocaust. For now that she,
too, is dead, she is hoping that the donation will make her a
favorite when the Messiah does return.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Seizling, who pops up in the strangest places, is a
touchstone figure, the real clown of ``Adam Resurrected,'' and the
embodiment of the most trivial aspects of Holocaust
memorialization. The play itself, however, never sinks to
triviality. A smart and empathetic ensemble, led by Mirkurbanov and
also featuring other such expressive performers as Israel (Sasha)
Demidov, Yevgenya Dodina and Nelly Gosheva, brings a deep sense of
passion and commitment to this mini-epic under the big top. And
they effortlessly surmount barriers of culture and language that
could have made a mess of this extreme and ambitious material.
</P>
<P>
   Some playgoers may be put off by the overwrought qualities in
the writing and the stagecraft. But given the subject matter, it's
hard not to forgive a theater company, forged in the Jewish
homeland by Russian refugees, for going overboard now and again.

   PACAJUS, Brazil _ When Antonio Gomes da Silva found school a
bore at age 11, there was no grown-up within hollering distance
urging him to stay. Not the grandfather rearing him, who raised
cattle and saw little use for grammar. Not the father who abandoned
him and went to live in Sao Paulo, 2,000 miles away. Not the mother
left behind years earlier when his parents separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If just one adult had said to me, `No, don't drop out, you
need an education,' it would have changed my life,'' Gomes da Silva
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 15 years since, the landscape in northeastern Brazil
_ traditionally the poorest, most precarious swatch of this diverse
country, which is bigger than the continental United States _ has
begun to change, with subsistence farms giving way to factories.
And in the lightning switch from ox carts to the post-industrial
age, survival for workers like Gomes da Silva, a supervisor at a
box factory, depends on hitting the books to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 30 other employees of Rigesa, the Brazilian
subsidiary of the Westvaco Corp., the paper company based in New
York, Gomes da Silva now spends five nights a week in voluntary
classes learning the basics of reading, geography and mathematics.
A blue jeans factory owned by Vicunha Ltda., a large Brazilian
textile manufacturer, that sits across the street from Rigesa also
sponsors elementary school classes, as do the other concerns in the
Pacajus industrial park, some 25 miles from the Ceara state
capital, Fortaleza. It is all part of a tax-incentive package the
state government offered to industry to create jobs outside large
urban areas in places like this, a city of some 37,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Though the contrast between old and new is starkest here in
Brazil's dusty northeast, the same shift is being played out across
the country, from Sao Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul, where the opening
of the world's eighth-biggest economy is expected to lure $17
billion in direct foreign investment this year _ the highest of any
emerging market. Foreigners are buying up state-owned industries,
and putting their money in everything from car factories to
pharmaceutical subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But companies investing in Brazil are finding that severe
shortcomings in the educational system, and the poverty that forced
many workers to quit school early, hamper productivity and efforts
at quality control. And as factories come to rely more on advanced,
computer-controlled machines, they need fewer workers, but more
capable ones: workers who can read the screens and make sense of
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   A wide-ranging 1997 study of industry in Brazil found overall
productivity running at 27 percent of the United States level, with
even the more advanced sectors, like the automobile industry, only
30 percent as productive as in the United States and 21 percent as
productive as in Japan, the best in the industry. The report, by
the McKinsey Global Institute in Washington in conjunction with its
Sao Paulo office, largely blamed Brazil's protectionist legacy and
business' lack of reinvestment. But it noted that workers in Brazil
had an average of six years of schooling, compared with 11 to 13
years in Korea and Japan, and encouraged companies to invest in
basic education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to Asia, it's a disaster,'' said Riordan Roett,
chairman of the Latin American studies program at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Advanced International Studies. ``In terms of
globalization and competitiveness, education and job training are
absolutely critical, and Brazil falls way behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the lack of investment in basic education,'' Roett
continued, ``that is holding, and will hold, Brazil back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil, which began focusing
on education early in the decade, found that the average worker in
the Sao Paulo area had only a fourth-grade education. And the
quality of even that level of schooling was open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Through diagnostic tests, the chamber found that 90 percent of
newly qualified primary school teachers had mastered barely 10
percent of the required curriculum, ``which meant the perpetuation
of the problem,'' said Silvio Tichauer, who runs the organization's
Institute for Quality of Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is now putting together a 50-volume, 15,000-page
``School Kit,'' for the continuous remedial instruction of teachers
in Brazil. It also runs educational programs and has introduced
standardized tests, a novelty in Brazil, at five primary and
secondary schools in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had instances where we've wanted to start up
computer-controlled machines, and we've found workers have a
tremendous lack in logic and mathematical skills that we had to
supplement with our own specific training,'' said Tichauer,
executive manager in Brazil for the FMC Corp., the food packager
based in Chicago. Tichauer, who is based in Sao Paulo, added, ``If
it's bad here, it's probably worse everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses are doing the same. Banco Bradesco S.A., a
major Brazilian bank, finances nearly 50 primary and secondary
school classes for workers and children scattered around the
country. Fiat S.p.A., the Italian car maker, which built a factory
in Minas Gerais state a few years ago, has had to open classes as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Guilherme Reis, president of the National Council of Industries,
based in Rio de Janeiro, said the longstanding government failure
to supply decent public education and health care has increased the
burden on industry, raising the price of doing business in Brazil
beyond the legendary ``Brazil cost,'' which covers excessively high
financing costs, fees for the use of ports and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, beyond the taxes you pay, you have to pay more, a
kind of hidden charge, for education in areas where public services
fall short,'' Reis said.
</P>
<P>
   While John Mein, president of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Brazil, said that companies were not yet avoiding the country
because of the low level of education, Reis said that a ``large
share'' of the industries his council surveyed ``expect to have
problems in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McMahon, the president of Rigesa, is among those who see
difficulties on the horizon. ``As we modernize our mill and box
plants, the equipment is much more sophisticated,'' he said. ``The
whole logic will be based on computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is running
for re-election in October, spent the early part of his four-year
term focusing largely on privatizing government-owned industries
and opening Brazil to foreign investment. Efforts to shore up
education began only in the latter part of his term. The government
has taken steps to force municipalities and states, which are
responsible for primary and secondary school education, to spend a
minimum of about $260 a year for each student in the classroom, up
from $208 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, however, the problem has not been primarily a lack
of money. Though Brazil has spent nearly 20 percent of the federal
budget on education, among the highest levels in the world, money
has not bought quality. Only one in three students finish the
eighth grade in Brazil, compared with two out of three in Bolivia,
which spends two-thirds less than Brazil on education.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the investment in education is one whose benefits may
take a decade or more to appear. And critics say the showcase of
the government drive to improve education _ installing televisions
and computers in each school _ overlooks the core of the problem,
which is poor teacher training. In regions like the northeast,
public school teachers typically earn $50 a month, less than half
the legally established minimum salary.
</P>
<P>
   David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University
of Brasilia, who writes a newsletter called Brazil Focus, said
televisions and computers ``are nice, but in a lot of these
schools, the teacher has a second-grade education, at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Tichauer was blunter still. ``More than half of those TV sets or
computers are just gathering dust,'' he said. ``If you don't have
someone in the schools who's going to be helping the school use
these tools, it ain't going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 30 percent of the entire education budget is
earmarked for public universities, according to government
statistics. That, said Roett of Johns Hopkins, comes at the expense
of primary education and reinforces the country's already heavily
skewed distribution of income. Unless students come from families
that can pay for private primary and high schools, they are
unlikely to gain admission to the best universities, which are
public.
</P>
<P>
   When it started operations in Pacajus nearly three years ago,
Rigesa demanded an eighth-grade education for the 160 or so jobs it
was offering, most paying the minimum wage of $110 a month. But it
quickly had to lower its requirement to the fifth-grade level. The
company has spent about $50,000 here on its educational program,
which relies on videotapes developed by a Brazilian television
network to teach the courses and a ``facilitator'' to answer
questions.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT OBSERVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. _ Change is an infrequent visitor to Seneca
Falls, but it makes a very big statement when it comes.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet, close-knit village has had its days on the short-end
of history _ engineers, seeking a better water route to the Erie
Canal, flooded the river valley in 1915, submerging some 200
factories and homes and Seneca's namesake falls.
</P>
<P>
   And in its vanguard. For it was here that five uppity
housewives, led by displaced Bostonian Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
called the nation's first women's rights convention in 1848 at the
Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Seneca Falls.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when ladies were seen but rarely spoke out in public,
when social mores were as constricting as the tight corsets they
wore, the women stood before a hastily assembled audience and
bitterly recited what men's tyranny had denied them: education;
employment; property; citizenship; legal standing in divorce in
custody; a role in the church; and the vote. They demanded equality
``because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and
fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights,'' and they
launched a suffrage movement that took 70 years to enfranchise
American women.
</P>
<P>
   July 16 is the 150th anniversary of that historic meeting as
well as the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments it ratified. First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, joined by a host of dignitaries, will
speak at Seneca Falls, opening up a four-day festival of women's
achievements that promises to swell and swamp this
spit-and-polished village (pop. 7,600) and its lovingly maintained
historic sites with 100,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The commemoration is also a reminder that so much of what both
genders now take for granted _ from the professions to the playing
fields, to politics and the pulpit _ started out with some
scandalous talk around a mahogany tea table in central New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every anniversary has been a touchstone, a time for
individuals and groups to reconnect to the tradition of radicalism
that is so well represented here,'' said Vivien Rose, historian at
the Women's Rights National Historical Park, one of those sites.
``It's a time to reflect on the condition of women in society and
plan how to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment comes at an intriguing time for the women's movement.
A cover story in Time magazine recently asked the question ``Is
Feminism Dead?'' Women's rights groups, preoccupied with abortions
fights and distracted by gay rights, seem to be searching for
relevance and strugglng to make their case to stressed out soccer
moms and as well as those single, 20-something women for whom
feminism seems a dated or even a dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our foremothers would be delighted with the work we've done in
furthering their dream,'' Eleanor Smeal, a former president of the
National Organization for Women, told a boisterous NOW rally
outside the restored Wesleyan Chapel Tuesday, ``but they would be
disgusted that women still don't have full equality under the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of modern-day feminism say the women's movement has
achieved most of its goals _ and certainly, they say, it's good to
have the vote _ but at the terrible cost of undermining marriages,
forcing women to work, and denigrating motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This enormous social experiment to make women legally and
economically equal to men has not resulted in a net increase in
women's happiness,'' said Danielle Crittenden, editor of the
conservative Women's Quarterly. ``We have simply replaced one set
of problems with a new set of problems that arise from freedom and
equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Seneca Falls isn't a bad place to ask how well this social
experiment has worked. It's largely an Italian community,
traditional in its values, heavily Roman Catholic, almost
completely white, and solidly middle class. Republicans run the
all-male village board, right-to-life groups years ago drove the
Planned Parenthood office out of town, and, until the
preservationists got a hold of it, the Wesleyan Chapel, birthplace
of the women's movement, was a laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   But it also a community where, as in much of America, the social
and legal gains of women are thoroughly woven into local life.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, lured by the town's awesome history but not
sure how warm the welcome would be, Becky Bly moved to Seneca
Falls. She runs a company, Woman-Made Products, as well as the
Coalition for Lesbian Visibility. Tuesday morning, she instructed
her teenaged daughter on her constitutional right to distribute
fliers for Woman-Made Products at the NOW rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Long Island, people used to break my windows because I was
a lesbian,'' Bly said. ``Here, they may gossip behind my back, but
mostly they just let me be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Caraccilo, the village barber, sits outside on the stoop,
waiting for customers who probably aren't going to fight the
unusual congestion on Fall Street for a haircut. Until Seneca Falls
became the American mecca for feminist pilgrims, he hadn't thought
much about the women's movement or its impact on his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I say _ holy smoke! _ would my wife have retired with a
pension, would may daughter have been an All-American soccer
player, if those women hadn't started it all right here in Seneca
Falls?'' Caraccilo asks. ``I've gotta believe it's a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob's nephew, Fran Caraccilo, is the village planner. Fran's
wife, Gail, is president of the local Elizabeth Cady Stanton
Foundation, which raised $50,000 to purchase and restore the white,
frame farmhouse that belonged to Cady Stanton _ a frustrated
intellectual who raised seven small children on 150 acres downwind
from the mills while her husband, Henry, was off spreading
anti-slavery zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here,'' Fran Caraccilo said, ``wasn't luck or an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Seneca Falls was much more than a rail, water, and
turnpike hub and one of the nation's fastest-growing manufacturing
towns in the mid-nineteenth century. It also was boiling in the
cauldron of reform fervor that was unique to central New York _ a
potent mix of religious revivalists, temperance preachers, utopian
visionaries, and impassioned abolitionists. Add to that Quaker
communities and local Iroquois tribes, both with traditions of
equality for women, and the table was set for a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Literally. Over tea with Lucretia Mott, a Quaker and antislavery
activist from Philadelphia; Martha Coffin Wright, Mott's sister;
Mary Ann McClintock; and Jane Hunt, of nearby Waterloo, Stanton
``poured out...the torrent of my long-accumulating discontent with
such vehemence and indignation that I stirred myself, as well as
the rest of the party, to do and dare anything,'' she later wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary idea to hold a women's rights convention was
hatched that afternoon. In a little over a week, the women not only
persuaded 300 people, including some 40 men, to meet for two days
at the chapel, but they also produced a blistering feminist
manifesto modeled on the Declaration of Independence that accused
men of ``endeavoring to destroy (a woman's) confidence in her own
powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead
and a dependent and abject life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratifying the declaration turned out to be the easy part, though
it took a persuasive speech by Rochester newspaper publisher
Frederick Douglass, a former slave, to pass the very controversial
suffrage resolution. What followed was public ridicule and abuse of
Cady Stanton, who only later was joined by the more famous
suffragist, Susan B. Anthony. It became so intense that Cady
Stanton stopped wearing the loose-fitting pantaloons popularized by
Amelia Bloomer, another Seneca Falls sister.
</P>
<P>
   The suffragists moved on from Seneca Falls and so did the
industrial boom. The village lost sight of its rich heritage until
the late 1970s, and even then there was a good deal of debate about
whether designating a historic district, creating a Women's Hall of
Fame, or letting the federal government build a $12 million
monument to the women's movement made much sense.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Barbieri, associate director of the Seneca Falls
Historical Society, is an advocate. Her wake-up call as a woman
came years ago, she said, when her dream of attending the
University of Notre Dame was shattered by what was then a
single-sex rule. The 150th anniversary, Barbieri said, ``has been a
wake-up call to the community for anybody who still asks 'why would
anybody come to Seneca Falls?'''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration has posed certain challenges for a small town.
Among them: food, drink, and toilets for 100,000, and finding 120
pairs of white sneakers for the entire Seneca Falls Youth Chorus,
which is singing ``It Takes a Village'' for the First Lady. And
then there was a bit of political theatre after New York Lt. Gov.
Betsy McCaughey Ross, the state's highest-ranking woman
office-holder, found she had not been invited to share the
opening-ceremony stage today with Mrs. Clinton and New York Gov.
George Pataki. (McGaughey Ross hopes to unseat Pataki in the fall
elections.)
</P>
<P>
   For Maria Granger, the local commotion is worth the price. A
stay-at-home mother, Granger visited the Women's Rights Historical
Park for the first time last week, and she took her three young
daughters with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my girls to know that there are some reasons why they
have rights and choices,'' Granger said. ``Living here in Seneca
Falls, it's not something you should take for granted.''

age, survival for workers like Gomes da Silva, a supervisor at a
box factory, depends on hitting the books to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 30 other employees of Rigesa, the Brazilian
subsidiary of the Westvaco Corp., the paper company based in New
York, Gomes da Silva now spends five nights a week in voluntary
classes learning the basics of reading, geography and mathematics.
A blue jeans factory owned by Vicunha Ltda., a large Brazilian
textile manufacturer, that sits across the street from Rigesa also
sponsors elementary school classes, as do the other concerns in the
Pacajus industrial park, some 25 miles from the Ceara state
capital, Fortaleza. It is all part of a tax-incentive package the
state government offered to industry to create jobs outside large
urban areas in places like this, a city of some 37,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Though the contrast between old and new is starkest here in
Brazil's dusty northeast, the same shift is being played out across
the country, from Sao Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul, where the opening
of the world's eighth-biggest economy is expected to lure $17
billion in direct foreign investment this year _ the highest of any
emerging market. Foreigners are buying up state-owned industries,
and putting their money in everything from car factories to
pharmaceutical subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But companies investing in Brazil are finding that severe
shortcomings in the educational system, and the poverty that forced
many workers to quit school early, hamper productivity and efforts
at quality control. And as factories come to rely more on advanced,
computer-controlled machines, they need fewer workers, but more
capable ones: workers who can read the screens and make sense of
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   A wide-ranging 1997 study of industry in Brazil found overall
productivity running at 27 percent of the United States level, with
even the more advanced sectors, like the automobile industry, only
30 percent as productive as in the United States and 21 percent as
productive as in Japan, the best in the industry. The report, by
the McKinsey Global Institute in Washington in conjunction with its
Sao Paulo office, largely blamed Brazil's protectionist legacy and
business' lack of reinvestment. But it noted that workers in Brazil
had an average of six years of schooling, compared with 11 to 13
years in Korea and Japan, and encouraged companies to invest in
basic education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to Asia, it's a disaster,'' said Riordan Roett,
chairman of the Latin American studies program at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Advanced International Studies. ``In terms of
globalization and competitiveness, education and job training are
absolutely critical, and Brazil falls way behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the lack of investment in basic education,'' Roett
continued, ``that is holding, and will hold, Brazil back.''

</P>
<P>
   The American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil, which began focusing
on education early in the decade, found that the average worker in
the Sao Paulo area had only a fourth-grade education. And the
quality of even that level of schooling was open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Through diagnostic tests, the chamber found that 90 percent of
newly qualified primary school teachers had mastered barely 10
percent of the required curriculum, ``which meant the perpetuation
of the problem,'' said Silvio Tichauer, who runs the organization's
Institute for Quality of Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is now putting together a 50-volume, 15,000-page
``School Kit,'' for the continuous remedial instruction of teachers
in Brazil. It also runs educational programs and has introduced
standardized tests, a novelty in Brazil, at five primary and
secondary schools in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had instances where we've wanted to start up
computer-controlled machines, and we've found workers have a
tremendous lack in logic and mathematical skills that we had to
supplement with our own specific training,'' said Tichauer,
executive manager in Brazil for the FMC Corp., the food packager
based in Chicago. Tichauer, who is based in Sao Paulo, added, ``If
it's bad here, it's probably worse everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses are doing the same. Banco Bradesco S.A., a
major Brazilian bank, finances nearly 50 primary and secondary
school classes for workers and children scattered around the
country. Fiat S.p.A., the Italian car maker, which built a factory
in Minas Gerais state a few years ago, has had to open classes as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Guilherme Reis, president of the National Council of Industries,
based in Rio de Janeiro, said the longstanding government failure
to supply decent public education and health care has increased the
burden on industry, raising the price of doing business in Brazil
beyond the legendary ``Brazil cost,'' which covers excessively high
financing costs, fees for the use of ports and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, beyond the taxes you pay, you have to pay more, a
kind of hidden charge, for education in areas where public services
fall short,'' Reis said.
</P>
<P>
   While John Mein, president of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Brazil, said that companies were not yet avoiding the country
because of the low level of education, Reis said that a ``large
share'' of the industries his council surveyed ``expect to have
problems in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McMahon, the president of Rigesa, is among those who see
difficulties on the horizon. ``As we modernize our mill and box
plants, the equipment is much more sophisticated,'' he said. ``The
whole logic will be based on computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is running
for re-election in October, spent the early part of his four-year
term focusing largely on privatizing government-owned industries
and opening Brazil to foreign investment. Efforts to shore up
education began only in the latter part of his term. The government
has taken steps to force municipalities and states, which are
responsible for primary and secondary school education, to spend a
minimum of about $260 a year for each student in the classroom, up
from $208 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, however, the problem has not been primarily a lack
of money. Though Brazil has spent nearly 20 percent of the federal
budget on education, among the highest levels in the world, money
has not bought quality. Only one in three students finish the
eighth grade in Brazil, compared with two out of three in Bolivia,
which spends two-thirds less than Brazil on education.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the investment in education is one whose benefits may
take a decade or more to appear. And critics say the showcase of
the government drive to improve education _ installing televisions
and computers in each school _ overlooks the core of the problem,
which is poor teacher training. In regions like the northeast,
public school teachers typically earn $50 a month, less than half
the legally established minimum salary.
</P>
<P>
   David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University
of Brasilia, who writes a newsletter called Brazil Focus, said
televisions and computers ``are nice, but in a lot of these
schools, the teacher has a second-grade education, at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Tichauer was blunter still. ``More than half of those TV sets or
computers are just gathering dust,'' he said. ``If you don't have
someone in the schools who's going to be helping the school use
these tools, it ain't going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 30 percent of the entire education budget is
earmarked for public universities, according to government
statistics. That, said Roett of Johns Hopkins, comes at the expense
of primary education and reinforces the country's already heavily
skewed distribution of income. Unless students come from families
that can pay for private primary and high schools, they are
unlikely to gain admission to the best universities, which are
public.
</P>
<P>
   When it started operations in Pacajus nearly three years ago,
Rigesa demanded an eighth-grade education for the 160 or so jobs it
was offering, most paying the minimum wage of $110 a month. But it
quickly had to lower its requirement to the fifth-grade level. The
company has spent about $50,000 here on its educational program,
which relies on videotapes developed by a Brazilian television
network to teach the courses and a ``facilitator'' to answer
questions.

RAPE REPORTS SHAKE MORALE OF CANADA ARMED FORCES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When Judith Taylor of Toronto marched into a
recruiting station last month to enlist in the Canadian Army, she
simply ignored a flurry of recent news reports that women in the
army had been sexually harassed and even raped by fellow soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm strong-minded,'' Ms. Taylor, 22, said, ``and things like
that don't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   But reports about sexual assaults at gunpoint and a widespread
acceptance of crude behavior toward women in the military have
upset many Canadians, including the country's top soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been deeply embarrassed and disappointed by these
cases,'' the armed forces Chief of Staff, Gen. Maurice Baril, wrote
in an open letter to military officers. ``Canadians demand a higher
standard of behavior from members in uniform, and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports are just the latest scandal in recent years _
including the death of a Somali teen-ager in 1994 at the hands of
Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia _ that have shaken the morale of
the 60,000-member military and increased concerns about the cost of
maintaining a peacetime force.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual assaults were first reported in May in a series of
articles in MacLean's, a national news magazine. After the articles
were published, other women, including Ann Margaret Dickey, 25, of
Gagetown, New Brunswick, came forward with their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickey said she was raped at gunpoint in 1996 by two
officers in her first week of basic training. She said her
superiors had confined her to barracks and ordered her not to
report the attack to the military police.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she has gone public with the accusations, however, she
said the army is trying to undermine her credibility. ``They're out
to prove that I'm lying,'' Ms. Dickey said in a telephone interview
from her home. ``The military has lost its honor. I'm embarrassed
to say I was a member of the Canadian armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickey, who had served 18 months in the Army Reserve before
enlisting in the regular force and entering basic training, said
that after she talked to reporters last month in Ottawa about her
assault, the army released her medical files, which she said
included false information about her mental state. She is asking
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate her case.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the army, Capt. Alain Bissonnette, refused to
comment on Ms. Dickey's statements, except to say the military was
investigating them.
</P>
<P>
   Although many soldiers have called the MacLean's articles about
rape in the military unfair and inaccurate, other soldiers have
said they were not surprised that such abuses occurred because of
officers' pervasive indifference to such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the staff, Baril recognized the existence of
such attitudes and lashed out at those who see such harassment as
an inevitable consequence of having women in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow the Canadian Forces to become a refuge or a
training ground for thugs and brutes,'' Baril said.
</P>
<P>
   But the general himself now appears to have been caught up in
the accusations. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has reported
that the military police are looking into assertions that Baril was
told in 1996 about the sexual harassment of a woman at a military
base in Kingston, Ontario, but did nothing about it. Baril has
refused to comment because the incident is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the military police are pursuing 80 sexual
assault complaints, Bissonnette said. The head of the military
police, Col. Patricia Samson, has said the articles about rapes in
the military could lead to many more incidents' being reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Maclean's articles vividly described how women had been
raped while serving in the military. A retired air force major, Dee
Brasseur, one of the first Canadian women to become a fighter
pilot, told the magazine that she had been raped and coerced into
having sex with an instructor to advance her career.
</P>
<P>
   For Brasseur, who retired in 1994 after 21 years in the service,
the worst aspect of the harassment was the disillusionment that it
caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something you love betrays you in that fashion,'' she
told the magazine, ``it is the deepest psychological wounding you
can have.''
</P>
<P>
   The military police have reviewed the 26 episodes reported in
Maclean's and have decided to investigate or reopen all but three.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll suggests that most Canadians do not trust the
military to pursue the allegations fully. Only 27 percent of those
polled by The Globe and Mail and CTV television said the armed
forces could adequately investigate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of sexual abuse are being made just as the
National Defense Forces completed their most ambitious drive yet to
recruit women.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,800 women serve in the Canadian military, 11 percent of
the regular force. Some 16,000 women are in the reserves, 19
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor, the new enlistee, is one of more than 300 women who
have applied for entry into combat units since April. But since
most did so before the sexual assault allegations became public, it
is not possible to determine what effects the reports have had on
recruitment, said Michael Whittaker, a civilian spokesman for the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   While the charges are being investigated, the military has taken
several steps to deal with the problem, including requiring all
armed forces members to go through training to prevent sexual
harassment and setting up a telephone line for soldiers to report
incidents without going through the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain, however, is that the army's reputation has been
tarnished again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one girl at a school say to me, `Am I going to get raped
if I join the army?''' said Capt. Kenneth I. Charles, a military
career counselor with the recruitment center in Toronto who speaks
at job fairs and before university students.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said recruiters responded to such frank questions with
tough, direct answers. ``They say, `It has happened in the past,
and these are the steps we have taken to stop this,''' he said.

&HT;        LLOYD NOT EVEN BREAKING EVEN IN FUNDRAISING
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 15 -- While he was laying in a hospital bed
recovering from heart surgery, Sen. Arlen Specter's campaign went
ahead with a gala fundraiser in Philadelphia, attended by 17 Senate
Republicans but not Specter.
</P>
<P>
   In that one early June night, Specter raised more money from his
hospital bed than his opponent, Democrat William Lloyd, did over a
three-month span.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1 to June 30, state Sen. Lloyd, D-Somerset, raised
just $13,674 for his uphill battle to unseat Specter, according to
reports filed Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Lloyd has raised $46,634, and has just $1,262 left in
his account -- and that's not counting the $60,500 his campaign has
already accrued in debt. Without more money, Lloyd's staff say it
will be difficult to get his message out to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have money coming in drips and drabs,'' said Peter Wiley,
spokesman for Lloyd's campaign. ``(But Lloyd's) not going to give
up. He wants to campaign until he drops.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear exactly how much Specter raised at his June
fundraiser, but Wiley said the senator at least doubled in one
night how much money Lloyd was able to raise in three months.
</P>
<P>
   From April to June, Specter raised $701,174 for his bid to
become Pennsylvania's first four-term senator. That put him over
the $6 million mark for total contributions raised over the last
few years of fundraising for the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Specter has already spent $1.05 million on his
campaign, a lot of money by most measures but a total that his
campaign considers to be barely noticeable. His top aide noted that
Specter did not have many commercials up on the air during the
primary race against a few religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent wisely and cautiously,'' said Kent Gates, Specter's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said that a few fundraisers were cancelled over the
five-week period of Specter's recuperation. Specter returned to
work last week, and said he will be able to hit full campaign
stride before Labor Day, the traditional kick-off for the most
heated periods of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even since winning the May primary, Lloyd's campaign has not
been able to pick up any steam as Specter was out of commission. In
what Wiley termed a ``political Catch-22'', he said that
contributors have been reluctant to give money to the fledgling
campaign because he hasn't raised enough money to demonstrate that
he is a viable candidate -- in other words, he needs money to get
money.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiley said Lloyd held a few fundraisers over the July 4th
weekend, money that would not show up on the new FEC reports,
during which he raised about $12,000.

COMPAQ POSTS SMALL SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. put its house in order last quarter, and
is now turning its attention to a bigger challenge: squeezing more
profits out of its newly acquired Digital Equipment Corp. unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based computer company posted a small profit before
charges for the second quarter _ more than analysts had expected _
by slashing prices on machines that had clogged distribution
channels since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's operating profit was $32 million, or 2 cents a share,
compared with $465 million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue climbed 5.7 percent to $5.83 billion, which included
Digital sales since the buyout closed on June 11, from $5.52
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's earnings were pounded by several factors,
including the slowdown in Asia, pricing cuts, and indications of
slowing PC sales in this country. Nevertheless, operating earnings
were slightly above Wall Street forecasts, which called for Compaq
to break even in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Previously announced one-time costs associated with the Digital
acquisition resulted in a net loss of $3.63 billion, or $2.33 a
share, for the period. The charges included $3.2 billion for the
write-off of technology, $291 million for restructuring related to
job cuts and closing of facilities, and $139 million for other
``operating adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, said the key
challenge last quarter was to clear out excess merchandise that
piled up when corporate demand for PCs slackened, hurting Compaq's
first-quarter earnings. By cutting prices, Compaq succeeded in
reducing its inventory at distributors to 3 1/2 weeks' worth from
as high as 10 in January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Compaq's earnings received a small, unexpected
boost from Digital's services business, which he said has the
highest backlog of orders in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 33 million Compaq shares were exchanged Wednesday, but
the price didn't move much. That's because Compaq stock had already
been on the rise for weeks. It climbed about 30 percent since the
beginning of the second quarter as the company assured investors
that inventory problems were being addressed. Wednesday, Compaq
fell 1/8 to 339/16, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Compaq's biggest challenge is to smoothly meld
Digital's operations into its own, while wringing out excess costs.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the former Digital, especially in New England, are
bracing for layoffs and other cutbacks. Compaq has said it will cut
17,000 jobs _ 15,000 of them at Digital _ as it integrates the two
companies' operations. But so far, it has announced only 5,000 cuts
related to the consolidation of its manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the other 12,000 jobs coming from? That's the
biggest issue,'' said Louis Mazzucchelli, a stock analyst with
Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. ``There's no way to sugarcoat
that, and it's not going to be pretty. But they've got to get that
done sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said the remaining job cuts will occur over the next year,
but declined to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzucchelli and other analysts said Compaq will have a tough
job trying to blend Digital's culture into its own while paring
costs in the highly competitive computer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to get back to a growth posture as soon as they can.
And everyone's going to be shooting at them as they become a more
visible target.''

FLEET, STATE STREET MAKE STRONG SECOND-QUARTER SHOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lifted by a robust economy and expansion into different
corners of the investment arena, Fleet Financial Group, Inc. and
State Street Corp. reported Wednesday strong second-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The gains come in a consolidating financial services environment
that is slowly remaking some firms, like Fleet, into one-stop
financial service houses, and positioning others, like State
Street, as overseers of international wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, the nation's 10th largest bank, saw net income soar 13
percent over three months ending in June to $393 million, or $1.29
per diluted share, from $347 million, or $1.17 a share, a year ago.
Much of the growth at New England's largest bank came from its
credit card, mortgage lending, and brokerage businesses _ all areas
in which traditional banks are expanding in order to compete and
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from Fleet's investment services, mainly from its Quick
&AMP; Reilly Group, Inc. discount brokerage, soared 34 percent. Net
interest income nudged up 5 percent, mainly due to Fleet's purchase
of the Advanta Corp. credit card company earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   State Street, a bank-holding company that is mainly a
back-office processor for asset management firms around the world,
said second-quarter earnings rose 18 percent to $108.6 million, or
$0.66 per diluted share, compared with $92.1 million, or $0.56 a
share, in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It cited heftier fees from its core business of investment
mangagement, record-keeping, accounting, price reporting, and
securities processing. Expenses grew 21 percent to $507 million,
but analysts said the number was justified as State Street prepares
to serve more investors abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy numbers at both companies reflect a convergence
between financial services companies, as banks increasingly tread
on asset managers' traditional turf. Fleet is not nearly as big a
provider of processing services as State Street, but it does sell
some of products and services vended by investment companies. The
gains also reflect the booming stock market and economy, which have
lifted the boats of most investment management companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the financial services companies have really broadened
their product array,'' said Fleet's chief financial officer, Eugene
M. McQuade. ``Now is the payback time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, where assets under management now exceed $100 billion for
the first time, also reported 14 percent growth in its traditional
lending operations last quarter. ``Overall they're the best numbers
we've seen in a long time from the company,'' said analyst Sandra
J. Flannigan at Merrill Lynch Global Securities. Fleet beat Wall
Street expectations for second-quarter earnings by $0.03.
</P>
<P>
   At State Street, where earnings met expectations, chief
financial officer Ronald L. O'Kelley credited blossoming investor
markets around the globe for buoying business. While Asian economic
turmoil had dented operations at the company's State Street Global
Advisors asset management unit, strong European stock markets and
growing opportunities for foreigners to buy mutual funds had
helped. SSGA is the third-largest US money manager, with $459
billion in total assets.
</P>
<P>
   About 72 percent of State Street's business comes from fees for
serving institutional investors. Revenues from non-US clients
account for nearly one-quarter of total revenues. Overall, the
company has $4.5 trillion in assets under custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is hitting on all cylinders,'' said analyst George
A. Bicher of Bankers Trust New York. There are only six big players
in the global asset servicing business, but with many markets high
_ Asia, of course, an exception _ there are increasing volumes of
securities for State Street to process.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, whose stock has grown at an annualized rate of 22.6
percent since 1980, also announced Wednesday a two-for-one stock
split for mid-September. The company's stock eased 7/16 to end
Wednesday at 85 11/16. State Street nudged up 1/8 to close at 73
1/16.

MARKET PLACE: BIG COKE BOTTLER FINDS ITS PLACE IN THE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the bottling company that
is ever the bridesmaid to the giant Coca-Cola Co., is getting a
turn in the spotlight after all.
</P>
<P>
   While the Asian economic crisis deepens, stock in the bottler
provides a brand name that investors trust without the added
exposure to Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and other countries whose
bubbles have burst.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign sales account for 80 percent of Coca-Cola's total
business, and the company's profits have been crimped slightly as
falling currencies reduce the value of those sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales in the United States are skipping along, with
growth of about 10 percent annually, impressive for a mature market
in which Coke products are already consumed at the rate of slightly
more than one eight-ounce serving a day for each man, woman and
child.
</P>
<P>
   And Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler in the Coke
system, accounts for 65 percent of Coke's domestic sales volume.
The bottler also handles Dr Pepper, the No. 6 soft drink in the
United States, and gets about 32 percent of its business from
Western Europe and Canada. For the last 18 months, it has been on
an acquisition binge, snapping up Coca-Cola Bottling of New York,
Coca-Cola Bottling of Canada and Coca-Cola Southwest, as well as a
$2 billion British bottler. Last month, it announced plans to
acquire Great Plains Bottlers &AMP; Canners Inc., a Midwest bottler,
which handles Dr Pepper and Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Carton, director of investor relations for Coca-Cola
Enterprises, says that even without the acquisitions, the company
will meet its goal of 10 percent growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   All this leads to new-found respect in an industry in which the
bottlers, clinking angrily under their breath, have long had to
take a back seat to the soft-drink companies.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, shares in Coke Enterprises were trading at $21, up
from a split-adjusted offering price of $5.50 in 1986. In April,
the share price popped through the $40 barrier for the first time
and leaped higher a few days later after an announcement that
company president Henry Schimberg had pledged to stay on two more
years as chief executive, and three subsequent years as a
consultant. Chairman and chief executive Summerfield Johnston
agreed to remain as chairman for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
   In May, two stock analysts speaking at a beverage-industry
conference recommended the stock, even over Coca-Cola. And last
month, at the Coca-Cola Company's biennial presentation before
investment bankers and portfolio managers, officials of the
bottling company were included onstage for the first time. Stock in
the bottler gained 25 cents Tuesday, to close at $40.75, ahead of a
scheduled earnings report today from Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened interest in Coke Enterprises can be attributed to
several factors besides concern about of the Asian crisis and
management savvy. First of all, a bottler bonded in any way to
Coca-Cola Co. ends up looking good, simply because Coke is, as the
saying goes, running on all cylinders. Volume is up, both worldwide
and in the United States. Marketing has never been better
organized; witness this summer's relentless promotion of ``Coke
Cards,'' 55 million of which were distributed to teen-agers and
college students. The cards combine entertainment discounts and
other offers with the purchase of a Coke or Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Coke Enterprises has been through a series of
consolidations and aligned its marketing and business strategy with
Coke. One of 11 anchor bottlers around the world (Coca-Cola
Beverages, which has operations in central and Eastern Europe, went
public in London just this week), Coke Enterprises is a pillar of
strength when it comes to local marketing and execution, the twin
forces that increase sales.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co., which has a 42 percent stake in the bottler,
benefits directly from the bottler's success, and the two have
reached a mutual understanding, mostly under the leadership of
Coca-Cola Co. chairman and chief executive M. Douglas Ivester, a
former chairman of Coke Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, companies like Coke and Pepsi had a fractious
relationship with their bottlers. ``You might call it constructive
tension,'' says John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, a widely
read industry newsletter. He added, however, ``In the last couple
of years, Coke has really listened well to its big bottlers.''
</P>
<P>
   The model looks pretty good, but, much like the Coke that
dazzles investors today, it took years to assemble. The bottler
staggered for its first five years. A 1991 merger with Johnston
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. turned things around. Centralized management
was replaced by one based in the field. And the merger brought in
Schimberg and Johnston, who get rave reviews from money managers
and bottlers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry is one of the most gifted executives in this industry,''
Sicher said. ``He really has few peers. He has such a deep,
intuitive understanding of the marketing and distribution of soft
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their linked agendas, Coke Enterprises must be regarded
as a totally separate species from Coke, said Emanuel Goldman, a
beverage stock analyst with Paine Webber in San Francisco. And if
an investor worries about debt, Coke Enterprises may provide cold
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is a concentrate company with a balance sheet that has
effectively no debt,'' Goldman said. ``Coke Enterprises is
extraordinarily top heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke's long-term debt is just $801 million, on shareholder
equity of $18 billion, according to its 1997 annual report. The
bottler has about $8 billion in debt on shareholder equity of $1.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bottler's stock is trading at more than 100 times
earnings, twice the multiple of Coke's stock, Goldman noted.
Dividends aren't much to write home about either, only about 16
cents a share annually.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, may be the role played by its principal
shareholder. ``Coke in a sense stands behind the company,'' Goldman
said. ``It's not official. But when you have 60 percent of the
volume, you can be pretty sure Coke cares.''

 By JAYNE CUSTRED  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SOUTHPORT, England _ It will take more than a straight driver and
solid iron play to master the links of Royal Birkdale Golf Course
this week in the 1998 British Open.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fact, Tom Watson will tell you it is the intangibles, not
what is carried in the golf bag, that determine who will win and
who will lose the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things that are most important to win the
Open,'' said Watson. ``First of all, you have to have guts. Then
you have to couple that with desire. And I think you have to be
dedicated to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson has shown five times that he has all those
characteristics and more in Open Championships, with his last
victory coming at Birkdale in 1983. Here in the British Isles,
Watson has become an adopted son for the European fans. He holds
their hearts and, as is obvious by his great success in their
national championship, the key to winning here as well.
</P>
<P>
   For Watson, winning No. 6 this weekend is not out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a belief I can win this tournament,'' he said. ``It is
not a question of if I think I can win, and I am playing well
enough where I think I can. It takes some strategy on this golf
course to win, with the wind blowing the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a pretty good concept of what to do and how to
get to the greens, of how to fit the balls into the greens or into
the fairways with the wind. I think some players who haven't played
the golf course enough don't have that _ they won't have that
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it be enough? There is a long list of favorites this
week at Royal Birkdale. The Europeans are counting on veteran Colin
Montgomerie and rising star Lee Westwood to contend. The U.S.
players to watch include Tiger Woods, David Duval, Mark O'Meara and
defending champion Justin Leonard, while South Africa's Ernie Els
is high on all lists.
</P>
<P>
   With conditions at Royal Birkdale remaining windy and difficult,
most players are going into the tournament with high hopes but
cautious attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really just have to go out and see what's what,''
Montgomerie said. ``I cannot say (this course) suits my game, apart
from anyone else's. I'm glad the fairways are quite narrow, and I
look forward to trying to hit them along with everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience, of course, will be at a premium. A little luck, as
well, especially keeping the ball out of the gorse, thorny shrubs
and long, reedy grasses known as whin that line the Birkdale tract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you win a tournament, there are other things involved
rather than just hitting the ball good and putting good,'' Leonard
said. ``It is hitting good shots at the right times. It is missing
shots but being able to recover, and that's the big difference
between challenging and trying to win a tournament and finishing in
30th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit some good shots when I needed to, and the shots that I
missed, I got away with last year. And, you know, that's real
important when you're trying to win a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara can certainly attest to that. He is often mentioned as a
favorite this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of course Mark can play very well,'' Watson
said. ``I think the left side of this golf course on certain holes
fits very well with his game. He will have to be careful on the
par-3s with his draw, but I think Mark can play this course very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara also has the confidence necessary to battle Birkdale and
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my juices are flowing pretty good, and I have pretty
good expectations,'' O'Meara said. ``I am just trying to stay a
little bit low-keyed.''
</P>
<P>
   While the European players certainly have more experience than
the Americans on links-style courses, that hasn't helped them in
the more recent Open Championships. John Daly won the 1995 Open at
St. Andrews, Tom Lehman took the title in 1996 at Royal Lytham, and
Leonard got the Claret Jug last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the wind continues to blow, even O'Meara couldn't help
but give the nod to those golfers most at home on this type of golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind blows, there's no question that it's a bit of an
advantage toward the European side because they're much more
accustomed to playing that type of golf,'' he said. ``But I think
the Americans enjoy coming over and playing this type of golf,
because in America we don't get the opportunity to play different
types of shots all the time. The creativity comes out a little bit
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The first indication of just who will be up to the test of Royal
Birkdale under any conditions will come today. While shooting an
extremely low first-round score is not a must, carding something on
the high side could be impossible to recover from in the Open
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Unless conditions change for the better, most golfers would take
even-par and wait it out in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind stays the way it is, the winning score is not
going to be far from par,'' Watson said. ``Even-par is going to be
a tremendous score on this golf course. Of course, if we keep on
playing with the same wind here and all of a sudden the wind
changes directions, that will throw a monkey wrench in everybody's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happened in 1983, and it's one of the reasons I
won. I successfully negotiated the wind change. So I hope it does
change. I hope it's a variety of wind conditions here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the bookmakers in London have Watson going off
at 50-1 odds, the same as Leonard last year. That's a bet Watson
was advising fans to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go out and put 20 pounds on it,'' Watson said with a
grin. ``Actually, I'd put more.''

 &HT;    Internet access captures convention spotlight
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Bigger, faster, better, stronger. The advent of
high-speed access is the No. 1 topic on the minds of many of the
20,000 plus attendees at Summer Internet World this week at
Chicago's McCormak Place Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband access is shaping up to be the least glamorous but
most important aspect of Internet development as Web developers,
cable companies and telecommunications providers look toward the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint CEO William Esrey set the tone for the conference in his
keynote address Tuesday where he talked up Sprint's Integrated
On-Demand Network. Sprint's ION service will use a single line to
handle voice, video and Internet data. It will roll out to select
U.S. cities including Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Kansas City and
Denver before the end of the year. In five years, 90 percent of
traffic will be data transmissions, Esrey predicted. ``What you
need is a made-for-data environment. We will go from being the No.
3 long-distance company to the No. 1 integrated data network.''
</P>
<P>
   To play, or not to play
</P>
<P>
   He challenged the Baby Bells including BellSouth, as well as
other phone and cable companies who make up the ``last mile''
Sprint needs to completely deploy its service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local networks can play ball and be in the game or not
play ball and get left out,'' he said. ``If the Bell companies
really want to get into long-distance, they should view Sprint as a
partner rather than a competitor.'' He said Bell South, Ameritech,
GTE and Southwest Bell were among the local phone companies
considering an alliance with Sprint. MediaOne Express, a show
exhibitor, was also promoting high-speed access. MediaOne's cable
modem service is available in selected areas of Atlanta, Boston and
other MediaOne cities. Internet marketing director Kelly Ruebel
says the challenge is to get users educated and excited about
high-speed access. ``If someone isn't a heavy Internet user, you
have to show them what high speed means so they can understand the
value in it,'' she says.

   NEW YORK _ Time Warner released second quarter results Wednesday

Turner, the founder of the Atlanta unit.

   Time Warner's shares have more than doubled in value over the
past 12 months, with about half of those gains coming since the
beginning of this year. Time Warner lost $49 million or 9 cents a
share a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chairman Ted Turner, the company's biggest shareholder now
holds more than $5.18 billion worth of stock, including 50,110,101
shares held directly and 5,537,191 shares held indirectly,
according to CDA/Investnet. Included in the indirect holdings are
386,000 shares owned by Turner's wife, Jane Fonda. Those shares are
worth nearly $36 million, based on Wednesday's closing price of
$93.12 1/2. The shares hit a 52-week peak of $96.43 3/4 earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine months ago, Forbes magazine estimated Turner's net
worth at $3.5 billion, making him America's 28th richest person.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting's second quarter revenues rose nearly 21
percent, helping to boost its parent's earnings to $23 million or 4
cents a share. Time Warner president Richard Parsons estimated that
Turner Broadcasting _ bought for $9.3 billion 18 months ago _ is
worth nearly twice that now.
</P>
<P>
   In a Wednesday briefing, Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin said
his company's percentage growth would range between the middle to
upper teens for the rest of the year. And he said the contribution
made by Turner Broadcasting was so strong he considered it Time
Warner's ``crown jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin also said Time Warner had no interest in buying an company
that serves as a gateway to the Internet such as America Online or
Yahoo!. Levin said his company was considering letting others use
its cable systems to offer local and long distance telephone
service. Time Warner has a cable system in northwestern metro
Atlanta with 50,000 subscribers. It is currently upgrading that
system to handle digital TV, high speed access to the Internet, and
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, our cable plant will be used by somebody to
provide local. telephone service,'' added Time Warner Cable
President Joe Collins. `` If not AT&AMP;T, then someone else who wants
to take on the regional telephone comapnies.''
</P>
<P>
   While its earnings are small, Time Warner's underlying
financials continue to strengthen. Its operating income before the
amortization of intangible assets, or EBITA, rose 17 percent to
$1.16 billion in the quarter. In the media business, EBITA is
considered one of the key indicators of company's financial health.
Turner Broadcasting's EBITA was $198 million, up 20 percent from
165 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's quarterly revenue was $6.53 billion, of which $906
million was contributed by Turner Broadcasting.

FOLDEROL OUTWEIGHS BASEBALL AT ALL-STAR EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They held a luncheon at Fenway Wednesday to trumpet the
1999 baseball All-Star Game, and the ratio of non-baseball people
to baseball people in attendance was about 10-1. In other words,
just about the modern norm.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the way it was the first time around, back in
'46. At that time the attraction was baseball, baseball, and, in
case you were tired of that, how 'bout a little baseball? The idea
that Stan Musial and Rapid Robert Feller and Joe D were coming to
town was enough. There was no attendant folderol, just baseball,
the greatest game ever to spring from the mind of mortal man.
</P>
<P>
   That was Tom Yawkey's opinion, anyway. As relayed by the Globe's
Gerry Moore, here was Yawkey's basic outlook on the 1946 All-Star
Game, the first ever played in Fenway: ``Because host Tom Yawkey
feels fans are interested mainly in baseball, the extracurricular
activities will not be too lengthy.''
</P>
<P>
   So I wonder what Mr. Yawkey was thinking around noontime
Wednesday as he gazed down from Diamond Heaven at the Fenway Park
proceedings. For every Dominic ``Little Professor'' DiMaggio, there
were five guys in suits. Marketing guys. Advertising guys.
Broadcast guys. Guys who, in some cases, wouldn't know third base
from a naval base, I'm sure. And when there weren't suits, there
were skirts. (Not that there's anything wrong with that).
</P>
<P>
   There were nice little welcoming speeches by the likes of Dan
Duquette, American League president Dr. Gene Budig, mayor Tom
Menino and Pat Moscaritolo, the Cheese of the Greater Boston
Convention and Visitors Bureau. Of course, this being 1998, the
dissertations were mainly about m-o-n-e-y. Specifically, the
economic impact of the All-Star Game, which will apparently be
considerable, how much so depending on which version you favor.
</P>
<P>
   Menino: ``$40 to $60 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscaritolo: ``Over $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Budig: ``Significantly better than that (i.e., $50 million).''
The AL prexy also paid Hizzoner a stunning compliment. ``You are,''
he said, ``an interesting politican because you understated how
good it is going to be, because it is off the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball? What's that?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, it's nobody's fault; it's just the way it is. Don't ask
if it makes any sense to have an All-Star Game in a park that seats
33,000 and change. The All-Star Game is irresistible, because it
means major moolah for the local economy. Let's just hope we get
through the day without anyone being forced to acknowledge that
there will be no public sale of tickets for the game in question,
or that there is not even a guaranteed seat for every current
season ticket holder.
</P>
<P>
   There would be if the game had anything whatsoever to do with
baseball. It does not. The game itself has to do with taking care
of sponsors. It has zero to do with the baseball fans whose
interests are theoretically being served by bringing the best
baseball players in the world to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Having the final All-Star Game of the 20th century in Updike's
``lyric little bandbox of a ballpark'' (or Clark Booth's ``Baseball
Basillica,'' take your pick) is a wonderfully romantic notion. Not
too long ago they went to Wrigley, Fenway's soul brother. So why
not go to Fenway?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right thing to do,'' says Dr. Budig. ``The people
in this community clearly deserve an All-Star Game. The time was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly will Joe Fan get out of it? There are two
possibilities. The first would be the Home Run Contest. I am
assuming there will be some sort of ticket possibilities there (or
am I being naive?). The second is ``Fan Fest.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is the interactive exhibit that is an integral part
of the All-Star deal these days. People will be sold the idea that
``Fan Fest'' is their All-Star Game. And I do hear good things
about ``Fan Fest.'' People returning from Denver spoke only in
superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   They're hoping to get Hynes Auditorium for ``Fan Fest.'' That
would make good geographic sense. Problem is, they have what you
call your prior committments. Let's just say that the folks at the
Hynes are working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Wednesday. We're waiting for the good baseball talk. The
supposed highlight of the day was the of the official logo. Who can
get excited about a logo? To me, a logo is about as exciting as
American cheese on white, hold the everything. And a glass of
water.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 and 1961 no one knew from logos. Geez, it was just a
baseball game. The issue in 1946 was how many of the eight Red Sox
players on the 25-man American League roster would start (the
answer was four). The issue 15 years later was weather. Nobody was
talking about anything a year before the game. Aside from getting
the needed hotel rooms (and the total was a bit shy of the
estimated 14,000 they'll need next year) and planning a little
dinner, what else was there to do? Oh, yeah, print the ducats. By
the way, bleacher tickets were available the day before the '46
game.
</P>
<P>
   In '46 and '61 it was all baseball, not ``the economic impact on
the community.'' It was the All-Star Game, not just another
convention for Pat Moscaritolo's people to hype. Baseball, like,
for example, the idea that only one man played in both previous
Fenway All-Star Games and that was Stan Musial. Baseball, as in did
you know that in 18 innings of Fenway Park All-Star baseball a
National League player has yet to hit a ball either off or over The
Wall?
</P>
<P>
   So let me throw out a baseball thought. Will they even bother to
invite a lefthanded hitter into the Home Run contest? ``Thome and
Griffey,'' says Dan Duquette, ``I don't think even Yellowstone can
hold those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Danny, I love it when you talk dirty like that. Lighten up
on the money chatter. Lemme hear more of that good baseball banter.
We (itals)are(unitals) talking about the All-Star Game.

DOW OFF 11.07 IN TURBULENT SESSION; TECH STOCKS STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were mixed Wednesday, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq index jumping to another new high, while
the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of
500 stocks finished lower after rising earlier in a day of volatile
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Dell Computer and Intel pushed the Nasdaq higher,
with Intel rebounding after its second-quarter earnings, which were
reported after the market closed Tuesday, came in a little under
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak, which jumped 8}, to 82{, added about 37 points to the Dow
after it reported that its second-quarter earnings beat forecasts
by a striking 25 cents a share. But that was not enough to offset
some disappointing earnings news.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar said that earnings rose 2.5 percent, to $1.20 a
diluted share, 4 cents a share below the forecast by analysts
surveyed by First Call Corp. The company said that earnings were
hurt by weak Asian sales. Caterpillar's stock fell 4\, to 52.
</P>
<P>
   And even strong earnings from Ford Motor did not help it. The
company reported profits that beat estimates by 10 cents a share,
but the stock dropped 1, to 59{. Even so, the stock is still up
84.5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index rose 26.13 points, or 1.33 percent, to
1,994.54, leaving it just a few points shy of the 2,000 level. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.77, to 1,174.81, while the
Dow dropped 11.07, to 9,234.47. During the day, the Dow topped
9,300 for the first time, but was pulled lower by Caterpillar and
by declines in some of Tuesday's better performers, including J.P.
Morgan and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond rose 7/32, to
106 2/32, snapping a three-day slide. The yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell to 5.70 percent from 5.71 percent Tuesday.
The long-term yield is still more than 10 basis points, or
hundredths of a percentage point, higher than it was a week and a
half ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is because the outlook for a turnaround in Japan and Russia
has improved recently in some investors' eyes. Russia has been
helped by a $17 billion bailout from the International Monetary
Fund, the United States and Japan. And Japan is searching for a new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   One of the concerns some analysts have about the stock market is
that while it is rising, the rally is limited to the bigger-company
stocks. This means that the so-called breadth of the rally is not
wide. One indicator of the lack of breadth is the number of
advancing stocks compared with decliners. On the Big Board on
Wednesday, decliners lead advancers 1,543 to 1,443.
</P>
<P>
   Another indicator is the fact that the main index of smaller
company stocks is still well below its high while the major indexes
have all bounced back. The Russell index of 2,000 stocks rose 2.55,
to 461.98 Wednesday, but it is still 6.4 percent from its high of
491.41 on April 21. And while the Nasdaq is up 27 percent this year
and the S&AMP;P 500 has risen 21 percent, the Russell 2,000 index is up
just 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big-cap rally,'' said Marshall Acuff, the equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``The lack of breadth makes you
scratch your head. You have to build the breadth. You've got to
have the earnings to build the breadth and companies like
Caterpillar don't have the earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``if people really felt good about earnings they
would be driving the midcaps and small-caps higher.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for this disparity in performance is that
price/earnings ratios are so high that investors only want to pay
up for bigger company stocks that have long-term records of coming
close to earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts argue that the rush of new money from
Americans and foreigners into the stock market is going to be
enough to offset concerns about the high cost of stocks and the
comparatively lackluster earnings performance this year _ low
single-digits compared with double digits last year.

HOUSE CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM SNAGGED ON PROCEDURAL ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The thorny effort to rewrite the nation's
campaign-finance laws snagged again Wednesday as opposing forces in
the House failed to reach agreement on how to end debate on the
high-stakes issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who have repeatedly pledged to complete the
debate before the House recesses for the summer on Aug. 7, abruptly
withdrew a plan to meet the deadline after a bipartisan group of
lawmakers pressing to reduce the influence of money in politics
said they would support it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the GOP leaders floated a new proposal that the
bipartisan coalition called worse than the first.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan would have reduced the number of proposed
amendments _ to 34 from 258 _ to the most prominent overhaul plan,
sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays, a Connecticut
Republican, and Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal would permit debate on 59 amendments to the
Shays-Meehan bill and nine alternatives to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They backed off the first agreement when we agreed to it,''
Meehan said of the GOP leadership. ``They are trying to find a way
to blame reformers for the delays, to shift the blame for doing
nothing on campaign-finance reform to those who are working to get
the reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Republican leaders said the first agreement
contained a clause that would have allowed more than 34 amendments,
which could have caused more delays than the second plan, which
contains no such provision.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said the GOP leaders intend to stand by their oral
pledge to complete debate by Aug. 7. That would give the Senate
enough time to act in September if the House passes the
Shays-Meehan bill or other campaign-finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan and his allies said they had no faith in the
promises. ``This is not the first or second or third time that
promises have been made and broken,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, yielding to pressure from members
of both parties, agreed to permit the campaign-finance debate to
start in late May. Since then, the debate has been limited to
late-night sessions, usually one or two nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's lone session to discuss the issue, supporters of
the Shays-Meehan bill survived a scare late Tuesday night when the
House narrowly defeated an amendment that Shays said would have
``gutted'' the overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's sponsor, Representative John Doolittle, a
California Republican, said the measure was aimed at protecting the
right of independent organizations such as the Christian Coalition
to distribute voter guides about the records of incumbent lawmakers
before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and Meehan warned that the amendment would kill a major
element of their plan: a provision requiring groups that wage
campaigns aimed at influencing elections to report their
fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was defeated, 219-201. All 23 House members from
New England opposed the amendment, except Representative John E.
Sununu, a New Hampshire Republican, who voted for it, and
Representative John W. Olver, a Massachusetts Democrat, who did not
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the House adopted an amendment to the Shays-Meehan bill
that Shays said could chip away at the fragile coalition that
supports the overhaul. The measure, which passed, 282-126, would
tighten the ban on political contributions by noncitizens,
including legal permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that legal permanent residents should be
allowed to participate in the political process because they pay
taxes, can be drafted in wartime, and, in most cases, are waiting
to become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, this is a killer amendment,'' Shays said. He said
the bill could lose support if that amendment survives.

IT'S OFFICIAL: `60 MINUTES' GETS DOUBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (also moving in `e' category) 
(rm) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ CBS made it official Wednesday: ``60
Minutes,'' the oldest and most successful news program in the
history of television, will expand to a second edition early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The new program, to be called ``60 Minutes II,'' will include
many elements of the original, including some appearances by its
veteran correspondents and the familiar opening of a ticking
stopwatch, while introducing a new lineup of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes after a long, behind-the-scenes debate over
whether a new ``60 Minutes'' would dilute the appeal of the
original by spreading its brand too widely. Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News, said the new program was intended to be
``not a clone, but a respectful offspring'' of the original.
</P>
<P>
   The chief connection between the new edition and the original
will be updated segments of what CBS is calling ``classic'' reports
from the original show, presented by the cast of the Sunday night
``60 Minutes.'' They may also appear in follow-up segments on the
second edition if something reported on Sunday needs updating.
</P>
<P>
   No new correspondents were named Wednesday, but the executive
producer will be Jeff Fager, currently the executive producer of
the ``Evening News With Dan Rather,'' who previously spent six
years as a producer on ``60 Minutes.'' Fager was called the crucial
piece in building the new program by several CBS News executives,
including Rather, who said, ``I don't think there could be a `60
Minutes II' without Jeff and the credentials he brings to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Fager will be replaced at the evening news by Al Ortiz, the
chief of CBS's Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Fager said Wednesday that he hoped to have the show on the air
by mid-January. ``One of the great advantages I have is that I
don't need to go around looking for new music or building a new
set.''
</P>
<P>
   The look of the new show will be very much the same as the
original, Fager said, as will the style of reporting. There will be
no anchor, he said, just a lineup of correspondents, as on the
original ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial player in the development of the new program
is Don Hewitt, the creator and executive producer of ``60 Minutes''
for the past 30 years. Hewitt will serve as a consultant on the new
edition, CBS announced.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Hewitt and the correspondents long associated with
the show, like Mike Wallace, Morley Safer and Ed Bradley, had been
one of the sticking points in what became a long negotiation over
the second edition. Hewitt had said that he had been asked numerous
times over the years to expand what has been the CBS network's most
valuable franchise, but he always resisted, seeking to protect the
almost hallowed status of the original.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the correspondents had expressed their own
reservations about the potential risk to the reputation of the
original. But CBS's management pushed the expansion to take
advantage of the ``60 Minutes'' name. News magazines are some of
the most dependable profit centers for networks, which are under
increasing economic pressure because of a dearth of new hits and
escalating costs for entertainment programs produced by Hollywood
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who declined to comment, said in a statement released by
CBS, ``I think that under Jeff Fager, `60 Minutes II' is a natural
to be the second best broadcast of its kind on television. Inasmuch
as I can help, without shortchanging the first best broadcast of
its kind on television, I'm hoping to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president of CBS and the man responsible for the
network's prime-time schedule, had long made clear his enthusiasm
for a second edition of the most reliable ratings-getter on CBS.
``This is very important for us,'' he said. ``If you just look at
the summer, `60 Minutes' has been the top-rated show in television
three of the last four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new edition will likely be scheduled on a weeknight
at either 9 or 10 p.m. and may be pitted against an existing news
magazine on another network ``just because it's so hard to avoid
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward declined to speculate on which correspondents might be
under consideration for ``60 Minutes II'' but said of two part-time
contributors to the original show, Christiane Amanpour and Bob
Simon, ``We're looking for experienced broadcasters with superb
talent and those are certainly people with those qualifications.''

Minutes II' without Jeff and the credentials he brings to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Fager will be replaced at the evening news by Al Ortiz, the
chief of CBS's Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Fager said Wednesday that he hoped to have the show on the air
by mid-January. ``One of the great advantages I have is that I
don't need to go around looking for new music or building a new
set.''
</P>
<P>
   The look of the new show will be very much the same as the
original, Fager said, as will the style of reporting. There will be
no anchor, he said, just a lineup of correspondents, as on the
original ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial player in the development of the new program
is Don Hewitt, the creator and executive producer of ``60 Minutes''
for the past 30 years. Hewitt will serve as a consultant on the new
edition, CBS announced.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Hewitt and the correspondents long associated with
the show, like Mike Wallace, Morley Safer and Ed Bradley, had been
one of the sticking points in what became a long negotiation over
the second edition. Hewitt had said that he had been asked numerous
times over the years to expand what has been the CBS network's most
valuable franchise, but he always resisted, seeking to protect the
almost hallowed status of the original.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the correspondents had expressed their own
reservations about the potential risk to the reputation of the
original. But CBS's management pushed the expansion to take
advantage of the ``60 Minutes'' name. News magazines are some of
the most dependable profit centers for networks, which are under
increasing economic pressure because of a dearth of new hits and
escalating costs for entertainment programs produced by Hollywood
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who declined to comment, said in a statement released by
CBS, ``I think that under Jeff Fager, `60 Minutes II' is a natural
to be the second best broadcast of its kind on television. Inasmuch
as I can help, without shortchanging the first best broadcast of
its kind on television, I'm hoping to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president of CBS and the man responsible for the
network's prime-time schedule, had long made clear his enthusiasm
for a second edition of the most reliable ratings-getter on CBS.
``This is very important for us,'' he said. ``If you just look at
the summer, `60 Minutes' has been the top-rated show in television
three of the last four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new edition will likely be scheduled on a weeknight
at either 9 or 10 p.m. and may be pitted against an existing news
magazine on another network ``just because it's so hard to avoid
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward declined to speculate on which correspondents might be
under consideration for ``60 Minutes II'' but said of two part-time
contributors to the original show, Christiane Amanpour and Bob
Simon, ``We're looking for experienced broadcasters with superb
talent and those are certainly people with those qualifications.''

APPLE'S EARNINGS EXCEED ANALYSTS' EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Confounding the skeptics yet again, a resurgent
Apple Computer Inc. blew by Wall Street analysts' earnings
estimates Wednesday for the third consecutive quarter. Apple said
it sold a record number of its G3 Macintosh computers and that
profit margins improved in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Apple reported its results after the market's close, but in
anticipation of a strong quarter, Apple shares closed at $34.44, up
$1, a new 52-week high, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's revenues were as expected, but that
higher margins boosted earnings due to Apple's selling a greater
percentage of high-end machines. Revenues might have been higher
had the company been able to meet demand for its new Powerbook
laptop models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great quarter,'' Steve Jobs, Apple's interim
president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
``Operational excellence has returned to Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   For its third fiscal quarter, which ended June 26, Apple
reported earnings of $101 million, or 65 cents a share, fully
diluted, compared with a loss of $56 million in the comparable
period a year ago. Revenues dropped 18 percent to $1.4 billion,
from $1.7 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's third-quarter 1998 earnings included a $26 million net
gain from nonrecurring items, including an after-tax gain of $33
million related to the initial public offering of ARM Holdings PLC,
and a $7 million charge related to the acquisition of technology
from Macromedia Inc. Without these nonrecurring items, the
company's net income for the quarter would have been $75 million,
or 50 cents per diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Apple to earn 33 cents a share, according
to First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said Apple could
continue to outperform expectations in the quarters to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a pretty good job building excitement around the
iMac,'' he said, referring to a new $1,299 Macintosh for the
consumer market. ``They've created an atmosphere in which people
want to buy the Macintosh again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One measure of Apple's new discipline as a business is that the
company increased inventory turns from 13 to 22 in the quarter,
which helped drive down costs and lowered its exposure to declining
component prices. Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer,
said in a conference call with securities analysts, that the
company's goal was to increase inventory turns to 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking a Dell-style balance sheet,'' said Kunstler,
referring to Dell Computer Corp.'s industry-leading minimal
inventory levels. ``From a shareholder's perspective, that's got to
be very sweet to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Macworld convention this week in New York, Apple answered
a number of concerns that had been raised about the iMac,
announcing that it would include a 56K modem rather than the slower
33K device it had originally been shown with, and unveiling three
external floppy disk drives. In addition, Apple said software
developers had announced commitments for 177 new programs or
upgrades for the Macintosh since the iMac was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more comfortable with the iMac proposition than I
did before Macworld,'' said Charles Wolf, an analyst with C.S.
First Boston. He said he expected Apple to sell 275,000 iMacs to
schools and home consumers in the fourth quarter; 400,000 in the
December quarter and 1 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than anything Compaq has for the consumer market
under $2,500,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the launch of the iMac would bring Apple's profit
margins down by a couple of percentage points, but he added that
the company expected a substantial gain in unit volumes from the
new machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sights are set on a very aggressive foray into the
consumer market,'' he said during the call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Although in the past Apple has discovered after launching new
products that it had miscalculated demand or had encountered
production difficulties, Jobs said the company was gearing up for
the iMac launch and would be ready this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a lot of iMacs this quarter,'' he said.
``Even making a lot, there's no way we will meet demand this
quarter. We hope to meet demand next quarter. That's just the way
it is when you have a hot product.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 10 million existing home users of the
Macintosh, and new computer users who want to get access to the
Internet, Jobs expects the iMac to win back customers from the
Wintel camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thing to remember is many of them were not born with a PC in
their mouth,'' he said. ``Many of them defected from the Mac and we
can win some of them back.'' &QL;

GOP LEGISLATION WOULD BLUNT JOB DISCRIMINATION BAN AGAINST GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans say they will vote next week on
legislation that would nullify President Clinton's executive order
banning job discrimination against homosexuals working for the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., said in an interview Wednesday that
he plans to offer an amendment to the Commerce Department spending
bill that would prevent any federal money from being spent to
implement, administer or enforce the president's executive order.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me this is not a gay fight, it's a fight about executive
orders and about carving out particular classes,'' Hefley said.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said presidential executive orders are meant to be used
for emergencies, not for trying to circumvent Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He said that with this order, which was issued in May, the
president decided ``with the stroke of a pen, I'm going to be a
dictator ... The president directly thumbed his nose (at
Congress.)''
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said Congress has signaled that most of its members don't
want to add a new category based on sexual orientation to the civil
rights laws that apply to minority and disabled federal workers and
grant recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not promoting discrimination, but there are many civil
rights laws to deal with discrimination,'' Hefley said. ``I don't
think the American people want additional protected classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said he has support from Republican leaders including
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, House Majority Leader
Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, House Rules Committee chairman Gerald
B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., and House Appropriations chairman Bob
Livingston, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., who chairs the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which works to elect Republicans to
Congress, said in an interview he would support Hefley's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than take things through the House and go through the
normal process, he thinks he can makes laws by himself,'' Linder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley had planned to offer the legislation Wednesday as an
amendment to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, but said he
changed his strategy for fear of offending Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
the only openly gay Republican in Congress, who heads the
appropriation panel's Treasury Postal Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to bash Kolbe,'' Hefley said, adding that he
hopes that moving the issue away Kolbe's panel will reduce the
chances that it will become a gay issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it might not be so prominent if I'm not sticking my
finger in Kolbe's eye,'' Hefley said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kolbe pledged to fight Hefley's amendment and predicted
an ugly battle over the issue of whether gays should be protected
against job discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a very tough debate with a lot of
difficult things said,'' Kolbe said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   One critic of Hefley's amendment said the Colorado
representative was attempting to appease conservative religious
groups in his home district, which includes Colorado Springs. One
of those groups, Focus on the Family, headed by James C. Dobson,
has pushed for months to block the languishing nomination of San
Francisco gay rights advocate James Hormel, Clinton's choice to be
ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, a group
that represents gay Republicans, said, ``It's out and out anti-gay.
It's pandering to the religious right and gay bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hefley's amendment comes as a broad coalition of conservative
religious groups has launched a campaign against homosexuality,
hoping to communicate that it is a disease that can be cured with
counseling and therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has taken out ads this week in national
newspapers, such as one that told the story of a former lesbian who
says she changed her sexual ways through religion.
</P>
<P>
   The ads follow recent remarks by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., who compared homosexuals to alcoholics,
kleptomaniacs and sex addicts. Gay groups responded to the ads by
purchasing their own full-page ads.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., one of six House Democrats who
joined with six House Republicans Wednesday evening to send a
letter to all House members defending Clinton's executive order,
said she would fight Hefley's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the majority is trying to enliven their base,'' at
the expense of gays, Tauscher said in an interview. ``It is an
attempt to keep the traditional Republican social conservative
right-wing base enlivened. They want to keep the money machine
going.''

the 20th Century than at Fenway Park and in Boston,'' said Red Sox
vice president and general manager Daniel F. Duquette. ``The city
has had a loyal, continuing relationship with professional baseball
since 1871 (when the Boston Red Stockings debuted in the old
National Association of Professional Baseball Players).
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, we're all committed to putting together a great
show,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick B. Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the
Greater Boston Visitors &AMP; Convention Bureau, told The Globe before
the 1998 All-Star game at Coors Field in Denver last week that the
game in Boston would likely generate $40 million what is nominally
considered tourist spending _ hotels, restaurants, retail sales and
transportation. But Moscaritolo said that after talking with
officials of Major League Baseball, and especially after reviewing
early revenue returns from what is considered to have been a highly
successful week of events in Denver, he incresased the projection.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I try to be quite conservative with those sorts
of numbers,'' Moscaritolo said. ``But when we looked at some things
in Denver like a lot of people _ especially the media and the
networks _ staying in their hotels for a few days longer after the
game than we had considered, some extra transportation revenue we
had not realized, we decided we were really low-balling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino is clearly relishing the competition with
other cities, which have realized $28 million to $38.5 million in
tourist revenue during All-Star games from 1993 to 1997. Menino
touted a prediction of as high as $60 million to be generated for
the local tourism and hospitality industries next year in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity to be out in Denver recently for the
All-Star Game,'' Menino said. ``They haven't seen anything, yet.
We're going to have the best All-Star game, here in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino joined Dr. Gene Budig, president of the American League,
and other officials in unveiling the primary logo for the game,
which was mounted temporarily on the legendary left field wall at
Fenway Park. The logo, one of about three dozen marks for the 1999
game on which Major League Baseball has obtained trademarks, is
emblazoned with the words ``Boston All-Star Game '99'' on a broad
green background that is intended to suggest the beloved Green
Monster.
</P>
<P>
   The primary logo and the others will be omnipresent in the city
by June 1 of next year, but official licensees of products bearing
Major League Baseball's marks have already been produced and will
be on sale as early as today at some retailers and souvenir shops.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous companies in the Boston area and throughout New England
pay fees to use the registered marks, either as licensees or
sponsors of the game. That revenue is distributed among the two
major leagues and the 30 franchises, according to official of Major
League Baseball Properties, who refused to put a dollar figure on
that revenue.

SPACE STATION OPPONENTS RALLY AROUND PROPOSAL TO SCUTTLE PROJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional opponents of the international space
station rallied Wednesday around a proposal by Rep. Tim Roemer to
pull the plug on the multibillion-dollar project.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Democrat said his annual effort to end funding for
the orbiting laboratory has received a boost from NASA's
acknowledgment of cost overruns and launch delays, along with the
failure of Russia _ one of 16 partners in the project _ to pay its
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel that the evidence continues to pile up to finally
put this space station out of its misery,'' Roemer said at a
Capitol Hill news conference attended by four other House members,
representatives of two science organizations and three taxpayer
groups, all opposed to continuing U.S. participation in the
project. A recent GAO report set the total cost over the project's
lifetime at $96 billion with development and construction to cost
$24.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has no answers for the cost overruns and scheduling
delays that now plague the station,'' Roemer said. ``Congress
should end this fiscal black hole now before it consumes other
worthwhile scientific projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Roemer's proposal, which he plans to offer as an amendment to a
funding bill for Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban
Development, is similar to legislation the Senate killed, 66-33, a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Roemer's amendment is scheduled for debate and a vote by the
full House on Thursday. He wants to delete about $2.1 billion
earmarked for NASA to spend next year to launch and assemble
several components of the space station. His amendment would
provide a maximum of $500 million to close down the project, which
is being developed at the Johnson Space Center in far south
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The first component, a 20-ton control module financed by NASA
and built by the Russians, is to launch Nov. 20. Two weeks later, a
space shuttle carries aloft a unit called Node 1, which will attach
to the control module and serve as a port for future components.
NASA's timetable calls for the facility to be complete and
operational by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Lampson, a Texas Democrat whose district includes JSC,
called Roemer's effort to kill the space station ``misguided.''
Lampson said NASA contractors have completed work on 75 percent of
the U.S. share of the hardware for the space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we backed out of the station now, and severed the
relationship we have with the Russian space agency, we ... would
have a really difficult time building another friendly project with
them. This would set back our international relations a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the traditional argument that scrapping the space
station would cost jobs, Roemer acknowledged that his task is more
difficult because of lobbying by space contractors and lawmakers
whose states stand to benefit from the project. ``I'm not going to
kid you. This is a very difficult thing to overcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the economic argument, Roemer points out that three
states _ Alabama, California and Texas _ receive 85 percent of the
benefit from contracts to develop, launch and operate the space
station. He also noted that the latest redesign cut the space
station's capability to two scientific missions, down from eight as
originally envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space station simply provides too little bang for the
buck,'' Roemer said.

 &HT;    Galarraga has 2 HRs as Braves rout Mets
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1996 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the New York Mets wish to make a race of the
National League East, they apparently never read the manual.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Mets now have played 47 innings, and New York has
yet to hold a lead. Wednesday afternoon, the Braves bid the Mets
farewell until Labor Day weekend, and Andres Galarraga left the
``Amazins'' looking like Beetle Bailey after Sgt. Snorkel adjusts
his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Riding Galarraga's sixth multi-homer game of the season, the
Braves pummeled New York 12-1 and swept a two-game set at Shea
Stadium. Ryan Klesko added a solo homer, Andruw Jones drove in two
runs, and Denny Neagle (10-7, 3.17) allowed one unearned run during
six innings to join Atlanta's five-man 10-win club on his third
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``How should I put this?'' asked Neagle. ``I was receptive to
getting that many runs today.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who matched his season high with five RBIs, was just
as happy to furnish them. He hit a two-run homer off New York
starter Masato Yoshii in the first and added a colossal three-run
shot off Bill Pulsipher in the fourth that landed in a grassy area
40 feet beyond the Braves' bullpen. That made it 9-1, and Bobby Cox
soon started emptying the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job,'' said Galarraga, who now has 31 homers, 11 shy
of his 1997 total in Colorado. ``I played four games in Miami last
weekend and didn't get an RBI. So now I got somebody on base and
finally have some RBIs in the second half. Maybe I make up for the
first four.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga has homered in just five of his last 27 games but has
now hit two home runs in four of those games. Wednesday marked the
25th multi-homer game of his career, and the long blast over the
bullpen was his fifth three-run homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finally got some pitches to hit,'' said Cox, who called off
batting practice while the Braves crawled from their beds for a
12:10 p.m. start.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who had given up three runs in his last two starts and
couldn't win, limited the Mets to four hits. More important, he
stranded four Mets in the first three innings while the lead was
being built. When he got the lead, he appeared stronger, allowing
just one runner past first base in his last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the season everyone is saying we got the
division easy,'' Galarraga said. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a little easier now than it was two days ago.

 &HT;    1-for-22 slump has Tucker riding bench
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- There was a notable absentee from Wednesday's
Flushing Wood Fest. Michael Tucker never came out of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those days,'' Tucker said, ``where if I went up
there and didn't get a hit, I might kill somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's slump, at 1-for-22 and holding, convinced Bobby Cox to
keep his right fielder on the bench and start Curtis Pride on his
second day off the DL. Pride went 1-for-3 and scored, and Eddie
Perez, who later batted in Pride's (and Tucker's) seventh spot, had
a pinch-hit RBI single. Cox thought it was something Tucker ought
to see while the Braves ran up 16 hits, their highest total in 43
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chases (bad pitches) like everybody else when they're not
hitting the ball real solid,'' Cox said. ``He's swinging at some
balls he really shouldn't be swinging at. These are things people
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after a .256 June, Tucker was riding an eight-game hitting
streak that brought him to July 4 still hitting .281, with 19
doubles and 11 home runs (his respective career highs are 25 and
14). But in his six games since, he has one double and five
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't going that great,'' he said. ``There's not much
you can do about it. Everybody goes thought it. Chipper went
through it. Klesko went through it. Andruw went through it at the
beginning of the year. All you can do is keep going up there and
swinging. Things just aren't clicking right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen adjustment
</P>
<P>
   With Mark Wohlers scheduled to make a last appearance Wednesday
night with Class AAA Richmond, the Braves plan to put off
activating him until Friday to avoid forcing him into back-to-back
appearances. That postpones by 24 hours the decision on whom
returns to Richmond to make room on the 25-man roster. Management
is still debating the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez is a likely choice, but with a respectable
performance in nearly seven weeks with the club (1-0, 3.00 ERA), he
is also out of options, and the Braves would quite possibly lose
him to the waiver wire, given the current quality of relief work in
the majors. That could nominate right-hander Mike Cather (2-2,
3.92), who finished Wednesday's game but made just his third
appearance in 16 games. Just beginning his second year of service
time, he retains his minor league options.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting times
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets are determined to use an infield overshift
against Chipper Jones, when he is batting left-handed and the bases
are empty. The ploy didn't help much in Wednesday's romp. Jones
went 2-for-4 and scored three times, but shortstop Rey Ordonez did
rob a single from him Tuesday night. Jones wound up 4-for-8 against
the Mets.

 &HT;    On Deck: Milwaukee Brewers
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight and Friday at 7:40 p.m.; Saturday at 7:10 p.m.;
Sunday at 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Braves Network (WUPA) will televise tonight, and TBS
will televise the next three games. 750-AM will broadcast all four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight: RHP Greg Maddux (12-3,
1.57; 1-0, 1.69 vs. Brewers) vs. RHP Cal Eldred (4-7, 4.80; 0-0,
1.50 lifetime vs. Braves). Friday: LHP Tom Glavine (12-4, 2.85;
1-0, 2.83 lifetime vs Brewers) vs. LHP Brad Woodall (4-4, 3.61;
0-0, 18.00 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday: RHP Kevin Millwood
(10-4, 4.28; first appearance vs. Brewers) vs. RHP Steve Woodard
(6-5, 3.47; 0-1, 5.40 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday: RHP John Smoltz
(7-2, 3.62; first appearance vs. Brewers) vs. RHP Jeff Juden (7-8,
4.73; 1-4, 5.74 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: In their first season of National League
membership, the Brewers are 1-4 against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves outscored the Brewers 19-3 and swept a
three-game series in Milwaukee June 1-3. The clubs opened the
season with a two-game set at Turner Field, Milwaukee getting a 1-1
split by scoring six runs in the last three innings during an 8-6
victory April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers leaders: Avg. _ Mark Loretta (.321); HR _ Jeromy Burnitz
(20); RBIs _ Burnitz (65); SB _ Fernando Vina (13). W _ Jeff Juden
(7); ERA _ Mike Myers (0.53). Strikeouts _ Cal Eldred (80). Saves _
Bob Wickman (13).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: After finishing the first half in a five-game losing
streak, Milwaukee went 3-3 out of the break and remains mired in
the middle of the Central Division. But they have been consistent,
remaining at or above .500 since June 10. ... The Brewers are
under-powered with a team slugging percentage (.394) that is 10th
in the NL and a run-scoring rate (4.48 per game) than ranks ninth.
While the starters have gone 27-33, the bullpen has been a
strength, once Bob Wickman took over closing duties.

 &HT;    For solace, Wohlers can look to Blass
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- The inquiry from Atlanta, home to the Gordian knot
that is Mark Wohlers, was hardly unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime anyone has control problems, I get a call,'' Steve
Blass says to your correspondent. He does not say so wearily. He
does not sound pained at being asked to pick at a 25-year-old scar.
He is a man who understands his place as a living, breathing point
of reference.
</P>
<P>
   As Wohlers lost touch with the strike zone, going from World
Series savior to troubled enigma, some mentioned that he had come
down with Steve Blass Syndrome. Or, others defended him by saying
that he was no Steve Blass. Wohlers is scheduled to make his return
to the Braves today; and we shall discover on which side of the
Blass analogy he finally falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only one of two ballplayers who's had a disease named
after him. Me and Lou Gehrig. Not bad company,'' is Blass'
oft-repeated one-liner on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wohlers, Blass recorded the last outs of a World Series. He
was the catalyst to Pittsburgh's 1971 victory over Baltimore, the
starter who had complete-game victories in games 3 (a three-hitter)
and 7 (allowing just four more hits). The next season, he won 19,
walking only 84 in 250 innings. He practiced a form of laser
surgery before it became common among medical types.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for reasons he still does not comprehend, Blass melted
down. At 30 (Wohlers is 28), Blass could not control the pitch's
destination. The more he fought it, the more imprecise he became.
He went 3-9 in '73, with an ERA of 9.81. There was but one major
league start in 1974 _ five innings, five hits, seven walks _ then
down to the minors. In the fourth inning of a 1975 spring training
game, Steve Blass said farewell by walking in six runs.
</P>
<P>
   A Pirates broadcaster, Blass is at the stage now where he can
dull the memory with regular injections of humor.
</P>
<P>
   He tells of the time Mackey Sasser, a catcher who became
strangely unable to throw the ball even back to the pitcher, passed
through Pittsburgh. ``I told him we would have made a heck of a
battery,'' Blass said. ``They'd need a bag of balls every time we
were out there. He'd throw the ball into center field, and I'd
throw it into the concession stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing funny about the malady as it worms
its way through a player's brain. ``Once you can't rely on your
instincts,'' Blass said, ``you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn a lot about yourself. I had a horrendous two years.
I don't think anything will get to me again, because I survived
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He does not make a great effort to follow those who currently
are afflicted. Of Wohlers, the Connecticut-born Blass knows this
much, ``He's from the New England area too, right? (Yes, Holyoke,
Mass.) Must be something in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd encourage him to try every conceivable thing, no matter
how ridiculous it may seem at the time. When it was over for me, I
was at least satisfied that I had tried everything,'' Blass said.
</P>
<P>
   And circle the wagons with your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just hang in there. All pitchers are going to go through their
streaks of wildness. Most of them get over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him I've been through it and I'm rooting for him.''

 &HT;    PSCR sanction for new series
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Professional Sports Car Racing (PSCR), a member club
of the American Competition Committee of the United States (ACCUS),
was named the sanctioning body for the recently announced American
Le Mans Series, and William Donaldson was named executive director
of the sports car series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped for and certainly encouraged a unification of the
PSCR and USRRC (the Bill France-owned United States Road Racing
Championships) since January of this year. This has not occurred,
and we need to move forward with the organization of our American
Le Mans Series,'' said Don Panoz, Chairman of Panoz Motor Sports
and originator of the American Le Mans Series.
</P>
<P>
   PSCR, based in Tampa, currently sanctions a series of races in
the United States, and for 1999 will focus its attention on as many
as 11 races in the American Le Mans Series.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, currently president of Premier Management Group (PMG)
of Indianapolis, will headquarter the series in Indianapolis.
Donaldson spent 19 years at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
leaving last September as its executive vice president to form PMG.
</P>
<P>
   Formula One
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of Sunday's British Grand Prix is that Michael
Schumacher won it, but here is the final version of how he won it.
The McLaren team protested Schumacher's victory, claiming he should
have taken a 10-second penalty for illegal overtaking. Three and a
half hours after the race finished stewards withdrew the penalty
because of a technicality _ they had informed the Ferrari team more
than the mandatory 25 minutes after the incident, thus it never
happened. So, officially, Schumacher won by 22.4 seconds, not 12.4.
Wins like that are why Schumacher gets the big bucks that stagger
even the imagination of NBA hopefuls. The 29-year-old is expected
to sign with Ferrari for another two years for $85 million, and
that information came before the British Grand Prix win.
</P>
<P>
   Legends
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Olympic swimming gold medalist Steve Lundquist held off
former New York Giants safety Myron Guyton to win the celebrity
Legends match during last week's ``Thursday Thunder'' at Atlanta
Motor Speedway. Reed Sorenson of Peachtree City continued his
dominance of the Young Lions division, taking his fifth straight
victory. Other winners: Chargers, Tim Pafford, Leesburg; Masters,
Stephen Dale, Fayetteville; Bandolero, Kyle Kennedy, Preston; Pro,
Doug Stephens, McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   Drags
</P>
<P>
   Phil Sexton of McDonough turned an 8.59 elapsed time (154.12
mph) in his 1996 Mullis Dragster to win the Pro/Super Pro division
of last Saturday's Sears/Craftsman series at Atlanta Dragway. Other
winners: Sportsman, Toby Barnes, Peachtree City, 1968 Camaro, 12.25
ET, 109.49 mph; Trophy, Cliff Donald, Lawrenceville, 1967
Barracuda, 14.77, 92.03; Motorcycle, Jay Rhyne, Athens, 1981

WINDS AT BRITISH OPEN HEIGHTEN THE CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ As a five-time British Open champion, Tom
Watson knows a thing or two about the world's oldest major. So when
asked to name the three most important ingredients for a British
Open champion, Watson did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you have to have guts,'' said Watson. ``You have
to couple that with desire. And I think you have to be dedicated to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With those thoughts in mind, Watson will join the world's
greatest golfers at Royal Birkdale Golf Club to test themselves
against the elements, the pressure and a demanding golf course when
the British Open begins Thursday. The year's third major is hard to
handicap, and it will be even more difficult to play, particularly
if the wind blows as forcefully as it has for much of this week.
</P>
<P>
   While several golfers like Lee Westwood, David Duval and the
defending champion, Justin Leonard, have been mentioned
consistently by their peers as favorites this week, other prominent
players may have difficulty contending because of injuries. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Lehman, who, according to several players and caddies,
strained his right shoulder Tuesday night when he fell off an
amusement park ride. Lehman reportedly felt better Wednesday
morning, and he has a late tee time Thursday (2:45 p.m. local),
giving him extra time to receive treatment. ``I'll definitely be
O.K.,'' Lehman told The Associated Press Wednesday. ``I was just
messing around with the kids.'' However, if Lehman is severely
hampered by the injury, it may force him to withdraw, or seriously
damage his chances to win.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ernie Els, who has still not fully recovered from the bad back
that forced him to withdraw from last month's Buick Classic. Els
did not look good at last month's U.S. Open, and he may take a
month off after this week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nick Faldo, who withdrew from last week's Loch Lomond
tournament with an injured right elbow. Faldo said Wednesday that
he would play, but he wore a cast for three days last week, and the
injury interrupted his preparation. ``I played a full round today,
didn't hold back,'' said Faldo. ``That was a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even healthy players may feel a little uneasy after playing
Royal Birkdale this week. Today was the calmest day of the week,
with temperatures in the low 60s, and winds gusting to 15 miles per
hour. Earlier this week, wind gusts approached 40 miles per hour,
and the weekend forecast calls for wind gusts of more than 20 miles
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Par could be a winning score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the holes play either into a wind, or with a stiff
crosswind,'' said Duval, the top money winner on the PGA Tour, who
will be seeking his first major championship. ``There doesn't seem
like there are many breaks. It beats you to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Birkdale demands accurate shots off the tee, because the
fairways are narrow and hard. Balls that land in the fairway with
speed are still in danger of rolling into the thick grass, bunkers
and dunes that await errant shots. Most players, particularly long
hitters like Tiger Woods, John Daly and Davis Love III, will only
use their driver sparingly, preferring to hit irons off the tee.
Putting is always crucial, but anyone who has a poor week off the
tee will not win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course is so hard,'' said Daly, who won the 1995 British
Open at St. Andrews. ``I had a better chance at St. Andrews, where
I hit a driver on a lot of holes. Here, you can't do it. You miss a
fairway here, you can't advance the ball unless you get a good
break or a good lie. You miss the fairway, you're dead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Guts, which Watson talked about, will come into play
particularly on crosswind holes, where players will have to aim for
trouble, trusting the wind to push their ball back to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken me two days to figure out how far the ball is
being pushed by the wind,'' said Lee Janzen, who won last month's
U.S. Open. ``Normally, in the states, we still aim for the edge of
the fairway. Here, I think you have to aim sometimes 20 yards off
the fairway, into deep trouble, just to get the ball to go in the
fairway. It is going to eliminate a lot of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire that Watson talked about will be evident on the
weekend, when the contenders separate themselves from the field.
The last two winners, Leonard last year and Lehman in `96,
discovered that they had what it takes to win a major. For top
players who have yet to win a major, particularly veterans like
Colin Montgomerie and Phil Mickelson, the pressure will be even
more intense if they find themselves in contention.
</P>
<P>
   The last 15 majors have been won by 15 different players, so the
list of potential winners is much wider than the fairways at Royal
Birkdale. Considering the havoc that the wind could cause, almost
anything could happen. But the challenge of dealing with the
conditions is part of what makes the British Open special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to rank them, but this is one I would dearly like to
win, and probably the one I get most excited for,'' said Love.
``This is probably the greatest championship in the world. Each
major has got something special, but this one is probably the one
most guys want to win more than any other.''

POLAROID BUYS ID CARD RIVAL FOR $12.9 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polaroid Corp. has bought its closest rival in the market for
advanced identification cards, paying $12.9 million for NBS Imaging
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid expects the acquisition of NBSI, a division of NBS
Technologies Inc. of Toronto, will consolidate its position in
driver's licenses and other so-called secure cards.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has struggled to rebound from a decline in sales of
instant cameras and film, its core business. While expansion into
medical imaging has met with mixed results, the Cambridge, Mass.
company remains the biggest player in the market for photo ID
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid said Wednesday it currently supplies secure licenses to
27 states, giving it the largest market share in the industry.
After the acquisition, Polaroid will hold license contracts for 50
US, Mexican, and Canadian states and provinces, as well as
contracts for identification documents in several other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBS is really their number-one competitor in terms of US
driver's license contracts,'' said analyst Gibboney Huske of Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``They have a pretty dominant market share in
this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The photo equipment giant plans to fold NBSI, of Fort Wayne,
Ind., into its own card business, according to Polaroid spokesman
Robert L. Guenther. No new jobs will be created in Massachusetts as
a result of the sale; NBSI personnel will be relocated to Polaroid
ID card production sites around the country, Guenther said.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid said it expects the acquisition to cause a slight
increase in 1998 earnings. NBSI reported almost $25 million in
annual sales in 1997. Polaroid had $2.1 billion in sales during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the sale would have a small but beneficial impact
on Polaroid's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to expand that business,'' said analyst B. Alex
Henderson of Prudential Securities. ``It's not a material event in
terms of earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Secure ID cards combine pictures with special laminates,
holograms, and sometimes biometrical security features to make the
cards fraud-proof. In Georgia, where Polaroid runs the largest
biometric ID card program in the world, the state's driver's
licenses carry fingerprint-verification information directly on the
card, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's stock gained 5/8 to close at 35 5/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

TO RICHTER, RIGHT PLACE TO BE IS WITH RANGERS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After all of the posturing and hard-line negotiating
tactics, it took a face-to-face meeting between Mike Richter and
Neil Smith on Monday for both to realize that New York was where
Richter belonged.
</P>
<P>
   And so late that night, after an afternoon of meetings and
bargaining, Richter settled for less than he originally wanted but
ended up with the team he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of opportunity when you become a free agent,''
Richter said at a news conference Wednesday to announce the deal.
``But staying where you are happy and where you have a chance to
win another championship is what's most important. And for me, that
is with the New York Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter's contract, a four-year deal worth $21.8 million, makes
him the National Hockey League's third-highest-paid goaltender
behind Dominik Hasek of Buffalo and Curtis Joseph, who was also
pursued by the Rangers but ended up signing a four-year, $24
million contract with Toronto Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When it came down to it, Mike and I worked things out,'' said
Smith, the Rangers' president and general manager. ``That's the way
it should be.'' Richter's agent, Herb Pinder, was also involved in
the negotiations, but it ultimately came down a compromise between
Richter and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith added: ``Free agency is not all it's cracked up to be, as
Mike will tell you. Sure, it makes you a little bit richer, but it
pulls on your heartstrings. I can't tell you how emotional it got.
Mike has been our goalie for nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by John Muckler, the Rangers' coach; Brian Leetch, the
team's captain, and Dave Checketts, the president and chief
executive of Madison Square Garden, Richter sat at a table with
Smith and signed the new contract before dozens of reporters and
flashing cameras in a short ceremony at the Garden, the arena
Richter will call home through the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   But before the deal was struck late Monday, Richter was prepared
to board a flight for Florida, where the Panthers wanted him to
replace John Vanbiesbrouck. Then, with no more than an hour to
spare, Smith called Richter with an offer, the one to which they
eventually agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Richter and Smith said there were no hard feelings despite
the sometimes ruthless tactics used by both sides over the last
month. ``I wouldn't call it easy,'' Richter said. ``But that's
business. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had been negotiating with Joseph since last Friday
and were apparently close to signing a deal. But negotiations with
Joseph broke down on Monday morning because of a division over
money and the length of the deal. Smith picked up the phone and
called Richter, who was close to working out a deal with the
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith treated the signing as a victory, and in some ways it was,
if retaining a front-line goaltender can be considered a victory.
Certainly the team would have been worse off if Richter had left
and no replacement was available. But will the Rangers be a better
team? After all, they missed the playoffs with Richter in net this
past season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the rebuilding Rangers, keeping Richter was important
for several reasons. First, no team is going to make the
post-season without a top-flight goalie. Richter is that. Second,
Richter will serve as a bridge to the future, tutoring a young Dan
Cloutier until he is ready to take over. Third, re-signing Richter
was proof to veterans like Leetch, who will become an unrestricted
free agent next summer, that winning is still a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very important for this organization if it wants to make
a quick turnaround,'' Leetch said. ``Everyone knows that starts
with a great goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   The next priority for the Rangers is re-signing Leetch. Despite
his subpar performance last season, Leetch is still viewed as a
premier defenseman and is the core of this team. ``I'd like to get
it done as soon as possible,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch was also hopeful that something could be worked out
before the season. ``I don't see anything in the immediate future
with my contract,'' he said. ``But I would like to get it done
sooner rather than later. It can be a distraction if you're talking
during the season.''

TAX-CUT MEASURE SAILS THROUGH HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an unusual show of election-year bipartisanship, the
House Wednesday unanimously passed a $700 million tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   The plan doubles the exemption for earned income, saving about
$131 for a single filer and $262 for joint filers; and cuts in half
the 12 percent tax rate on interest and dividend income.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax rate for unearned income would be phased in Jan. 1,
1999. Interest and dividends gained this year, therefore, are not
subject to the lower 5.95 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   As for the doubling of exemptions, taxpayers will be able to
receive 75 percent of the phased-in savings on their 1998 tax
returns and 100 percent of the savings the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also increases the size of the stabilization, or rainy
day, fund, from 5 percent of current revenues to 7.5 percent,
allowing reserves to grow from $950 million to a maximum of $1.42
billion. That item alone could cost $475 million.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the proposal would reduce unemployment insurance rates
by $116 million and add another $18 million for a workforce
development program.
</P>
<P>
   And the state tax code would be brought in line with the federal
tax code in several areas, including Roth and educational
Individual Retirement Accounts; and capital gains on the sale of a
principal residence.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not include Acting Governor Paul Cellucci's
proposal to lower the income tax from 5.95 to 5 percent, which
would cost more than $1.2 billion when fully phased in by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For a family of four earning $50,000 a year, Cellucci's plan
would save them $384, and a family of four earning $75,000 would
save $600; a single parent earning $30,000 a year would save $213;
and a single person earning $25,000 would save $198.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plan passed by the House Wednesday would save a
family of four $262 a year in personal exemptions when fully phased
in. A single parent would save $202, and a single filer would save
$131.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the gap between the two proposals, Citizens for
Limited Taxation and Treasurer Joseph D. Malone called on Cellucci
and other Republicans to reject the plan and hold out for a larger
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans joined the House Democrats in passing the
package 150-0. And Cellucci is expected to sign off on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperation is the name of the game,'' said Representative
David M. Peters, a Charlton Republican and minority leader. ``We
supported the tax cut based on its merits. Was it everything we
wanted? No. But we voted for it because we felt it was a good
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CelluccI had been scheduled to testify before the
Joint Committee on Taxation Wednesday during a hearing on his
income tax reduction plan. But the acting governor did not appear,
and the committee held his bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a disgrace,'' said the committee's Senate
chairman, Warren E. Tolman. ``This is a guy who, if I listen to my
TV, he's fighting hard for a tax cut. But when the bill is heard,
not only does he not show up, but he doesn't even send a
representative to debate and discuss this important public-policy
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Cellucci was in New Bedford announcing a grant for
the local jail. They said the Legislature did not notify his office
that the hearing was taking place.

 &HT;    GORE TO ANNOUNCE BLACK-ORIENTED LOAN PROGRAM
 &HT;    440&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reaching out to the African American community,
Vice President Al Gore will announce Thursday a new partnership
between the NAACP and the Small Business Administration as part of
a $1.4-billion loan initiative to assist black-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement, scheduled in a speech at the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People convention in
Atlanta, is an attempt to spur economic development in black
neighborhoods. The NAACP would help steer black applicants for
business loans to the SBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes that boosting the number of
loans in the African American community will strengthen the black
middle class, according a spokesperson for the SBA. While African
Americans represent 12.5 percent of the total population, they own
just 3.6 percent of all businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Clinton administration approved 1,810 loans to
African American businesses valued at $226 million. By comparison,
in 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, the SBA approved
709 loans to the African American community valued at $124 million.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership with the NAACP is only one part of Gore's
speech, which will have the theme of ``closing the opportunity gap
in America,'' according to a White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Building upon a speech he delivered earlier this year at the
Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, which has historic connections
to slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Gore is
expected to emphasize this theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all our progress, we know that too many never get into the
winner's circle of this new economy,'' Gore will say Thursday,
according to a prepared text of his remarks. ``I believe we must
use today's prosperity to expand that winner's circle _ by closing
the opportunity gap in our schools, by closing the opportunity gap
in our workplaces, and by building stronger families and
communities across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to address education by urging Congress to
support a program called the ``E-rate,'' which offers Internet
connections to public schools in impoverished areas at steep
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it: if we put computers and the Internet in every
classroom and school library in America, along with teachers who
are trained to use them, all of our children, from the poorest
inner-city schools to the most remote rural school districts, will
have access to the same vast store of knowledge,'' Gore's text
states. ``Some in Congress are trying to block the E-Rate. I
believe it is wrong to unplug our children's education.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech also serves to court African American voters as he
prepares to run for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists say that to win key Southern states such as
Georgia, Gore will need to energize African American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past seven months, Gore has announced a series of
programs on behalf of the White House that would directly benefit
minorities. They include expanding tax credits to encourage the
construction of low-income housing, encouraging U.S. automakers to
increase subcontracting to minority businesses, and new funds for
modernizing and building public schools in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Many African American leaders welcomed the news of the SBA loan
program, to which the NAACP would help steer black business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is very good news for the African American
community, but it's also good for the whole American community,
because it will create jobs and when you have jobs, you have less
discrimination,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is empowerment at its best,'' said Freman Hendrix, the
deputy mayor of Detroit, where 78 percent of the population is
black. ``This will absolutely touch the local economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, saw the new program as a case of spending money
to solve racial problems, which they say will only heighten
tensions between the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start throwing money at races of people, you turn
them into a special interest group,'' said Shelby Steele, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and author
of an upcoming book on race titled, ``The Dream Deferred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to throw money at white people to get them to
stop being racist?'' Steele asked. ``In the end you end up with
white resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   But that theory was quickly dismissed by those who have worked
with Gore on other initiatives aimed at tearing down the racial
barriers that still exist more than 30 years after the Civil Rights
Act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   As she canvassed the South with Gore following the fires of
black churches, the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, saw the way the vice president
was received and heard the promises that he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of soul,'' Campbell said. ``The black community
is very good at ferreting out those who don't keep their promises,
and he makes promises that people can hold onto.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the Sabiny people of eastern Uganda, 1998
is a circumcision year _ as are all even years _ when girls as well
as boys would normally be expected to endure a painful rite of
passage to young adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   But not this time, said G.W. Cheborian, chairman of the Sabiny
Elders Association, a council of clan leaders. While young men of
14 to about 22 will still take part in elaborate circumcision
ceremonies in December to mark their entry into manhood, for many
if not most girls and young women, there will be no genital
cutting.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years the Sabiny (pronounced sa-BEAN) people
have waged a campaign to abolish female genital mutilation and
replace it with a symbolic ritual declaring the girl a woman
without maiming her for life, Cheborian said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Cheborian received the 1998 United Nations Population
Award for the work that the Sabiny elders have done in their
remote, mountainous Kapchorwa region of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   His association shares it with Dr. Hugh Hastings Wynter of the
University of the West Indies in Jamaica, a leader in family
planning in the Caribbean. The award is judged by an international
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabiny Elders _ after first converting themselves from
proponents to opponents of female genital cutting _ attracted the
attention of health and population experts by finding their own way
to deal with a practice that is widely condemned by women's groups
and passionately defended by traditionalists in Africa, where it is
most prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   The elders' campaign is being studied by other Africans as an
example of how to deal with a culturally sensitive taboo within a
traditional society.
</P>
<P>
   Cheborian, who describes himself as ``about 71,'' said that even
among the Sabiny _ 130,000 people, according to Uganda's last
census in 1991 _ there were still those who clung to the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of our children are educated now,'' he said. ``The
girls say, `Father, this time I am not going to go along with your
idea.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago the Sabiny, a collection of rural clans engaged in
small-scale farming, were committed enough to the practice of
genital cutting that they made it a requirement. That put them in
conflict with the Ugandan government, which discourages the
practice. The tension only increased Sabiny tenacity on the
subject, Ugandans say.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1992, Sabiny chiefs formed the Elders Association and
began a systematic review of their traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason was to identify those which are values for
retaining, improve those which required improvement, so that they
are consistent with modern life,'' Cheborian said, speaking in
English. He said that those values that were no longer acceptable
were singled out to be ``discarded or abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, he said, the focus was on the genital
cutting of girls. But the elders met resistance and did not have
the necessary resources to wage an effective grass-roots campaign.
A few years ago the United Nations Population Fund stepped in with
some support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started in 1996, and we have been very active on the ground
for about two years now,'' Cheborian said. By the end of that year,
``it appeared that we had reduced the circumcision of girls by 36
percent,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a year that was studied because the practice was not
always limited to even years on girls, there were no reported
incidents. But most of the cases involving girls take place in even
years, the same as for boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is to tell parents about the harmful parts
of circumcising females,'' Cheborian said. ``This included the
pain, the very serious bleeding and fainting because of the
bleeding. Because of the open cuts, there is a risk of H.I.V.-AIDS
affecting the person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them that when that part which is cut forms a scar,
that reduces the opening of the passage, so later when a mother
wants to deliver, she finds a lot of labor problems. Sometimes it
calls for a doctor to operate. At times it delays a child to be
delivered out, and they die. Some children are born with their
heads in not quite good shape, and they remain very dull and cannot
make improvement in learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fathers and mothers alike ``have come to understand that it is
harmful,'' he said. ``Fathers are now on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabiny Elders Association has many other plans for enhancing
their people's cultural traditions, Cheborian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other aims are to write the Sabiny language so that
schoolchildren could be taught in that language and people could
read some issues in the local language,'' he said. The language
still does not have a written form and is in danger of extinction.
Another aim ``is to try as much as possible to research the local
herbs, the local medicine, to see if some can be more useful.''
</P>
<P>
   The association has introduced some welfare programs,
agricultural improvement campaigns and drives to educate people
about AIDS and H.I.V., the virus that causes it. The $25,000 prize
Cheborian received will help these projects.
</P>
<P>
   Before the award ceremony, he said he had some advice for others
in Africa who have defended the tradition of female genital
mutilation. ``I think the message I should give them is that those
societies which are having female circumcision _ we now call it
female genital cutting _ should also know that female genital
cutting is harmful,'' he said. ``Those are the facts that cannot
change. Doctors know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those societies which are still seeing circumcision should
come forward and be faithful to their children, not endanger them,
not put them into hardship. Cutting someone's body is a serious
problem.''

ADMINISTRATORS INCLUDED IN SKILLS TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Prospective teachers, whose widespread failure on
first-ever certification tests sparked a public and political
outcry this spring, will be joined by would-be principals and
administrators in testing rooms this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sept. 1, anyone applying to be administrators, guidance
counselors, psychologists, nurses, or school social workers will
face the same communications and literacy skills tests that sparked
such controversy for teacher candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Education made the decision June 22, but the
news was lost in the flap surrounding another controversial
decision that day: to lower test standards to allow many failing
teacher candidates to pass. That decision was later reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of criticism that teachers had little time to prepare
for their tests _ which were not originally intended to count in
April's first round of testing _ the board began spreading the word
this week to prospective administrators and support personnel.
Officials notified news organizations, education associations,
posted the information on the board's Web site, and even plan to
make public service announcements to get the news to educators well
before the first test on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure there was a lot of notice for this
one,'' said Alan Safran chief of staff for the Deparment of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Certification will be required for those applying after Sept. 1
and only for new candidates. Though teacher candidates also face
tests of their subject matter, the board said the certification
test will be required for administrators and support personnel,
whether or not a test is in place for their certificates by that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every prospective educator will have to satisfy the
requirements for communication and literacy skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board and department are committed to setting high
standards for all those involved in teaching our children,''
Education Commissioner David Driscoll said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators are unlikely to balk at being held to the same
standards as their staffs, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they understand that if we're going to hold teachers
to that standard, it would only be reasonable to hold
administrators to that standard also,'' said Peter Finn, executive
director of the Massachusetts Association of School
Superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   But Nadya Aswad Higgins, executive director for the
Massachusetts Elementary School Principals Association, said she
hopes the debate over the quality of education will not be obscured
by the politicized testing issue, which has become a touchstone for
controversy in a gubernatorial election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a problem in having someone pass a
literacy test,'' she said. ``But I do think too much of an emphasis
on it is undervaluing what it really takes to become an effective
principal,'' said Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains to be seen how professionals like social
workers will deal with mandatory literacy tests, Safran said the
board wants all professionals to be held to the same standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are school support personnel who have contact with kids
and contact with parents,'' he said. ``That communication has to be
articulate, clear and model excellent communications ability as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, only cafeteria and janitorial staff and substitute teachers
will be exempt from the testing, he said.

COMPAQ POSTS SECOND-QUARTER LOSS, OFFERS GLIMPSE OF FUTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional ending) 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Compaq Computer Corp.'s purchase of Digital Equipment
Corp. gave the Houston-based computer maker its first quarterly
loss since the dark days of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the earnings report issued Wednesday also offered an
intriguing glimpse into Compaq's future.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq posted a loss of $3.62 billion, or $2.35 a share, for the
second quarter of the year. That number almost matches the $3.63
billion charge related to the acquisition of Digital, which was
completed June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The company warned earlier this year that its second quarter
would be much like the first quarter, with profits and sales flat
due to deep price cuts necessary to move a glut of business
computers out of inventory.
</P>
<P>
   That warning proved accurate. However, before the Digital
charge, Compaq actually earned a small profit _ $32 million, or 2
cents a share, on sales of $5.8 billion. That compares to a profit
of $257 million, or 17 cents a share, on sales of $5.5 billion in
the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   But that small gain would not have happened without the
additional sales from owning Digital for just over two weeks.
Digital brought $1.1 billion to Compaq's coffers in that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Compaq Classic (Compaq without Digital) was a
disaster in this quarter,'' said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Piper
Jaffray in Minneapolis. ``The good news is that they can't do much
worse. They can only go up from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, disputed Kumar's
characterization, saying that Compaq had met its goals for the
second quarter and would concentrate in the third quarter on
integrating Digital into its operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neat part of that story is that, after we paid for Digital,
and took the Digital debt off the balance sheet, we still have $4.6
billion in cash, and that's significant,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Compaq has reduced the number of desktop, notebook and
file server computers sitting on the shelves of its resellers to
about 3 1/2 weeks of inventory, while the goal for the quarter was
four weeks. In order to accomplish that, Compaq shut down its
Houston factory for two weeks in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Kumar said his own checks of resellers show that inventory
of high-end file servers is closer to 10 weeks, and consumer
systems sold in retail stores is about five weeks. The server glut
is made up of systems that use older technology such as Intel
Corp.'s Pentium Pro processors, Kumar said, and thus is harder to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to take it,'' he said. ``You have companies like
Dell coming in and selling Pentium II servers at Pentium prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were not as glum.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Poyner of Oppenheimer in New York said Compaq has gotten the
worst of its inventory problems behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tactically, the focus is going to be on doing what they said
they'd do with the consolidation, putting the companies together,''
said Poyner. ``They're going to have to spend the quarter blocking
and tackling and getting everything done just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason has said Compaq will spend the current quarter working on
integration issues, and by the fourth quarter will begin to see
financial benefits. He held to those predictions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because Compaq executives said in advance that the company would
post a loss, investors weren't alarmed. Compaq's stock closed
Wednesday at 33 9/16, down 1/8, after being up on early trading.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first red ink in Compaq's history as a public
company. Compaq posted an 82 cent-a-share loss in the third quarter
of 1991, the year the company's financial situation imploded.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.63 billion Digital charge is made up of three components:
$3.2 billion to write off in-development technology, $291 million
for shutting down Compaq facilities and laying off Compaq workers
and $139 million for other ``operating adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Another $2 billion in charges has also been taken, but it was
rolled into the $9 billion price Compaq paid for Digital, a company
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq expects to lay off 17,000 people worldwide as a result of
the Digital merger, with 2,000 of them being from the ``Compaq
Classic'' work force. About 1,000 of those layoffs will take place
in Houston, though those have nothing to do with Digital. Those
layoffs are the result of Compaq's moving to a ``built-to-order''
system in its local factories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons Compaq bought Digital was for its $6
billion services and support operation. The figures released
Wednesday show that division already is having a significant impact
on Compaq's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of last year, Compaq's services business _
the installation, design and support of computer systems _ was just
$110 million. For the second quarter of this year, that number
jumped to $460 million, mostly due to the brief period that Compaq
owned Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Compaq expects to earn between $12 billion and $15
billion annually in service revenues after the turn of the century
as a result of the Digital purchase. At the time of the
acquisition, Digital's services arm was bringing in about $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that number has been flat for several years,'' said Kumar.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Compaq expects services to account for 20 percent of
its overall revenues. Poyner said those will be be high-profit
revenues, because the service business has margins averaging about
30 percent.

BOSTON UPS ALL-STAR GAME REVENUE ESTIMATE 
</HEADLINE>

 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Major League Baseball, tourism officials and Boston
city offficials sharply increased their prediction of how much
revenue the 1999 All-Star game will generate locally from $40
million to at least $50 million. They gathered Wednesday in Fenway
Park to unveil the trademark logos that licensees and sponsors will
begin using immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no greater place to have the last All-Star Game of
the 20th Century than at Fenway Park and in Boston,'' said Red Sox
vice president and general manager Daniel F. Duquette. ``The city
has had a loyal, continuing relationship with professional baseball
since 1871 (when the Boston Red Stockings debuted in the old
National Association of Professional Baseball Players).
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, we're all committed to putting together a great
show,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick B. Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the
Greater Boston Visitors &AMP; Convention Bureau, told The Globe before
the 1998 All-Star game at Coors Field in Denver last week that the
game in Boston would likely generate $40 million what is nominally
considered tourist spending _ hotels, restaurants, retail sales and
transportation. But Moscaritolo said that after talking with
officials of Major League Baseball, and especially after reviewing
early revenue returns from what is considered to have been a highly
successful week of events in Denver, he incresased the projection.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I try to be quite conservative with those sorts
of numbers,'' Moscaritolo said. ``But when we looked at some things
in Denver like a lot of people _ especially the media and the
networks _ staying in their hotels for a few days longer after the
game than we had considered, some extra transportation revenue we
had not realized, we decided we were really low-balling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino is clearly relishing the competition with
other cities, which have realized $28 million to $38.5 million in
tourist revenue during All-Star games from 1993 to 1997. Menino
touted a prediction of as high as $60 million to be generated for
the local tourism and hospitality industries next year in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity to be out in Denver recently for the
All-Star Game,'' Menino said. ``They haven't seen anything, yet.
We're going to have the best All-Star game, here in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino joined Dr. Gene Budig, president of the American League,
and other officials in unveiling the primary logo for the game,
which was mounted temporarily on the legendary left field wall at
Fenway Park. The logo, one of about three dozen marks for the 1999
game on which Major League Baseball has obtained trademarks, is
emblazoned with the words ``Boston All-Star Game '99'' on a broad
green background that is intended to suggest the beloved Green
Monster.
</P>
<P>
   The primary logo and the others will be omnipresent in the city
by June 1 of next year, but official licensees of products bearing
Major League Baseball's marks have already been produced and will
be on sale as early as today at some retailers and souvenir shops.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous companies in the Boston area and throughout New England
pay fees to use the registered marks, either as licensees or
sponsors of the game. That revenue is distributed among the two
major leagues and the 30 franchises, according to official of Major
League Baseball Properties, who refused to put a dollar figure on
that revenue.

 &HT;    DISASTER REINSURANCE POOL APPROVED BY HOUSE PANEL
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ States could receive federal insurance coverage for
a natural disaster such as a hurricane or catastrophic fire under a
bill passed by a House committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved 33-12 by the House Banking Committee, would
establish a federal insurance program to be administered by the
Treasury Department. The program would cover earthquakes, fires,
volcanoes and hurricanes that cause $2 billion in uninsured
damages, or damages from a storm so severe that it would take place
only once in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Iniki, which
devastated South Florida and Hawaii in 1992, and California's
Northridge earthquake in 1994, the bill is designed to protect
homeowners by providing backup insurance for state insurance pools.
These pools were developed after hard-hit companies dropped
coverage or refused to renew policies due to the enormous costs
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The states would pay a premium into the reinsurance fund to
cover catastrophic disasters. Federal money would be used only when
the loss exceed the money in the reinsurance fund. The federal
liability would be limited to $25 billion a year. The program would
be available to all states, but is expected to primarily help
Florida, California and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation responds to a growing dilemma experienced by
both consumers and the financial service sector. The impact of
insufficient capital to adequately address homeowners insurance
availability at affordable levels for the consumer when paying
premiums, the insurer when purchasing reinsurance to cover
significant losses and the lender attempting to protect its
collateral,'' said the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ FBI Director Louis Freeh forcefully warned Attorney
General Janet Reno that she was misreading the law by not seeking
an independent counsel to investigate campaign fund raising by the
Clinton administration, Sen. Fred Thompson told a Senate committee
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for
appointing an independent counsel,'' Freeh wrote in a memorandum,
Thompson said. The Republican Tennessee senator said he was briefed
on the memo in June by a senior FBI official.
</P>
<P>
   With Reno appearing as a witness before the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Wednesday, Thompson and others used the disagreement
between her and Freeh to press again for an outside investigation
of campaign finance practices involving White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although Freeh's rift with Reno over the appointment of a
special prosecutor had been publicly disclosed last winter,
Thompson angered Reno on Wednesday by confronting her with specific
language and details from Freeh's memo that had not been publicly
released. The Justice Department had repeatedly rebuffed requests
by Congress to release Freeh's memo, even going so far as to defy a
subpoena issued by a House committee investigating campaign
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's 22-page memorandum was written in November 1997.
Thompson, who was chairman of the Senate panel that had
investigated campaign finance abuses, characterized Freeh's memo as
a broad-based and unforgiving critique of the attorney general's
interpretation of the independent counsel law. The statute is
designed to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest when an
attorney general may have to investigate matters relating to the
president who appointed her or him.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, the senator said, ``pointed out that their investigation,
the FBI's investigation, had led them to the highest levels of the
White House, including the vice president and the president, and
therefore the Department of Justice must look at the Independent
Counsel Statute.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that FBI officials told him that Freeh's memo also
described Reno's decision not to seek an independent counsel as
starkly inconsistent with her actions in seeking to have
independent counsels named in other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Wednesday, Reno told Thompson that he was wrong
to reveal the contents of the memorandum. ``Our understanding was
that the briefing was supposed to be confidential,'' said Reno,
with a measure of anger.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he was briefed June 19 by FBI general counsel
Larry Parkinson and there had been no admonition to keep it
private. Reno rebuffed any notion that she was trying to shield
President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore from a criminal
investigation over fund-raising telephone calls they made in the
1996 election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As she had in the past, Reno defended her need to keep
confidential discussions among law enforcement officials whose
opinions she relied on. And she again defended her decision to
leave the campaign finance investigation in the hands of officials
in the Justice Department she heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one that you confirmed as attorney general,'' she
testified. ``I've got to make the legal decisions. I've got to be
able to rely on the people within the Justice Department to give me
full, honest opinions, and to discuss those and to have those
discussed when the decision has to be mine and I need to rely on
good, honest give and take where they pull no punches and tell me
what they think because I've got people giving me all sorts of
opinions and I want to continue that, because that's the type of
Justice Department that I have operated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line for me is, I'm going to call it like I see
it, based on the evidence and the law.'' Reno also noted that her
Department had indicted 11 people in the campaign finance
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., complained that the department had
charged the donors, but none of the recipients in the White House
or the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's appearance before the Judiciary Committee was supposed to
be aimed at general oversight of the Justice Department and she
spoke about more routine matters in a long opening statement. She
finished her prepared remarks by talking about recent funerals she
had attended of Border Patrol agents and how those officers
represented the best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But that was quickly brushed aside as the hearing room became a
partisan free-fire zone, turning to the issue of Reno's judgment
not to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate the President and his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's appearances before the committee have taken on the
characteristics of a ritual with each side playing by-now familiar
roles. She remains stolid, or as her critics would say, stubborn,
in her refusal to engage, deflecting questions with well-practiced
answers. Republican senators become exasperated and impatient while
Democratic senators rush to praise her performance in office.
</P>
<P>
   But her practiced composure appeared to have been pierced
momentarily Wednesday in a colloquy with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a relentless if
courteous critic of her decision not to appoint an independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno told Hatch that her decisions were based solely on the law.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch retorted: ``Then I am calling on you to do the right thing
based on the law.'' Reno responded, ``Anybody who says I'm
protecting anybody ought to listen to the criticism I get when I
name independent counsels.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno then adopted an uncharacteristically meek tone and told
Hatch: ``You don't have to be so fierce with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that the Freeh memorandum had seven sections, all
disagreeing with Reno's conclusions. He said that Freeh noted that
the independent counsel law has two sections, one which requires
the appointment of an independent counsel when there is credible
evidence that a senior official may have committed a crime and an
optional section where the Attorney General feels there is a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate conclusion by Mr. Freeh is that the statute
should be triggered under both the mandatory and discretionary
provisions of the statute,'' the senator said.

SENATE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL HEALTH CARE PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clearly worried that health care may be high on
voters minds in November elections, Senate Republicans on Thursday
unveiled a plan aimed at giving consumers of some managed care
plans more rights to medical service and greater ability to appeal
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Key elements of the proposal would allow some patients to appeal
medical decisions to outside experts, to use emergency rooms
without always getting permission from insurers and expand Medical
Savings Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately pounced on the plan, arguing that it only
offered modest protections to a minority of those enrolled in
managed-care plans and did not give patients the right to sue their
Health Maintenance Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disappointment. We were hoping they would come up
with something more real than this,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who hosted a forum where several medical
people who had bad experiences with HMOs testified.
</P>
<P>
   The health care issue is expected to dominate the congressional
agenda over the next several weeks. Prodded by pollsters telling
them that voters are upset about their managed-care plans, House
GOP leaders have drafted legislation similar to the one proposed by
the Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has also made the issue a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday he talked with patients about their negative
experiences with HMOs at a forum sponsored by the American Medical
Association. The president on Thursday is expected to attend a
rally with Democrats on Capitol Hill to exhort Congress to address
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The president last fall proposed his own patient bill of rights,
but he has endorsed Democratic congressional proposals that are
more far-reaching than the Republican plans, giving people more
access to specialists and allowing them to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton refrained from attacking the Senate plan,
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala dismissed the
GOP blueprint as ``too little, too late.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the offer of any bill represents a major turnaround for
conservatives such as Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla., who earlier this year had vowed to oppose any
government mandates regarding health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday both Nickles and Gramm stood with a number of more
moderate Republican colleagues promoting the bill they expect to
vote on before Congress leaves for summer recess in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in political games. We're interested in
quality health care,'' said Nickles, the Senate majority whip who
presided over the health care task force.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate GOP plan would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Give consumers of employer-sponsored health-care plans the
right to appeal medical decisions both within the HMOs and to
outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow consumers of self-insured employer-sponsored plans the
ability to use emergency rooms without always getting permission
from their providers and to see gynecologists without getting a
referral from their health plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give consumers of employer-sponsored, self-insured health
plans the ability to pick their own doctors if their employer has
more than 50 workers and offers only one HMO plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prevent health insurance plans from using genetic information
to deny patients coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expand Medical Savings Accounts and tax breaks for those who
are self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the Senate GOP plan does far less and covers far
fewer people than advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the provisions only apply to the 48 million consumers
who are enrolled in health plans self-insured by their employers.
They represent less than a third of the 170 million Americans in
employer-sponsored health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said they restricted regulations to plans that
cannot be regulated by states.
</P>
<P>
   The external appeals process in the GOP plan would also be
limited. Only those who had been denied medically necessary
procedures costing over $1,000 or who needed experimental
procedures could use the system.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been questions about the impartiality of the
outside appeals, since the medical expert who would hear the case
would be appointed and paid for by the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the arbitrator could not have a financial interest in
the health plan or hospital involved in the procedures, critics
said that person could not be truly independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the fox is guarding the henhouse,'' said Kim Ross,
legislative director for the Texas Medical Association, which along
with the AMA and other doctors' groups around the country are
opposing the Republican plans.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, complaints against HMOS are currently heard by doctors
appointed by the state Insurance Board.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas doctors are particularly disturbed that the Republican
plans do not give patients in employer-sponsored health-care plans
the right to sue for punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Texas Legislature in 1997 approved giving consumers
the right to sue their HMOs, that law is being challenged in
federal court in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that such lawsuits would drive up health
insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great boom for trial lawyers,'' said Nickles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say that the ability to sue is the only way to hold
the plans accountable. And as evidence that the provision would not
be abused, they point to the fact that since the Texas law was
passed in 1997 there have been no lawsuits against HMOs in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are also likely to clash on the issue
of Medical Savings Accounts, which allow workers to bank their own
money and funds contributed by their employers in tax-free accounts
intended to pay for medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the government is overseeing an experimental program
that restricts these accounts to 700,000 individuals who work for
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans want to greatly expand the MSAs, while
Democrats claim that the program siphons off wealthy and healthy
people from the insurance pool, making it more expensive to pay for
those left in conventional plans.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions creating more savings accounts and allowing the
self-employed to deduct health insurance expenses would cost
federal government $11 billion over 10 years. Republicans conceded
they had not figured out how to pay for those tax breaks.

SENATE REPUBLICANS INTRODUCE THEIR OWN BILL TO PROTECT PATIENTS'
RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans proposed legislation to protect
patients' rights on Wednesday, joining the battle with Democrats
and the American Medical Association who have sought much more
sweeping protections, including the right to sue managed care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan, to be followed Thursday by a bill from House
GOP leaders, seeks to give patients a greater choice of doctors and
provide tax breaks to make insurance more affordable. But the
Democratic plan would cover 150 million people; most of the GOP's
patients' protection provisions would affect only one third as
many.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said he plans
to bring the measure, which is still being written and finalized,
to the floor before Congress leaves for vacation the first week of
August. But prospects for either the Democratic or Republican plans
remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not really interested in political games, we are
interested in serious quality health care,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,
the second-ranking Republican and chief architect of the bill.
``Some of the other proposals, particularly the Democratic
alternative, is well-intended, but the net result would be that it
would greatly increase costs, reduce access, and frankly, it would
increase the bureaucracy and the regulations by unbelievable leaps
and bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats reacted swiftly and forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of health and human services, Donna Shalala,
called the Republican plan ``too little, too late,'' but added that
she hoped the two sides could compromise on a bipartisan bill. And
Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who helped draft the
Democratic bill, called it ``Gingrich lite,'' deriding it as even
weaker than the version House Speaker Newt Gingrich described last
month.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, at a round table discussion on Thursday at
the offices of the American Medical Association here, listened to
the heart-wrenching stories of patients and doctors who described
their personal run-ins with health maintenance organizations and
pressed Congress to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is about even more than health care; this is
about how people feel about America,'' Clinton said. ``These
stories are not the kind of stories any American of conscience
would ever want to be told in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance and HMO groups did not waver in their opposition to
all the managed care bills, including Thursday's proposal by Senate
Republicans. But they said they liked the ``new approach'' of
limiting most of the protections to patients covered by companies
that insure themselves. The Senate GOP proposal generally does not
affect patients whose employers buy coverage from regular health
insurance companies, which for decades have been regulated by the
states.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, most provisions of the Senate GOP plan would
affect 48 million Americans. The broader provisions of the
Democratic bill could cover 150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of compliance and and costs alone, it's
attractive,'' said Bill Gradison, the president of the Health
Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican announcement comes just as Democrats are
ratcheting up the pressure to overhaul managed care plans in
Congress and on the campaign trail. In a rather lackluster election
year, managed care has emerged as one of the more tantalizing
issues before the November elections, and Democrats have seized it
to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying by special-interest groups, including the American
Medical Association and insurance organizations, has been intense
since early this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO announced it would launch a nationwide
radio and television advertising campaign backing the Democratic
bill. ``Insurance companies and HMOs are turning health care into
big business,'' one of the labor federation's flyers claimed.
``They get the profits _ and too often we get stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   For months Senate and House Republicans tried to sidestep the
issue of regulating managed care, which is unpopular with business
and insurance groups. But they found the issue was too popular and
politically perilous to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans organized a task force early this year to
begin studying the issue, but maintained there would likely be no
bill this year. That changed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to steal the Democrats' thunder, the Senate Republicans
virtually adopted the Democratic bill's title for their own. The
GOP measure is called ``The Patient Bill of Rights.'' The
Democratic bill is called ``The Patients' Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Democratic bill, sponsored by Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan,
would drive up costs and the number of uninsured, as well as lead
to unnecessary regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican proposal, which was released as an
outline, shares some common ground with the Democratic bill. Both
bills require that patients be allowed to see a doctor outside an
HMO without paying the entire cost and see that health plans pay
for urgent emergency room care.
</P>
<P>
   They also stipulate that pregnant women and terminally ill
patients can continue seeing their doctor, at least temporarily,
even if that doctor leaves the health plan, and they would permit
unfettered communication about care between patients and
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike the Democratic bill, those protections would apply
only to employees in self-insured plans. Republicans argue that
state laws already protect the other 100 million consumers, but
Democrats maintain that state laws are not uniform on protections
and patchy at best. And the Republican plan only permits direct
access to only permits direct access to three types of specialists:
obstetricians. gynecologists and pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than open the process up to lawsuits, the Senate
Republican plan would allow all privately insured consumers to
challenge the denial of medical services by filing appeals, first
internally, and then with an independent reviewer selected by the
managed care company. The decision by an outside reviewer would be
binding and would apply only to procedures that cost more than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot sue your way to better health care
quality,'' said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a member of the GOP
task force.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to conservatives, the Senate plan also includes several
new tax breaks. It would greatly expand medical savings accounts,
special tax-free accounts for medical care that are now available
on a limited basis. Democrats steadfastly oppose the savings
accounts, saying they will lead to inferior health care and are
designed for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal also allows self-employed people to
deduct the full cost of their health insurance starting next year.
Sen. William Roth of Delaware, the chairman of the Finance
Committee, said the taxbreaks would be paid for in a
``noncontroversial manner.''

JUDGE REFUSES TO BLOCK MEASURE ENDING BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN
CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge refused Wednesday to block
implementation of the statewide ballot measure that ended most
bilingual education programs in the California public schools,
clearing the way for the new policy to be carried out when classes
start in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proposition 227 may go into effect, of course subject to
review of my decision by a higher court,'' said Judge Charles Legge
of U.S. District Court in San Francisco, referring to the ballot
proposal that passed by 61 percent to 39 percent last month. The
measure calls for a radical overhaul of how schools teach students
with limited English proficiency, essentially ending dual-language
instruction in favor of one year of English immersion before
students are shifted into regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of civil rights and education groups filed suit the
day after the June 2 election, seeking to block the measure as
discriminatory. In his ruling Wednesday, Legge said he could not
discern ``any intentional racial or national-origin discrimination
against any particular group'' in the measure, and declined to
grant a preliminary injunction blocking it.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mark Savage, said they planned an
immediate appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in an
effort to obtain a decision before the new school year starts,
though he acknowledged that he was not sure that would be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to get up to the 9th Circuit as quickly as
possible,'' Savage said, adding that a subsequent court challenge
may have to be filed, based on the measure's actual effect on
children once it is in operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent years, it has become commonplace in California for
ballot measures to be tied up in court for months or years after
their passage before taking effect. But it now seems all but
certain that Proposition 227 will be put into effect in districts
around the state even as court challenges continue.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the California State Board of Education adopted
regulations specifying that the measure should take effect in the
coming school year, rebuffing the arguments of some education
groups and school districts, including the Los Angeles Unified
School District, the state's largest, that fine print in the
measure allowed schools operating year round to wait until next
year before switching over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take on it at this time is that the way is cleared for
complete implementation of 227 and all its provisions,'' said Frank
Stephens, a spokesman for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which was
chosen to represent the state Board of Education in the lawsuit
after the state attorney general, Dan Lungren, recused himself
because he had opposed the ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens noted that various teacher groups and school districts
around the state have vowed to defy the new policy, and he added,
``We'll have to wait and see if that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles District _ where nearly half of the 681,000
students are classified as limited English-proficient, and nearly
half of those were in bilingual classes last year _ had contended
that it would be impossible to implement the needed administrative
changes in time for the new school year, and it had pinned its
hopes on the Federal court to block the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the ballot measure, Ron Unz, a multimillionaire
software entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, said in a telephone
interview that Wednesday's decision was ``a tremendous victory for
the people of California, for the voters who showed overwhelming
support for the measure and especially for the hundreds of
thousands of immigrant children who will at last be taught English
when the school year begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure allows exceptions to the new policy under limited
circumstances when parents request waivers for their children, and
if students are not proficient in English after a year of immersion
classes, they can enroll for another year. But even if parents
obtain a waiver to place their children in alternative programs
like bilingual classes, instruction must still be in English for
the first 30 days of the school year.

TIME WARNER SURPRISES WALL STREET WITH STRONG QUARTERLY PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Time Warner Inc., completing the
transformation from Wall Street dog to darling, has reported
quarterly profits more than tripled over the 1997 period. Shares of
the company set their third consecutive high.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest media-entertainment concern posted
second-quarter results Wednesday that came in far above Wall Street
estimates thanks to record profits in cable, magazines and the
Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and TV operations.` `This is a
blow-out quarter,'' said analyst Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King
Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Time Warner, viewed with disdain as little as two
years ago when it was completing the acquisition of Turner
Broadcasting System, jumped 1.875 to 93.125 and at one time touched
96.50.
</P>
<P>
   The issue had gained 4.25 in the previous two session on
bullishness about the company's outlook and is now up better than
60 percent since mid-January. It has more than doubled in value
over the past year from 45.375.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price gains represent a massive attitude change for
Wall Streeters, who spent years deriding Chairman Gerald Levin over
the stock's poor performance following the 1989 merger that created
Time Warner and the $7 billion TBS deal. As little as two years
ago, many investors hoped the board would oust Levin in favor of
Vice Chairman Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Time Warner has become one of the engines driving the
bull market's rally. ``You now have a company that's running on all
cylinders,'' Hyman said. ``TBS has been a great acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of 1998, New York-based Time Warner earned
$101 million, or 4 cents a diluted share, compared with 1997
quarterly profits of $30 million, which equaled a loss of 9 cents a
share. Analysts had expected a loss of 4 cents a share this
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 10 percent to $6.53 billion and cash flow, a key
Wall Street indicator for entertainment companies with large debt
loads, rose 17 percent to $1.16 billion. Levin has forecast annual
cash flow gains of 16 percent to 17 percent over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well on our way to another record-breaking year,''
Levin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operations set records in all three sectors. The TBS
channels, including TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network and CNN, posted a 20
percent gain in cash flow to $198 million; HBO cash flow rose 15
percent to $113 million; and cable systems, which have 11.9 million
customers, jumped 29 percent to $448 million with asset sales
adding $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing cash flow rose 12 percent to $176 million due to
advertising gains at Fortune, In Style and People, and improved
circulation at People, Time and Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. cash flow gained 12 percent to $122 million due to
higher TV production and distribution revenue from shows such as
``ER'' and ``Friends'' and solid box-office returns from ``City of
Angels'' and ``A Perfect Murder.'' TBS Filmed Entertainment rose 31
percent from syndication of Castle Rock's ``Seinfeld'' and New
Line's release of ``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are solid results all around,'' said analyst Harold
Vogel of Cowen &AMP; Co. ``All their problem areas seem to be turning
around. The strategies that Levin and Turner have implemented seem
to be working quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   The only second-quarter laggards were Warner Music Group, with
cash flow down 9.4 percent to $96 million due to poor results from
direct-marketing such as Columbia House, and the WB Network with a
$23 million quarterly loss. Analyst Jill Krutick of Salomon Smith
Barney said the music business, which includes recording artists
Madonna and Eric Clapton, is showing signs of a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has sliced $2 billion in debt during the past two
years through moves such as selling off its stake in Six Flags
theme parks and has pledged to further reduce the load from the
current $16.4 billion. It also plans to cut $700 million in
operating costs by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Duff &AMP; Phelps, Fitch and Moody's Investors Service have upgraded
their debt ratings this year. Time Warner finished in the black
last year for the first time since 1992, earning $246 million due
to cost cutting, TBS properties and ad gains from the strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne, formerly named U S West Media, owns 25 percent of Time
Warner's entertainment properties.
</P>
<P>
   In a development that may foreshadow the merging of cable and
phone service, Levin disclosed Wednesday that Time Warner has
discussed leasing cable lines to long-distance phone companies such
as AT&AMP;T Corp. to provide loval service. AT&AMP;T agreed last month to
buy cable operator Tele-Communications Inc., which has 10 million
subscribers.

JUDGE ASKS GM AND UAW TO SET ARBITRATION DATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ A federal judge on Wednesday asked General Motors
and the United Automobile Workers to schedule a date for the
arbitration of strikes at two auto parts factories here as top
negotiators from the automaker and union talked face to face for
the first time in three days.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Paul Gadola Jr. did not grant GM's request for an order
that arbitration begin immediately. But he urged both sides to
agree by Tuesday on a date to meet with an arbiter, Robert Thomas.
GM and the UAW said they would comply.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides said they were satisfied with the decision, it
still amounted to a small victory for GM, which has suffered
heavily from the strikes, which began on June 6 and have shut down
26 of the automaker's 29 assembly lines in North America.
</P>
<P>
   GM had accused the union of stalling on any arbitration, and
while the union had denied this, union officials had said as
recently as Tuesday that they saw no need to speed up the
arbitration process. GM wants the arbiter to rule on whether the
walkouts here are local strikes, which are allowed under GM's labor
contract, or a national strike, which is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said
the arbitration process would slow a settlement here. Some UAW
officials involved in talks with GM at factories outside Flint are
now needed to prepare for arbitration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM has said that before any deal can be reached in Flint, the
union must withdraw threats to strike at parts factories in
Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jaworski, a GM lawyer who represented the company in
federal court in Flint on Wednesday, said GM thought that the
issues in the strike needed to be settled by negotiations but also
wanted arbitration. Once the two sides meet with an arbiter, it
could take as little as a week for Thomas to reach a ruling, labor
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Gadola did not rule on GM's contention that the strikes here
represent a national walkout. But he made a point of denying the
suggestion of some labor experts that no court in Michigan would be
willing to become involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, that's not the view of this court,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By an extraordinary coincidence of the sort that sometimes
happens in auto factory towns, Gadola is the son of the judge who
presided during the only other time GM and the UAW have confronted
each other in court during a strike.
</P>
<P>
   When UAW workers occupied Flint factories in late 1936 and
demanded that GM recognize the union, Paul Gadola Sr. declared the
strike illegal on Feb. 2, 1937, and ordered the strikers arrested
for contempt when they refused to leave the factory.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard was sent to Flint, but the strikers left the
factory peacefully after GM said it would bargain with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North American
personnel, returned to Flint on Wednesday morning to resume
bargaining with Shoemaker. The two had lunch in the restaurant of
the same Holiday Inn where they had negotiated for two weeks until
Sunday, when Knechtel returned to Detroit for lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker said Wednesday evening that little progress had been
made at any of the sites where the union and GM are bargaining.
Knechtel declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives have taken an unusually strong stand during the
walkouts at the parts factories in Flint, citing a need to reduce
costs sharply to become more competitive. An annual report
Wednesday from Harbour and Associates Inc., the best-known
manufacturing consulting firm in the auto industry, found that
while GM had improved considerably, it still had a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   GM needs an average of 30.32 hours of labor to make each
vehicle, compared with 32.15 hours at Chrysler Corp. but just 22.85
hours at Ford Motor Co., according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign automakers' factories in the United States were the most
efficient, with Nissan requiring only 17.07 hours for each vehicle,
although its cars and trucks tend to be fairly small and easier to
assemble.
</P>
<P>
   The Harbour report found GM had greatly improved productivity in
stamping metal auto parts, a central issue here, but that the
automaker still lagged behind competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Further trouble for GM was developing Wednesday in Spring Hill,
Tenn., as workers at its enormous Saturn factory began preparing
for the first strike vote since production began there 12 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of GM's 29 assembly plants in North America, the Saturn factory
is one of only three still producing cars; the other two are in
Oshawa, Ontario, and Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, while a fourth assembly
plant in Pontiac, Mich., is preparing for pickup truck production.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bennett, the UAW's chairman, said the Saturn factory
produced more of its own parts than other assembly plants and had
found outside suppliers for the half-dozen small parts for each car
that it usually receives from the struck factories in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the strike vote is mostly coincidental with the
showdown here, he said; Saturn workers have been growing angry for
months at recent moves by GM to begin buying car doors, dashboards
and exterior body panels from outside vendors instead of producing
them in Spring Hill. &QL;

CALABASAS A GATEWAY TO BREATHTAKING RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPANGA, Calif. _ I ran into an old friend the other day while
out riding. Well, actually, I ran over an old friend. No injuries
occurred. In fact, I almost had to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The old friend, you see, was a trail I hadn't ridden in at least
eight years, maybe longer. Having once lived in Calabasas
Highlands, and having once possessed a much greater tolerance for
pain, Red Rock Canyon and Calabasas Peak Motorway were my local
training grounds.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, I was reminded why only those with lungs and
legs of steel need bother attempting the enormously trying pitches
and the nearly 1,200-foot increase in elevation that this 7.2-mile
loop route encompassing the two landmarks presents. Ardor will be
rewarded, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty steep in both directions _ to and from the
summit,'' said Jim Hasenauer of Woodland Hills, a professor of
Communication Studies at Cal State Northridge and a board member
for the International Mountain Bicycling Association. ``But it's
well worth it for the views you get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the trail is a little loose from fire-road
grading, a ride up Red Rock is always spectacular. Especially now
since there are still wildflowers blooming.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll know why it is called Red Rock Canyon as soon as you see
the ruddy sandstone that forms the distinctively un-Southern
Californian landscape that was home to a Boy Scout camp until the
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy purchased the property in the
early 1980s. There are several short hiking trails and a variety of
interesting rock formations to explore.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon holds additional significance for mountain bikers. It
was the site of a groundbreaking Conservancy meeting in 1987 that
would lead to the creation of the Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists
Association (CORBA). Policy toward biking in the Santa Monicas
changed considerably following the meeting, with the mountains'
management agencies recognizing the majority of the mountain bike
community as responsible and concerned users of the public
backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   The loop has several access points. Yet to really appreciate the
ride, you should start at Old Topanga Canyon and Red Rock roads
(elevation: 980 feet). This way, you're only a short distance from
the spectacular rock formations that parallel a fire road early in
the ride. Likewise, if the route proves too strenuous, you have a
reasonable ways to return.
</P>
<P>
   The ride in to Red Rock Canyon and its like-named park is like a
step back in time. Older homes that are barely winning the war
against the elements line the narrow canyon and tall oak canopy
which hides a community of reclusive artists and aging hippies. The
pavement turns to dirt after only about a half-mile, and riders are
quickly funneled into an even narrower canyon with steep sandstone
walls and the distinctive red rock that gives the canyon its name.
Just a few yards ahead is the park, with water but no restroom
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Once past the caretaker's house and ``barn,'' visitors will
begin climbing a steep, loose fire road. Take it easy; there's
plenty more where this comes from. At about two miles in, the fire
road intersects with Calabasas Peak Motorway (1,520 feet), another
fire road. Turn right and begin climbing _ and climbing _ to
2,163-foot Calabasas Peak.
</P>
<P>
   It's but a mile to the peak, but a couple of the pitches are
seemingly straight up. After only about a quarter-mile cyclists
will spy the angular striations of out-croppings known as Fossil
Rocks. Hawks, crows and turkey vultures lazily circle the rocks
that house caves many of the raptors call home.
</P>
<P>
   Once Calabasas Peak is crested at the 3-mile mark, it offers one
of the most impressive views in the Santa Monicas. Stretching to
the east is Topanga Canyon. To the southeast, the Santa Monica Bay
and Palos Verdes Peninsula. And to the west, a majestic panorama of
mountains with Mulholland Highway splitting the rolling hills.
</P>
<P>
   Continue the loop by pedaling north along the motorway. There is
a series of short ups and downs before making the final descent to
Old Topanga Canyon Road (1,500 feet) at 4.9 miles into the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Here the fun really begins. The twists and turns of Old Topanga
might be tricky for autos, but for a bike it's like a free ride on
``Colossus.'' The 2.3 miles and a more than 500-foot drop back to
the intersection of Old Topanga Canyon and Red Rock roads is over
all too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know how to use your gears and you think a fun
downhill is the just reward for a tough climb, this loop has a lot
to offer,'' Hasenauer said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though you've gone just more than seven miles when the
end approaches, your legs, heart and lungs will tell you it seemed
like a whole lot more.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Pedal on:!off! Solo riders in the 16th consecutive Ensure
Race Across America will blast off from the Irvine Holiday Inn
Select on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately eight days and 2,900 miles later, the male and
female winners will pull in to Savannah, Ga., and will be awarded
with $10,000 each for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Relay teams leave July 26 and include Team 70+, which counts
among its members 75-year-old Joe Walker of Encino, competing in
his third RAAM and going for his second consecutive successful
transcontinental crossing. For more race information, call (949)
474-7226.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOING
</P>
<P>
   What to consider when tackling the Red Rock Canyon-Calabasas
Peak mountain-biking loop:
</P>
<P>
   Length: 7.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Elevation gain: About 1,180 feet.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Riding time: 2 hours at a moderate pace; slower cyclists
should allow longer.
</P>
<P>
   Terrain: About 4.4 miles of fire road, 2.8 miles of pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Best map: Tom Harrison Cartography's ``Trail Map of the Santa
Monica Mountains Central.''
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Drive south on Topanga Canyon Boulevard
(Highway 27) to the town of Topanga. Turn right on Old Topanga
Canyon Road. Park near the intersection of Red Rock Road, where
space is limited. Proceed by bike on Red Rock Road.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tote their bicycles on four-wheel drive vehicles may
consider parking at Red Rock Canyon Park at the terminus of its
namesake road. However, the road remains in major disrepair
following winter storms.

HOUSTON POLICE OFFICERS MAY FACE CHARGES IN BOTCHED DRUG RAID 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston police officers involved in a botched drug
raid that left a 23-year-old man shot to death earlier this week
could face criminal charges, sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief C.O. ``Brad'' Bradford said a preliminary
investigation ``raised serious concerns'' about how the officers
conducted the raid in which Pedro Oregon was killed. An officer was
wounded by friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was disturbed by questions surrounding the incident,
Bradford added there were indications of ``serious departmental
violations, even violations of the law.``
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, family and friends of Oregon agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother wasn't a criminal,'' Oregon's sister Susana, 19,
said in his modest apartment, strewn with his soccer trophies,
photographs, religious verses and bullet holes. ``He was a
landscaper. He did a lot of planting and working on yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Oregon left a widow and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, assigned to the gang task force at HPD's Southwest
Patrol Division, told investigators they entered Oregon's apartment
about 1:30 a.m. after their confidential informant witnessed a drug
transaction inside.
</P>
<P>
   No narcotics were found in the apartment, and Susana Oregon said
her brother was not involved with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about a police informant who was here,''
she said. ``That's just what they all say, but I don't think it's
true.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers said several people were inside the apartment when
they entered, and that Oregon ran into a bedroom and locked the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two people were here, the victim and a witness,'' said
Kevin Painter, a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified witness told Oregon's family that police were
yelling for someone named Julio when they entered the apartment. No
one named Julio lives there, Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers just got really excited,'' he said. ``The witness
heard `bang, bang,' a kick, and then `bang, bang, bang, bang,
bang.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The police shot the lock and then kicked open the door. If the
kids had been sleeping in the bed, they would have been killed with
the first two shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers who broke into the bedroom said they opened fire
after Oregon pointed a pistol at them. More than 30 shots were
fired in the small space, sources said. Several shots hit Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Lamont E. Tillery, 30, was shot in the shoulder, but his
bulletproof vest prevented serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ballistics tests determined that Tillery was shot by a fellow
officer. A weapon was recovered from Oregon's bedroom, but no
investigator would say Wednesday if it had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   One source, asked what the raiding officers had done wrong,
said, ``It would be easier to ask what they did right _ the answer
is, not much.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers carried neither a search nor an arrest warrant,
that source said.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential informant the officers were using was not
registered with HPD, as now required of all informants, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said there is also a question about whether the
informant fit the department's criteria to qualify as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   The number of officers firing weapons in such a small space, the
number of shots fired, ``goes into the equation as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police may have been looking for Oregon's brother, who does
belong to a gang, Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also wondered if Oregon or his brother had been ``set up'' by
a gang member.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is one informant from another gang to pretend to
be an informant for the police,'' Painter said. ``To tell police,
`yeah, I'll help you out,' and these stupid gang officers believe
everything the stupid informant is telling them and the informant
is really just using the police to get revenge.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The involved officers, relieved of duty with pay pending the
outcome of the investigations, are Tillery, a two-year veteran;
David R. Barrera, 28, a five-year veteran; Pete A. Herrada, 28, a
three-year veteran; David Perkins, 30, a four-year veteran; James
R. Willis, 28, a five-year veteran, and Sgt. Darrell H. Strouse,
34, with HPD for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are two investigations. One, being conducted by HPD's
internal affairs division, will determine whether the officers
violated department policies regarding use of confidential
informants.
</P>
<P>
   The other, being conducted by homicide investigators and the
Harris County District Attorney's civil rights division, will
determine whether any officer faces criminal charges in Oregon's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence will probably go to a grand jury when the investigation
is complete, officials said.

   The officers carried neither a search nor an arrest warrant,
that source said.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential informant the officers were using was not
registered with HPD, as now required of all informants, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said there is also a question about whether the
informant fit the department's criteria to qualify as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   The number of officers firing weapons in such a small space, the
number of shots fired, ``goes into the equation as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police may have been looking for Oregon's brother, who does
belong to a gang, Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also wondered if Oregon or his brother had been ``set up'' by
a gang member.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is one informant from another gang to pretend to
be an informant for the police,'' Painter said. ``To tell police,
`yeah, I'll help you out,' and these stupid gang officers believe
everything the stupid informant is telling them and the informant
is really just using the police to get revenge.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The involved officers, relieved of duty with pay pending the
outcome of the investigations, are Tillery, a two-year veteran;
David R. Barrera, 28, a five-year veteran; Pete A. Herrada, 28, a
three-year veteran; David Perkins, 30, a four-year veteran; James
R. Willis, 28, a five-year veteran, and Sgt. Darrell H. Strouse,
34, with HPD for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are two investigations. One, being conducted by HPD's
internal affairs division, will determine whether the officers
violated department policies regarding use of confidential
informants.
</P>
<P>
   The other, being conducted by homicide investigators and the
Harris County District Attorney's civil rights division, will
determine whether any officer faces criminal charges in Oregon's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence will probably go to a grand jury when the investigation
is complete, officials said.

TROUT CACHE IN WATERS OF LEE VINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEE VINING, Calif. _ From the time the first snowplow clears the
road over Tioga Pass into Yosemite National Park each summer,
straight through to the Oct. 31 close of trout season, anglers
hammer Saddlebag, Tioga and Ellery lakes and Lee Vining Creek on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Each of the waters has strong populations
of wild brown, rainbow and brook trout, and bi-weekly plants of
catchable trout are made by the Department of Fish and Game to
ensure the fishery remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you come to the Eastern Sierra for solace and a
pristine mountain experience, that isn't what you'll likely find at
these intensely popular roadside jumping-off spots.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that solitude is just a short walk away, at
Fantail Lake _ a backcountry brook-trout nirvana that is accessible
to anyone willing to carry their gear on their backs for 1{ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Department of Fish and Game biologist Phil Pister used
to say that the limit on brook trout at Fantail Lake and the
surrounding area should be ``all you could carry'' because of their
propensity to overpopulation in these high-elevation lakes.
</P>
<P>
   At his prodding, under a special bonus limit, 10 brook trout
measuring less than eight inches could be kept in addition to the
regular five-fish limit. That means anglers can keep 15 brookies
per day, and 15 would just about make a decent meal for a hungry
fisherman who's made the walk into the Mine Creek drainage that is
home to Fantail Lake.
</P>
<P>
   (As of March 1, the size maximum was raised to 10 inches; the
brook trout special bonus limit applies to the entire Sierra
Fishing District.)
</P>
<P>
   The trailhead to Mine Creek, the former mining site of
Bennettville and Fantail Lake, is found at Tioga Junction
Campground off Highway 120, about three miles north of Tioga Pass
and the eastern boundary of Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Lee Vining note that Highway 120 and the trail to
Fantail Lake are free of snow but that the lake is ``about 97{
percent iced over.'' But things change quickly in the Sierra
Nevada, and it could break open anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes up the trail to Bennettville, visitors will be in
quiet forest and away from the bustle of the roads and campground.
Once the restored site of Bennettville at about the
three-quarter-mile mark, it's just a short way to Mine Creek and
the first in a string of small lakes in this small, understated
valley. The trail follows the creek and the shorelines of each
lake. A few hikers might be spotted on weekends. But if you fish on
a weekday, you are likely to have the whole area to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Lake is the first in the series, and there is some deeper
water along the southwest shoreline. Most of the lake is shallow
and the brook trout cruise these shallows feeding on just about
anything that falls in the water. A small ant pattern fished on fly
tackle or on spinning tackle behind a bobber will catch dozens and
dozens of the small, colorful fish. A tiny spinner, like a Panther
Martin or Roostertail, is also very effective.
</P>
<P>
   At 9,842 feet, Shell Lake is typical of most high elevation
Sierra waters. It is packed with very small brookies. Because the
growing season is short and trout have few natural predators, the
brookies have a tendency to overpopulate the lake and rarely get
more than six inches long. They do provide great action on light
tackle, and Shell is just the first of three waters in Mine Creek
valley.
</P>
<P>
   The next lake up the trail is unnamed and about a third the size
of Shell. It, too, is packed with fish, but far fewer because it is
more shallow and might see a die-off over some winters.
</P>
<P>
   But above the unnamed gem is a stretch of stream with big pools
packed with trout. Try fishing your way up the valley and into the
outlet of Fantail Lake, the biggest of the lakes in the vicinity.
This lake is just inside the Harvey Monroe Hall Research Natural
Area in the extreme northern end of the Inyo National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Fantail is shallow and fish are spread throughout the
lake _ most abundantly at the inlet and outlet and along the deeper
water on the south shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   From Fantail, Mine Creek heads west up a steep slope to Mine
Creek headwaters in Spuller Lake. You can fish all the way up to
Spuller or hike over the saddle due north of Fantail and hike down
the ridge dividing the Mine Creek and Lee Vining Creek drainages,
and then fish Lee Vining Creek back to where you parked. That whole
loop measures just more than three miles round-trip. The hike up to
Spuller adds nearly two miles to the hike.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the upper end of Fantail Lake and looking to the
southeast, one can see the Dana Plateau and 13,053-foot Mount Dana.
</P>
<P>
   From this vantage point, you will find it difficult to believe
there are strings of cars bustling up and down a road just a couple
of miles away and crowds of fishermen struggling to catch a few
trout on roadside lakes. All the while you catch brook trout after
brook trout.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOING
</P>
<P>
   Fantail Lake is west of Lee Vining, north of Highway 120 and
just east of Yosemite National Park in the Eastern Sierra. It's
about six or seven hours by car from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Take Highway 14 and Highway 396 and, just south of Lee Vining,
turn left on Highway 120 to Tioga Pass.
</P>
<P>
   At Tioga Junction Campground, situated at the junction of
Highway 120 and the Saddlebag Lake road, is a small parking area
near a historical marker about Bennettville, a mining boondoggle.
Park here and load up your day pack and fishing gear. Walk across
the bridge spanning Lee Vining Creek into the campground and take
the hiking trail to Bennettville. Watch out for cars.

prohibited.

   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Police and British troops evicted
protesters and confiscated weaponry Wednesday from the hillside
next to the Drumcree parish church that has been the flash point
for violence across Northern Ireland over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces in combat gear struck tents and turned up an
assortment of weapons including spent pistol rounds, catapults,
crossbows, gunpowder, a homemade submachine gun, bomb-making
chemicals and nuts, bolts and steel discs to be used as missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Protestant Loyal Orange Order of Portadown and
their followers have been camped at the site since July 5, when
they encountered barricades and troops placed in their way. They
are protesting a government order barring them from marching
through a Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were told they could return once the all-day
security search was completed, but only after each person had
passed a police inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the opportunity to stop the violence and the only way
the Orange Order can control this is with limited numbers,'' said
Tom Craig, deputy chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
whose men have been bombarded for 10 nights by gunfire,
gasoline-filled bottles and nail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The operation appeared to mark the end of another test period
for Northern Ireland's fragile new peace agreement, with sectarian
fire bombings and the shattering arson deaths of three young
Catholic brothers coming just weeks after hopeful votes to create
fresh structures for the British province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thinks that we are beaten and it's over is totally
misreading the situation,'' said David Jones, spokesman for the
Portadown Orange Lodge. ``We are still going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Maginnis, the security spokesman of the Ulster
Unionists, Northern Ireland's largest political party, said, ``I
want the Orangemen to go home, primarily on the basis that they are
not able to control the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Dixon, the Presbyterian Moderator, said, ``The violent
events now rightly associated with the continuing Orange presence
at Drumcree are wholly unsupportable by any Christian standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The haul of weapons from the churchyard and nearby fields will
be an embarrassment to the Portadown Orange Order, which prides
itself on its religious rectitude and dedication to nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   The Portadown Orangemen brought the province to a perilous point
last weekend when they summoned tens of thousands of fellow
Orangemen to join them on Monday in their standoff. A year ago
intelligence predictions that 70,000 people were headed to Drumcree
caused the police to force the march down the contested Garvaghy
Road, and rioting engulfed the province. This year the Orangemen
were predicting a turnout of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But with news of the Quinn brothers' killings, the masses of
Orangemen never showed up at Drumcree. The Order's own chaplains
urged the Portadown local leaders to call off their protest and
abandon the hillside vigil out of respect for the three dead boys.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and Jason Quinn, 9,
were burned to death in their beds in Ballymoney in an arson
attack. Two Protestants have been arrested.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Orange Order has been opposed both to the peace settlement
reached in April after 26 months of negotiations and the creation
of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, whose 108 members were
elected on June 25. The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line
Protestants, and his followers saw the Drumcree showdown as a way
to build up the Protestant rejectionist front he now leads.
</P>
<P>
   His hope was to persuade wavering supporters of David Trimble,
the First Minister of the Assembly, to desert him, eliminating the
small majority of Unionist members who believe in the Assembly's
power-sharing principles. The Assembly is charged with setting up
cross-border organizations that will bring Northern Ireland closer
to the Republic of Ireland, a Catholic goal.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble was among those who in the aftermath of the Ballymoney
murders called on the Orangemen to drop their protest. Paisley
urged them to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order's carefully cultivated image of unity,
determination and orderliness has been damaged at Drumcree. Their
protest was hijacked by young militants with nail bombs and
gasoline-filled bottles who went to war each night with troops and
policemen, and the defiant Orange rebuke to the government's
Parades Commission was exploited by Protestant paramilitaries
elsewhere in the province to go on violent rampages.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen also had an unaccustomed public falling out among
themselves over how to react to the murders of the three Catholic
brothers, and they did not succeed in their proudly stated ``line
in the sand'' demand to walk down ``the Queen's highway'' here.

IT'S JULY, BUT AVALANCHE THREATS REMAIN IN SIERRA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONE PINE, Calif. _ A recorded message at the Mount Whitney
Ranger Station warns backpackers that avalanche conditions still
exist above 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It's mid-July, for wafflestompers' sake, can this be right?
</P>
<P>
   You bet your boots it is, all because the Sierra Nevada mountain
range received twice its normal snowpack this winter and cool
weather has kept it from melting.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the backcountry has hampered hikers' summer plans,
especially for those with less technical ambitions. Ice axes and
crampons are considered musts to tackle passes over 11,200 feet,
including the Mount Whitney Trail. Many creek and river fords are
dangerous; some are impassable.
</P>
<P>
   You know things are bad when Canoga Park Boy Scout Troop 211
can't find an adequate four-day trip for its annual Sierra outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to be aware of the fact that water is running high
and they are likely to find snow at elevations they wouldn't
normally at this time of year,'' said Al Nash, spokesman for
Yosemite National Park, where Tioga Pass Road (Highway 120) opened
July 1, the latest in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly slower than usual (for backpacker traffic),''
Nash said. ``We may be running anywhere between four and six weeks
behind schedule for the backcountry.''
</P>
<P>
   High Sierra trails may have patches of snow or be uniformly
covered, with depths of up to four feet at spots. Some passes may
not be snow-free until late July or August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is summer, winter and spring conditions exist in
the mountains,'' states the Mount Whitney Ranger Station's phone
recording.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS AID OF REHNQUIST IN QUASHING SECRET SERVICE
SUBPOENAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CONGRESS-RENO) 
(JT) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Wednesday night asked
Chief Justice William Rehnquist to intervene in its battle to keep
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr from forcing Secret Service
agents to testify before the grand jury investigating the
relationship between President Clinton and a former White House
intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Rehnquist or the U.S. Court of Appeals acts on the
extraordinary motion from the administration, filed after a
district judge refused to block their testimony, the agents are
scheduled to appear before Starr's grand jury on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The heated struggle over Starr's demand for testimony by the
agents guarding Clinton goes to the heart of the delicate and at
times difficult relationship between the president and his
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ like all presidents _ chafes at the invasion of
privacy that Secret Service protection demands as the price of
protection. But over time, Clinton has come to accept the
suffocating proximity of his guardians as a part of his job.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest subpoena of eight Secret Service officers,
including Larry Cockell, the head of the plainclothes detail
guarding the president, Starr is seeking the testimony of those
with the most intimate knowledge of Clinton's movements and his
meetings to provide corroboration of other witnesses' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the White House on Wednesday
challenged those subpoenas, saying they would intrude on a
relationship that demands implicit trust and confidentiality.
Breaking that bond could imperil the president's life, they say.
They said any testimony by the agents should be deferred until
completion of the government's appeals of two federal court rulings
requiring testimony by Secret Service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But their arguments, made in a secret court session, failed to
persuade District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, administration
officials said this evening. Johnson on Wednesday repeated her
assertion in a May ruling that there was no legal basis for the
Secret Service claim that agents had an untested ``protective
function privilege'' not to testify, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia U.S. Court of
Appeals last week unanimously upheld her May ruling requiring the
agents' testimony; the administration is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, White House spokesman Mike McCurry and
Clinton's private attorneys attacked the latest subpoenas as a
potential violation of attorney-client privilege and a breach of
the confidentiality that presidents expect of their agents. Until
now, the White House refused to discuss the Secret Service issue,
saying it was being handled by the Justice Department and the
Service's parent agency, the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry struck out at Starr Wednesday, calling him an
``overzealous prosecutor'' who ``seems to be throwing subpoenas at
anything that moves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the head of the president's detail has heard the president
talking to one of his attorneys, in what is presumed to be a
privileged conversation, the government has the right to come and
take someone who by law has to be in the car to protect the
president and try to find out about that conversation?'' McCurry
said. ``Those are tactics that are certainly questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now served subpoenas on about ten Secret Service
employees _ Cockell, several members of its uniformed division, and
the agency's general counsel, John Kelleher. Cockell is currently
the head of the Presidential Protective Detail, the plainclothes
agents who provide immediate physical protection to the president
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed division guards the White House and provides
security at sites where the president appears. As guardians of the
White House complex, uniformed officers control access to the West
Wing and keep detailed records of the president's visitors,
although they rarely know what goes on behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's efforts to compel the testimony of Secret Service
officers have shaken the agency to its core.
</P>
<P>
   Senior agency officials have said that it is a daily struggle to
persuade Clinton _ and every previous president _ to accept the
intrusive presence the Service believes it needs to protect him.
Hauling agents into court would shatter the necessary intimacy
between the president and his guardians, Service officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton first moved into the White House in 1993, there
were persistent reports of friction with agents assigned to guard
him. Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton bristled _ as
all new White House occupants do _ at the round-the-clock
protection and its inevitable infringement of personal privacy. The
mood wasn't helped by rumors (later vehemently denied) that Secret
Service agents had witnessed Mrs. Clinton throwing a lamp or a
Bible at her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service officials are sensitive to the burden that
protection imposes on the first family. ``We are with them 24 hours
a day,'' said a former member of the presidential detail. ``We are
there for moments of tension between you and your wife, your
relatives, your children. We are there to experience your Christmas
Eve, your Christmas Day. We're talking about the very minutiae of
daily life.''
</P>

<P>
   Agents are seldom actually with the president when he is in the
family quarters of the White House, although they do control access
to the private floors of the executive mansion when the first
family is in residence. The president can meet privately with
anyone in the residence, the Oval Office, the White House theater
and numerous crannies of the sprawling mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But agents are always nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service officials say they always know where the
president is, but they don't always know who is with him and they
are trained not to eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do our jobs chiefly with our eyes, not our ears,'' said
Hamilton Brown, executive secretary of the Association of Former
Agents of the U.S. Secret Service, who guarded every president from
Kennedy to Reagan. ``No one's ever talked a president to death. We
tend to turn off the background noise and concentrate on the job
we're there to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the president meets in the Oval Office with aides or small
groups of visitors, agents remain discreetly outside. But when he
receives larger groups, agents remain.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said that the president has a close and
respectful relationship with the agents assigned to guard him. But
he has complained about the disruption his travels cause _ 40-car
motorcades, freeway closures, the large tents erected to block
public view of his entrances and exits to hotels and convention
halls.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Clinton's lawyers suspect that Starr
wants to question Cockell about conversations he might have
overheard in the presidential limousine on Jan. 17, the day Clinton
was deposed by lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones. It was at that
six-hour session that Clinton was first asked about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Attorney General Janet Reno faced fierce
criticism Wednesday for her decision to appeal the Secret Service
privilege rulings. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the
Judiciary Committee, told her that he was dismayed at the decision
which he believed, ``called into serious question the real
motivations of both the Department of Justice and the Secret
Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has agreed to consider legislation establishing a
partial privilege for agents, said there was no respectable legal
scholar in the nation who believed such a privilege currently
existed.

KREMLIN ASKS LEGISLATORS TO OK KEY ECONOMIC PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With billions in Western loans at stake, the Russian
government urged the lower house of Parliament today to pass a
package of tax, budget and economic measures, the strings lenders
have attached to any additional money.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament passed several new laws designed to instill
discipline in the budgeting process and restore confidence in the
economy, including legislation that cuts corporate taxes,
encourages foreign investment and simplifies taxes on small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of $17.1 billion in new loans over the next 18
months has lifted Moscow's beleaguered stock market. Stocks rose
for the fifth day in line with rallies in the bond market that
began earlier this week. The hope that an international bailout
would head off a Russian cash shortage and currency devaluation has
raised prices of stock and bonds and lowered interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Important votes on personal-income tax rates and procedures
regarding value- added taxes are due Thursday or Friday.
Streamlining the arcane tax system and increasing tax collection
are cornerstones of the plan pushed by the government and the
monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   If Parliament balks, the Russian government has warned that it
will adopt some of the measures by decree. But some measures,
including taxation rates, can only be enacted by legislation. And
the Kremlin would prefer to have as much Parliamentary support as
possible. The board of the International Monetary Fund is expected
to vote on Monday to approve $11.2 billion in new loans this year
for Russia. The Kremlin is rushing to ram the measures through
Parliament by then.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, President Boris Yeltsin has mounted a sort of
charm offensive to woo hard-line deputies. He even invited party
leaders to the Kremlin on Tuesday for tea, a sharp contrast to just
a few weeks ago when he threatened to dissolve Parliament when it
resisted his choice of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said Wednesday that reports on the Kremlin
session with the president were manipulated to cast them as
toadies. And Wednesday they tried to show their independence by
denouncing the rescue package as a sell-out to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Government opponents say the spending cuts will increase the
burden on ordinary Russians already battered by economic reform.
The Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, told journalists that
the government's anti-crisis program ``will not resolve the
problems.'' But he also hinted at compromise, saying that his party
will support ``any measures that improve production and raise
responsibility and discipline, regardless of where they come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Tuesday, Anatoly Chubais, Russia's chief
representative in talks with the IMF and World Bank, brushed aside
concerns that the Parliament might reject some of the measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Duma will support the program,'' he predicted,
referring to the lower house of Parliament. ``Of course not all of
the measures require the Duma's support. There are measures which
can be passed by decree of the government and the president.''

NATO THREAT TO INTERVENE IN KOSOVO FADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The already remote prospect of NATO military
intervention in Kosovo has quickly faded as the Serbian crackdown
there has let up and the rebels expand their campaign, Pentagon
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A month after NATO warplanes staged a noisy show of force over
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, the officials said that NATO had
not ruled out the use of force to halt the growing civil war in the
Yugoslav province. But they said that for now the success of ethnic
Albanian insurgents in the Kosovo Liberation Army had significantly
undercut that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO's strategists have drafted preliminary plans,
including possible air strikes against Serbian forces in Kosovo,
the officials said neither the United States nor NATO had any
intention of helping the rebels in their campaign for independence
from the Yugoslav government by bombing the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to know _ and NATO has made this clear and the U.S.
government has made this clear _ that the cavalry is not coming,''
a Defense Department official told reporters at the Pentagon
Wednesday, speaking only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they remained worried that the fighting could
spread to neighboring countries, an event that would almost
certainly draw in NATO, but those fears have diminished since the
Serbs have eased their crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials in Washington and at NATO's headquarters in
Brussels said Wednesday that NATO's military planning had virtually
ground to a halt and that the United States and its allies had
focused their attention on diplomatic efforts to end the fighting.
The officials emphasized, though, that NATO could still launch a
strike against the Serbs on very short notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is very much on the political side,'' a Western
diplomat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another meeting of the ``contact group'' of countries monitoring
the fighting _ the United States, Russia, Germany, Italy, Britain
and France _ is to take place in London next Tuesday. President
Clinton's senior national security aides met at the White House
this evening to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the United States and its allies have become
frustrated by the rebels' apparent unwillingness to consider a
peaceful resolution. Compounding the frustration is the confusion
over who, if anyone, can speak for the loosely organized rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually are having a hard time in our community
understanding exactly who is in charge _ who is in charge of the
military, who is in charge of the politics,'' an intelligence
official at the Pentagon said Wednesday, referring to the
intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian crackdown has eased significantly since NATO's air
exercise on June 15, in which more than 80 aircraft coursed across
the skies over Albania and Macedonia. Though largely symbolic, the
exercise showed NATO could quickly assemble air power in the
Balkans. A day later, Milosevic met with President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia and pledged to halt the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two to three weeks, we've seen a definite
leveling off and perhaps even drop in offensive-type of operations
on the part of the Serbs,'' one of the officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That raised hopes that a political solution was still possible,
but those hopes have dimmed because of the rebels, who are vowing
to establish an independent state of Kosovo, whose 2 million people
are overwhelmingly ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, once a couple of hundred irregulars,
has grown in size and strength since Milosevic ordered his
crackdown. Still, the officials said, it is unable to wage a
sustained military campaign against the better-trained and equipped
Serbs. The rebels control their land, these officials said, because
the Serbian forces have not pursued them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of determined Serb resistance or counterattacks,
the KLA have not shown yet that they are capable of holding
ground,'' one said. ``They can harass and temporarily occupy and
hold ground, but they hold the ground because the Serbs are
allowing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke to reporters on events of the last few
weeks, offered details that contradicted a number of recent reports
about the size and strength of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   While reports have suggested that 50,000 Serbs have taken part
in the fighting, intelligence reports indicate that only 10,000
soldiers from the Yugoslav National Army are involved, along with a
smaller number of special police units, the officials said. The
rebels, by contrast, have only 2,000 soldiers, although they can
rely on the support of ``tens of thousands'' of armed supporters in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also displayed a map suggesting the rebels control
far less than the 30 to 40 percent of territory often cited.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are receiving money and weapons from ethnic Albanians
outside Kosovo, including expatriates in Germany and North America,
the officials said.

JAPANESE CARS STILL TOPS IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Though their governments may collapse
with regularity, Japanese car dealerships in the United States
remain dependable, according to an annual J.D. Power and Associates
customer satisfaction survey.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Wednesday, found that after a year of
driving their vehicles, owners of Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus and
Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti automobiles had the fewest complaints
about service they received from their dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The two auto lines have dominated the top spots since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in a distant third this year was General Motors' Saturn,
followed by Ford's Jaguar and Mercury lines. Recent improvements in
Mercury vehicles helped boost the brand from a No. 17 ranking last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, customer satisfaction was higher across the board this
year, the study found, largely because cars continue to be built
better and require less service.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the report at its headquarters northwest of Los
Angeles, J.D. Power officials said quality service ultimately
translates into increased sales for dealers and noted that
customers who are satisfied with their dealership experience are
three times more likely to purchase another vehicle from the same
manufacturer. ``Customers clearly reward good service with loyal
patronage,'' said Joe Ivers, director of customer service research.
</P>
<P>
   With drivers taking better-built cars to the mechanic less
frequently, dealers must concentrate on the quality of service they
deliver in conducting routine maintenance such as oil changes and
tune-ups, Ivers said. The survey found that one-third of services
performed on cars still under warranty is done at independent
service centers such as Jiffy Lube and Midas.

PANEL SAYS U.S. FACES RISK OF A SURPRISE MISSILE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rogue nations or terrorists could develop and
deploy ballistic missiles for an attack against the United States
with ``little or no warning,'' an independent commission announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But senior American intelligence officials disputed the finding,
which challenges a longstanding intelligence estimate that no
country except Russia and China, which already possess ballistic
missiles, could hit American targets, and that North Korea could
perhaps field long-range missiles before 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous conclusions of the bipartisan commission, headed
by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, provide fresh
ammunition for supporters of a national missile defense, and
sharpen an election-year issue that Republicans want to wield
against the administration and Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sobering conclusion,'' said Speaker Newt Gingrich,
a strong supporter of national missile defenses, who called on the
administration to work with Congress in the next several months to
address the heightened threat as described in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has spent more than $40 billion since the
Reagan administration to build a space- or land-based defense
against ballistic missile strikes, but has yet to construct a
workable network.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a report Wednesday by the General Accounting Office, the
auditing arm of Congress, concluded that it is unlikely that a
program to develop a national missile defense will meet an
important deadline in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not address the merit of any particular
defensive system, focusing instead on the ballistic missile threat
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major implication of our conclusions is that warning time
is reduced,'' said Rumsfeld, who was defense secretary under
President Gerald Ford. ``We see an environment of little or no
warning of ballistic missile threats to the U.S. from several
emerging powers.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission singled out North Korea, Iran and Iraq for
scrutiny. For example, the panel's report said, ``We judge that
Iran now has the technical capability and resources to demonstrate
an ICBM-range ballistic missile'' similar to a North Korean model.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday, George Tenet, the
director of Central Intelligence, said the government stood by a
threat assessment first made in 1995 and reaffirmed most recently
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The government assessments, Tenet said in his letter, ``were
supported by the available evidence and were well tested'' in an
internal review.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the commission, in its 300-page classified report delivered
to the House and Senate on Wednesday, as well as in an unclassified
27-page version, said the American intelligence community was wrong
in relying on the much-longer warning times.
</P>
<P>
   Rumsfeld said rogue nations, such as Iran and Iraq, had obtained
sensitive missile technology, in part because of loosened export
controls among industrialized nations. ``Foreign assistance is not
a wildcard,'' Rumsfeld said. ``It is a fact of our relaxed
post-Cold-War world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumsfeld also said that these suspect countries had become more
adept at concealing their missile programs, making it more
difficult for Western intelligence analysts to gauge a country's
progress and intentions.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily called briefing for reporters, senior intelligence
officials said Wednesday that the commission had examined the same
information available to government analysts, but had come to
different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   These intelligence officials said that they tended to focus on
specific evidence to reach their conclusions, assigning various
degrees of certainty to each assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence officials said the panel, officially titled the
Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United
States, took the same information and, in essence, assumed the
worst about what was not known for a particular country's missile
program, and drew its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Rumsfeld concurred: ``We came at this subject as senior
decision-makers would, who have to make difficult judgments based
on limited information.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the report, even though it was praised in
particular by Republicans, is likely to stoke the debate over
ballistic missile threats rather than be viewed as the definitive
conclusion. &QL;

   IN CHALLENGE TO CLINTON, HOUSE BACKS AN ABORTION CURB
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Daring President Clinton to cast an election-year
veto on a sensitive issue, the House voted Wednesday to make it a
federal crime for an adult to take a minor to another state for an
abortion to avoid a parental-consent law in the girl's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed that this latest measure in the recurring
abortion war in Congress would not become law. It might be blocked
in the Senate. If not, the White House said, the president's
advisers would recommend that he veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved by a vote of 276-150, well short of the
two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a veto. But
the meager prospects for enactment did not diminish the intensity
of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents, most of them Republicans, said the measure was
necessary to prevent unscrupulous adults from sidestepping the law
in the 22 states that require parental notification before minors
may have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate their belief that this happens thousands of times
a year, the proponents waved a poster of enlarged advertisements
from telephone Yellow Pages in Pennsylvania, one of the states with
a notification law, promoting abortion clinics in New Jersey and
Maryland, which do not have such laws. ``No Parental Consent
Required,'' the advertisements said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wrong, and it has to be stopped,'' said Rep. Sue
Myrick, R-N.C..
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said that the violence of
abortion was compounded ``when strangers scoop up 12- or
13-year-old girls and usher them across state lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the bill, most of them Democrats, said that it
would be disastrous for pregnant girls with unloving parents and
would prevent grandparents and male partners from helping desperate
minors in their time of need.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the bill would encourage parental involvement, said
Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va. He said that would mean that the pregnant
girls would ``have to go alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The real purpose of the legislation, said Rep. Louise Slaughter,
D-N.Y., is to give Republicans ``campaign sound bites'' in which
they could ``label opponents of the bill as anti-parent and
anti-family.''

   HIGHER SURPLUS ESTIMATE SPURS GOP TAX CUTTERS
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday more
than doubled its estimate of the federal budget surplus over the
next decade, emboldening Republicans who want to use some of the
money for tax cuts despite President Clinton's insistence that it
all be set aside until Social Security's financial problems are
solved.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO said it expects the cumulative surplus from 1999 through
2008 to be $1.55 trillion, more than double the $671 billion it
projected in March. The new estimate brings the CBO's outlook
roughly in line with the Clinton administration's most recent
projection of a $1.8 trillion surplus over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington having hardly had time to adapt to an era of
good fiscal news after decades of huge deficits, both parties
claimed credit for the good news in the budget office's report.
</P>
<P>
   But it was seized on especially by Republicans, who have been
pressing the budget office for months to adopt a more optimistic
view of the nation's fiscal condition to further their tax-cutting
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO said Wednesdy it had detected a largely unexplained
increase in tax revenues and a slightly stronger economic growth
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried early this year to place the surplus off limits to
Republican tax cutters by saying that every penny should be
preserved until the two parties can agree on how to shore up Social
Security for the retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy has worked. But as the surplus has grown,
Republicans have begun asserting that it will be big enough to
accommodate tax cuts and a Social Security fix. With Wednesday's
estimates, Republican leaders became more explicit in rejecting
Clinton's ``Social Security first'' demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a whopping $1.5 trillion surplus over 10 years, we can
preserve, protect and strengthen Social Security while also passing
significant tax relief for hard-working Americans,'' said House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are seeking $100 billion in tax cuts in the
next five years, including reductions in the so-called marriage
penalty paid by many two-income couples. Gingrich has also called
for a reductions in the capital gains tax and in estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and moderate Republicans in the House and the Senate
have said a tax cut of that magnitude is politically unrealistic
because it would require painful spending cuts that even
Republicans would not want to defend in a congressional election
year.
</P>
<P>
   But dipping into the surplus would at least partly solve that
problem and allow Republicans to further their efforts at reducing
the size of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the politicians in Washington aren't careful, the surplus
will be used to create more government spending,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas. ``To stop the politicians from spending the money,
I want to use the surplus to pay down the debt, save Social
Security and we should use a portion of it to cut taxes this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats warned that dipping into the surplus now would
jeopardize any chance of reaching a bipartisan consensus on Social
Security and would leave Republicans vulnerable to charges of
putting immediate tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of retirement
security for the baby boomers and their children.

   CENSUS MONEY HELD UP IN BATTLE OVER METHODS
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday
approved only half the money the Census Bureau needs to prepare for
the 2000 Census, withholding the rest until Congress and the White
House agree on how best to count the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote Wednesday was the latest skirmish in the
long-running battle pitting Congressional Republicans against
Democrats and the Clinton administration over the bureau's plans to
use statistical methods to supplement the traditional head count in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has said that the use of statistical samples
of the population to estimate the number of people not contacted
directly by census workers would produce a less costly and more
accurate tabulation, and would reduce the number of inner-city
blacks and rural Hispanic residents missed by traditional counting
methods. But Republicans have criticized the plan, saying it is
unconstitutional and is subject to political manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved a $33.5 billion spending bill for fiscal
1999, which begins Oct. 1, for the departments of Commerce, Justice
and State, but voted to hold back half of the Census Bureau's
money.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill pays for such government agencies and
operations as the Federal court system, the FBI, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, the National Weather Service and U.S.
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   In a party-line vote, the committee defeated, 31-22, an
amendment by Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., that would have provided
the Census Bureau with its full funding of nearly $952 million
while the National Academy of Sciences determined whether using
statistical methods would produce a more accurate census than the
traditional attempt to count everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Mollohan said his amendment would allow experts to determine the
efficacy of using statistical methods and prevent the issue of the
census from degenerating into a ``barroom political brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote stemmed from an agreement last November between
the White House and congressional Republicans. Details of the
agreement are now in dispute. Administration officials say the two
sides agree that the departments of Commerce, Justice and State
would be financed for half of the next fiscal year until the
dispute over the census is resolved. Republicans say they agreed
only that the Census Bureau would receive money for six months.

   GOP SENATORS DEFEAT DEMOCRATS' FARM PLANS
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Wednesday along party lines to
reject Democratic proposals to give more federal assistance to
struggling farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The main Democratic measure, billed as essential to keep
thousands of farms from going under in one of the worst years in
more than a decade, would have increased the amount of federal
money farmers could borrow with their crops as collateral and would
have extended the time for repayment.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal, an amendment to a $57 billion bill to
pay for government agriculture programs in the next fiscal year,
was rejected, 56 to 43.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., joined all 55 Republicans in
opposition. All those who voted in favor were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope the vote will work against Republicans running
for election in farm states this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Plains states are a striking exception to the
generally booming national economy. Plunging wheat prices caused
primarily by reduced exports to Asia and a worldwide glut on the
market have crippled many small farms from Minnesota through the
Dakotas and west along the Canadian border to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first big test of the 1996 farm law, which phases
out government crop subsidies, placed a limit on how much farmers
can borrow from the government and ended government controls over
what farmers can plant and when they can plant it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe farmers, like almost all other Americans,
fare best when the government takes a hands-off approach. Democrats
hold that farmers need a strong government safety net to protect
them in bad times.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the loans, the Democratic proposal would have
increased the amount that could be borrowed against a wheat crop,
this year alone, to $3.16 a bushel from $2.58, and would have
lengthened the maximum repayment period to 15 months from 9 months.
Farmers with other crops would have been entitled to similar loans.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this would help farmers by enabling them to withhold
their crops from the market until the price rose.

 &HT;    HBO &AMP; Co. shares surge after end of merger talks
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- HBO &AMP; Co. stock rebounded Wednesday, after it was
announced the Atlanta-based company had broken off merger talks
with San Francisco-based McKesson Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The leaked information that HBO, the largest U.S. maker of
health care company software, was in merger talks with drug
wholesaler McKesson had caused HBO stock to drop sharply Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, 31.2 million shares changed hands, and HBO was the
third most active stock on U.S. markets. It closed at $33.75, up
$1.68 3/4, or 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson approached HBO three weeks ago and proposed a business
combination that would have been controlled by McKesson, according
to analyst Charles Trafton of Adams Harkness and HBO spokeswoman
Beth Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson would have given HBO access to thousands of customers
for its products along with McKesson's software for managing drug
costs. Meanwhile, HBO's high-profit, high-growth software business
would have bolstered McKesson's slimmer profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HBO board of directors had a fiduciary duty to consider
this offer,'' Trafton said, ``but shot it down because it did not
want the company to be in the drug distribution business. ...
(Furthermore, the parties) could not agree on terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Trafton also said McKesson stock _ which on Monday hit a 52-week
high of $90.12 1/2 _ was probably too expensive, at a time when HBO
can be picky.
</P>
<P>
   HBO split its stock in June. Shares reached a 52-week high of
$38.37 1/2 Monday, the day before HBO reported record
second-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has no debt, a half-billion dollars in cash and a
$13 billion market capitalization, widely credited to the efforts
of Chief Executive Officer Charles McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, HBO reported net income of $144 million on sales of
$1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now that talks with McKesson have broken down, HBO is likely to
look for another acquisition, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The McKesson deal would have given HBO a presence in every
single area of health care, said Sharon Corr, a Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
analyst. However, she said, HBO could buy a pharmacy software
vendor or some sort of information services company that would be a
better fit.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TRIES TO BLOCK STARR SUBPOENAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved quickly Wednesday
to block subpoenas seeking grand jury testimony from the
president's personal security detail as his private attorneys and
press secretary fired verbal broadsides at independent counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the Justice Department and Starr's staff met behind
closed doors for almost an hour with Chief U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson, who oversees the grand jury investigating
an alleged presidential affair and cover-up. The attorneys declined
comment when they emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was prompted by subpoenas Starr issued Tuesday
summoning Larry Cockell, chief of the president's security team,
and six other Secret Service officers to appear Thursday before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been investigating whether Clinton or his associates
tried to illegally cover up his alleged sexual encounters with
former White House aides Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey.
Clinton and Lewinsky have denied under oath engaging in sex.
Clinton also has denied any inappropriate behavior involving
Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyers, Robert S. Bennett and David Kendall,
accused Starr of going after Cockell in an effort to ``intrude'' on
confidential conversations between the president and his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell frequently stands at Clinton's shoulder when others are
present and rides across from him in the presidential limousine.
Cockell was present when attorneys for Paula Jones questioned
Clinton under oath about alleged sexual liaisons, including with
Lewinsky and Willey, and rode with the president and Bennett to the
White House following the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Bennett and Kendall said Starr was trying
to ``invade the president's right to consult'' with his personal
attorneys. ``Any backdoor attempt by this prosecutor (Starr) to
invade the president's right to consult with personal counsel will
be aggressively and firmly resisted,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry also criticized the
subpoenas from Starr saying it would be wrong for members of the
president's security detail to testify about what they overheard
while protecting him. ``Those are tactics that are certainly
questionable, and that is a mild way of putting it,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential spokesman also accused Starr's staff of
``outrageous and venomous'' behavior and blamed the prosecutor for
a television news report Wednesday suggesting that Secret Service
agents played a role in the president's alleged extra-marital
liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News reported that Starr's investigators believe some Secret
Service agents ```facilitated' for President Clinton,'' then drew
parallels to accusations that while serving as Arkansas governor
Clinton used state troopers to approach women about possible
liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is utterly outrageous and venomous for Ken Starr to allow
his staff to impugn the integrity of the president of the United
States and people who are required by law to protect him, and if he
had any ounce of decency today, he would tell them to knock it
off,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sneering at the president of the United States is common sport
here in Washington now,'' McCurry said. ``But the Secret Service
agents who protect the president of the United States with their
lives are dedicated, serious professionals, and they should not be
slimed by Ken Starr and his operatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly did not return telephone calls
seeking comment on McCurry's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena for Cockell and the six Secret Service officers was
served Tuesday as the Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn a ruling
compelling Secret Service employees to appear before the grand
jury. That order dealt with an attorney for the agency and two
uniformed officers who were not members of the president's personal
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has argued that forcing testimony by the
officers might cause presidents to be more wary and push them away
when engaged in confidential business, thus increasing the danger
of assassination.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch questioned Attorney General
Janet Reno's decision to appeal the ruling and suggested her agency
was part of a ploy to delay Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to appeal at this time calls into serious
question the real motivations of both the Department of Justice and
the Secret Service,'' Hatch told Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said the ruling by a three-judge panel was
appealed because the department believes it is wrong. ``I tell you,
Mr. Chairman, with all my heart, it is not done for delay,'' Reno
said.

 &HT;    I-75 bust nets 150 pounds of cocaine, Atlanta couple
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With their three children in the back of a motor home
and a station wagon in tow, Frances and Marlinda Barthelemy of
Atlanta appeared to be nothing more than an average family on the
way home from a Florida vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials said Wednesday that the couple was
part of a major drug distribution ring that supplied large amounts
of cocaine in the Vine City area. On a recent trip to Florida,
authorities said, the Barthelemys picked up about 72 kilograms
(more than 158 pounds) of the drug, wrapped it in duct tape and
stuffed it under a bed in the back of the motor home.
</P>
<P>
   The trip ended late Tuesday, just before the Barthelemys and
their cargo of cocaine _ with an estimated street value of $1.5
million to $3 million _ reached Atlanta. A multi-agency task force
of local, state and federal law enforcement officials had been
investigating the drug ring for more than six months and watching
the couple on their trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Agents swooped down on the northbound Winnebago on I-75 in
Forest Park, seized the cocaine and arrested the husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Barthelemy, 34, and Marlinda Barthelemy, 27, are being
held in the Clayton County Jail on federal drug trafficking charges
and awaiting a bond hearing later today. Their three children, sons
ages 4 and 14 and a daughter, 7, have been turned over to
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   A.B. Llewellyn, assistant special agent in charge of the Atlanta
FBI office, said Frances Barthelemy, who owns a small auto repair
shop in south Atlanta, is also wanted in Dooly County on a 1990
bench warrant for failure to appear on a cocaine trafficking
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Barthelemys were major distributors of cocaine in the
Atlanta area and part of a larger network, Llewellyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people on both ends of the pipeline'' that are still
under investigation, and more arrests are expected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Deputy Police Chief C.B. Jackson called Tuesday's bust
``a very, very large seizure'' of cocaine for the city.
Investigators believe much of the cocaine was destined to be
processed into crack cocaine for eventual distribution in an area
of Vine City known as ``the Bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a problem area of the city,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the drugs and motor home, law enforcement
officials seized five cars, including a 1998 Mercedes-Benz station
wagon; two pickup trucks; a Harley-Davidson motorcycle; a Land
Rover; and a Sea-Doo personal watercraft from the Barthelemys' home
and business.

 &HT;    Beating the drum for New Orleans
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS -- This city is enjoying a renaissance _ the economy
is recovering from the devastation of the oil bust, and violent
crime, the city's most nagging nemesis, is down dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Residents give a much of the credit to Mayor Marc Morial, the
dapper, 40-year-old son of the city's first black mayor, Dutch
Morial, who served from 1978 to 1986. The younger Morial is
settling into his second term as mayor, a position given to him in
February by more than 80 percent of the voters. His landslide
victory was almost unprecedented here.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent lunch in Morial's private dining room, the mayor
talked about the future of the city as he took bites of chilled
avocado soup heavily laced with Tabasco sauce. And he talked about
his own future, which could include a third race for mayor. That
would mean convincing the voters to change the city's charter,
which sets the limit at two terms. His father tried to change the
charter twice and failed. Morial says he's thinking about trying
anyway, because, simply and not so modestly put, a good mayor is
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a good mayor is tough,'' he said. ``It's very hard to
run these major cities and sustain your popularity and get things
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:Even though New Orleans is on an economic rebound, it lags
behind other Southern cities. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A:There's a tension here between tradition and progress, but the
best way to build New Orleans is to blend the two. We're not
Natchez, we're not Charleston. We are a large population center.
But Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Miami, they catapulted past us in
many ways, because you had a more progressive spirit than you had
here. We are unique, and our uniqueness is something we are going
to preserve. We don't want to be a city that's defined by glass and
steel, by new buildings, but we have to have progress.
</P>
<P>
   Q:There's a fear here that development along the Mississippi
Gulf Coast in connection with the casinos will encroach on New
Orleans' tourism. Is that something you worry about?
</P>
<P>
   A:We can't get angry about competition. We need to expand our
entertainment opportunities. That's why we are building Jazzland _
an amusement park in eastern New Orleans _ and allowing limited
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Crime and police corruption are this city's black eyes. You
fought to keep Police Chief Richard Pennington when he was offered
a chance to return to Washington, D.C., to be that city's chief.
Why was he worth the huge pay raise you gave him to stay here?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think it was an important fight. When you rebuild an
organization like we're rebuilding the police department, you
rebuild it like a team _ around your franchise player. And
Pennington has the confidence of the public. It has been a long
time since we've had that.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What is the hardest issue the police here struggle with?
</P>
<P>
   A:Drug-related murders. They're unpredictable and hard to
police. And we need help from the federal government _ the FBI, the
Drug Enforcement Administration, the ATF. We've got a port out
there. We're a transportation hub. Keeping dope from coming in from
the port _ that's a job for customs and DEA.
</P>
<P>
   Q:New Orleans is on an economic upswing. What are some of the
projects that have happened?
</P>
<P>
   A:There's the (land-based) casino on Canal Street (which went
bankrupt but is now set to reopen), a $250 million expansion of the
convention center downtown, the $80 million Jazzland. And there are
several other projects on the drawing boards, including converting
an old contaminated industrial site _ the American Can Building _
into apartments. There are two new hotels _the Ritz-Carlton is
moving into the old Krauss department store on Canal Street. The
streetcar line is going to be expanded, and we are in the midst of
the three-quarters-of-a-billion (dollar) airport expansion. We're
benefiting from when times got bad. Now, as we rebuild, we are
diversifying our economy.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Beyond possibly running for a third term as mayor, what other
ambitions do you have?
</P>
<P>
   A:Maybe running statewide, possibly for governor. But I'm
realistic _ I don't run for offices I can't win.

 &HT;    Glickman vows support for farmers
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Even though he is the target of a $2.5 billion race
discrimination lawsuit, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman joined
with leaders and delegates to the nation's largest and oldest civil
rights group in voicing his support for black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what is happening to black farmers, and to America's
small farm heritage is a moral crisis and one that we all have an
obligation to help resolve,'' Glickman told delegates to the NAACP
meeting in Atlanta Wednesday. While NAACP delegates were polite,
some of the farmers who had protested against him earlier in the
day continued their criticism at a news conference after Glickman's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary reiterated his own findings that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has discriminated against black farmers
in the past, ``and possibly now.'' Glickman said the legacy he
wants to leave is a department that ``has a better land base that
is diversified and not one of just conglomerate farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he sees the demise of black farms at three times
the rate of farms generally. Twenty-six black farmers from Georgia
are among more than 500 nationwide who have sued Glickman and the
USDA, alleging that the agency discriminated in lending and federal
programs for decades. Black farmers maintain that because of
discriminatory practices, their numbers have dropped from more than
900,000 in 1920 down to 18,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman did not have checks with him Wednesday, telling the
group that Congress must change the law barring payments beyond two
years in discrimination cases involving lending.
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Chestnut, a lead attorney in lawsuits filed by hundreds of
the nation's black farmers, said the Department of Justice shares
some of the blame for holding up the payments to farmers. ``They
are scared because they are afraid it will set a precedent in
dealing with black folks and they will be showered with all kind of
lawsuits,'' Chestnut said in his speech to the NAACP delegation.
``Racism is rampant in the federal government. Regardless of what
Glickman says, the government is going to pay real money to black
folks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These farmers are so upset that if Glickman does not settle,
they will set up a tent city in front of his office until this is
resolved or he resigns,'' Chestnut said. Black farmers say more
than 2,000 discrimination complaints have been filed by black
farmers with USDA.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting black farmers and their supporters early Wednesday
morning said the secretary's rhetoric is not matching his
department's deeds. While several discrimination claims have been
verified by USDA investigators, monetary settlements have not been
made.
</P>
<P>
   John Boyd of the National Black Farmers Association, Gary Grant
of the National Black Agriculturalists Association and Ralph Paige,
director of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, led a group of
about 100 in a ``march of support'' for black farmers through
downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no victory for Democrats in 2000 without the
support of the black farmers,'' Grant said. Boyd even had his mule,
named Struggles, in the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel less than a slave because I can't support my family,''
said black farmer Lynwood Brown.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and Chairman Julian Bond said the
nation's oldest civil rights group stands with black farmers and
urges a repeal of the legislation barring the granting of loans to
any farmers that has experienced a loan restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Both voiced support for the full funding of the Minority Rights
Act, which would provide $10 million in technical assistance for
minority farmers, repeal of federal provisions that bar farmers
from making new loans if they've had old debts, lifting of the
two-year statute of limitations on filing discrimination claims in
lending and the implementation of the Civil Rights Action Team
report prepared at Glickman's direction that outlined 92 steps to
correct discrimination within the department and its field offices.

 &HT;    Can Gore deliver? That's issue for new NAACP leaders
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter'
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The NAACP convention Vice President Al Gore comes to
address today has had its fiery moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil rights era, when the NAACP leaned more toward doing
battling segregation through the courts than some other
organizations, it would have been unusual for its president to
suggest a protest at the Supreme Court building, as Kweisi Mfume
did this week in calling attention to the high court's abysmal
record of minority hiring.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of increasing ethnic and political complexity, Mfume's
priorities have been to focus and energize the organization that
can still make the broadest claim to speak for black America, and
the outspoken former congressman from Baltimore has been very
effective in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But the rousing convention also occurs as black political
leaders are growing increasingly pragmatic in endorsements and less
reliant on traditional litmus tests.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or 15 years ago, it would have been a shock to see
Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington take sides in an Alabama
Republican primary, as he did with his endorsement of Winton
Blount. (For that matter, it would have been a surprise to see
House Speaker Newt Gingrich weighing in on the side of a black
Republican in the 2nd Congressional District primary.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Georgia governor's race, the endorsement of Roy Barnes, a
legislator who once opposed the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday
bill, by black leaders such as Rep. Cynthia McKinney and former
Mayor Maynard Jackson also would have seemed an odd fit a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this year McKinney has been so staunch in her support that
when a flier attributing a racist remark to Barnes proved to be
inaccurate, McKinney went to a radio studio unannounced and cut a
spot she'd written, urging black voters to send a message to ``the
good old boys from the bad old days'' by voting for Barnes. It was
more than the Cobb legislator could have dared asked for, and he
hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black voters in my opinion are more interested in delivery
than in promises,'' Jackson said recently, reflecting on his
endorsement. Aside from a greater emphasis by black voters on equal
rights, he said, ``there is virtually no difference in what whites
and blacks want.''
</P>
<P>
   Black politics is becoming ``a bit more opportunistic'' than it
has in the past, said William Boone, a political scientist at
Clark-Atlanta University, with less emphasis on finding the
``morally correct'' candidates and more on those ``not necessarily
spotless'' who can bring home the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a moving away from the broad kinds of issues,
toward the idea of talking about specifics and getting behind the
folks who can win and bring a degree of prosperity to the
community,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   This should be good news for a mainstream Democrat such as Gore,
who in any case has shown a surprising ability with the cadences of
the civil rights movement in speeches like the one he gave at this
year's King holiday observance at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   But today's audience will be listening less for the rhetoric in
the upcoming race for the presidential nomination, and thinking
more about what the candidates can deliver.

<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa _ From the porch views of the Victorian-era houses
sitting high on the limestone bluffs over the Mississippi River, it
looked like a sad parade on the streets of Dubuque in the '80s, an
exodus of downhearted Iowans fleeing the farm-crisis economy.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, with unemployment rates over 14 percent, young
Iowans with roots five or six generations deep came to see their
future prospects here as hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Dubuque, a city of some 60,000 people, has a new and
enviable problem: too many good jobs and not enough workers. With
an employment rate below 4 percent, and a flurry of new and growing
Dubuque companies in the fields of computer programming, publishing
and marketing, employers lament a shortage of workers.
</P>
<P>
   So Dubuque civic and business officials have begun an aggressive
program to bring back its sons, daughters and grandchildren. The
campaign, ``Come back to your future _ come home to Dubuque,'' has
included a site on the Internet and mailings to high-school and
college graduates. There have also been newspaper and radio
advertisements directed at the parents and grandparents of former
Dubuquers, urging them to persuade their offspring to return.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wonderful to be home,'' said John Link, whose wife, Teri,
and daughter, Tabitha, 2, are among the more than 30 families who
have returned to Iowa since the recruitment efforts began around
last Christmas. ``When I left, I never thought it would be
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The flourishing economy of Dubuque underscores the
transformation of the economy in the rural Midwestern states like
Iowa, which once depended almost solely on agriculture. Dubuque is
now home to three textbook companies, a far cry from when the local
economy was dominated by the John Deere tractor factory and a
meatpacking plant.
</P>
<P>
   Link, 30, left Dubuque after graduating from high school in
1986, eventually settling in the Northern Virginia suburbs, with a
job in a marketing department in Washington. Ms. Link, 31 and also
from Iowa, worked as a paralegal.
</P>
<P>
   For young families that have grown weary of life in congested,
expensive suburban settings, small cities and towns in the
countryside have lately become quite appealing, known for safe
streets and good schools.
</P>
<P>
   For employers in Dubuque, as in many smaller cities in the
Midwest, they need more technologically literate workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking $6-an-hour jobs here, but jobs that pay $15
and $20 an hour,'' said Mike Walker, the general manager of Dubuque
Data Services, a computer-programming company that has recently
grown to 56 people, from 38 in November, including 6 new hires from
Dubuque's Web site recruitment campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Links cherished living in a metropolitan area, especially
the sense of excitement and diversity. But they also found it
expensive, and more than a bit stressful, especially after the
birth of their daughter. With Ms. Link expecting another child in
the fall, the couple took a close look at Dubuque after hearing
about the job surplus and recruitment efforts. Link easily found a
good job in sales for an advertising company, and they moved back
to Dubuque in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is so much easier now,'' said Ms. Link, who added that
she could now afford to be a stay-at-home mother. ``Around
Washington, it took forever to get anywhere. Now I'm five minutes
from the countryside, five minutes from the mall. You just feel
like you can relax and breathe here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Links acknowledged that there were trade-offs for the
slower-paced life: fewer restaurants, stores, less cultural
diversity. Some acquaintances around Washington were dumbfounded by
their decision to move to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would say, `Oh, I'm so sorry,'' Ms. Link said, referring
to people who assumed that her husband was being forced to transfer
to a job in Iowa. ``A lot of people don't even know where it is.
They get it confused with Idaho or Ohio. They think its some
desolate region with nothing but cornfields.''
</P>
<P>
   With architecture that goes back more than 150 years, Dubuque
can be postcard pretty, its steep hills and rugged bluffs
overlooking the nation's most storied river, the Old Mississippi.
Stylish boutiques and coffee shops line Bluff Street. And it takes
less than a half-hour to get to the Illinois tourist town of
Galena, 15 miles to the southeast, with its antique stores and
historical sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up in the morning and see a sky that's cobalt blue,''
Link said. ``You forget about what smog was.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a much more affordable place for a young family. In
the Virginia suburbs, a cracker-box town house cost about $150,000,
Link said. Now the couple have a three-bedroom house with three
bathrooms, a fireplace, a two-car garage and a nice yard _ for
$108,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important than anything else, little Tabitha never
goes more than a day or two without seeing a grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spoil her rotten,'' Ms. Link said, confessing that she
and her husband had also got a bit spoiled. ``Now we've got baby
sitters whenever we want.''

METS ARE PUT IN THEIR PLACE: FAR, FAR BACK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After winning a surprising 88 games last year, the
Mets came into this season believing that they could finally
challenge the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. On May
31, fresh off their biggest trade in more than a decade and after
winning their ninth straight game, the Mets _ bolstered by the
addition of Mike Piazza _ trailed the Braves by just five games.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wednesday's embarrassing 12-1 drubbing at the hands of
the most dominant team in the league proved anything, it was that
the gap between the Mets and the Braves is widening, not shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt in anyone's mind, Andres Galarraga
pounded the point home with two 400-foot-plus home runs, one of
which cleared the retaining fence behind the left-field bullpen at
Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to improve to be as good as them,'' Manager Bobby
Valentine conceded after the Mets had lost for the 11th time in
their last 15 games. ``We have to pitch better, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of those losses have come in the Mets' first five meetings
with the Braves this season. And on the eve of a suddenly important
four-game set with the resurgent Philadelphia Phillies, the Mets
(46-43) have fallen a season-high 13{ games behind the Braves for
the third time this season. The Phillies, who lost, 3-2, in
Milwaukee Wednesday, also trail the Braves by 13{.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, then, that trade talks involving third baseman
Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox appear to have heated up
again for the Mets?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' brightest spot Wednesday came when their forgotten
reliever, Mel Rojas, pitched two scoreless middle innings, with the
Mets behind by 9-1, in his first appearance in two weeks. Enough
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since their nine-game winning streak, the Mets are 15-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything,'' said John Franco, who allowed four
hits and three runs in pitching the ninth, the day before the
hearing of his three-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of mind-boggling. At one time, we were 11 games over
.500. It just shows how bad we've played the last six weeks. I
don't know if today was the lowest point of the season. But it's a
low point.''
</P>
<P>
   Can things sink much lower?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see how they could for Masato Yoshii (4-5), who
has not won since May 27 _ a span of nine starts. After allowing
seven runs and nine hits in three and two-thirds innings Wednesday
_ including back-to-back first-inning home runs to Galarraga and
Ryan Klesko as the Braves jumped to a 3-0 lead _ the Japanese's
right-hander's earned run average is 4.13.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Yoshii nor his best friend, Hideo Nomo, has a victory
since the Mets acquired Nomo from the Los Angeles Dodgers on June
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm pitching all that poorly,'' said Yoshii, who
was tagged for five hits in the fourth before Bill Pulsipher came
in. ``Maybe they're picking up on certain patterns of how I'm
approaching hitters,'' he said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga surely picked up on something from both Yoshii and
Pulsipher. The Atlanta first baseman's three-run moon shot off
Pulsipher closed the book on Yoshii, capped a six-run fourth and
gave the Braves the 9-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Galarraga, who has 30 home runs, was asked if the
Braves have invaded the Mets' collective psyche and convinced them
that they cannot beat the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, probably,'' Galarraga said. ``Especially with
beating them five times already. The more beatings, they get more
frustrated, we get more positive and that's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was asked if the wild card was all the Mets have to look
forward to. ``It kind of seems that way now,'' said the catcher,
who drove in the Mets' only run with a third-inning double off
Denny Neagle (10-7). ``I think we have to get realistic and stop
looking at the big lead they have. We have to worry about doing
what we can to start going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had just four hits Wednesday, had better start
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies are at Shea beginning Thursday night and the
Pirates follow on Monday, before the Mets travel to Milwaukee and
Chicago. The Brewers and Cubs are both in the wild-card race, along
with the Phillies, Giants and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley, who was out of the starting lineup for the first
time since rejoining the team last Saturday, described the Phillies
and the Pirates as scrappy teams. The Braves, he said, are a
quality team.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was asked what adjective he would use to describe the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' he said. ``Right in between scrappy and
legitimate contenders. We have to do the little things to become
legitimate contenders. Galarraga had an incredible day. They do the
big things.''  &QL;

LAWYER SAYS EX-CADET WAS NOT PRESENT AT KILLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Calling it ``an all-or-nothing defense,''
David Graham's attorney told jurors Wednesday that the former Air
Force Academy cadet was not present when 16-year-old Adrianne Jones
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Dan Cogdell said during opening statements in
the capital murder trial that Graham is guilty only of trying to
cover up for a ``terrible woman's vengeance,'' referring to
Graham's former fiance, Diane Zamora. He said Zamora believed
incorrectly that Graham had sex with Jones, triggering her death
wish for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The defense scenario contrasts with prosecutor Mike Parrish's
opening arguments that Graham and Zamora participated equally in
the beating and shooting death of Jones, a sophomore at Mansfield
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell would not say Wednesady whether his client will testify
durig the trial. Zamora, who was convicted of the killing, has been
subpoenaed to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's defense also contradicts Zamora's testimony during her
February capital murder trial. She testified that both were present
and that Graham killed Jones and forced Zamora to go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and Diane, the evidence will show, did this capital
murder together,'' Parrish said, raising his voice and placing his
two fists together on a table in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish spent 20 minutes outlining the case against Graham,
which he said will include evidence that he and Zamora lured Jones
out of her Mansfield home on a school night, struck her with a
weight and shot her after she stumbled away and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As defenseless Adrianne Jones lay in that field on the ground,
David Graham puts two bullets in her head,'' Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cogdell said Graham loved Zamora so much that he agreed to
take the blame with her if she was caught. He said Zamora, a Naval
Academy midshipman at the time of her September 1996 arrest, was
consumed with jealousy because she thought Graham had sex with
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   During Zamora's trial, her attorney suggested that Graham and
Jones did not have sex, but no witnesses testified about the
matter. Parrish and Cogdell said in their opening remarks that the
two could not have had sex. One witness, a former cross-country
teammate of Jones and Graham, testified that she drove Jones home
from a track meet on the night that Graham said in his police
confession that the two had a tryst.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks, Cogdell explained a late-night phone
call from Graham to Jones the night of her slaying by saying that
Graham wanted to warn Jones that Zamora might do ``something
terrible.'' Cogdell did not say how or why Jones would leave her
house with Zamora if Graham had warned Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane Zamora did kill Adrianne Jones. David Graham did not.
David Graham was not there,'' he said. ``... He didn't love her; he
worshipped her. She filled a void in him, a need, a hole that had
been with him a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 20, pleaded not guilty to the charge of capital murder.
He faces life in prison if convicted of kidnapping and killing
Jones in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell told jurors that he will highlight differences between
Zamora's oral and written statements about the slaying, and show
that Graham's written statement is ``a piece of fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   By insisting that Graham was not present, Graham's attorneys may
lose the chance to argue that Graham is guilty of a lesser offense
than capital murder, such as murder or kidnapping, said Fort Worth
attorney Bill Lane, who has been analyzing the trial since jury
selection began last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you stand up and say `My client was not there,'
you're not going to have lesser charges,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell also attacked the way Grand Prairie detectives conducted
the investigation, saying they were more concerned about making an
arrest than properly investigating the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented nine witnesses on the first day of
testimony, including Jones' mother, Linda Jones. She described her
daughter _ often using the present tense _ as ``bright,
energy-plus, bouncing-off-the-wall happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after sitting down in the witness stand, Linda Jones
moaned and sobbed after spotting the handgun that was introduced as
evidence for a previous witness but that had not been removed from
the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Over defense objections, Parrish showed the jury more than a
dozen enlarged photos of Jones' body, as well as close-ups of the
gunshot and other wounds that Jones suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the jury of seven men, five women and one
female alternate took notes but displayed no visible reaction to
the photos.

SENATE VOTES TO WAIVE LAST SANCTIONS ON INDIA AND PAKISTAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate unanimously agreed Wednesday to give
President Clinton authority to temporarily waive most remaining
economic sanctions on India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed without dissent as an amendment to an
agriculture appropriations bill when its main opponent, Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, was in Cape Canaveral, Fla., training to be an
astronaut for his coming space mission.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the measure said it would give the United States more
flexibility in dealing with the spread of nuclear arms in South
Asia, and erase a penalty that hurt American businesses more than
the targeted countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unilateral sanctions rarely achieve their goals,'' said Sen.
Pat Roberts, R-Kan. ``They hurt American workers and diminish U.S.
strength in international affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to pressure from farmers, both the House and Senate in
the past week had overwhelmingly exempted grain sales from the
sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan after those two countries
conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was scheduled Wednesday to put out for bid an order for
350,000 metric tons of wheat, a contract worth more than $40
million that American wheat farmers would have been barred from
bidding on had the sanctions remained in place.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration had also sought wider authority
to waive all other sanctions, except military aid, as a diplomatic
tool to entice India and Pakistan to curb their nuclear arms
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Senate agreed to give Clinton that power for up
to one year. Clinton would be required to consult with Congress on
his decision, and the Secretary of State would have to report to
Congress on the economic and national security developments in
Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would allow Clinton to waive restrictions contained
in the Arms Export Control Act. It would restore financing from the
Export-Import Bank, and provide for the extension of loans or
technical assistance from international organizations like the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had already sidestepped some of those
provisions by defining certain assistance as humanitarian aid,
which is exempted from the law. Wednesday's action is the first
step toward enactment. The Senate still has to approve the
underlying appropriations bill. The House would also have to concur
and, if necessary, negotiate any differences in a conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Glenn, the author of the original sanctions
legislation, blocked the broader waiver authority from being
attached to the exemption on grain sales. Glenn said granting the
president that authority would render the sanctions effectively
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   With the grain sales exempted, however, senators acknowledged
that the largest and most painful penalty had been removed, leaving
little to punish India and Pakistan for conducting tests that drew
international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Glenn, Jack Sparks, said the senator would
continue to fight the broader waiver authority. ``This bill still
has to go conference, and we can oppose it along the way,'' Sparks
said.

LAWYER SAYS FORMER AIR FORCE CADET LIED TO PROTECT ZAMORA  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Prosecutors have called this the ``David
and Diane did it'' case, but when former Air Force Academy cadet
David Graham's capital murder trial began Wednesday, defense
lawyers offered a radically different version of events:
</P>
<P>
   Graham's ex-fiancee _ former Naval Academy midshipman Diane
Zamora _ did it all by herself, they said, acting out of jealousy
over a romantic liaison that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Graham, 20, said he lied when he told Zamora he had
sex with 16-year-old Adrianne Jones, and he lied again when he
confessed to helping Zamora kill the girl on the night of Dec. 4,
1995 on a remote road south of Grand Prairie near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his client spent two hours typing out an elaborate
confession to the crime following his arrest in 1996, defense
attorney Dan Cogdell insisted Wednesday that ``David Graham was not
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, Cogdell conceded that his client had
telephoned Jones a few hours before her slaying. But rather than
luring her to her death, Cogdell said, Graham made a fruitless
attempt to warn her that Zamora was in a jealous rage because she
suspected Graham and Jones were romantically involved. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Graham later helped cover up his high school sweetheart's
crime, cleaning blood from the car and hiding the murder weapon,
Cogdell told jurors.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``He vowed to Diane that night that if they were ever caught,
he would confess along with her,'' the lawyer said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Graham and Zamora were arrested months later after Zamora
confided in her new classmates at the Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md., and they turned her in. Both signed confessions saying they
plotted and carried out Jones' murder. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Zamora, 20, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in a
separate trial in Fort Worth last February. Graham's trial was
moved to New Braunfels because of publicity. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At the Jones family's request, prosecutors did not seek the
death penalty for either of the defendants. If Graham is convicted
of capital murder, he will receive a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told the seven-man, five-woman jury Wednesday that
Graham and Zamora acted together to lure Jones from her Tarrant
County home late one Sunday night, then killed her for coming
between them.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers also conceded that a key portion of Graham's
confession _ his written account of a one-night stand with Jones
after a track meet about a month before her fatal shooting _ was
bogus, and they presented evidence to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Bartlett, a former Mansfield High School student who was a
cross-country teammate of Graham and Jones, told jurors the
encounter could not have occurred. Bartlett, who did not testify in
Zamora's trial, said Wednesday that she, not Graham, had given
Jones a ride home from school that night.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said Graham had fabricated the story during an argument
with Zamora. The tale of the affair sent Zamora into a rage that
caused her to kill Jones, the lawyer asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors agreed that Graham's lie about the affair led to
Jones' death, but they said it was Graham who shot Jones twice in
the head after Zamora clobbered her with a lead weight. The murder
weapon was later found in the attic of Graham's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's untrue story to Diane is that ... the little harlot
(Jones) had taken advantage of him,'' said prosecutor Mike Parrish,
referring to Graham's confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rage, she (Zamora) demands the death of Adrianne Jones,''
Parrish said. ``Inexplicably, he goes along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell told jurors that Parrish was only ``half right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane Zamora did kill Adrianne Jones. David Graham did not,''
he said. ``David Graham was not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said Graham later gave a ``false confession'' to help
his former true love, Zamora, whom he worshipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``She filled a need in him, a hole in him that had been there
some time,'' said Cogdell, describing Graham as somewhat of a loner
who had never done well in relationships with girls before meeting
Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   They met through a mutual interest _ the Civil Air Patrol _ and
vowed to get married in 2000 after graduating from their respective
military academies.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham came to learn that Zamora was a ``very jealous
woman,'' Cogdell said. ``She accused David Graham on a regular,
almost-constant basis of being unfaithful. She would create
scenarios and accusations in her mind that had no basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``David would deny, deny, deny those accusations,'' but Zamora
``would fixate on them,'' he said. ``She knew David had a high
opinion of Adrianne Jones and she seized on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother, Linda Jones, provided the day's most
poignant moment the second she sat in the witness chair. Noticing
that the murder weapon, a Russian Army pistol, had been left on the
witness stand by the previous witness, Jones burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you move that?'' she asked sheepishly before asking for a
break to compose herself.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, she described her daughter as a bright,
happy sophomore whose goal was to earn a soccer scholarship to
college. She worked part time at a fried chicken outlet in
Mansfield, which is just southeast of Fort Worth, while dedicating
herself to athletics to overcome a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Jones told jurors that the last time she saw her daughter,
she was in her bedroom studying and getting her clothes ready to
wear to school the next day. The teen-ager apparently left the
house later, without her family's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, she was found shot to death in a rural area
near Joe Pool Lake.
</P>

PRICE-FIXING TRIAL OPENS FOR 3 EX-ARCHER OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In opening arguments in one of the largest
price-fixing trials ever, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday that
former senior executives with Archer Daniels Midland Co. ``were
caught red-handed'' on secret recordings conspiring with
competitors to set the market prices for a popular feed additive.
</P>
<P>
   But a defense lawyer for one of the executives challenged that
claim, saying that the recordings of his client had captured very
little, and that meetings the government portrayed as incriminating
involved little more than discussions about the functioning of the
market for the additive, lysine.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening statements, the two sides disclosed for the first
time that price fixing in the lysine market predated the entry of
Archer Daniels in the business, involving a small cartel of
Japanese and other Asian companies. And a defense lawyer also said
that, during investigation the government's chief informant on at
least one occasion secretly taped an FBI agent involved in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Three former executives from Archer Daniels _ Michael D.
Andreas, the former vice chairman who is on leave from the company;
Terrance Wilson, the former head of the company's corn processing
division, and Mark E. Whitacre, the former head of its bioproducts
division _ were charged by the government as participating in the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Whitacre who will clearly be at center stage
throughout most of the trial. It was Whitacre who first disclosed
the price fixing between the competitors and who secretly recorded
conversations over two and a half years. But he became a defendant
in the case after the government learned he had violated his
cooperation agreement by taking millions of dollars from Archer
Daniels, even as he was working with law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Over more than an hour, the prosecutor, James M. Griffin,
methodically described the government's evidence, as he led the
jury through a narrative of the major meetings during which the
lysine competitors agreed to fix prices and allocate production
volumes among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said that to prove the crime the government had only to
provide evidence that an agreement to fix prices had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is the crime,'' he said. ``It does not matter if
the conspirators kept the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said that the government would prove that price fixing
was nothing new at Archer Daniels. For example, he said that one
witness would testify that Wilson had been fixing prices on citric
acid, a food additive, since 1991, before the lysine scheme began.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin added that the taped evidence alone proved the roles of
Andreas and Wilson. ``Michael Andreas and Terry Wilson were caught
red-handed on audio and videotape committing the crime they are
charged with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But John Bray, a lawyer for Andreas, said that there was no
compelling recordings clearly proving that his client had engaged
in wrongdoing, and that he was innocent. ``If ever there was a
case, ever, where there are two sides to the story, then this is
it,'' Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than encouraging lawbreaking, Andreas was trying to take
on the illegal Asian cartel, Bray said. At times, he said, his
client can be heard on tape saying that Archer Daniels ``does not
make deals'' with competitors relating to price and volume.
Moreover, Bray said, the tapes that do exist are ambiguous as to
their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the case emerged, Bray said, was that in 1992
Whitacre had falsely told Archer Daniels that a competitor was
attempting to extort millions of dollars from the company. Archer
Daniels called in the government, and the FBI went to discuss the
allegations with Whitacre. During that visit, Whitacre told the
agent about a price-fixing conspiracy. Bray contended that the
revelation was designed to take attention away from the bogus
extortion story, which he said Whitacre had concocted for his own
enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening, Bill T. Walker, a lawyer for Whitacre, said that
the opening statements showed that his client was going to be ``the
whipping boy'' of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have seen here,'' Walker said, ``has been a
roasting'' of Dr. Whitacre,'' whom he described as a man with a
Ph.D. who built the company's lysine business from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, it was Whitacre who had brought the entire
case to the government. Without his client, he said, the government
would not have obtained any of its recordings. ``Everyone is here
for one reason,'' he said. ``Dr. Whitacre went to the FBI.''

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES $3.5 BILLION FOR IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans took a crucial step Wednesday
toward approving full financing of the International Monetary Fund,
signaling a willingness to reverse their opposition to the agency
out of concern that the economic crises overseas might spread to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before a House panel voted $3.5 billion for the agency,
far below the $17.9 billion requested by the Clinton
administration, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader and a
harsh foe of the IMF, virtually conceded the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I suppose they will probably get about as much
money as they're looking for,'' Armey said in a speech to the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives have been suspicious of the agency's lending
practices and critical of recent loans to prop up Russia and bail
out Asia. But with the Asian financial crisis deepening and
threatening U.S. agricultural exports, Wall Street's anxiety is
rising and building pressure on House Republicans to drop their
objections to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich acknowledged the growing concerns last
month when he noted, ``A lot of members who were wavering last fall
now realize that it's very important for us to pass this.''
</P>
<P>
   Other top Republicans concurred privately with Armey on
Wednesday, while predicting a loud fight when the issue goes to the
full Appropriations Committee and then to the House floor later
this summer. And some conservatives are still threatening to attach
provisions that would restrict funds for family planning efforts
overseas _ a measure that President Clinton opposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the full amount in March. The Clinton
administration termed the House's response a piecemeal approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for this Congress to get serious and stop fooling
around,'' Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said Tuesday.
``This is just back to close-down-the-government time, you know,
and they play these games, and there is serious work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the IMF's programs were heightened this week when
it was forced to dig deep into a little-used fund of last resort to
provide up to $13.8 billion in new loans to Russia over the next
two years to help stabilize the ruble. The agency has not dipped
into this fund in two decades and tapping it now severely limits
its overall lending ability.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Foreign Operations subcommittee of the
Appropriations Committee only approved one-fifth of the
administration's request for IMF money Wednesday night, members of
the panel signaled that they recognized the urgency of the agency's
need for more financing.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the top Democrat on the
subcommittee, agreed that the monetary agency operated too
secretively and made questionable judgments. She said that the
agency eventually could be scrapped _ ``Dismantle it, erase it,
start from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, she said, the full amount of money should be approved
to stop the Asian crisis from spreading to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your house is burning down, you can't be concerned that the
roof is leaking,'' she said. ``We have an emergency at our
doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who dominate the panel, said the agency's
inadequacies could be discussed later. Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif.,
said that adding the full $17.9 billion now would be a flippant
move.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee defeated Pelosi's proposal by voice vote and
then approved the underlying bill, which, because of the small
percentage of financing for the monetary agency, provides only
about half of the $31.97 billion the president requested for all
foreign operations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill still includes tough restrictions on the monetary
fund's lending practices that the administration is resisting.
These include ending subsidized interest rates for regular
borrowers and releasing edited transcripts of the minutes of the
fund's board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want the money, that's life,'' said Rep. Robert
Livingston, R-La., chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And the bill faces other hazards. Anti-abortion forces have
vowed to attach a proposal restricting money for overseas family
planning services. Thus, the final version could offer the IMF
money the president wants, but he could still veto it if it
restricts the availability of family planning funds.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights forces won a slim victory in the committee
meeting Wednesday night on another family-planning issue. Abortion
opponents had written the bill so that it would have allowed groups
funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development that
advocate ``natural'' family planning _ the rhythm method _ to
withhold information about other forms of contraception.
</P>
<P>
   But on an 8-7 vote, with no debate, proponents of abortion
rights prevailed. They included language that requires ``natural''
family planning advocates to refer people elsewhere when they seek
information on alternative methods of avoiding pregnancy. &QL;

U.S. TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIAN COMPANIES THAT AIDED IRAN
MISSILE PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said on Wednesday that
it would impose trade sanctions on nine Russian companies and
institutions that have been helping Iran with its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's action comes as the Russian government
publicly announced an investigation into the nine enterprises for
violating new export control laws worked out in cooperation with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The trade sanctions would be the first imposed by the Clinton
administration on Russian companies helping Iran, though American
assistance to seven of the nine companies had already been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian assistance to Iran was largely in the form of
research grants and scientific partnership programs originally
designed to keep former Soviet scientists working after the
collapse of the Soviet Union and to make sure they would not
emigrate to help states like Iran with their weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's announcement was timed to head off a
congressional effort to override President Clinton's veto of a bill
that would impose sanctions on any company believed _ but not
proven _ to be aiding Iran's missile, nuclear or chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House put off its vote on overriding the Clinton veto, which
was scheduled for Wednesday. While the House is expected to vote to
override, administration officials say they are working to sustain
the veto in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, was
passed overwhelmingly by both houses and would affect Russian and
Chinese companies the hardest. It was strongly supported by the
pro-Israel lobby, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the bill for numerous reasons, officials say.
First, they feared it would create a nationalist backlash in Russia
and make it harder to win Moscow's cooperation on halting these
exports. Second, the bill calls for sanctions on the basis of
``credible evidence,'' a low threshhold of proof, and allows the
president to waive the sanctions only for reasons of national
security, a high threshhold for waiver.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said: ``The
standard of evidence is far too low. We constantly see evidence
that is credible but just turns out to be wrong. That's not a
serious way to do business in the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior official said the main issue was the need for
Russian and Chinese cooperation to stop dangerous exports. ``We can
impose a few sanctions and show our outrage and feel better, but in
reality, that's often symbolic. The real way you get to the heart
of the problem is through the creation and effective enforcement of
Russian controls, and you put that at risk with a confrontational
sanctions route.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who is about to travel to Moscow, on
Wednesday praised the Russian decision to investigate the
companies..
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has been promoting U.S.-Russian scientific and space
cooperation, called the Russian move on Wednesday ``an encouraging
step forward.'' Gore has been frustrated by the Russian help to
Iran, because he has also had to be responsive to Israeli concerns
about the danger posed by the Iranian nuclear, chemical and missile
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to work closely with the Russian government
at every level to close off exports of dangerous, destabilizing
weapons technology,'' he said on Wednesday. ``This includes
imposing trade restrictions and suspending U.S. government programs
or assistance to entities under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade restrictions will include bans on exports and imports
and financial transactions, the officials said, which are more
sweeping penalties than those called for under the bill Clinton
vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for a ban on the export to Russian companies
helping Iran's missile program of specific commodities on the
American munitions list or the Commerce Department's list of items
that can have military use. The restrictions announced on Wednesday
cover all the imports or exports of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is designed to send a strong message to other Russian
companies that want to deal with Iran that the U.S. is prepared to
inflict economic pain,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said they did not believe the new restrictions,
announced in an apparent hurry, would affect U.S.-Russian
cooperation on the International Space Station or plans to launch
American satellites on Russian rockets. One of the entities
sanctioned on Wednesday is Glavkosmos, which is the Russian
equivalent of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   American scientific assistance to all Russian enterprises runs
about $50 million a year, officials said. They could not provide a
figure on the amount of trade the nine enterprises have with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States was satisfied with the actions of the
Russian government, President Clinton's spokesman, Mike McCurry,
said: ``We believe that those steps indicate the seriousness to
which the Russian Federation has taken the expression of concern
we've made on certain technology transfers. They involve a lot of
the premier Russian enterprises that have been involved in
technology transfers and they could be very significant,'' he said.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Targets of the investigation were identified by the White House
as the INOR scientific center, the Grafit and Ployus research
institutes, the Tikhomirov institute, Glavkosmos, the Komintern
plant in Novosibirsk, the MOSO company, Baltic State Technical
University and Europalace 2000.

SPORTS COLUMN: NO STATUS IS RANGERS' STATUS QUO  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Up on the stage, the Rangers had their ducks all in a row: Mike
Richter, Dave Checketts, Neil Smith, John Muckler, Brian Leetch.
And now Smith, the president and general manager, stood at the
lectern and mentioned how it had been ``a very exciting and
nerve-racking'' few months.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting and nerve-racking months?
</P>
<P>
   Smith had to be thinking of April, May and June in 1994, when
the Rangers won the Stanley Cup with Richter as their goaltender.
Those months were exciting and nerve-racking, but since then almost
nothing about the Rangers has been exciting and nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Smith was talking about the prolonged salary
negotiations with Richter, no longer a free agent now that he has
signed a four-year, $21.8 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting and nerve-racking? Maybe to Smith, who couldn't afford
to antagonize Ranger loyalists again after Mark Messier's departure
to Vancouver a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But to anyone else, the Rangers, in retaining Richter, merely
retained a segment of their status quo that no longer has much
status in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Rangers' hierarchy, this is what passes now for
exciting and nerve-racking. And with the Knicks temporarily out of
business in a summer of labor discontent in the National Basketball
Association, this is also what passes for exciting and
nerve-racking at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA lockout delays the start of the Knicks' season or
cancels it, another bad Ranger team will be all the more glaring at
the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For his $21.8 million, Richter bought the annual party line,
saying that with the Rangers, he had a ``good chance of winning a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, must have been thinking of the 1994 Rangers, not last
season's Rangers, who skated on a treadmill to oblivion, finishing
below even the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for Wayne Gretzky, last season's Rangers might not
have qualified for the American Hockey League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, retaining Richter was important. He is a good goaltender.
In the 1994 playoffs he was a great goaltender, but he might never
be that sharp again. If the Rangers don't get better as a team, he
will never need to be that sharp again.
</P>
<P>
   Retaining Richter did not improve the Rangers for Coach John
Muckler; looking back on the Messier mess, retaining Richter merely
improved their public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were not wrong in not offering Messier a three-year
contract. Battered and bruised even before he turned 37 at
midseason, he wasn't worth Vancouver's three-year, $18 million
investment. But the Rangers had alienated their loyalists with the
way the Messier negotiations were mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Messier's mess helped Richter get all the
millions the goaltender wanted because Smith couldn't afford
another free-agent faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts, the Garden president, told of walking along Madison
Avenue on Tuesday as a Ranger loyalist leaned out of a car window
and yelled, ``Sign Richter.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Leetch isn't signed to a new contract by next July 1,
Smith will be confronted with another potentially explosive
free-agent situation.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Rangers are to be a much better team, Smith needs to
obtain a few better players, especially a goal scorer for Gretzky's
line. Their only free-agent acquisitions have been John MacLean,
the former Devils right wing, and Scott Fraser, another right wing.
Still out there are Ziggy Palffy, who had 45 goals for the
Islanders last season, and Scott Niedermayer, the Devils
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Smith talked of making a trade or two before training camp opens
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreasonable to think that you're going to trade for a
superstar,'' he said. ``With 27 teams, there just aren't enough
superstars to go around, but I'm hopeful we can make some trades
that will make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   While Smith endured his exciting and nerve-racking negotiations
with Richter, other teams were signing free agents with impact. The
Dallas Stars grabbed Brett Hull, the Chicago Blackhawks landed Doug
Gilmour and the Red Wings took defenseman Uwe Krupp.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Rangers' coming season (and playoffs?) do not
appear to be too exciting and nerve-racking.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Times Square subway station _ a bewildering snarl
of grime-encrusted tunnels that is the neglected basement of what
has become the city's most animated neighborhood _ is finally about
to receive the renovation that has been promised for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials requested bids this week for the first phase
of an eight-year, $180 million project to redesign and refurbish
the city's busiest subway station, widening corridors and adding
staircases and elevators for the thick crowds of workers,
theatergoers and tourists that have begun flooding into the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The project will replace the station's filthy tiles and
gum-plated floors, seen by 500,000 riders a day, with bright walls
and nonslip granite, highlighted with stainless steel accents and
restored mosaics. Several major artworks will be installed,
including a 53-foot-long porcelain mural of a futuristic subway
that Roy Lichtenstein created for the station before he died last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is scheduled to award
the contract for the first phase of the project in October, and
construction _ which will disrupt subway service on and off for
years _ should begin by spring 1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The project is a scaled-down version of a much more grandiose
plan that was unveiled in the early 1990s, before the recession
caused real estate developers to pull out of a plan to contribute
$90 million for a large rotunda and underground shopping plaza.
Now, despite the boom that has transformed the Times Square area
into a family-friendly arcade of theaters and shops, the MTA is
paying for the entire project itself.
</P>
<P>
   Several good-government groups have criticized the MTA for not
requiring developers who are profiting from the boom to build
escalators into the station or to contribute to its upkeep. But by
using public money for the project, transit officials say, they are
at least able to assure riders that this renovation will actually
take place, unlike the many false starts that have left the station
a decaying monument to the haphazard subway competition of the
early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really it,'' said MTA Chairman E. Virgil Conway.
``It's really going to happen. No more diddling around.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA has already begun closing off darkened corners of the
station to prepare for the construction, and telling underground
merchants to prepare for relocation. After 37 years of operation,
the Record Mart, a renowned Latino music store near the north end
of the N and R subway platforms, will have to move to make way for
an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure I believe it's real,'' said Jesse
Moskowitz, who has owned the store since its opening in 1961. ``But
this time they sound very serious. We're getting ready to move.''
</P>
<P>
   For most riders, the most striking change, in addition to the
new walls, ceilings and floors, will be the changes to the
mezzanine above the platforms, an area filled throughout the day by
nearly impassable streams of riders transferring between the
shuttle and the north-south lines. To ease pedestrian circulation,
the project will widen the main corridor under 42nd Street, at the
north end of the Seventh Avenue platform, by about 15 feet,
improving sight lines and removing sharp corners.
</P>
<P>
   Ventilation will be slightly improved, although no fans will be
installed. Elevators will for the first time make the station
accessible to the handicapped, and signs will be clearer, aiding
the thousands of tourists whose first venture into subway riding
often begins at Times Square and ends abruptly when they become
hopelessly disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally going to make things the way we always would
have liked them,'' said William Madden, the program manager for the
project. He noted that the 94-year-old station was an agglomeration
of four lines originally run by two competing subway companies,
which accounts for its glued-together nature.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the project won high praise from riders' groups
and the Municipal Art Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very handsome, very intelligent,'' said Brendan Sexton,
the art society's president, who recently saw the completed plans.
``They've really taken into account pedestrian travel underground,
improving the lines of sight and way-finding.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sexton said he was disappointed that the MTA was letting
property owners off the hook by not requiring them to build
escalators and large entrances to the station, even though most
received tax breaks for building in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said he did not think that the extra staircases were
important enough to warrant seeking contributions from developers.

 HINCAPIE CAN'T TRADE RED, WHITE AND BLUE FOR YELLOW  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOLET, France _ A few Americans' hearts were broken Wednesday
on the D1 two-lane road at a spot marked by a green banner just
outside the village of Plumelec in western France.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among those affected was George Hincapie, who wears the
red, white and blue, star-spangled jersey of the U.S. national
bicycle road-race champion. ``It's been a dream of mine to wear the
jersey in the Tour de France especially,'' the 25-year-old Hincapie
said before the start of the daily stage. ``The only thing I'd
trade it for is the yellow jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, the U.S. Postal Service rider was second in the
overall standing, two seconds behind the Tour's leader, the man in
the yellow jersey. Hincapie, his teammates and their officials knew
that if he finished first, second or third in the first of three
time-bonus sprints of the day and the leader, Bo Hamburger, a Dane
with the Casino team, finished behind him, the American would be
the race's virtual leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it'll be hard but you can't pass up a chance like
this,'' said Hincapie, a native of Queens, N.Y., who now lives in
Charlotte, N.C. ``I can hope. I feel confident and I'm going to try
my best. I'm a little nervous, excited, but that's the Tour de
France.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Hincapie's third Tour. A teammate and another American,
Frankie Andreu of Dearborn, Mich., has already ridden in six
editions of the world's greatest bicycle race and finished all of
them. With that much more experience, he put the mission into
perspective: ``It'll be hard,'' Andreu said. ``The whole team will
ride to put George in position to sprint but it'll be a very
difficult two seconds to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was too difficult. Stuart O'Grady, an Australian
with the Gan team who was in third place over all and a second
behind Hincapie, won the sprint and the six bonus seconds deducted
from his overall elapsed time. Hincapie was third, gaining two
seconds that no longer mattered. O'Grady was now the virtual leader
as Hamburger gained no time.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian, 24 and an Olympic champion in team pursuit, also
won the second bonus sprint and finished third in the final one
while neither Hincapie nor Hamburger scored. O'Grady leads
Hamburger, in second place, by 11 seconds, with Hincapie third,
also 11 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the fourth of 21 stages, a 252-kilometer
(156-mile) journey from Plouay in Brittany to Cholet in the Loire
region, O'Grady exchanged his virtual leadership for the real thing
_ he mounted the victory podium and slipped into the yellow jersey.
``That feels wonderful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It felt particularly wonderful to win here. Brittany is mad
about bicycle racing and Plouay, the start, is particularly wild
about the sport and annually stages a one-day race that attracts
many tens of thousands of spectators. The town will be the host to
the world championships in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The flat stage was won in a sprint finish by Jeroen Blijlevens,
a Dutchman with TVM, in a time of 5 hours 48 minutes 32 seconds, an
average speed of 43 kilometers an hour (about 27 miles an hour) in
chilly weather. Second was Nicola Minali, an Italian with Riso
Scotti, half a bicycle length behind, and third was Jan Svorada, a
Czech with Mapei and a victor two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Grady, Hamburger and Hincapie finished in a large bunch of
riders eight seconds behind the winner. The American was among a
handful who were slowed by another mass crash, about two kilometers
from the finish, but got up quickly and sped off. Another victim
was Mario Cipollini, the world's top sprinter, who was unable to
compete in his specialty for the second time in this 85th Tour
because of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie was disappointed afterward but not crushed. ``I did my
best,'' he said. ``Not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hincapie was eager for Thursday's stage, which also has
three bonus sprints. Like him, his eight Postal Service teammates
were guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team will do its best to get him up there at the front and
then it's up to George,'' said Marty Jemison of Park City, Utah.
``We all know it will be tough but we're hoping.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Americans on a rival team, Cofidis, were also rooting for
Hincapie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George has a great chance,'' said Kevin Livingston, of
Austin, Texas They were teammates on Motorola two years ago. ``He's
a good friend and I'd like to see it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Julich of Glenwood Springs, Colo., and lately
Philadelphia, another former Motorola rider, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speaking to Kevin,'' he said, ``and we think maybe this
is the year an American takes the yellow jersey. No one has had it
since Greg LeMond in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a big honor to represent America in this race
because cycling isn't so popular back home,'' said Julich, who is
one of six Americans in this year's Tour. ``It takes a lot of
character to be in this sport because when you're growing up, all
your friends are playing baseball, football and basketball and
you're doing an obscure sport called cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it all becomes worth it when you ride in the Tour,''
Julich said. ``That's the pinnacle of the sport. And the yellow
jersey is the pinnacle of the pinnacle. I would love to see George
in the yellow jersey.'' &QL;

COLOMBIA TAKES STEP TOWARD PEACE AS GROUPS PLAN TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Although peace remains a distant goal,
Colombia seems to have made more progress toward ending its
34-year-old civil war in just six days than during the past six
years combined.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Colombia's second-largest guerrilla organization
and civilian groups agreed to hold a national convention somewhere
in Colombia before Oct. 12 in an effort to reach a permanent peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, leaders of the country's right-wing paramilitary
death squads, which have been attacking the guerrillas and their
civilian supporters, announced that they too are willing to open
peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel accord and the paramilitary statement came six days
after a historic encounter between President-elect Andres Pastrana
and the top commanders of Colombia's largest guerrilla group, the
Rebel Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who takes office Aug. 7, journeyed into the Colombian
mountains last Thursday for a secret meeting with the guerrilla
chieftains. The two sides agreed to initiate peace negotiations
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of talks held in a 13th-century monastery near
the German city of Wurzburg, leaders of the rebel National
Liberation Army, or ELN, said they would consider ending its
practices of kidnapping for ransom and attacking the nation's vital
oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met and got to know the guerrillas. I think they are telling
us the truth,`` said a buoyant Jaime Bernal Cuellar, Colombia's
attorney general, who took part in the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an unexpected opening,'' added Leon Valencia, a
guerrilla, in an interview from Germany with the Bogota station
Radionet. ``It's a good beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombians were especially pleased because the pending peace
talks will be the first in six years. The last serious attempt at
negotiations between the government and rebels broke down in March
1992 shortly after they began in Tlaxcala, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the rebels have gained the upper hand in the war,
which has left tens of thousands dead and displaced 1 million of
Colombia's 32 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe the guerrillas can overthrow the government. But the
insurgents, who number between 10,000 and 15,000, have dealt the
120,000 troops of the poorly trained Colombian army a series of
humiliating defeats. The rebels now maintain a presence in about
half of the country's 1,071 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   During the past four years, the rebels refused to negotiate with
the government of President Ernesto Samper. They consider his
administration illegitimate because Samper was elected in 1994 with
the help of $6.1 million from the Cali cocaine cartel.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the 21-point agreement was signed by ELN
representatives and a delegation made up of some of Colombia's most
prestigious academics, business leaders, union officials and
clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ELN refused to disarm or to discuss a cease-fire,
the document includes provisions to ``humanize'' the war. For
example, the rebels agreed to refrain from using anti-personnel
mines in conflict zones and renounced the kidnappings of the
elderly, children and pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN said it would renounce kidnappings-for-ransom altogether
if alternative means of financing the organization were available.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the ELN and FARC rebels earned about $1.1 billion last
year through kidnappings, extortion and protection payments from
drug traffickers, according to a government document published last
week in the Bogota newsweekly Cambio 16.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues spelled out in the accord include holding a
nationwide forum to discuss Colombia's oil policies. The ELN
contends that foreign oil companies are robbing the nation's
natural resources and has dynamited pipelines more than 500 times
in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Once the forum begins, the ELN has promised to refrain from
attacking oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe that after more than three decades of
war, the rebels will ultimately reject the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Francisco Mesa of the Bogota group Pais Libre, which
assists the relatives of kidnapping victims, said the ELN's pledge
to stop snatching pregnant women and children means little since
they usually abduct well-to-do ranchers and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Rangel, a former security adviser to the Samper
government, said the guerrillas may be attempting to win political
favor at home and abroad as they prepare for war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dialogue (may be) part of a political tactic within a war
strategy,`` Rangel said. ``They will continue to develop their
plans for war.``
</P>
<P>
   Others are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to believe that, for the first time in a long time,
there exists a sincere desire for peace within the armed
insurgency,'' wrote columnist Enrique Santos Calderon in the Bogota
daily El Tiempo.

3 DUTCH MARINES ARRESTED AS DRUG SMUGGLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ Three Dutch marines involved in
drug-control efforts in the Caribbean have been arrested in
connection with the smuggling of close to 700 pounds of cocaine to
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were carried on a military plane that was normally
used in the anti-drug campaign in the Dutch Antilles, the islands
off the Venezuelan coast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dutch are known for their lenient policy toward
soft drugs, the discovery of the smuggling, which involved hard
drugs that are strictly outlawed, has infuriated the government.
According to government investigators, the marines apparently were
acting as couriers for civilian drug smugglers based in South
America and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   They could apparently carry their goods with ease, because there
is little customs control over military forces on the Dutch island
of Curacao, their point of departure, or on the military air base
in the Netherlands that was their destination.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the smuggling route is an embarrassment for the
Dutch government, which is expecting an official visit from Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, the American drugs policy adviser, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That visit has itself stirred anger in the government. Although
the general is ostensibly coming here to observe how the Dutch and
other European countries cope with drug use, before his arrival he
condemned the Dutch drug policy in an interview as ``an unmitigated
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, three marines and 11 civilians have been arrested in the
last few days in connection with the smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators apparently had been watching the
network since March before they intercepted a load of cocaine as
marines brought it off the plane in bags in the Netherlands.
Another 100 pounds of cocaine were found in the home of a Dutch
sergeant major living in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   The minister of defense said the behavior of the marines was
``scandalous.'' He said that ``military who deal in drugs are
fired.'' One of the arrested men served aboard the Dutch frigate,
Pieter Florisz, a ship that patrols the Caribbean around the
Antilles in order to intercept drug smuggling and coordinate with
similar American efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that they were struck by the casual and easy
way the couriers could operate: They simply carried military canvas
bags holding the drugs on to the plane they were taking from
Curacao back to the Netherlands or asked colleagues to take an
extra bag for them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, one of the three men, the sergeant major, found
that he had too large a load to send on the plane, so he casually
took the remainder home, according to investigators who found about
100 pounds in the man's home in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the military men had little idea where the
drugs were bought or where they would end up because they carried
the drugs for an organization of ``big guys'' based in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Dutch navy said that he could not be certain
that military aircraft or vessels had never been used before for
drug smuggling and that professional drug syndicates that operate
in the Caribbean ``inevitably pose a risk.'' From now on, he said,
all military luggage will be closely inspected.

NGUYEN NGOC LOAN, 67, DIES; EXECUTED VIET CONG PRISONER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (rm) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nguyen Ngoc Loan, the quick-tempered South Vietnamese national
police commander whose impromptu execution of a Viet Cong prisoner
on a Saigon street in the Tet offensive of 1968 helped galvanize
American public opinion against the war, died on Tuesday at his
home in Burke, Va. He was 67 and had operated a pizza parlor in
nearby Dale City.
</P>
<P>
   A son, Larry Nguyen, said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In a long war that claimed two million lives, the death of a
single Viet Cong official would hardly have seemed noteworthy,
especially in a week when thousands of insurgents were killed
mounting an offensive that included the beheading of women and
children in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brig. Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan raised his pistol on Feb.
1, 1968, extended his arm and fired a bullet through the head of
the prisoner, who stood with his hands tied behind his back, the
general did so in full view of an NBC cameraman and an Associated
Press photographer.
</P>
<P>
   And when the film was shown on television and the picture
appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world, the
images created an immediate revulsion at a seemingly gratuitous act
of savagery that was widely seen as emblematic of a seemingly
gratuitous war.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, by Eddie Adams, was especially vivid, a frozen
moment that put a wincing face of horror on the war. Taken almost
at once with the squeeze of the trigger, the photo showed the
prisoner, unidentified and wearing black shorts and a plaid shirt,
in a final grimace as the bullet passed through his brain. Close
examination of the photo, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1969,
showed the slug leaving his head.
</P>
<P>
   For all the emotional impact, the episode had little immediate
influence on on the tide of American involvement in the war, which
continued seven years longer, until the evacuation of Saigon in
1975. Indeed, it was a full four years after the execution that
another indelible image of the war created a new round of
revulsion, the sight of a screaming 9-year-old girl as she ran
naked along a road after having been burned in a South Vietnamese
napalm attack.
</P>
<P>
   The execution changed General Loan's life.
</P>
<P>
   One of 11 children of a prosperous mechanical engineer, Loan, a
native of Hue, had graduated near the top of his class at the
University of Hue and begun a career as a jet pilot in the South
Vietnamese Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   As a close friend of Nguyen Cao Ky, the swashbuckling pilot who
became South Vietnam's premier in 1965, Loan, then a colonel, was
put in charge of the national police and gained an immediate
reputation among western reporters for his flashpoint temper and
towering rages at the scenes of Viet Cong attacks against civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who knew him said that Loan would not have carried
out the execution of the prisoner if there had not been reporters
and photographers on the scene. But Loan insisted his action was
justified because the prisoner had been the captain of a terrorist
squad that had killed the family of one of his deputy commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the killing and other summary executions by the South's
military during the Tet offensive drew immediate rebukes from
American officials, and a few days after the incident, Ky, the
former premier who had become Vice President, said the prisoner had
not been a part of the Vietcong military but was ``a very
high-ranking'' political official.
</P>
<P>
   Loan later suggested that the execution had not been the rash
act it appeared to be but had been carried out because a deputy
commander he had ordered to shoot had hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, `Then I must do it,' '' he said. ``If you hesitate,
if you didn't do your duty, the men won't follow you.''
</P>
<P>
   Vo Suu, an NBC cameraman at the scene, recalled that immediately
after the shooting the general walked over to a reporter and said,
``These guys kill a lot of our people, and I think Buddha will
forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was severely wounded while charging a Viet Cong hideout
three months later and taken to Australia for medical treatment,
there was such a local outcry against him that he was taken to
Walter Reade Hospital in Washington, where he was repeatedly
denounced on the floor of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Saigon, Loan, who had been relieved of his command after
his wounding, seemed a changed man, one who devoted his time to
showering presents on orphans.
</P>
<P>
   At the fall of Saigon his pleas for American help in fleeing the
country were ignored but he and his family escaped in a South
Vietnamese plane.
</P>
<P>
   Once his presence in the United States became known there was a
move to deport him as a war criminal, but the efforts fizzled and
Loan, whose right leg had been amputated, settled in northern
Virginia, where he eventually opened his pizza parlor, which he
operated until 1991 when publicity about the proprietor's past led
to a sharp decline in business.
</P>
<P>
   As a message scrawled on a restroom wall put it, ``We know who
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, of Burke, Loan is survived by his wife,
Chinh Mai, a daughter, Nguyen Anh of Fairfield, Va., three other
children, a number of brothers and sisters and nine grandchildren.

   BC-CHERNOW-PROFILE-NYT (moved on Sunday, July 12)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, July 12,
about the author Ron Chernow and his best-selling book ``Titan: The
Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.,'' omitted two words from Mr.
Chernow's comment about Rockefeller in an interview. Mr. Chernow
said, with the restored words shown by italics, ``Rockefeller was
(ital) vilified as (unital) the great corporate criminal of his
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the date
of the interview. It was on June 17, not last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a fax message pointing out these errors, Mr. Chernow also
disputed an assertion in the article that part of the reason the
Rockefeller family went to him for a biography was their interest
in Rockefeller's illegitimate sisters. He said the family did not
know of their existence.

   ROME _ All fashion feeds on the new _ and the shocking _ and
Italian fashion even more than most. But in a world inured to
political scandal, nudity, profanity, sexual flamboyance and
celebrities' eternal falls from grace, there are very few taboos
left to break.
</P>
<P>
   That is perhaps why the Roman Catholic Church is an irresistible
theme for Italian designers seeking to make a splash. As
fall-winter collections got under way in Rome this week, fashion
designers sprinkled their shows with religious symbols.
</P>
<P>
   One designer announced he would send a model prancing down the
runway to the accompaniment of Pope John Paul II _ a CD recording
of the pope singing a Gregorian chant at Mass that was
electronically woven into a hip-hop background beat. Perhaps only
the Vatican, which threatened to sue the designer if he persisted,
was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Another designer had his models drinking holy water.
</P>
<P>
   From the ``Jesus Jeans'' of the early 1970's _ marketed with
provocative advertisements of a model in tight cutoffs under the
New Testament words, ``He who loves me, follows me'' _ to today's
shock-value Benetton ads, irreverence, or blasphemy to some, has
become a perennial of Italian fashion and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Italian pop artists, advertisers and designers seem
so inclined to invoke and provoke the Vatican is that the Catholic
Church in Italy is more closely woven into the fabric of secular
life than in almost any other Catholic country.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Fellini may have pioneered the trend in his satirical
1972 film ``Fellini's Roma,'' which featured an ecclesiastical
fashion show. But even today, offending the Vatican is one of the
surest ways of attracting publicity in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference with the iconoclasm of today and 20 years
ago is that they are driven by opposite fads. Fashion now is
invoking the Lord's name not in vain, but out of New Age vanity.
</P>
<P>
   If in the '60s and '70s the fashion industry was echoing a
social mood of rebellion and nonconformism, today's designers say
they are seeking to tap into the culture's yearning for spiritual
values, and in so doing happen to get the publicity they are after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a certain New Age dimension to my shows,''
said Kean Etro, the Milan-based designer, who said he wanted to
include the pope in Friday's show as ``my homage to the world of
introspection.''
</P>
<P>
   Etro, whose family-owned company, Etro, has a store in New York
on Madison Avenue, said he would respect the Vatican's wishes and
find some other music for his show. ``I'm not looking for a
clash,'' he said, sounding a bit hurt by the church's response. ``I
meant this as a tribute to the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, however, was not flattered. ``This is outrageous
and offensive to believers,'' said Archbishop John Foley, head of
the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, any comment only gets them more attention,
which is what they seek, but I personally cannot let something like
this go by,'' he said. ``They are guilty of sacrilege _ using a
sacred part of the liturgy for a very secular event _ a fashion
show.''
</P>
<P>
   The church is far less influential in Italian politics and
social life than in years past (Catholicism ceased to be the state
religion of Italy in 1984), but its views on issues ranging from
homosexuality, school curriculums, birth control and divorce are
widely heard. The Holy See is an independent nation-state in the
center of Rome, with its own newspapers, television stations and
publishing houses and vast real-estate holdings. In a country where
politicians and most secular institutions carry little weight with
ordinary citizens, the church is the country's most imposing and,
to some, oppressive institution.
</P>
<P>
   When newspapers first announced Etro's intention, Vatican Radio,
which owns the copyright to the pope's recordings, immediately
threatened to sue the designer and the producers of the CD,
insisting the music was a copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   While based on the pope's a cappella singing of the preface to
the Mass, the arrangement, titled ``Forgive Us,'' sounds less like
a Gregorian chant than a slightly solemn summer pop tune. It is
highly unlikely that the pope would give his blessing to such an
endeavor, but the composers were also aggrieved by the Vatican's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't meant to be blasphemous or even ironic,'' said
Andrea Mariotti, one of the composers. ``It is very beautiful and
emotional.'' He selected the pope, he said, ``because I was
searching for the big idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariotti, who said he began his project with cooperation from
the church, now charges that the Vatican moved to prevent him from
selling his CD in stores not out of religious concerns, but
commercial ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to block me so they can steal the idea and
sell it themselves,'' he said. Certainly, there are people in Rome
who believe that this recording of the pope's singing could be
profitable. ``This CD could be gigantic if it is ever released,''
Etro said. ``Bigger than Elton John's tribute to Princess Diana.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The publicity payoffs of iconoclasm are mixed with odd snippets
of New Age sincerity. Guillermo Mariotto, the designer for the
Rome-based fashion house Gattinoni, made headlines during last
year's fashion week by holding his show inside an Anglican Church
(no Catholic church would accept such a proposal) with a runway
model dressed as the Virgin Mary. Mariotto said he had planned to
have the model wear a crown of thorns, but was gently dissuaded by
Anglican officials, who told him such a gesture might offend the
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the sacristy of a consecrated church, on a telephone
conference about the crown of thorns with the office of the
Archbishop of Canterbury,'' Mariotto recalled. ``I felt like the
most important person in the world. I was crying with happiness.''
He switched to a crown of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   This year Mariotto, who said he was a believing Christian,
substituted holy water for beer in the show on Monday night. The
theme was unfinished fashion, a tribute to the hundreds of
construction sites all over Rome that are being made ready for the
year 2,000 jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   One scene called for models, dressed as construction workers, to
spill out of a bar, guzzling beer. ``I put holy water in the
models' bottles instead,'' he confided. ``I wanted to save the
girls in the show from feelings of envy and bad energy.''

GAY RIGHTS ISSUES BACK, NETTLING REPUBLICANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stalled confirmation of a gay ambassadorial
appointee, a White House directive on gay rights and a new ad
campaign by Christian conservatives have forced lawmakers to revive
a once-taboo topic that inflames activists but draws a mixed
reaction from most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Normandy landing in the larger cultural war,''
said Robert Knight of the Family Research Council, one of the
conservative groups behind the ad campaign. ``We're basically not
going to take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But most lawmakers are not exactly rushing to the front lines.
Some Republicans worry the issue will explode in their faces by
making the party appear intolerant. And while the debate energizes
Christian conservatives on behalf of the GOP, it also increases
support for Democrats in the wealthy and politically active gay
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It energizes both bases, but the negative for them is it makes
them look extremist and mean,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
who is gay. ``We're not all orphans. As gays and lesbians have come
out, we've brought along our friends and our parents and our aunts
and our uncles. And it's not just gay and lesbian people and our
friends and relatives. It is people who do not feel comfortable
associating with bashers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the most conservative Republicans are wary of
setting themselves up for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very careful to be very sensitive,'' said Rep.
Joseph R. Pitts, R-Pa., who is the House leadership's liaison to
Christian conservatives. ``I don't want to inflame emotions and
public animosity. I just think we should be careful not to
demagogue on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative ad campaign calls for a ``national discussion
of homosexuality'' with the goal of convincing gays to become
celibate or heterosexual. Full-page ads in The New York Times, The
Washington Post and other major newspapers urge gays to ``confront
the truth of their sexual sin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads also praise Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who came
under fire last month for comparing homosexuality to alcoholism and
kleptomania. Lott's denunciation was echoed by House Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Texas and by Republican Whip Tom DeLay of
Texas, the No. 3 House leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side has been systematically, over time,
desensitizing the American people into thinking that this is an
acceptable lifestyle. It is not acceptable,'' DeLay said. ``It is
wrong. It is dangerous. It destroys families. It destroys people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups countered the conservative ad campaign on
Wednesday with a full-page ad in USA Today featuring Dave and Ruth
Waterbury of Minnesota, whose daughter is a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to be Republicans. But that shouldn't matter,'' the
Waterburys say. ``Fairness should be a concern of Americans of all
political stripes. It's as American as apple pie.''
</P>
<P>
   The dueling ad campaigns come as both the House and the Senate
confront issues involving gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, conservative Republicans have blocked James
Hormel's nomination as ambassador to Luxembourg, citing concerns
that the San Francisco philanthropist would pursue a homosexual
agenda in the foreign posting.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote next week on legislation
overturning a recent Clinton directive aimed at eliminating
discrimination based on sexual orientation in federal employment.
Opponents, led by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., contend that the May
28 executive order gave homosexuals special status that goes far
beyond existing civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts, some Christian activists contend that
Republicans are cowed by the fear they will be labeled intolerant
or extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has been AWOL,'' Knight said. ``You really don't have
a parade of conservatives going to the microphone to take on this
issue. Everybody's afraid to get on the wrong side of gay
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas said most voters fall in the middle
of the opposing views that are driving the debate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much like the abortion issue,'' he said.
``Basically, it's `don't get in my face.' Most people know someone
who is gay or work with someone who is gay and don't have a problem
with it as long as they are not forced to endorse the lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   With an election just around the corner, many lawmakers would
just as soon stay out of the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time on a lot of issues that the American
people and the church should resolve,'' said Rep. James Traficant,
D-Ohio. ``It was a closet lifestyle that's now out in the family
room. There's more tolerance. But there is still, to many, an
abhorrent feeling it is wrong. There are very strong sentiments on
both sides.''

ANTICANCER AGENT APPEARS TO ENHANCE RADIATION'S EFFECTS IN MICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tests of a promising anticancer agent known as angiostatin have
shown that it enhances the effects of radiation in treating human
tumors grafted into mice.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism of the effect is unknown, but the agent seems to
make the blood vessels that supply the tumor more sensitive to
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin, a substance produced by the body, belongs to a
class of agents called anti-angiogenesis factors, meaning that they
suppress the formation of new blood vessels. The exploration of
such agents in cancer treatment has long been advocated by Dr.
Judah Folkman, in whose laboratory angiostatin and another
angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin, were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, of Children's Hospital in Boston, described the new
result, being published Thursday in the journal Nature, as ``very
clever and very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication for translation to the clinic,'' he said, ``is
that anti-angiogenesis therapy with angiostatin could be very
useful with radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Harris, chief of radiation oncology at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute in Boston, said the study ``creates a whole new
way of thinking about how radiation works.''
</P>
<P>
   Radiation therapists have focused on trying to kill as many
tumor cells as possible, Harris said, but the new finding raises
the possibility that ``a significant part of the benefit from
radiation comes from killing the blood vessels that supply a
tumor's growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior author of the study, Dr. Ralph Weichselbaum, a
radiation oncologist at the University of Chicago, said the
research had found that the combination of angiostatin and
radiation was more effective than either alone in shrinking the
mice tumors.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not had enough angiostatin to determine whether
it would have eliminated the tumors entirely in a prolonged
experiment. He added that he had achieved even better results with
endostatin, in experiments that have yet to be published.
</P>
<P>
   The finding that angiostatin and radiation were far more
effective in combination than was either agent alone would, if
applicable to humans, be important for therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Several substances successfully attack tumors in mice but turn
out to be useless in treating human cancers. One reason is that
tumors are genetically unstable and quickly develop resistance to
many agents that attack them.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable interest has been evoked by Folkman's work,
particularly because in a journal article on angiostatin last
November he and his colleagues showed how the resistance problem
could perhaps be sidestepped.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the possible solution is that angiostatin does not
attack the tumor cells themselves but affects the cells that form
the blood vessels supplying the tumor. The blood vessels' walls are
composed of normal, noncancerous cells known as endothelial cells.
Being normal, the endothelial cells are thought to be incapable of
developing resistance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Folkman said he had always envisaged that angiostatin and
related agents would supplement, not replace, anticancer treatments
like radiation and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a platform,'' he said, ``it's not exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Weichselbaum said he hoped to try his combination method in
humans. One obstacle is that angiostatin is at present available
only in quantities sufficient for research on mice.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Soff, a co-author who supplied the angiostatin for
the study, said that he could not scale up his production without a
commercial partner and that the rights to angiostatin as a human
therapy were held by Entremed, a company that holds licenses to
Folkman's work.
</P>
<P>
   But Soff, a biologist at Northwestern University Medical School
in Chicago, also said that the version of human angiostatin that he
makes in his laboratory differs in structure from the human version
made by Entremed. If so, his institution might be able to license a
competing version.
</P>
<P>
   Weichselbaum, Soff and Folkman do not know how it is that
angiostatin enhances the effect of radiation. Radiation is usually
thought to be effective only against actively dividing cells.
Angiostatin is thought to work by inhibiting the growth and
division of endothelial cells.
</P>
<P>
   Hence angiostatin might be expected to deprive radiation of any
targets at all. The work of Weichselbaum and Soff shows that
empirically the opposite is the case, but the explanation for this
surprising result remains to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the anti-angiogenesis approach have said that it may
be useful in preventing new tumors or the spread of old ones,
because these tumors must induce new blood vessels to bring them
nutrients, but that there is no reason it should work against
established tumors, which already have a blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   But Folkman said that according to his experiments, even
established tumors have a rapid turnover of blood vessels and must
continually induce the body to build new ones. Even established
tumors, then, should in principle be vulnerable to
anti-angiogenesis factors.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-angiogenesis has become a fast-moving field, with two new
journals devoted to the subject and a raft of companies and
researchers now exploring a variety of chemicals with
angiogenesis-suppressing properties.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin and endostatin, two natural products, seem to be the
most potent in laboratory tests, but they are proteins and hard to
make in large quantity. &QL;

AFTER ARTICLE BY SON, BOUTON INVITED BACK TO YANKEE STADIUM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When Jim Bouton received a call Wednesday from someone
claiming to be with the Yankees, he was sure it was a friend
playing a joke. ``OK, who is this?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Joe Schillan, the promotions and events
coordinator for the Yankees, calling to ask Bouton to participate
in Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium on July 25. ``It's been a very
emotional day here in our household,'' Bouton said from his home in
Egremont, Mass., the emotion he spoke of evident in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Bouton won 39 games for the Yankees during the 1963 and 1964
seasons, but became persona non grata at Yankee Stadium after his
book ``Ball Four'' was published, containing details that shed
light on the off-the-field activities of the Yankee legend Mickey
Mantle and others.
</P>
<P>
   But on Father's Day of this year, Michael Bouton, his son, wrote
an article in The New York Times that was essentially a plea to the
Yankees to invite his father to Old-Timers' Day. Michael Bouton
noted the recent pain his family had suffered, following the death
last year of his sister, Laurie, in an automobile accident, and
suggested that it was time to forgive and forget.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees followed through, and Jim Bouton was touched. ``This
is the third time I've wept today and it's not even 2 p.m.,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouton's understanding Wednesday was that he would be introduced
wearing a suit, and would not play in the Old-Timers' Game. ``They
don't want anybody striking out the side,'' he said, joking. But a
member of the organization said Wednesday night that a uniform
would be made available to Bouton, and there was a possibility he
could play if he wished.

TIME WARNER PROFITS SURGE; STOCK CLOSES AT 52-WEEK HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that second-quarter
net earnings more than tripled on the improved strength of its
cable television operations, magazine advertising and Warner
Brothers studios.
</P>
<P>
   The results at Time Warner, the world's largest entertainment
company, exceeded Wall Street expectations and helped send the
company's shares up $1.875, or 2 percent, to a 52-week high of
$93.125.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wall Street's positive response might also have
reflected the emphasis of Time Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, on
further debt reduction and higher growth targets, as well as
Levin's suggestion that Time Warner would lease some of its cable
property to telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended June 30, Time Warner earned $101
million, compared with $30 million in the comparable period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported that after the payout of preferred-stock
dividends, earnings were 4 cents a diluted share, compared with a
loss of 9 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call
Corp., which tracks earnings estimates, had expected a loss of 4
cents a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter revenue rose 15 percent, to $3.67 billion from
$3.19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after the earnings were released, Levin
said that AT&AMP;T Corp.'s decision last month to buy
Tele-Communications Inc., the leading cable company, ``has
validated our valuations of cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not specify which telephone companies might
strike a deal with Time Warner, the biggest cable company after
TCI, Levin said that ``our plant will be used to carry telephony.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Hatch, who follows entertainment for UBS Securities, said
such deals would not necessarily be costly for Time Warner and
could generate a new source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AT&AMP;T is interested in using TCI Cable to develop land-based
telephone facilities, then Time Warner is interested in similar
deals with AT&AMP;T or other companies, and the phone company partner
would put up the capital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings results include profit gains at Time Warner
Entertainment Co., a partnership with Mediaone Group Inc. The
partnership owns most of the Time Warner cable systems, the Home
Box Office and Cinemax cable channels and the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   The combined operating earnings of Time Warner and Time Warner
Entertainment before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization,
an important measure of performance for big entertainment
companies, rose 17 percent, to $1.16 billion, on combined revenue
of $6.53 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's publishing division reported operating income
before interest, taxes and amortization of $176 million, up from
$157 million a year earlier. The results reflected significant
advertising gains at Fortune, In Style and People magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's cable services, which include Cable News Network
and Turner Network Television, posted a 20 percent increase in
operating earnings, to $198 million, bolstered by increased
subscription revenues at TNT, Turner Classic Movies and the Cartoon
Network.
</P>
<P>
   The film division posted an 11 percent increase, to $122
million, primarily from television syndication sales.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's music business continued to suffer as earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell to $96
million from $106 million. &QL;

UNION AND OWNERS DISCUSS PLAN FOR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 2000 Olympics and a World Cup type of baseball tournament
were among the topics discussed Wednesday at an unusual meeting
between union officials and owners. No decisions were made, but the
meeting was significant because it was the formal beginning of a
joint effort to expand baseball internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a very good, very productive and an exciting
meeting,'' said Paul Beeston, chief operating officer for Major
League Baseball. ``Don articulated the union's position, and it's
consistent with our position. We had six club representatives, and
they can see Don has a vision and a commitment, a plan that is not
at counter with anything we want to do. I think we can work very
well together.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeston referred to Donald Fehr, the head of the union, which
has been ahead of the owners in the desire to take baseball
worldwide. But in the year that Beeston has been in office, he has
worked to bring the owners even with the players in the
international effort.
</P>
<P>
   The new committee, Beeston said, discussed a variety of issues:
the all-star Japanese tour scheduled for November, the potential of
playing games, both exhibition and league, outside of the United
States and Canada; the qualifying rounds for the 2000 Olympics, the
type of players who could be in the Olympics and the future of a
worldwide tournament based on soccer's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Fehr also emerged from the meeting with the feeling that the two
sides are prepared to work together and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling that there's a lot of work to do and there's
an opportunity out there,'' Fehr said. ``We have to come up with an
operating plan.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest decisions the committee has to make is the
type of professional players who could play in the qualifying games
for the Australia Olympics. Those games are expected to be played
during the Pan-American Games a year from now. Major league players
are not expected to be available for those games or the Olympics.
The Olympics are scheduled for what will be the last two weeks of
the 2000 major league season. The minor league season will have
ended by then.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will also work on the feasibility of creating a
world tournament. There has been talk that the first one could be
held in three to five years, but that is speculative.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston and Fehr will be in Italy next week for the world
championships and a meeting of the executive board of the
International Baseball Association, the certifying body for the
Olympics.

 &HT;    Youth urged to fight some some drug laws
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Parents of Kemba Smith, a young college student who
is serving 24 years in prison for minor involvement in her
boyfriend's drug ring, implored young NAACP delegates to work
toward changing the laws that put their daughter away.
</P>
<P>
   A National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's
legal defense team is representing the young woman. Smith, 24,
admitted to lying to federal authorities about her boyfriend's
whereabouts and transporting cash for him. Smith, a former college
student, did not use, deal or ferry drugs. She insists that she
lied because she feared for her life and her parents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Gus Smith asked teen delegates to get
involved in protesting the laws and his daughter's sentence. He
also implored them to pick their friends carefully and to terminate
the friendship if the friends are involved in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Singer rouses audience
</P>
<P>
   The audience rose to their feet, cheering and shouting, as
recording artist Jennifer Holliday sang at the NAACP's 26th
national membership/life membership luncheon that gave awards to
chapters that had grown over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Holliday dedicated her song, ``I'm On Your Side,'' to the late
Jondelle Johnson, former executive director of the Atlanta NAACP.
She spoke of the friendship she and Johnson once shared.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker, former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin
Hooks, also received a standing ovation as he encouraged members to
continue the fight for justice and equality. ``We still have a long
way to go, the fight is not over,'' Hooks said. Hooks encouraged
members to help to teach youth to ``do the very best you can'' in
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta, Turner Broadcasting
corporate vice president Xernona Clayton and Julian Bond, chairman
of the NAACP, were also in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Artist guides students
</P>
<P>
   Frank Frazier, 55, a Dallas, Texas-based artist, is putting this
year's NAACP convention theme, ``Preparing Tomorrow's Leader's
Today,'' in action. The designer of six NAACP convention logos,
Frazier said he will give an ACT-SO student the opportunity to
design the art work in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then it's their turn,'' said Frazier, a 25-year NAACP
member. ``One of the reasons I'm involved in the NAACP is because
of ACT-SO and to help develop the future of our youth. It's
positive seeing all of the black youth.'' ACT-SO is a competition
for high school students in arts and academics.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said he has been selling his work at NAACP conventions
for 35 years. He said he suggested the NAACP sell shirts and
posters of this year's design, featuring a man and woman in African
dress accompanied by two youths.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Harris, executive director of the Nashville NAACP
branch, said she tapped Frazier to design the logo for the 1992
convention. ``He was hot,'' Harris said. ``(The NAACP) has been
using my contact ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying on course
</P>
<P>
   Like many other delegates at the convention, Ophelia Averitt, a
national board member from Ohio, has belonged to the group for a
long time. And like many her age, she has been a member since she
learned to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Averitt's parents registered her when she was 3. A
self-described ``seasoned'' member who won't divulge her age,
Averitt has moved up through the ranks and is now president of the
Akron, Ohio, NAACP branch. ``You make the time,'' she said. ``If
you're a volunteer and committed to what the course is, then that's
your mission. You keep your eye on the prize. When you find out
that other people depend on you, that gives you a sense of being.
That makes you move forward, and no money can compare to the
service you do for others.''

TEXANS WRITING THEIR OWN TRANS-AM CHAPTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These hardly are the glory days of the NTB Trans-Am Series, home
to road-racing legends Mark Donohue, Peter Revson and Parnelli
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit factories have deserted the Sports Car Club of
America-sanctioned series, taking with them the upper-echelon
Chevrolet Camaros fielded by Buz McCall and the Ford Mustang Cobras
entered by Jack Roush and Tom Gloy.
</P>
<P>
   Even record-setting four-time Trans-Am champion Tommy Kendall is
without a full-time ride halfway through 1998. Like Kendall, 1989
Trans-Am champion Dorsey Schroeder also is logging air time as a TV
commentator this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The 33rd season of what is billed as ``America's longest-running
road-racing series'' has seen Paul Gentilozzi emerge to replace
Kendall _ winner of a record 11 consecutive races in 1997 _ as
Trans-Am's moving target.
</P>
<P>
   Amid whispers that his Rocketsports Chevy Corvette is equipped
with illegal traction control _ which also was the rap on Kendall
last year _ Gentilozzi has won five of seven races en route to a
sizable 41-point lead in the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, Texans Lou Gigliotti and Bill Saunders have kept
things reasonably entertaining with the first series victories of
their respective careers.
</P>
<P>
   Gigliotti, of Garland, won the rain and controversy-plagued race
at Lime Rock Park in Connecticut on May 25 in his Mustang ``concept
car.'' And on Saturday, Saunders _ who is Gentilozzi's AutoLink
teammate _ wheeled his Corvette to victory on the Burke Lakefront
Airport layout at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Gigliotti and Saunders are joined only by the
geography of North Texas. Politically and financially, they stand
at opposite ends of the SCCA spectrum. But at the respective ages
of 48 and 51, Gigliotti and Saunders are proving that one way to
avoid a midlife crisis is to suit up, strap in and stand on it.
</P>
<P>
   Gigliotti's victory at Lime Rock came in his eighth Trans-Am
start, and third of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real proud of that,'' said Gigliotti, the SCCA World
Challenge champion in 1991, 1992 and 1996. ``There are a lot of
good drivers in this country who never get an opportunity. I love
racing. I'm addicted to it. The only way I get an opportunity is to
build and race my own cars. That's how I can afford to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gigliotti's racing habit primarily is funded by LG Motorsports,
whose G2 Performance Parts are popular among the owners of Chevy
and Ford muscle cars.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, meanwhile, has parlayed his position as president of
Dallas-based HighwayMaster with Gentilozzi's Rocketsports operation
into a Trans-Am career that is in its sixth year. Saunders' first
Trans-Am victory came in his 69th start, shattering Paul Miller's
previous record for persistence at 38 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Persistency pays off,'' Saunders said this week. ``They did a
piece not too long ago on ``Inside the PGA'' where they talked
about the golfers who go out, win and are up in the money, but you
never hear about them. I guess that's me. I'm a guy they're not
expecting to win a race _ especially at my age. But I love to race,
no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is no question, Saunders said, that the series now
sponsored by National Tire and Battery is not what it was a year
ago _ when Kendall duked it out against Schroeder, Brian Simo and
rookie Mike Borkowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference in the field this year,'' said
Saunders, who also finished second to Gentilozzi at Mid-Ohio on
June 14. ``It's hard to equate what Tommy Kendall did last year
against a field of top-notch drivers. Tommy dominated us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gigliotti, whose love for Trans-Am dates to watching Donohue
and Jones bang fenders on the backstretch at Watkins Glen, N.Y., in
1969, said this is a series in transition. And it still is great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Donohue and Dorsey Schroeder and Scott Pruett and Tommy
Kendall are not there anymore,'' Gigliotti said. ``But my answer to
that is I wasn't there last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that struck home after I won at Lime Rock was when I
went upstairs to talk to the officials and they had a plaque
listing every winner. The first name was Peter Revson and then Mark
Donohue. The next row at the top of the list, it will be Lou
Gigliotti _ right next to Peter Revson and Mark Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great for their time and they'll be great in my book
forever. But every year, a new chapter gets written.'' &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
NASCAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials are reported to be considering a ban on
in-season testing in an effort to discourage the trend toward
multicar Winston Cup teams, like Jack Roush's five-car armada.
According to reports on ESPN2's ``RPM 2Night'' and in ``The
Charlotte Observer'', NASCAR might replace the seven in-season
tests it allows each team with a single extra day of practice at a
track at the start of the race weekend. For instance, teams would
be allowed an open practice day at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort
Worth on a Thursday, with Bud Pole qualifying on Friday,
second-round qualifying on Saturday and the race on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in favor of such a plan is three-time Cup champion
Darrell Waltrip, who sold his single-car Chevrolet team to Texan
Tim Beverley in March rather than fight the multicar outfits
fielded by Roush, Richard Childress and Robert Yates. ``It's dark
and lonely out there when you don't have a teammate,'' Waltrip
said. ``There's nothing you can do about the sport growing. But
when you talk about guys owning five and six teams, I don't think
that's healthy for the sport. That's where the sanctioning body has
to make it that everybody has got a fair shake. If they do open up
these joints a day early, then you wouldn't need test dates. That's
what we're hearing all the time _ `I don't have enough test days,
so I'll start a second team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roush, meanwhile, genuinely was pleased to see rising superstar
Jeff Burton win his first race of 1998 in Loudon, N.H., on Sunday.
It also was Burton's initial victory in the No. 99 Exide Batteries
Ford Taurus with first-year crew chief Frank Stoddard. Stoddard
replaced the popular Buddy Parrott after Parrott's off-season
promotion to team manager of the Roush shop in Mooresville, N.C.
``Frankie and Jeff's story is pretty special,'' Roush said.
``Frankie and Jeff have learned together what they need to do now
to finish these races, and they're going to be something to deal
with in the future. Buddy Parrott has been a great teacher for
them. And there's just tremendous energy with this program.'' For
the record, Burton is 31 and Stoddard, who joined Burton's team in
1996, is 30.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR will do away with the Craftsman Truck Series' traditional
``halftime'' break for the Tempus Resorts 300K at Pikes Peak
International Raceway in Fountain, Colo., on July 25. The race
instead will feature Cup-style tire changes during pit stops.
Dennis Huth, NASCAR vice president of administration, said the
one-race change will be approached as a test. &QL; 
IRL/CART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plano's Greg Ray says the only drawback to driving for A.J. Foyt
in the Pep Boys 400K at Dover (Del.) International Speedway this
weekend is a lack of practice time on the 1-mile, 24-degree-banked
concrete oval. ``I've never done a lap there, and A.J. hasn't
tested there,'' said Ray, who is subbing for the injured Billy Boat
in the Indy Racing League event. Ray said the No. 97 Dallara he has
been driving for car owner Thomas Knapp over the last year and a
half was purchased from Foyt in Houston. ``I've known these guys
for a while, and they know I wanted to drive for them,'' said Ray,
who has been fitted for the No. 11 Conseco Dallara/Aurora. ``We
just haven't been able to get to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray also confirmed that he has spoken to Bobby Rahal about the
ride that will open up in the Miller Lite Reynard/Ford when Rahal
retires at the end of the FedEx Championship Auto Racing Teams
season. Other rumored candidates are 1996 CART champion Jimmy
Vasser, Gil de Ferran, Robby Gordon, former Formula One World
Driving Champion Damon Hill and Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Ray
indicated a preference for the IRL's all-oval format. ``I do miss
road racing, but they (CART) don't race on the type of tracks I
like for the most part,'' he said. ``I'm listening to all
opportunities, but I think the IRL is where I want to be.'' &QL; 
NHRA &QL;

<P>
   Mired in 11th in points, Eddie Hill of Wichita Falls is not a
factor in the National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel championship.
But Hill, 62, is one of only five Top Fuel drivers to have
qualified for all 11 races run this season. ``That's unusual,''
said Hill, the 1993 champion and driver of the Pennzoil Dragster.
``I was almost shocked myself when we ran across that stat.
Normally, all of the top 10 teams qualify at every race. I don't
remember having that many DNQs by top 10 teams in recent years.
We're way back down in the points, but we're No. 5 in qualifying
points. That shows we've qualified a lot better than we've raced. I
think the good qualifying will pay off during the last half of the
season.'' Points leader Cory McClenathan, Joe Amato, Kenny
Bernstein and Gary Scelzi are the other Top Fuelers to have
qualified at every national event. The second half of the 22-race
season resumes today with the Mopar Parts Mile-High Nationals in
Morrison, Colo. &QL;

TMS PLANS ANNOUNCEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Texas Motor Speedway have scheduled a ``major
announcement'' for Wednesday at the infield media center.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be about the granting of a second NASCAR Winston Cup
race date to TMS?
</P>
<P>
   Track spokesman Gary Guehler said he could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major announcement, and there'll be a Winston Cup team
owner and driver here,'' Guehler said. ``We'll get some views of
the new surface.''

   The reconfigured and repaved 1.5-mile speedway passed its first
tests on June 5-6, when it played host to the NASCAR Craftsman

</P>
<P>
   NASCAR traditionally releases its schedule for the coming year
no sooner than the Mountain Dew Southern 500 on Labor Day weekend.
Recent speculation is that the only addition to the 1999 Cup
schedule will be at the reconfigured Miami-Dade Motorsports Complex
in Homestead, Fla., raising the race count to 34. &QL; 
NUTS AND BOLTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Jerry Nadeau has been dropped as driver of
the No. 13 FirstPlus Financial Ford Taurus, co-owned by Bill
Elliott and Dan Marino. Nadeau qualified for 14 of 17 races, with a
best finish of 21st (twice). No replacement has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   CART regular Robby Gordon has been signed by Roehrig Motorsports
to drive the No. 19 Yellow Freight Ford at the Brickyard 400 on
Aug. 1 at Indianapolis. Gordon will be subbing for the team's
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series regular, Tony Raines.
</P>
<P>
   Pro football analyst and former NFL coach Jerry Glanville is
scheduled to compete in the Craftsman Truck Series events at the
California Speedway this weekend and Pikes Peak International

   Multiple World of Outlaws Sprint Car champion Steve Kinser won
his first race since late March on June 27 in Eagle, Neb. Kinser,

   NANTAHALA, N.C. -- Until lean, hungry Eric Robert Rudolph
emerged from the deep mountains nine days ago looking for food,
George Nordmann lived quietly. Now the murky role he played in
providing food and a pickup truck for Rudolph, a longtime
acquaintance, has thrust Nordmann into the media spotlight focused
on the manhunt for the suspect in the Jan. 29 Birmingham abortion
clinic bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have said that they have no evidence that
Nordmann cooperated in helping Rudolph avoid capture. Nordmann
called the Macon County sheriff's office Saturday and reported that
his pickup truck and some food had been stolen and that he believed
Rudolph was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better neighbor,'' said Jennifer
Solesbee, who hired one of Nordmann's daughters to babysit her two
young children.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances said Nordmann is a devout Catholic who is opposed
to abortion. When one of his daughters became pregnant out of
wedlock several years ago, he kept her at home during her
pregnancy. The daughter attempted to deliver the baby at home, but
emergency medical workers were called when the delivery ran into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not believe in abortion, but I do not think he would
try to kill anybody over it,'' said Pam O'Dell, who knows Nordmann
and attended school with several of his children.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann, 71, could not be located Wednesday. He didn't answer
knocks on the screen door of his small cluttered house, surrounded
by weeds, junk cars and chickens pecking in the dust. Nordmann's
house, perched on a winding road looking across the hazy
southwestern North Carolina mountains, is decorated by religious
pictures that Solesbee described as ``graphic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pictures of Jesus and saints everywhere,'' she said,
explaining that some show the crucifixion of Jesus Christ wearing a
thorny crown and bleeding from nail holes in his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann has been divorced for many years and raised his
children, Solesbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann moved to the Andrews area from Florida in the late
1970s, when he took a part-time job teaching shop at Nantahala
School, said Principal Richard Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said he remembered seven of Nordmann's children. ``They
were kind, courteous, respectful, good academically.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes that religion played a role in their
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann has lived alone for several months, after a daughter
who lived with him married and moved to Hayesville, Solesbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of his business, The Better Way Health Food Store in
Andrews, said he is helpful and pleasant, although some of his
recommendations, such as coffee enemas to purge the body, are
unorthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if you smoke here, but please don't exhale,''
reads a sign on a bulletin board behind the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Macon County Sheriff Homer Holbrooks said Nordmann
and Rudolph ``have known each other for quite a while,'' as do many
people who live in the Nantahala community near Topton, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooks said authorities do not believe that Nordmann
aided Rudolph with the intention of helping one of the FBI's 10
Most Wanted fugitives escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did the right thing,'' said Jack Daulton, the FBI's
chief in Atlanta, adding that, for now, Nordmann is under no
suspicion of unlawfully helping Rudolph. According to an account,
that Holbrooks said Nordmann gave sheriff's department officials,
Rudolph came to Nordmann's house during the day of July 7 and asked
for food.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph left, but returned two nights later when Nordmann was
not home. Rudolph took food and drove away in Nordmann's 1977 blue
Datsun pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann on Saturday reported the incident to sheriff's Deputy
Kenny Cope, who alerted Holbrooks. ``Homer, you are not going to
believe this,'' he told the sheriff. ``I got a gentleman here who
has been contacted by Eric Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities discovered Nordmann's truck shortly after noon
Monday near Apple Tree campground, in the vicinity of the
intensifying manhunt that includes agents and dogs from the Georgia
Department of Corrections. In its new composite of Rudolph, a
32-year-old carpenter and outdoorsman also wanted for questioning
in three Atlanta bombings, the FBI said the suspect has lost weight
and has grown a beard and long hair pulled into a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooks said that description suggests that Rudolph ``is
operating alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody has been cooking corn bread and pinto beans, he'd
be in a little better shape than what he is,'' Holbrooks said. ``I
do not think anybody is helping him.'' Even so, the sheriff said
some residents have told him, ``If I knew where he was, I wouldn't
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Ratthe, owner of Back Porch Herb Shoppe in Andrews, said
some of her customers who oppose abortion support Rudolph despite
the felony charges against him:
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come in and said, `What is so wrong about what he
has done?' If they are strongly against abortion, they'd look at
him as a saint.''

   CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ Three supervisors at a sewage treatment
plant in Yonkers run by Westchester County remained suspended
without pay Wednesday after 122 million gallons of wastewater that
had not been disinfected were released into the Hudson River on
Sunday and Monday, Andrew Spano, the county executive, said
Wednesday. The workers will remain suspended pending the outcome of
an investigation into why they did not alert senior officials or
use backup procedures to treat the water.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the wastewater prompted county officials to order
the beach at Croton Point Park here and another in Sleepy Hollow,
Philipse Manor Beach, closed for a second day while the water was
examined for harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   A first round of tests for bacteria in the Hudson turned up no
unhealthful levels of E. coli, said Dr. Harold Adel, the county's
health commissioner. But Adel said the two beaches would remain
closed until results of follow-up bacteria tests become available,
probably on Thursday, he said. Boaters were also being advised to
avoid contact with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is strictly precautionary,'' Adel said. He added that he
thought the follow-up tests most likely would also show no problem,
with the flow of the tide and the dilution from billions of gallons
of river water quickly erasing any threat.
</P>
<P>
   Spano said problems first developed at the plant on Sunday, when
some pipes were clogged, disrupting the final stage of the
water-treatment process, the addition of chlorine to kill bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   For four hours on Sunday, wastewater that had not been
disinfected poured into the Hudson at the rate of nearly 4 million
gallons an hour. The workers fixed the problem, but no one notified
the plant manager or county environmental officials about the
release of the partially treated wastewater, Spano said.
</P>
<P>
   The chlorine-pumping system broke down again at 7 a.m. Monday
and was not fixed until Tuesday morning, bringing the total release
of potentially contaminated wastewater up to about 122 million
gallons, county officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Spano said, no one notified top officials of the
release so that neighboring communities could be alerted and
bacteria checks conducted. ``We have strict procedures in place for
this,'' he said. ``It just baffles me why they didn't tell
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of the suspended workers have not been released and
their union, the Civil Service Employees Association, was unable to
provide any information on the situation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which handles an average flow of 92 million gallons
of sewage a day from 26 Westchester communities, generally has had
a good operating record, said Samuel Thernstrom, a spokesman for
the state Department of Environmental Conservation, which was
investigating the breakdown at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Along with county officials, the DEC was not notified within 24
hours of the spills, as it should have been under the terms of the
plant's permit, Thernstrom said. He said the county could be levied
a fine in the ``tens of thousands of dollars'' depending on the
outcome of the investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Cronin, who investigates pollution problems for the Hudson
Riverkeeper Fund, a private environmental group, said his group did
not share the state's generally positive view of the plant's
operations, referring to a variety of lapses there over the years.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is no room for error at such a big sewage plant,
particularly one on a stretch of the river where the tides can
carry pollution many miles in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   At Croton Point Park Wednesday, which is 18 miles north of the
Yonkers plant, Spano surveyed the vacant beach and said, ``This
just kills me.'' People intending to swim said they were
discouraged to discover the beach closure notice at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Desiree and Dwayne Bland had driven up from Harlem to swim and
picnic at the broad, sandy beach with their two children. They
ended up instead at a playground in the park, where Mrs. Bland was
teaching her 3-year-old son, Khari, how to use a swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to hear about it when we got here,'' Mrs. Bland
said. ``I came all dressed and ready,'' she added, indicating the
bathing suit under her sundress. ``I guess I'm all dressed up with
no place to go.''

ADVERTISING: FORD GIVES YOUNG &AMP; RUBICAM SOME GEMS AND OGILVY A
JOLT
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has unexpectedly shaken up its agency roster
across Europe, shifting assignments with billings estimated at $175
million to $225 million to Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising from Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age described the move
Wednesday as one of the largest ever in Europe. On Jan. 1, five
plum accounts are leaving Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Europe in London, part of
WPP Group , for Young &AMP; Rubicam Europe in London, part of Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford lines departing Ogilvy are the Ford Fiesta, with
billings estimated at $70 million; the Ford Ka, $50 million; the
Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle, $20 million, and the Windstar
mini-van, with a small budget. Before the reshuffling, Y&AMP;R Europe
had handled those brands only in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R Europe is also gaining the Ford corporate-image assignment
for Europe. Spending for it has been relatively modest but is in
line to grow to as much as $90 million with the arrival soon of a
new campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul in the Ford roster means that Y&AMP;R Europe assumes
the role of the lead agency for Ford of Europe from Ogilvy Europe.
The move came two weeks after Y&AMP;R Europe prevailed over Ogilvy
Europe for the assignment to introduce across Europe a model to be
named Focus, which will replace the Escort in the Ford lineup in 18
to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus account, with billings estimated at $100 million,
represented the first assignment of a mainstream Ford brand to Y&AMP;R
Europe, Campaign, a British trade publication, reported. And the
assignment altered the balance of power between the two agencies as
they vied for Ford's favor in Europe, Campaign reported, tipping
the balance to Y&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the extent of how far the teeter-totter had tottered was not
evident until Wednesday, when Ford of Europe, based in Brentwood,
England, announced what was described as a ``major restructuring of
its advertising strategy,'' toward selling on a brand-by-brand
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are simplifying and clarifying the roles and
responsibilities of our advertising agencies,'' said Philippe
Mellier, vice president for marketing, sales and service at Ford of
Europe, ``which will provide our customers Europe-wide with a
consistent message about our products.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ford shake-up is indicative of a new wave of ferment roiling
agencies that have automotive accounts. The automotive category was
volatile earlier in the decade, with more than a dozen marques
changing agencies. That itchiness had faded as car and truck sales
increased after the improvement in national economies across North
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the intensifying competitiveness in the automotive market is
leading marketers again to reassess their agency ties.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford roster makeover ``is key to our ongoing growth in the
European market,'' Mellier said, ``and is a cornerstone of our
strategy to take Ford into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other automakers that have also recently altered agency
rosters are Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which named Deutsch
Inc. in Marina del Rey, Calif., and New York to handle the
introduction of the 1999 Galant.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trade publication Brandweek, Mitsubishi will
change its American advertising theme, in a campaign planned to
begin late this month, to ``Wake up and drive'' from ``Built for
living.'' The older theme was created by the company's previous
agency, the G2 unit of Grey Advertising in Huntington Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R Europe has been trying to build its Ford business in Europe
for more than a decade. A breakthrough occurred in 1994, Campaign
reported, when Ford awarded the agency the Galaxy minivan account.
That was followed by assignments for Cougar, which in Europe
carries Ford's name, rather than Mercury's; Puma, and the Lincoln
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y&AMP;R is relishing the challenge of repeating for Ford's volume
brands the successes we've had in developing pan-European
advertising for the Galaxy and Puma,'' said Kevin King, account
managing director for Ford of Europe at Y&AMP;R Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ogilvy Europe is losing its large assignments to Y&AMP;R
Europe, the blow is being softened somewhat. It will continue
handling some Ford accounts, including Escort, until that brand is
phased out; Mondeo, the so-called world car, and Ford's commercial
vehicles. Y&AMP;R Europe had been handling those accounts in Germany,
and they now will be shifted to Ogilvy Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mindshare, a media agency that like Ogilvy Europe is owned by
WPP, will continue to handle media buying for Ford of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Y&AMP;R Advertising handles the
Lincoln-Mercury division for Ford and Ogilvy is the Ford corporate
agency, responsible for the image campaign introduced in May that
carries the theme ``Better ideas. Driven by you.'' Ford division
vehicles are handled by J. Walter Thompson, another Ogilvy sibling.

 RICHARD McDONALD, 89, FAST-FOOD PIONEER  
 (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard McDonald, who with his brother Maurice revolutionized
the way that billions of people around the world eat in fast-food
restaurants, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Manchester, N.H.
He was 89 and lived in nearby Bedford, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   From a single hamburger stand in San Bernardino, Calif., in
1948, the systematized approach that the McDonald brothers
developed to offer customers reasonably priced food at a rapid pace
formed the cornerstone of the fast-food business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the business they created, built and sold in 1961,
McDonald's Corp., has more than 23,000 outlets in 111 countries and
sales in excess of $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While they worked very much in tandem, Richard McDonald, who was
known as Dick, is credited with two talismans of the McDonald's
empire: the Golden Arches and the sign that proclaims how many
hamburgers the chain has sold _ a figure now high in the billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole concept was based on speed, lower prices and
volume,'' McDonald once said, adding hypothetically: A ``guy comes
in, you ask him what he wants on his burgers; he says, `I got to go
back to the car to ask my wife.' Wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not an idea the two brothers arrived at quickly. Born
poor in rural New Hampshire, Richard and Maurice (Mac) McDonald
migrated to California in the late 1920s, equipped with high school
diplomas and the desire to make $1 million before they reached 50.
</P>
<P>
   A number of odd jobs on the periphery of the movie business
failed to pan out. In the late 1930s they opened a hot dog stand
near the Santa Anita race track in Arcadia, Calif., northeast of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, they opened a small drive-in barbecue restaurant in San
Bernardino, a growing blue-collar city. Business was brisk, yet
after a few years the McDonalds became convinced that they could do
better by doing things faster.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1948 they shut down their restaurant, dismissed
the carhops, streamlined the menu and began to reinvent the way
they would deliver their food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the kitchen, everything was mechanized,'' wrote David
Halberstam in ``The Fifties,'' his 1993 book. ``Much of the food
was preassembled; the slack time between the rush hours was used to
prepare for the next onslaught.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a revolutionized-pace kitchen, they wanted a
symbol. What Richard McDonald came up with was the Golden Arches.
``I thought the arches would sort of lift the building up,'' he
told an interviewer from The Chicago Tribune in 1985. ``Our
architect said, `Those arches have to go.' But they worked _ it was
luck, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, there were long lines to buy what were then 15-cent
hamburgers, 19-cent cheeseburgers, 20-cent milkshakes and 10-cent
french fries.
</P>
<P>
   By 1954, the McDonalds had sold 21 franchises and opened nine
outlets. At that time, Ray Kroc was a milkshake-machine salesman
who was not selling many machines, except to the McDonalds. He
traveled to San Bernardino to see why, and was so impressed that he
asked for a job as their franchise agent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Kroc founded Franchise Realty Corp., and opened his
first McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Ill. In 1960, he
changed the name to McDonald's Corp. A year later, he bought the
business from Dick and Mac McDonald for $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, Dick McDonald returned to his native New
Hampshire. His brother Maurice died in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald is survived by his wife, Dorothy, of Bedford; a
stepson, Gale French, of Belchertown, Mass; and two
step-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A contretemps of sorts blew up in the late 1970s, after
publication of Kroc's biography, ``Grinding it Out: The Making of
McDonald's.'' In it, Kroc, who has often been thought of as the
driving force behind McDonald's, dates its birth to the first
restaurant in Des Plaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the time we sold, there was no mention of Kroc being
the founder,'' Richard McDonald told The Wall Street Journal in
1991. ``If we had heard about it, he would be back selling
milkshake machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroc died in 1984. Later, the company came to a meeting of the
minds with Dick McDonald on who did what.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mutually agreed that Dick and Mac were the pioneers of
McDonald's and helped to found the fast-food industry,'' said Chuck
Eberling, a McDonald's spokesman. ``Mr. Kroc was the entrepreneur
who founded what today is known as McDonald's Corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Years after the brothers sold to Kroc, someone asked Richard
McDonald if he had any regrets. None, Halberstam relates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have wound up in some skyscraper somewhere with about
four ulcers and eight tax attorneys trying to figure out how to pay
all my income tax,'' McDonald replied.

   The technology-heavy Nasdaq index jumped to its sixth
consecutive new high, closing just shy of the 2,000 level at
1,994.54. But the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index declined as investors took profits after
Tuesday's rally. During the day, the Dow topped 9,300 for the first
time, before closing lower at 9,234.47. The S&AMP;P index fell to
1,174.81. Strong earnings from Ford Motor failed to bolster the
stock market. Ford shares fell $1, to $59.50, but are up 84.5
percent so far this year. The company topped earnings estimates by
Wall Street analysts by 10 cents.

ANCIENT GLADIATORS HOLMES AND FOREMAN TO MEET  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It could well be the last Fight of the Century. Two
gladiators with a combined age of 99 years. And that's the point,
George Foreman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won the Olympics in 1968; UCLA won the basketball
championship in 1968; the Jets won that year,'' he said. ``I loved
that Joe Namath. That's why I'm rooting for UCLA again, why I'm
rooting for that Super Bowl again.''
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons _ as well as $10 million _ Foreman announced
Wednesday that he would meet another aging former heavyweight
champion, Larry Holmes, on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   There is no title at stake these days. Foreman forfeited his
crown when he declined to fight various challengers after his
stunning comeback victory over Michael Moorer in 1994, which made
him the world's oldest champion at 45. Holmes was last a champion
in 1985. The bout, the first between the two, is being billed as
the Birthday Bash. Two weeks before the fight, Foreman will have
celebrated his 50th birthday. Holmes will turn 49 in November. In
deference to Foreman's age, and greater celebrity status, Holmes
will earn only $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need the money, Larry?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs money,'' said Holmes, who colors his hair with
Just for Men to get rid of the gray.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-round fight will be held in either New York or Las Vegas,
whichever comes up with a better promotional deal, and will be
televised on a pay-per-view basis. So far there are two sponsors _
9 Net Avenue, an Internet company, and Kremlyovskaya, a Russian
vodka. But Foreman already has more than $1 million in a trust fund
from the promoter, a Briton named Roger Levitt. And that up-front
money, suggested Foreman's longtime lawyer, Henry Holmes, helped
make the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand, especially young people,'' said
Foreman, seriously considering the question of age and why he
fights. ``When Archie Moore was champion, he was a closet athlete.
He had to hide his age. Sonny Liston had to conceal his age, too.
It was as if, once you mentioned their age, their careers were over
and no one would take them seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning to the baby-boom generation of which he and Holmes
are a part, Foreman added: ``Something happened after World War II.
There were kids born that weren't like other children. I'm part of
that now. Why are we doing things our age group never did before?
Someone smarter than me will have to explain it.''

SPRINT IS LAYING OUT DETAILS OF PLAN TO REVAMP NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. has been laying out fresh details of an ambitious
program to revamp its communications network to provide integrated
data and video information at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance telephone company, announced the
plan amid much fanfare last month, but investors were largely
underwhelmed because the company provided few financial and
technical details of its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was building an advanced network but offered
little to explain how it wanted to deploy and market the service
and how it intended to work with local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Sprint has made deals with Ameritech, BellSouth, GTE
and SBC Communications to use those local companies' fiber optic
networks within cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is continuing to try to negotiate deals with the
remaining Bell local phone companies and with big competitive local
phone providers including AT&AMP;T Corp.'s Teleport unit and Worldcom
Inc.'s MFS operation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, William Esrey, Sprint's chairman,
said that deals with existing local phone companies could allow
Sprint to reach 70 percent of its target business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint intends to begin offering big businesses access to the
integrated network later this year. The service will be generally
available to business customers near the middle of next year and to
consumers late in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said Sprint would aim at between 30 million and 35 million
of the nation's roughly 100 million households for the new service.
He said he expected that families who sign up for the service,
which would combine local and long-distance telephone service with
high-speed access to the Internet and video capabilities, would
spend about $125 a month.
</P>
<P>
   With each subscriber generating that kind of revenue, Esrey
said, Sprint could turn a profit with as few as one million
residential users.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's deals with the Bells and GTE do not address the
question of how Sprint's services actually get into homes and
offices. Esrey would not say how much Sprint anticipates spending
to upgrade individual phone lines to carry the new service, but
analysts generally estimate that figure at between $500 and $1,000
a line.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said Sprint's costs could end up being lower than
estimated because of the geographic concentration of the target
market. Of the roughly 26,000 local telephone central offices in
the nation, Esrey said, about 4,000 of them would allow Sprint to
connect to 70 percent of the target households.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey also said that Sprint would continue to pursue alliances
with cable television companies. He said that if AT&AMP;T succeeded in
acquiring Tele-Communications Inc., then AT&AMP;T should have to resell
access to TCI's cable television network to competitors like
Sprint. &QL;

BABBITT HELPS DEMOLISH DAM, BUT SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH
FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Ore. _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt Wednesday swung
a sledgehammer to begin demolishing an outdated Oregon irrigation
dam, while signaling he is ready to deal with critics on the tricky
issue of removing dams from Washington state rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt praised what he called ``steady and inexorable''
progress toward removing two aging dams from the Elwha River, and
restoring 70 miles of spawning habitat that was once home to the
largest salmon runs of the Olympic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But in a clear peace signal toward Senate Republicans, Babbitt
said in an interview that he would take no action toward modifying
or taking down federal dams on the Columbia River system without
the assent of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is studying the future of four Army Corps
of Engineers dams on the Snake River in eastern Washington. Since
the dams were built in the late 1960s and early 1970s, salmon runs
on the river have plummeted to the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, of course, do not speak for the administration _ I am just
the Secretary of the Interior,'' Babbitt said with a smile. ``It
is, however, my view that under existing law Congress' approval
would be needed for any significant alterations or removal of dams
from the Columbia and Snake ivers . . . I acknowledge it would take
action by Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has been engaged in an intricate, year-long negotiation
with Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., chairman of the Senate Interior
appropriations subcommittee and holder of his department's purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   A critic of Elwha dam removal, Gorton has moved toward putting
up money for the federal government to buy both dams and tear down
the lower dam. As a price, however, he has insisted that no action
be taken toward removing dams on the Snake River. Gorton has
demanded that the prohibition be written into law.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has embarked on an examination of the nation's 75,000
large dams, and to identify those that are obsolete, expensive,
unsafe and environmentally destructive.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he joined local water districts near Chico, Calif.,
to begin removing McPherrin Dam on a key tributary of the
Sacramento River. The breaching of the dam will open about 25 miles
of Butte Creek to fish. The creek is one of only four Sacramento
River tributaries with remaining populations of spring chinook
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Babbitt was swinging the sledgehammer again. He put a
notch in the Bear Creek Dam in downtown Medford. The dam is being
replaced as part of a program of civic beautification and
environmental improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, under a hot sun, drew hundreds of people and
reflected water fights going on around the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the river flow!'' chanted a large contingent of
environmentalist demonstrators who cheered as Babbitt knocked away
the first few chunks of the dam.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs, however, proclaimed ``Protect Our Property
Rights,'' and the property rights contingent chanted ``Don't Let
Babbitt Have It'' as he attacked the dam.
</P>
<P>
   They were protesting a critical habitat plan for endangered coho
salmon in southwest Oregon and California's north coast that plan
would protect 300-foot-wide zones along river banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our home sits one foot from a 100-year flood plain. If these
regulations are approved, I will need a federal license to put
gravel on my road,'' said Richard Gierah of Yreka, Calif., one of
the property rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, though, was preaching peace. He cited the restoration
of Bear Creek, in which irrigators, Medford civic leaders and local
fisheries groups all signed off on a restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are doing sends a big, big message to Oregon, the
West and the United States,'' he said. ``We don't have to continue
the confrontational traditions we grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 1993 tour of the Olympic Peninsula, Babbitt mused about
pushing the plunger that would blow up one of the dams. Since then,
he has continued to focus on the Elwha River, where department
studies predict that runs of 250,000 salmon a year can be restored
if the dams are removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been moving, slower than I would have wanted toward a
consensus goal of getting those dam off that river,'' he said. ``We
have to keep the process moving and it will happen.''

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS AID OF REHNQUIST IN QUASHING SECRET SERVICE
SUBPOENAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add `administration officials said' in lede)  (See also: CONGRESS-RENO) 
(JT) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Wednesday night asked
Chief Justice William Rehnquist to intervene in its battle to keep
the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr from forcing
Secret Service agents to testify before the grand jury
investigating the relationship between President Clinton and a
former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Rehnquist or the U.S. Court of Appeals acts on the
extraordinary motion from the administration, filed after a U.S.
district courtjudge refused to block their testimony, the agents
are scheduled to appear before Starr's grand jury on Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The heated struggle over Starr's demand for testimony by the
agents guarding Clinton goes to the heart of the delicate and at
times difficult relationship between the president and his
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, like all presidents, chafes at the invasion of privacy
that Secret Service protection demands as the price of protection.
But over time, Clinton has come to accept the suffocating proximity
of his guardians as a part of his job.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest subpoena of eight Secret Service officers,
including Larry Cockell, the head of the plainclothes detail
guarding the president, Starr is seeking the testimony of those
with the most intimate knowledge of Clinton's movements and his
meetings to provide corroboration of other witnesses' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the White House on Wednesday
challenged those subpoenas, saying they would intrude on a
relationship that demands implicit trust and confidentiality.
Breaking that bond could imperil the president's life, they say.
They said any testimony by the agents should be deferred until
completion of the government's appeals of two federal court rulings
requiring testimony by Secret Service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But their arguments, made in a secret court session, failed to
persuade District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, administration
officials said this evening. Johnson on Wednesday repeated her
assertion in a May ruling that there was no legal basis for the
Secret Service claim that agents had an untested ``protective
function privilege'' not to testify, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia U.S. Court of
Appeals last week unanimously upheld her May ruling requiring the
agents' testimony; the administration is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, White House spokesman Mike McCurry and
Clinton's private attorneys attacked the latest subpoenas as a
potential violation of attorney-client privilege and a breach of
the confidentiality that presidents expect of their agents. Until
now, the White House refused to discuss the Secret Service issue,
saying it was being handled by the Justice Department and the
Service's parent agency, the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry struck out at Starr Wednesday, calling him an
``overzealous prosecutor'' who ``seems to be throwing subpoenas at
anything that moves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the head of the president's detail has heard the president
talking to one of his attorneys, in what is presumed to be a
privileged conversation, the government has the right to come and
take someone who by law has to be in the car to protect the
president and try to find out about that conversation?'' McCurry
said. ``Those are tactics that are certainly questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now served subpoenas on about ten Secret Service
employees _ Cockell, several members of its uniformed division, and
the agency's general counsel, John Kelleher. Cockell is currently
the head of the Presidential Protective Detail, the plainclothes
agents who provide immediate physical protection to the president
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed division guards the White House and provides
security at sites where the president appears. As guardians of the
White House complex, uniformed officers control access to the West
Wing and keep detailed records of the president's visitors,
although they rarely know what goes on behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's efforts to compel the testimony of Secret Service
officers have shaken the agency to its core.
</P>
<P>
   Senior agency officials have said that it is a daily struggle to
persuade Clinton _ and every previous president _ to accept the
intrusive presence the Service believes it needs to protect him.
Hauling agents into court would shatter the necessary intimacy
between the president and his guardians, Service officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton first moved into the White House in 1993, there
were persistent reports of friction with agents assigned to guard
him. Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton bristled _ as
all new White House occupants do _ at the round-the-clock
protection and its inevitable infringement of personal privacy. The
mood wasn't helped by rumors (later vehemently denied) that Secret
Service agents had witnessed Mrs. Clinton throwing a lamp or a
Bible at her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service officials are sensitive to the burden that
protection imposes on the first family. ``We are with them 24 hours
a day,'' said a former member of the presidential detail. ``We are
there for moments of tension between you and your wife, your
relatives, your children. We are there to experience your Christmas
Eve, your Christmas Day. We're talking about the very minutiae of
daily life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Agents are seldom actually with the president when he is in the
family quarters of the White House, although they do control access
to the private floors of the executive mansion when the first
family is in residence. The president can meet privately with
anyone in the residence, the Oval Office, the White House theater
and numerous crannies of the sprawling mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But agents are always nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service officials say they always know where the
president is, but they don't always know who is with him and they
are trained not to eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do our jobs chiefly with our eyes, not our ears,'' said
Hamilton Brown, executive secretary of the Association of Former
Agents of the U.S. Secret Service, who guarded every president from
Kennedy to Reagan. ``No one's ever talked a president to death. We
tend to turn off the background noise and concentrate on the job
we're there to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the president meets in the Oval Office with aides or small
groups of visitors, agents remain discreetly outside. But when he
receives larger groups, agents remain.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said that the president has a close and
respectful relationship with the agents assigned to guard him. But
he has complained about the disruption his travels cause _ 40-car
motorcades, freeway closures, the large tents erected to block
public view of his entrances and exits to hotels and convention
halls.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Clinton's lawyers suspect that Starr
wants to question Cockell about conversations he might have
overheard in the presidential limousine on Jan. 17, the day Clinton
was deposed by lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones. It was at that
six-hour session that Clinton was first asked about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Attorney General Janet Reno faced fierce
criticism Wednesday for her decision to appeal the Secret Service
privilege rulings. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the
Judiciary Committee, told her that he was dismayed at the decision
which he believed, ``called into serious question the real
motivations of both the Department of Justice and the Secret
Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has agreed to consider legislation establishing a
partial privilege for agents, said there was no respectable legal
scholar in the nation who believed such a privilege currently
existed.

TWA CRASH INVESTIGATORS ACKNOWLEDGE THEY MAY NEVER FIND CAUSE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after the crash of TWA Flight 800, the
National Transportation Safety Board is moving toward finishing its
investigation without knowing the source of the spark that touched
off the explosion that destroyed the Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of the safety board said that within a year they
hope to conclude several research projects that will expand their
knowledge of how the plane's center fuel tank reached a state where
it could sustain an explosion and allow them to make further
recommendations for preventing similar explosions. But they
acknowledge that determining the precise cause of the detonation
may be beyond their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The officials' comments made it seem more likely that the final
report on the accident will not answer what for many in the public
remains the central mystery of the crash that took 230 lives on
July 17, 1996. But for investigators, the central question has
always been how to prevent similar explosions. And they said that
their investigation has already yielded a series of recommendations
sufficient to prevent the build-up of fuel vapors in airplane tanks
that they believe made the explosion aboard Flight 800 possible.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that finding the source of the spark is not a
reason to continue the investigation indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were able to pinpoint what ignited TWA Flight 800, and
fix that ignition source, there are still the other ignition
sources we've identified as possibilities, and the ones we haven't
even thought of,'' said NTSB Chairman James Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said in an interview that he hoped that within the next
year the safety board will be able to issue its report on the
explosion that destroyed the plane off the coast of Long Island
minutes after it took off from Kennedy Airport for Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has often told the families of those who died
in the accident that it may be unable to find the cause of the
spark. But the board has only recently set a time frame for ending
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of 1996, when investigators concluded that the
747's center tank had exploded, their vision of the end point of
the investigation has gradually but fundamentally shifted, away
from determining what set it off and toward finding out how such
explosions can be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates Boeing and
the airlines but must defer to the safety board in the
investigation, is moving in the same direction, planning steps to
reduce the risk of fuel tank explosions without knowing what set
off Flight 800's. An industry advisory committee, with
representatives from Boeing, the airlines, aircraft parts
manufacturers and fuel companies, is due to report to the FAA by
July 23, and is likely to recommend that the airlines switch to a
fuel blend that does not turn so easily from liquid to vapor, the
form that can burn or explode.
</P>
<P>
   TWA says it does not see an end in sight. ``As far as I know,
they're not even close to any kind of probable cause,'' said
airline spokesman Mark Abels. He said the investigation could last
``many years.''
</P>
<P>
   But safety board officials are emphasizing not that they are
unlikely to pinpoint the cause of the spark, but what they have
learned over the last two painstaking years: that the center fuel
tank of the 747 exploded; that far more often than previously
believed, the empty space in fuel tanks on other commercial jets
have conditions that can sustain such explosions; that the wiring
of old 747's and other models show a variety of problems, and that
simple changes to the fuel or tanks could cut the risk.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, airlines that fly 747's, warned by Boeing to expect
orders soon from the FAA, are inspecting their planes and replacing
some parts. These include parts of the fuel probes, which measure
fuel volume, and which were found in the case of Flight 800 and
other old 747's to show flaws. An increased emphasis on wiring has
led to a variety of changes in airplanes, and to the emergency
grounding of some older 737's after flaws in fuel-tank wiring were
discovered earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Flight 800 specifically, the NTSB is pursuing several areas
of research. One is computer simulations of center tank explosions,
trying to determine from the way this tank came apart where the
spark originated. The tank is about the size of a two-car garage,
but it is divided into several chambers, and engineers still hope
that further analysis of the damage pattern will tell them more
about where ignition occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The board also plans to blow up a full-sized tank from a
decommissioned 747. The board blew up a similar tank last year, but
that tank had previously been damaged, engineers say, and the fuel
they used, propane, had more energy than jet fuel does.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board also plans to conduct more test explosions in a
one-fourth scale model.
</P>
<P>
   The board may hold another round of hearings in the case this
fall, as it did last year in Baltimore. It also continues to
receive a flood of ideas from around the world, from people with a
wide variety of backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a retired Navy commander, William Donaldson, after
a lengthy and sometimes bitter exchange of letters with the board,
has drafted a 96-page report that seeks to persuade the aviation
subcommittee of the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure to hold more hearings on the crash. Donaldson argues
that the plane was destroyed by a missile and that the safety board
and the FBI are trying to hide this.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of the aviation subcommittee, Rep. James Traficant,
D-Ohio, began looking into the possibility of a missile last
September, and concluded in a letter sent Wednesday to the
committee chairman, Rep. James Duncan, R-Tenn., that he had found
``not a single shred of evidence to counter the NTSB's assertion
that the crash was initiated through a fuel air explosion in the
center wing fuel tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The reconstructed wreckage of the plane itself still sits in a
hangar in Calverton, on Long Island. It may be the
longest-surviving TWA 747, because it will be there for the
foreseeable future, and the airline has since scrapped the rest of
its 747's as uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what its long-term future is. The reconstructed
wreckage of Pan Am 103, another 747, that was brought down by a
terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, 10 years ago in December,
is still standing. USAir flight 427, a Boeing 737 that crashed near
Pittsburgh in September, 1994, is mostly still in boxes, according
to Paul Turk, a spokesman for the airline, now called US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines Flight 585, another 737, which went down near
Colorado Springs in March, 1991, is also in boxes. ``Some of it is
in a hangar in Colorado Springs, and some of it is in San Francisco
at our maintenance base,'' said Joe Hopkins, an airline spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do reach a point in time where there really is no reason
to keep it,'' he said. But some lawsuits go on for years, he said,
and the wreckage could be evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not keep it for 100 years,'' he said, ``but you
might for 15.''

TIME TO KO SLEAZY PROMOTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Boxing is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   As well it should be. In a free society, people have the right
to determine their own destiny as long as no one other than
themselves is hurt in the process.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the sport needs an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   It's as safe as reasonably possible given its violent nature.
And it's getting safer as doctors and administrators tinker with
policy, particularly in ever-vigilant California.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies in the way boxing business is done. The people
running the sport _ particularly promoters and managers _ are too
greedy for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   They are overly protective of their fighters for fear of losing
them and the money they bring in. With boundless egos, they are
utterly unable to work with one another. And their underhanded way
of doing business alienates sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   It might be too late for promoters Don King and Bob Arum, both
of whom are 60-plus and near the end of their reigns.
</P>
<P>
   Those who succeed them, however, had better break from boxing's
sleazy tradition. To compete for the entertainment dollar, the
sport must be run more like a corporation than a back-room craps
game.
</P>
<P>
   Its business must be conducted in the open, not in secrecy,
where fighters tend to be taken advantage of. It must operate in a
free and open market, not one encumbered with restrictive
contracts. And it must adhere to basic supply-and-demand economic
tenets: Give the public what it wants and the money will roll in.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation proposed by U.S. senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Richard Bryan (D-Nev.) would help tremendously. The ``Muhammad Ali
Boxing Reform Act'' is designed to make promoters and sanctioning
bodies accountable for their actions and regulate contracts so
fighters won't become slaves to the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   The feds will be watching more than ever. They had better
behave.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the absence of a national or international governing
body, it will be up to promoters to run the business wisely.
</P>
<P>
   They must pit their fighters against the best challengers
regardless of the risk. Boxing needs a handful of compelling fights
each year to maintain interest in the sport. That hasn't happened
recently because the best tend to avoid the best for fear of
losing.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, a well-fought loss wasn't such a terrible thing.
Sugar Ray Robinson, the greatest fighter ever, lost 19 times. It
didn't affect his marketability.
</P>
<P>
   And they must get creative in their marketing, using the
nation's major sports as models. Boxing needs to create its Michael
Jordans and its Mark McGwires.
</P>
<P>
   These are examples of how thinking must change. The sanctioning
bodies are a stickier problem.
</P>
<P>
   These for-profit organizations, which are based in and out of
the United States, provide a means to recognize champions and rank
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   They're a cancer in at least two regards.
</P>
<P>
   One, there are too many of them _ more than a dozen. Today, the
talent pool is so diluted that world titles mean almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, the bodies are corrupt. Their rankings are based on
how much money their executives can make under the table, not on
the ability of the fighters.
</P>
<P>
   For now, we're stuck with the sanctioning bodies. Boxing must
have rankings and champions to function.
</P>
<P>
   But they have only as much power as the boxing business gives
them. They should be used to provide a loose structure but not as
the foundation of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, fighters should be matched according to ability or
marketability _ not where they stand in some bogus rankings system
compiled by unscrupulous sharks.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, the sanctioning bodies will fade away and a
central authority beholden to no one will govern boxing. It might
be then that it joins the fraternity of mainstream _ and honorable
_ professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, here's some advice for those who control
boxing: Wake up! You oversee one of the most exciting and noble
sports in world. Do it justice and everyone will benefit.

 &HT;    Rudolph hunt leads to N.C. lookout point
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Federal agents searching for Birmingham bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph have found what they believe was an
observation point where the fugitive watched the Nantahala
residence of a man whose help he tried to enlist for food and other
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   They believe Rudolph watched the house of 71-year-old George
Nordmann for several days before approaching the health food store
owner July 7.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal document, Rudolph approached Nordmann,
described as a ``nodding acquaintance,'' and presented him with a
list of provisions and five $100 bills. Investigators said the
items requested included batteries, oatmeal, beans and raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, a 32-year-old itinerant carpenter who lived for a while
in western North Carolina, is being sought in the fatal bombing of
a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta-area bombings.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 federal agents and scores of other law enforcement
officers were searching the area Wednesday around where Nordmann's
pickup was found Monday afternoon. Agents of the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation were involved in sealing off and searching the Apple
Tree campground near Topton.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also brought in a U.S. Customs helicopter equipped
with infrared viewing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nordmann did not report to authorities he had seen
Rudolph or that his pickup was missing until Saturday, he is not
believed to have supplied the suspected bomber with his truck or
with food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not changing from what we originally said _ he (Rudolph)
took it,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Responding to media
reports that explosive residue was found in the vehicle,
authorities said they don't know where Rudolph went in the truck,
but they have found no evidence of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running forensic tests,'' Killorin said of the truck,
which was taken to the ATF lab in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined if Rudolph used the truck to haul the
food to some lair or if he carried the load or stashed it.
</P>
<P>
   The food, which included canned goods, is estimated to weigh up
to 100 pounds, Macon County Sheriff Homer Holbrooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are unlimited places to dump food around here,'' the
sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin joined in a chorus of federal officials Wednesday in
saying that Nordmann is not considered to have been aiding Rudolph
in eluding capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small community,'' Killorin said. ``There is some
militia activity up there, and this is where the guy lived. Eric
Rudolph is a dangerous fugitive and informing on him is a matter of
concern. But what did he do at the end of the day? He did come
forward. He did the right thing.''

POLITICIANS EAGER TO SPEND STATE'S RECORD SURPLUS OF $3 BILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Whether it is pork-barrel promises or just good
public policy, Texas's Democratic and Republican politicians are on
a spending spree this year, the likes of which hasn't occurred
since the oil-boom days of the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is talk of ``scrubbing the budget'' and no new taxes from
the years of revenue shortfalls. Politicians are appealing to
voters this year with expensive promises they can afford to
fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   And the price of those promises may go up Thursday after
Comptroller John Sharp announces a state revenue surplus of about
$3 billion, a state record.
</P>
<P>
   From Republican Gov. George W. Bush to his Democratic challenger
Garry Mauro to the lieutenant governor showdown between Democrat
Sharp and Republican Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry, the
spending promises are flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this election is about is: `The money is there. How are
you going to spend it?' '' Mauro said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is an unprecedented opportunity to
`reprioritize' where Texas goes in the 21st century,'' Mauro said.
``Revenues are up 24 percent since Bush has been in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Perry, within the framework of fiscal conservatism, said
there is room for additional state spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do feel good about the economy in general,'' Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear out there during this period of good times is:
Let's improve our public education ... fix our roads and bridges
and ... let's make sure our criminal justice system is funded
properly,'' Perry said. ``But once you get those basic needs
addressed ... they (taxpayers) want their money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used part of a $2.4 billion surplus in the current budget
last year to deliver a $1 billion property tax cut to homeowners.
But almost half that cut was eaten up by local school district tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
   For his re-election campaign, Bush has spent almost every day
during the past two weeks touring rural county courthouses
promising that if re-elected he will renovate them at a cost of
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has promised to spend another $203 million on a
reading initiative to fulfill his pledge to end the social
promotion of ill-prepared students in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is proposing cutting state revenues $100 million a
year with a research and development tax credit to encourage
high-tech businesses to move to Texas. The proposal would require
another $17.8 million to target community college students for
training needed by the high tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Perry are promoting a plan to exempt 176,000 small
businesses from the state franchise tax at a cost of $37 million to
the state during the next two years. Sharp has a plan to exempt an
additional 56,000 small businesses at a cost to the state of $58
million.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has a spending plan that he calls Putting Families First.
Mauro said his plan will improve education and the lives of average
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has proposed eliminating the state's motor vehicle sales
tax at a cost of $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also has proposed spending $2.6 billion to give each of
the state's teachers a $5,000-a-year raise. He wants to spend $200
million to restore cuts in the state's contribution to the Texas
Teacher Retirement System that were made during the budget-crunch
days of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another Mauro plan would borrow $2 billion from the principle of
the Permanent School Fund to build new classrooms in Texas schools.
The state would repay the money with interest over 30 years. Bush
has called this plan an ``irresponsible'' raid on the school trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said he is not against Bush's courthouse renovation
proposal. But Mauro said the time Bush has spent campaigning on it
shows a difference in their priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``His priority is to rebuild $200 million worth of
courthouses,'' Mauro said. ``I don't think that's the first place
we ought to be spending money. We ought to tear down the temporary
buildings (at schools) and build permanent classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was unavailable Wednesday, but his campaign spokeswoman,
Mindy Tucker, said Bush is for responsible spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, he's committed to fully funding public education, and
he's always looking for additional ways to cut taxes,'' Tucker
said. ``He believes we must find responsible ways to continue to
cut taxes and at the same time leave the state in a solid financial
position for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said Mauro is a ``liberal's liberal'' who wants to spend
all of the state's money on new programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the lieutenant governor's race, Sharp is proposing a college
scholarship program that would pay for the college tuition of high
school students with a 2.8 grade point average. The cost would be
$485 million a year and has Mauro's backing.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp also wants to reduce the effect of the so-called ``Robin
Hood'' school finance plan by increasing state spending on public
education by $700 million a year. That would reduce the amount of
money wealthy school districts have to transfer to poor school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's education proposals include spending $70 million a year
to give teachers who take specialized training as reading teachers
a $5,000 bonus. They would receive an additional $2,000 a year if
they teach in schools with low achievement scores.
</P>
<P>
   Perry also wants to develop an experimental voucher program to
give public-school students money to attend private schools,
secular or religious. Perry has not put a price tag on that
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning in the Rio Grande Valley this week, Perry also
proposed building a South Texas medical school, at a cost of $66
million over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said his approach to the state's budget surplus and
returning excess tax dollars to the state's citizens is different
from Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has taken the Bill Clinton approach to this
campaign: You pander, promise and spend until it hurts,'' Perry
said. ``I reject that crass politics of just promising everybody
whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said his programs do not amount to increased state
spending because he plans to propose budget cuts to pay for them.
Sharp said budget-cutting proposals he has made in the past seven
years as comptroller have saved the state $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different than any other year, and I'm doing what
I've always done _ coming up with ways to improve education while
suggesting cuts to pay for my proposals,'' Sharp said.

WATER-MAIN BREAK CAUSES HAVOC ON MANHATTAN'S EAST SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A loose cap blew off a water main on Manhattan's
Upper East Side Wednesday, opening up a gaping sinkhole, sending
water surging through the streets, shutting the nearby Franklin D.
Roosevelt Drive for several hours and disrupting operations at some
of the city's most prestigious hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The havoc began shortly after 4 a.m. when a geyser of muddy
water started spraying into the street at 68th Street and York
Avenue, at the crossroads of some of the area's most important
medical institutions and research centers. No one was seriously
injured, but the cascading water flooded the streets for blocks
around, and quickly started pouring into hospital basements,
hampering operations.
</P>
<P>
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, on the west side of
York Avenue, nonemergency surgery was postponed, many chemotherapy
appointments were rescheduled, and employees struggled to keep
convalescing patients comfortable after nearly half of the
hospital's air-conditioning system was knocked out on the hot and
humid day. At New York and Presbyterian Hospital, on the east side
of the avenue, the main entrance was closed, pickups and drop-offs
were disrupted, and scientists struggled frantically to salvage the
fruits of years of research as water flooded into their basement
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   At ground zero for the flood was a dark blue Lincoln Town Car
driven by Imran Siddiqui, a livery driver. Siddiqui, who had just
dropped off a fare and was tallying up his receipts, said he felt a
brief trembling and then a violent lurch as the rear of the car
sank into the street. Water shot up around the windows, he said, as
if he had been in a drive-through car wash. He escaped just before
the earth opened and swallowed his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought the East River had overflowed, or there had
been an earthquake,'' Siddiqui, 24, said from a gurney at the New
York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, where he went for X-rays
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hundreds of other water main ruptures that plague the
city's aging infrastructure each year, Wednesday's mishap was not
caused by a defect in century-old piping, but rather by a small
section of pipe that was laid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The rupture occurred at an elbow of the East Side's water
system, where a 36-inch distribution pipe that runs down York
Avenue turns east onto 68th Street. At the bend is a 20-inch-wide
stub of a pipe, which is supposed to be shut by a metal cap until
it is ultimately linked to a new branch of pipe continuing south on
York Avenue. The cap, which had been held in place by clamps, blew
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like taking the cork out of a Champagne bottle,'' said
Joel Miele, commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental
Protection, which oversees the city's 6,600 miles of water pipes.
Miele said that the cap was held in place by a single set of
clamps, but that new specifications put in place after 1992 called
for fastening pipe caps down with two sets of clamps. He said that
an inquiry into the mishap would focus on why the clamps gave way.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding led to a series of frenzied early-morning calls
summoning doctors and scientists to their labs, both to assuage the
concerns of rescue workers that hazardous materials could be washed
into public areas and to save data from long-term research
projects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hugh Robertson, who directs a molecular biology lab at the Joan
and Sanford Weill Medical College and Graduate School of Medical
Sciences of Cornell University, got a call shortly after 4:30 a.m.
and raced to his lab, which is in a basement with windows at street
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a research lab, so we expect all manner of things _
unexpected things _ that nature will visit upon us,'' Robertson
said, ``but usually we expect it in an experimental context. We
watched the water fill the window wells and then pour through the
seals at a great clip. Suddenly, in a moment, years of data was
jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and his students spent the morning trying to salvage
what they could, photocopying soggy reports before they became
illegible, trying to preserve films of molecules and seeing whether
all the computers still worked.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Neel, 31, a senior graduate student, sat outside New York
and Presbyterian Hospital in her white lab coat, drinking coffee
and worrying about two years of research she had done on the delta
virus, which can cause significant liver damage in humans when it
strikes in conjunction with hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of damage,'' she said. ``It's like
a plague of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of city workers spent Wednesday gathered around the
yawning sinkhole, which stretched 30 feet long by 20 feet wide and
reached 8 feet deep. By midday, Siddiqui's totaled Lincoln had been
fished out.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding closed the FDR Drive in both directions for several
hours during Wednesday's morning rush and shut down traffic on York
Avenue between 63rd Street and 72nd Street for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison shut off its steam lines to keep them from
being ruptured by the sudden blast of cold water pouring over them.
The lack of steam power knocked out half of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering's air-conditioning system, which uses steam power
to turn turbines. Officials at the hospital turned off the
air-conditioning in office areas to divert as much cold air as
possible to patients. City officials said Wednesday night they
expected the steam power to be restored by Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of asbestos that insulate the steam pipes were loosened by
the flood, leading emergency workers to seal off the area and
forcing each worker to get decontaminated by white-suited
firefighters wielding brushes and by rinsing off in a 4-by-6-foot
wading pool marked ``Hazmat Decon Pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, the director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said the decontamination was merely a precaution. ``The
asbestos was not airborne,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flood did not do nearly as much damage as other
water main breaks _ like the Jan. 2 rupture that flooded lower
Fifth Avenue and ignited a nearby gas main _ it left a series of
indelible images in the memory of witnesses. It began with a
trickle but grew into a surging rivulet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought somebody was cleaning the sidewalks,'' said Manny
Kouroupakis, 45, who was setting up his coffee truck on York Avenue
when the break occurred. ``Then the water kept coming and coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouroupakis and Siddiqui, the livery driver, called police.
``The limo was bouncing up and down, with water shooting up about
three or four feet into the air,'' Kouroupakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the car fell into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Siddiqui, who plans to enroll at York College this year, said
his father had always worried about his work as a livery driver,
especially about the thieves. ``When I get home, my dad will
probably say, `I'm sorry, but I told you a thousand times: It's not
safe,''' he said, laughing.

 &HT;    Ensuring prosperity for future generation
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- What will the Miami Valley look like in 20
years?
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it depends on what we do now. The current wave of
prosperity has placed richer, fuller lives within the grasps of
thousands of people here, but like a nagging thought that won't go
away, there is a feeling, a sense that the region as a whole could
be doing much better.
</P>
<P>
   Serious problems remain at its foundation: a growing disparity
between rich and poor, a shortage of skilled workers, an education
system under fire and persistent concerns over the quality of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems could still be here in the year 2020 and beyond,
unless ways are found to translate the current prosperity into a
solid economy and society for the future.
</P>
<P>
   How can prosperity be deepened and broadened, and also be made
more long-lasting? It is a question that people are wrestling with
here as well as in cities and towns around the country. And it is
one for which there are no easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has developed a blueprint for a thriving
21st century economy, urging communities to build on their
strengths and shore up their weaknesses. Called Sustainable
America, it's a clunky phrase but a concept that's creeping more
and more into public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the idea of sustainable development is like a
triangle, with economic growth on one corner, environmental
protection and social justice on the other two.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton formed the Council on Sustainable Development
in 1993 with the idea that all three goals are compatible and can
be accomplished together.
</P>
<P>
   Your great-grandfather might have passed it along as a bit of
folk wisdom: Don't eat your seed corn.
</P>
<P>
   Like grandfather's advice, the founding principle of the council
is: ``Each generation is entitled to interest on the national
capital, but the principal should be handed down unimpaired to
future generations.'' The Chattanooga plan: Improving image and
environment. Cities like Seattle and Chattanooga have already
adopted it as their game plan. The idea, in its widest scope, has
yet to catch on in the Miami Valley, where study after study in the
last decade lists uncoordinated planning as one of the chief
obstacles to progress. But even here there are plenty of
sustainable projects to build on and _ as a central tenet of
sustainability _ everybody can pitch in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become what they call garage-door communities; you hit
the button and shut the world out,'' said Mike Wood of Kettering
Medical Center, who stepped down from a vice president's job to
have more time for his family, church and community. ``People need
to take a personal responsibility to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga is often held up as a model of sustainable
development. Once derided as the most polluted city in America,
Chattanooga found a way to improve its environment and the city's
image.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chattanooga, like Dayton, saw development of its
riverfront as a key element of the city's revitalization. Today all
but two miles of a 22-mile stretch of the Tennessee River has been
developed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The city has spent $150 million and has 20 new projects totaling
$316 million under way, according to the River Valley Partners, a
mix of public and private leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Aquarium has pumped up the tourist industry
downtown and housing values are skyrocketing on the north side of
the river, according to city planner Gordon Mellencamp.
</P>
<P>
   A system of free electric trolleys downtown has eased some of
the city's air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the riverfront development has done a lot to affect
the attitude of people here,'' Mellencamp said. ``It has improved
our self-image and allowed the community to feel it had a real
input into decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Vogler of the River Valley Partners said business
executives looking to relocate are always given a tour of the
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have seen cities all over the country,''
she said. ``They always comment on how impressed they are that the
city has re-invested in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga has had some business successes _ a new AT&AMP;T call
center, a $350 million expansion of the DuPont plant _ but faces
the same intense competition for jobs as other cities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth in population is steady, but not large _ about 1.5
percent a year,'' Vogler said. Seattle's 40-point check list
Seattle, with thousands of people flocking there, has the opposite
problem: coping with tremendous growth. The city has been working
on sustainable development since 1992, and created a 40-point
checklist of what makes up a healthy community. It is that
checklist that is serving as a guidepost for at least 10 other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items on the checklist seem odd. Gardening. Library
usage. Hospital emergency room use. Biodiversity. Wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   But sociolgists are finding that simple activities like
gardening clubs and bowling leagues are the sinew that holds
together a community, giving it muscle and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Other indicators, like hospital emergency room use, may signal a
lack of widespread health care insurance, a situation that may
prove more costly in the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Sustainable Seattle's latest report, delivered on Earth Day last
spring, shows mixed success, underscoring the difficulty of the
task.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and King County's streets and highways are still
chronically clogged with traffic, and trends show people driving
more and using more gasoline. There has been a 9 percent rise in
voter participation _ one of sustainability's goals _ but still
only 22 percent of eligible voters go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report lists as successes a 12 percent drop in
water consumption and the 49 percent of young people who do some
kind of volunteer work in the community.
</P>
<P>
   About 46 percent of the 500 people who responded to a Dayton
Daily News poll said they do some volunteer work, while 53 percent
said they do none.
</P>
<P>
   Studies such as the recent 20/20 Vision report prepared by
Dayton list education, regional decentralization, concentration of
poverty and economic change as problems facing the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that the Miami Valley is one of the 10 most
decentralized metropolitan regions in the country. It also has one
of the highest concentrations of poverty in the central core.
Twenty-five percent of the population of Dayton lives below the
poverty line. The rate is just 6 percent for adjacent suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Dayton is hardly alone, even within its own region. Of the
25 poorest Zip Codes in the Miami Valley, more than half are
outside Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity in the '90s has helped most of us to a more
comfortable lifestyle, but those shut out by age, social
environment, education and, yes, lack of initiative are being left
in Nowheresville as the money train streaks past without slowing
down.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity can create a vacuum that hurts some areas. For
example, 77 percent of Dayton's housing is older than 35 years.
Statistics show that during good times people opt for new and
better housing rather than rehabilitating older housing stock.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that worries about schools, crime and crowded living
conditions and Dayton _ along with similar cities throughout the
country _ is left treading water while the wave of prosperity
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities, like Indianapolis and Cleveland, have made
remarkable comebacks in the 1990s by providing a reason to go
there. Cities like Dayton won't revive without similar efforts.
Getting better, not just bigger. Tom Traynor, an economics
professor at Wright State University, said allowing Dayton _ and
its downtown _ to deteriorate further would make the city a
``wasted resource.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton is unique in some ways,'' said Traynor. ``It is unusual
to see a city develop to this size without a harbor, oil or some
sort of resource. Dayton's resources were its patents and
inventors.''
</P>
<P>
   Communities must look for ways to get better, not just bigger,
says the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado think tank, in its
Guide to Economic Renewal .
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's plans for riverfront development and the proposed minor
league baseball stadium are attempts at a ``big win'' solution to
some of the city's problems. Other solutions, aimed at Sustainable
America's goals of economic growth with a cleaner environment and
more widespread opportunity, may come in smaller doses.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownfields'' redevelopment of old, abandoned factories in
Dayton. The city recently became part of a nationwide project which
includes more than 60 cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton received a $250,000 grant that it's using to help
redevelop the former GHR Foundry, 400 Detrick St., near the Great
Miami River. Revitalizing abandoned industrial sites into new
businesses could help alleviate the city's poverty rate by
providing low-skill manufacturing or service jobs close to
impoverished neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The PRISM project, which brings citizens, environmental
regulators and General Motors engineers together to look for more
ecologically sound manufacturing techniques. Called cradle-to-grave
product responsibility, it is a key element in Sustainable
America's plan for the future. The PRISM project could turn GM and
other area plants into models for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's effort at farmland preservation. Food processing is a
$5.6 billion industry in the state, and the legislature has begun
attempts to preserve the large and diverse farm sector that
supports it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Composite Systems Technology in
Kettering, where research into advanced, lightweight composite
materials may someday help government and industry in the goal of
developing an 80-mile-per-gallon car. The U.S. Department of Energy
is pushing hard for high-mileage, low-polluting vehicles.
Lightweight body construction, which composite technology promises
to deliver, is essential to creating those vehicles. Composites
also have the potential to help with the nation's crumbling
infrastructure, with new ways to repair bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Tool Town, the plan to create a educational research park for
the machine tool industry, incorporates a number of sustainable
ideas. It would revitalize the GHR Foundry, a formerly polluted
downtown industrial site, and address the shortage of skilled
workers in the trade. Dayton is already the fourth-largest
tool-and-die center in the country; Tool Town could make the city a
national destination for workers in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Great Miami River Watershed Council's ongoing plan to
map, monitor and protect the region's water resources. The council
is made up of government and environmental leaders from all over
the Miami Valley who are working together to preserve what may be
the region's most valuable resource.
</P>
<P>
   Urban planners warn that unless steps are taken to shore up the
region's basic strengths _ and eliminate some of the weaknesses _
the recovery could be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing well in the short-term sense,'' said John Weiler,
director for the Center for Business and Economic Research at the
University of Dayton. ``There is a very different look for Dayton
now. In the 1960s the economy was 47 percent manufacturing. Today
it is 20-22 percent. Companies don't seem to want to move here,
stay here or grow here.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday in the '50s and '60s, Dayton was filled with
factories and workers. While that produced one of the most solid
economies in the United States, the central city also inherited the
leftover problems in the form of toxic waste sites like the old
Dayton Tire, Valleycrest and Pinnacle Road landfills.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Council's first report stated: ``Some things
must grow _ jobs, productivity, wages, profits, capital and
savings, information, knowledge, education _ and others _
pollution, waste, poverty, energy and material use per unit of
output _ must not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics think it is an unworkable goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustainable development is just another word for no
development,'' said Sam Staley, an economic analyst for the Buckeye
Institute for Public Policy Research, a national conservative think
tank located in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustainability is being used in the wrong way, it assumes we
know what is sustainable,'' Staley said. ``The market is still the
best determiner of what people want. When you inject the political
process, it gets much messier.'' Reversing a powerful trend. UD's
Weiler observed that sustainable development in the Miami Valley
would be asking the region to ``reverse quite a powerful trend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With urban flight we have a very decentralized economy here,''
Weiler said. ``I have sympathy for Dayton, but the only real hope
for Dayton is growth in the region. For that reason I think it
should become a strong advocate for regional development and hope
its fortunes rise with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Places like Portland and Seattle have resurrected the idea of
urban service boundaries, basically a line drawn around a city to
spur development within and preserve farmland and open space
outside. The rapid rise of new suburbs in the counties surrounding
Dayton, however, threatens to further decentralize the region and
make it that much tougher to pull communities together for
solutions to common problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's opposition to the proposed beltway through western
Montgomery County, Ohio 892, and concern over new water-pumping
plants in the suburbs are examples of two prime weapons _ water and
land use _ being up for grabs in the '90s free-for-all over
development.
</P>
<P>
   So where to go from here?
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley may never be a Silicon Valley or a Golden
Triangle of high-tech manufacturing and education. Perhaps Dayton
will continue its decline without much protest from its suburban
neighbors. But there are some ventures being talked about and put
into action that benefit the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Tool Town and a brand new research park in Beavercreek are
moving ahead. Former military bases in Miamisburg and Kettering are
being transformed into research parks that exploit the region's
aeronautic and nuclear expertise in private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   And the bikeways and green spaces are gradually being linked
together in an effort to build and expand a Miami Valley asset that
will be around long after the '90s fade from memory.
</P>
<P>
   An entire, as yet unimagined, form of economic development could
emerge from these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Ford took the emergence of electric power and made
incredible increases in productivity,'' said Traynor. ``We still
haven't figured out how to use the computer to make other things.
If we do, there could be this explosion of productivity again.''

Gai Mattiolo's models outfitted in Roman sandals and angel wings
during Rome's fashion week. If in the '60s and '70s the fashion
industry was echoing a social mood of rebellion and nonconformism,

 &HT;    Ensuring prosperity for future generation
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- What will the Miami Valley look like in 20
years?
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it depends on what we do now. The current wave of
prosperity has placed richer, fuller lives within the grasps of
thousands of people here, but like a nagging thought that won't go
away, there is a feeling, a sense that the region as a whole could
be doing much better.
</P>
<P>
   Serious problems remain at its foundation: a growing disparity
between rich and poor, a shortage of skilled workers, an education
system under fire and persistent concerns over the quality of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems could still be here in the year 2020 and beyond,
unless ways are found to translate the current prosperity into a
solid economy and society for the future.
</P>
<P>
   How can prosperity be deepened and broadened, and also be made
more long-lasting? It is a question that people are wrestling with
here as well as in cities and towns around the country. And it is
one for which there are no easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has developed a blueprint for a thriving
21st century economy, urging communities to build on their
strengths and shore up their weaknesses. Called Sustainable
America, it's a clunky phrase but a concept that's creeping more
and more into public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the idea of sustainable development is like a
triangle, with economic growth on one corner, environmental
protection and social justice on the other two.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton formed the Council on Sustainable Development
in 1993 with the idea that all three goals are compatible and can
be accomplished together.
</P>
<P>
   Your great-grandfather might have passed it along as a bit of
folk wisdom: Don't eat your seed corn.
</P>
<P>
   Like grandfather's advice, the founding principle of the council
is: ``Each generation is entitled to interest on the national
capital, but the principal should be handed down unimpaired to
future generations.'' The Chattanooga plan: Improving image and
environment. Cities like Seattle and Chattanooga have already
adopted it as their game plan. The idea, in its widest scope, has
yet to catch on in the Miami Valley, where study after study in the
last decade lists uncoordinated planning as one of the chief
obstacles to progress. But even here there are plenty of
sustainable projects to build on and _ as a central tenet of
sustainability _ everybody can pitch in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become what they call garage-door communities; you hit
the button and shut the world out,'' said Mike Wood of Kettering
Medical Center, who stepped down from a vice president's job to
have more time for his family, church and community. ``People need
to take a personal responsibility to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga is often held up as a model of sustainable
development. Once derided as the most polluted city in America,
Chattanooga found a way to improve its environment and the city's
image.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chattanooga, like Dayton, saw development of its
riverfront as a key element of the city's revitalization. Today all
but two miles of a 22-mile stretch of the Tennessee River has been
developed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The city has spent $150 million and has 20 new projects totaling
$316 million under way, according to the River Valley Partners, a
mix of public and private leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Aquarium has pumped up the tourist industry
downtown and housing values are skyrocketing on the north side of
the river, according to city planner Gordon Mellencamp.
</P>
<P>
   A system of free electric trolleys downtown has eased some of
the city's air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the riverfront development has done a lot to affect
the attitude of people here,'' Mellencamp said. ``It has improved
our self-image and allowed the community to feel it had a real
input into decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Vogler of the River Valley Partners said business
executives looking to relocate are always given a tour of the
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have seen cities all over the country,''
she said. ``They always comment on how impressed they are that the
city has re-invested in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga has had some business successes _ a new AT&AMP;T call
center, a $350 million expansion of the DuPont plant _ but faces
the same intense competition for jobs as other cities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth in population is steady, but not large _ about 1.5
percent a year,'' Vogler said. Seattle's 40-point check list
Seattle, with thousands of people flocking there, has the opposite
problem: coping with tremendous growth. The city has been working
on sustainable development since 1992, and created a 40-point
checklist of what makes up a healthy community. It is that
checklist that is serving as a guidepost for at least 10 other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items on the checklist seem odd. Gardening. Library
usage. Hospital emergency room use. Biodiversity. Wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   But sociolgists are finding that simple activities like
gardening clubs and bowling leagues are the sinew that holds
together a community, giving it muscle and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Other indicators, like hospital emergency room use, may signal a
lack of widespread health care insurance, a situation that may
prove more costly in the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Sustainable Seattle's latest report, delivered on Earth Day last
spring, shows mixed success, underscoring the difficulty of the
task.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and King County's streets and highways are still
chronically clogged with traffic, and trends show people driving
more and using more gasoline. There has been a 9 percent rise in
voter participation _ one of sustainability's goals _ but still
only 22 percent of eligible voters go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report lists as successes a 12 percent drop in
water consumption and the 49 percent of young people who do some
kind of volunteer work in the community.
</P>
<P>
   About 46 percent of the 500 people who responded to a Dayton
Daily News poll said they do some volunteer work, while 53 percent
said they do none.
</P>
<P>
   Studies such as the recent 20/20 Vision report prepared by
Dayton list education, regional decentralization, concentration of
poverty and economic change as problems facing the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that the Miami Valley is one of the 10 most
decentralized metropolitan regions in the country. It also has one
of the highest concentrations of poverty in the central core.
Twenty-five percent of the population of Dayton lives below the
poverty line. The rate is just 6 percent for adjacent suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Dayton is hardly alone, even within its own region. Of the
25 poorest Zip Codes in the Miami Valley, more than half are
outside Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity in the '90s has helped most of us to a more
comfortable lifestyle, but those shut out by age, social
environment, education and, yes, lack of initiative are being left
in Nowheresville as the money train streaks past without slowing
down.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity can create a vacuum that hurts some areas. For
example, 77 percent of Dayton's housing is older than 35 years.
Statistics show that during good times people opt for new and
better housing rather than rehabilitating older housing stock.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that worries about schools, crime and crowded living
conditions and Dayton _ along with similar cities throughout the
country _ is left treading water while the wave of prosperity
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities, like Indianapolis and Cleveland, have made
remarkable comebacks in the 1990s by providing a reason to go
there. Cities like Dayton won't revive without similar efforts.
Getting better, not just bigger. Tom Traynor, an economics
professor at Wright State University, said allowing Dayton _ and
its downtown _ to deteriorate further would make the city a
``wasted resource.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton is unique in some ways,'' said Traynor. ``It is unusual
to see a city develop to this size without a harbor, oil or some
sort of resource. Dayton's resources were its patents and
inventors.''
</P>
<P>
   Communities must look for ways to get better, not just bigger,
says the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado think tank, in its
Guide to Economic Renewal .
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's plans for riverfront development and the proposed minor
league baseball stadium are attempts at a ``big win'' solution to
some of the city's problems. Other solutions, aimed at Sustainable
America's goals of economic growth with a cleaner environment and
more widespread opportunity, may come in smaller doses.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownfields'' redevelopment of old, abandoned factories in
Dayton. The city recently became part of a nationwide project which
includes more than 60 cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton received a $250,000 grant that it's using to help
redevelop the former GHR Foundry, 400 Detrick St., near the Great
Miami River. Revitalizing abandoned industrial sites into new
businesses could help alleviate the city's poverty rate by
providing low-skill manufacturing or service jobs close to
impoverished neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The PRISM project, which brings citizens, environmental
regulators and General Motors engineers together to look for more
ecologically sound manufacturing techniques. Called cradle-to-grave
product responsibility, it is a key element in Sustainable
America's plan for the future. The PRISM project could turn GM and
other area plants into models for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's effort at farmland preservation. Food processing is a
$5.6 billion industry in the state, and the legislature has begun
attempts to preserve the large and diverse farm sector that
supports it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Composite Systems Technology in
Kettering, where research into advanced, lightweight composite
materials may someday help government and industry in the goal of
developing an 80-mile-per-gallon car. The U.S. Department of Energy
is pushing hard for high-mileage, low-polluting vehicles.
Lightweight body construction, which composite technology promises
to deliver, is essential to creating those vehicles. Composites
also have the potential to help with the nation's crumbling
infrastructure, with new ways to repair bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Tool Town, the plan to create a educational research park for
the machine tool industry, incorporates a number of sustainable
ideas. It would revitalize the GHR Foundry, a formerly polluted
downtown industrial site, and address the shortage of skilled
workers in the trade. Dayton is already the fourth-largest
tool-and-die center in the country; Tool Town could make the city a
national destination for workers in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Great Miami River Watershed Council's ongoing plan to
map, monitor and protect the region's water resources. The council
is made up of government and environmental leaders from all over
the Miami Valley who are working together to preserve what may be
the region's most valuable resource.
</P>
<P>
   Urban planners warn that unless steps are taken to shore up the
region's basic strengths _ and eliminate some of the weaknesses _
the recovery could be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing well in the short-term sense,'' said John Weiler,
director for the Center for Business and Economic Research at the
University of Dayton. ``There is a very different look for Dayton
now. In the 1960s the economy was 47 percent manufacturing. Today
it is 20-22 percent. Companies don't seem to want to move here,
stay here or grow here.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday in the '50s and '60s, Dayton was filled with
factories and workers. While that produced one of the most solid
economies in the United States, the central city also inherited the
leftover problems in the form of toxic waste sites like the old
Dayton Tire, Valleycrest and Pinnacle Road landfills.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Council's first report stated: ``Some things
must grow _ jobs, productivity, wages, profits, capital and
savings, information, knowledge, education _ and others _
pollution, waste, poverty, energy and material use per unit of
output _ must not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics think it is an unworkable goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustainable development is just another word for no
development,'' said Sam Staley, an economic analyst for the Buckeye
Institute for Public Policy Research, a national conservative think
tank located in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustainability is being used in the wrong way, it assumes we
know what is sustainable,'' Staley said. ``The market is still the
best determiner of what people want. When you inject the political
process, it gets much messier.'' Reversing a powerful trend. UD's
Weiler observed that sustainable development in the Miami Valley
would be asking the region to ``reverse quite a powerful trend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With urban flight we have a very decentralized economy here,''
Weiler said. ``I have sympathy for Dayton, but the only real hope
for Dayton is growth in the region. For that reason I think it
should become a strong advocate for regional development and hope
its fortunes rise with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Places like Portland and Seattle have resurrected the idea of
urban service boundaries, basically a line drawn around a city to
spur development within and preserve farmland and open space
outside. The rapid rise of new suburbs in the counties surrounding
Dayton, however, threatens to further decentralize the region and
make it that much tougher to pull communities together for
solutions to common problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's opposition to the proposed beltway through western
Montgomery County, Ohio 892, and concern over new water-pumping
plants in the suburbs are examples of two prime weapons _ water and
land use _ being up for grabs in the '90s free-for-all over
development.
</P>
<P>
   So where to go from here?
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley may never be a Silicon Valley or a Golden
Triangle of high-tech manufacturing and education. Perhaps Dayton
will continue its decline without much protest from its suburban
neighbors. But there are some ventures being talked about and put
into action that benefit the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Tool Town and a brand new research park in Beavercreek are
moving ahead. Former military bases in Miamisburg and Kettering are
being transformed into research parks that exploit the region's
aeronautic and nuclear expertise in private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   And the bikeways and green spaces are gradually being linked
together in an effort to build and expand a Miami Valley asset that
will be around long after the '90s fade from memory.
</P>
<P>
   An entire, as yet unimagined, form of economic development could
emerge from these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Ford took the emergence of electric power and made
incredible increases in productivity,'' said Traynor. ``We still
haven't figured out how to use the computer to make other things.
If we do, there could be this explosion of productivity again.''

STATE TO SPEND $700 MILLION TO REFURBISH COURTHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After years of delay, legislative leaders have reached
agreement on a deal to spend almost $700 million renovating
courthouses across the state, restoring some of the oldest and most
dilapidated public buildings in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham and House Speaker Thomas
M. Finneran hammered out a compromise that allows the project to go
forward, three years after it was first proposed. Birmingham and
Finneran agreed that some of the major projects will be performed
by union labor, resolving the main issue that had delayed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The $685.3 million bond issue has been a priority for years
among court workers, lawyers, and judges who have argued that the
poor condition of Massachusetts courthouses impedes the
administration of justice and puts workers and the public at risk
every working day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in courthouses around the state and the notion
that justice can be dispensed in some of these venues is hard to
imagine,'' Birmingham said. ``I thought the courthouse in Chelsea
had to be the worst, then you go to Worcester and they are
conducting criminal trials in what looks like a big walk-in
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the courthouses in Massachusetts are over
50 years old, and 13 are more than a century old. None of them has
ever seen a renovation crew. Horror stories abound among all those
who spend their lives in court.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Leahy, the general counsel of the Massachusetts Bar
Association, said the renovations are badly needed. ``We really are
dealing with horrendous conditions that they must even work in or
come into contact with as users,'' Leahy said. ``The courthouses
are antiquated and this is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point had been the role of organized labor in
the projects. Under the deal hammered out Wednesday, four major
projects _ with a total cash value of $270 million _ will be
subject to ``project labor agreements,'' which mandate that union
workers perform the work. The other projects will not require
union-only labor.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements also spell out work rules, including wages and
hours, and generally prohibit strikes or other job actions.
Essentially, unions agree not to delay projects _ and run up costs
_ in return for guarantees of work.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has languished since former governor William F. Weld
vetoed an earlier version of it last year on the grounds that the
labor agreements discriminated against minority workers, who have
historically made up a tiny percentage of the organized labor force
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Outraged proponents of the bill immediately accused Weld of
blocking the bill because it was too favorable to labor, while
wrapping his opposition in the mantle of equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The measure, which does not require a vote by the full House
or Senate, will likely reach Acting Governor Paul Cellucci this
week. Cellucci will certainly sign it, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Landolfi, the spokesman for the Office of Administration and
Finance, said the plan is to allocate $70 million to $100 million a
year until the project is completed. The schedule for the project
has not yet been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with this,'' Landolfi said. ``This is a
priority,. This is good news for the taxpayers and, of course, for
the courthouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill had already passed both chambers of the Legislature and
was technically referred to a conference committee. But rather than
appoint a committee, Birmingham and Finneran simply cut the deal
themselves, as they have on other major bills.

ALBERT, MSG NETWORK PUT CREDIBILITY ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ In the end, Dave Checketts was like a barker at a
circus.
</P>
<P>
   As president and CEO of Madison Square Garden, he oversees the
operations of four professional sports teams, most notably the New
York Knicks and New York Rangers, as well as Madison Square Garden
Network and Fox Sports New York.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts was presiding over Wednesday's return of Marv Albert,
who was hired by the MSG Network to anchor a nightly sports show
and do radio play-by-play on New York Knicks games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marv Albert is one of Madison Square Garden's stars,''
Checketts gushed. ``He is one of the elite broadcasters in the
history of the sports industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts was not lying. Albert is blessed with a glorious set
of pipes and over the years has received a truckload of awards for
being judged the best play-by-play announcer in New York City and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But since last September, Albert also has truckloads of unseemly
baggage, namely his guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of assault.
Albert did not serve any jail time, but his sentence has been
public humiliation and embarrassment over what his own defense
attorney, Roy Black, described as unconventional sexual practices.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts talked about Albert's ``loyalty'' to MSG and
rhetorically asked how long a person should be punished. With these
emotional and philosophical issues addressed, Checketts also talked
about the real deal _ ``good business'' and ``improved ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   What Checketts really was saying: Good broadcasters are
virtually a dime a dozen, but a man who wears women's underwear and
bites his sexual partners against their will? Now that's something
New Yorkers want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Have it your way. By restoring Albert to his profession,
Checketts has provided yet another example of why Charles Darwin's
theories are so utterly misplaced in today's televised sports
jungle. It's no longer survival of the fittest; it's survial of the
spectacle. In this twisted view, credibility doesn't matter
anymore, just as long the ratings are good and advertisers pay.
</P>
<P>
   But credibility does matter, and Albert has little. He is a liar
and despite Wednesday's apologetic words, he remains laughable,
unable to change the snickers and whispers that follow him
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Albert has no one to blame but himself. Before his trial on
felony charges of forcible sodomy, Albert stood strong and almost
defiant. ``I am confident that I will be completly exonerated when
these allegations are addressed in a public courtroom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert told a different story in court. He pleaded guilty to the
misdemeanor charge of assualt.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging testimony _ which remains undisputed _ came
from P.J. Masten, a Hyatt Hotel executive. She told the Virginia
court in graphic detail how Albert tried to sexually assault her on
two occasions, the second of which occurred in 1994 in a Dallas
hotel room. Masten claimed Albert wore only a garter belt, was
``exposed'' and ``aroused'' and tried to attack her. She escaped,
but only after pulling off his toupee.
</P>
<P>
   Albert says he is a changed man. ``What I did was wrong,'' he
said Wednesday without really explaining what he did. He attributed
his change to therapy. He said he will continue the sessions
because they have helped him to get to know himself and feel
better.
</P>
<P>
   Albert conceded that it will take viewers a while to take him
seriously when he debuts on MSG network's ``SportsDesk'' Sept. 14.
But he remained confident that one day they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control (the viewers),'' he said. ``But they will
understand that what I have to say is credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility is not like a sport in which one day a team wins and
another loses. A person has it or he doesn't. Albert lost his, and
while Checketts and his assorted minions tried to put a happy face
on Albert's return, they clearly were anxious about public
reaction, especially from potential sponsors. Checketts said that
he informed a few sponsors and feels ``good'' about his business
decision. Checketts and Albert repeatedly claimed their excitement
for such a talent to be back on air.
</P>
<P>
   It will be exciting, all right _ just as exciting as watching
any other freak at the local circus.

MATTERS IN JAPAN NOT AS DIRE AS SOME THINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Japan's political shake-up isn't a big deal, but for
Americans to understand why, they must understand a key political
difference between the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In America, presidents, senators and representatives are truly
movers and shakers attended by a retinue of policy experts. This
mass of brainpower employed in the service of Washington's elected
elite provides a counterbalance to entrenched bureaucratic power.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's system, however, lacks similar political equilibrium
because its elected representatives don't have the support system
enjoyed by their U.S. counterparts. If members of Japan's national
legislature, for instance, need guidance on economic reform
alternatives, they are as likely as not to end up seeking out the
bureaucrats who have created the system that needs reforming.
</P>
<P>
   The practical result of this lack of staff resources is a system
controlled by the bureaucracy. While this is true to some extent
for all governments, the power of Japan's bureaucracy is something
most Americans can't fully appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when Japan's prime minister resigned after his
party's disappointing election showing, the future of economic
reform wasn't affected as much as most Americans probably inferred.
Reform will happen in Japan when the bureaucrats running the
country allow it to happen, and not a moment before.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto wasn't
all that effective. While he talked a good game and looked good
playing his part on the international stage, nothing much good and
a lot bad happened on his watch. His recent waffling on the
structure of economic revitalization policies was typical of his
indecisive style of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The election losses that led to his departure mostly reflected a
dissatisfaction by the Japanese people with economic conditions.
That's not the same thing, however, as voting for radical change.
The Japanese aren't into radical change any more than most members
of other settled, stable societies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's not as though the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party has lost its power completely. What it lost was a great deal
of face, which is no small thing in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. stock market seemed to take only momentary notice of
what had happened in Japan, going from mixed on Monday to a strong
rally Tuesday. The smart money apparently understands Japan better
than the pundits, and Wall Street's message was that profits at
home count for a lot more than political machinations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, though, on the bond-trading side, the Treasuries
market swooned Monday on speculation that the situation will get
better in Japan sooner than conventional wisdom anticipates. This
was a momentary triumph of wishful thinking, perhaps, and probably
won't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Meaningful change in Japan depends on the bureaucracy,
particularly the Ministry of Finance. There have been no
indications so far that the bureaucracy is keen to embrace the sort
of changes needed.
</P>
<P>
   What will change things eventually, however, will be the
financial market deregulation that recently got under way in Japan.
Events will overtake bureaucratic inertia and the second-largest
economy on the planet will increasingly operate in response to
market forces.
</P>
<P>
   All of which will take time, lots of time.

TOWN REALLY PUTS ON THE DOG FOR MICKEY MOUSE, WALT DISNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC WESLANDER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARCELINE, Mo. _ An inflatable pair of mouse ears the size of a
Volkswagen teetered over the gazebo in Marceline's downtown park on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mouse flags flew everywhere, from Briggs-Cupp Chevrolet
to the Busy Bee Florist. The famous mouse ears perched on signs
along Kansas Street, renamed Main Street U.S.A. for the day. And
Mickey, Minnie and the whole gang paraded through creator Walt
Disney's boyhood hometown, greeted by a crowd of more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event was to promote Tuesday's release of Walt Disney Home
Video's ``The Spirit of Mickey,'' a compilation of early Mickey
Mouse adventures from the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   But it also gave Disney an opportunity to reconnect itself to
the wholesomeness of small-town America.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kough, manager of special events for Walt Disney Home Video,
acknowledged he crafted the event with an emphasis on small-town
America values in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That includes values like family, togetherness, happiness, joy
and children,'' he said. ``Walt Disney wants to continue to provide
quality entertainment for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while maintaining its role as a leader in family
entertainment, the Disney empire has found itself embroiled in the
social, political and economic controversies of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Popular animated films have on occasion generated controversy in
recent years. Arab groups, for example, vigorously protested
characters in ``Aladdin'' and persuaded Disney to change one song's
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Disney spins off subsidiaries and joins other
media empires, its name has become attached to a more diverse range
of projects _ some of which have upset defenders of family values.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax, one of Disney's spinoffs, produced movies such as
``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Kids,'' a raw look at teen-age sex. ABC-TV,
a new addition to Disney's fold, broadcast ``Ellen,'' which
featured a lesbian lead character.
</P>
<P>
   That type of programming, and Disney's offer of benefits to gay
and lesbian partners of employees, prompted boycotts from groups
such as the Southern Baptist Convention and the Assemblies of God.
Just this month, the Texas School Board voted to sell its Disney
stock.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, that meant some people saw Disney as
anti-family.
</P>
<P>
   In Stockton, Mo., about 100 miles southeast of Kansas City, the
high school canceled a band trip to Walt Disney World because of
what one school board member called Disney's ``pro-gay'' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   One national researcher said the Marceline event was no doubt
carefully planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't done accidentally, that's for sure,'' said Stephen
Hess, a senior fellow at Brookings Institute, a Washington think
tank. ``You could be sure that somewhere in Southern California
there were a group of people sitting around discussing (the
company's image). That's what they're paid to do. They're in the
image business.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Marceline reveled in its Disney roots.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed cheerleaders from Marceline High danced in sync with
Chip, Dale, Goofy and the rest of the characters. Football players
wearing their Marceline jerseys helped control the crowd. Mayor Joe
Fotenos and the high school pep band greeted Mickey at the local
airport. In the park, the local band the Martin Family played ``God
Bless the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The town will be the site of more Disney festivities soon. In
September, Gov. Mel Carnahan is expected to announce plans for big
festivities in 2001 to honor the 100th anniversary of Walt Disney's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   If the company is looking to improve its image as a family
corporation, Marceline is the place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better spot,'' said Kaye Malins, who lives
on the edge of town. ``In Marceline, the gift that we give all our
children is a sense of place. They know they are responsible for
their town. There's no graffiti; there's no trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Business owners in the town of 2,700 spent the last few weeks
painting their storefronts and changing addresses on their windows
to read ``Main Street U.S.A.,'' after the main drag in Walt
Disney's Magic Kingdom theme parks. Marceline resident Shane Ware
said he counted eight ladders downtown Sunday on his way to church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest crowd we've had that I've ever seen,'' he
said as he sat on a bench outside Hazen's drugstore, wearing a
Mickey Mouse T-shirt and looking a bit overwhelmed. ``This has
always just been my hometown. I've never thought of it to be this
big of a deal until today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just your basic small town. Everybody's friendly to
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   If Walt Disney's beloved Marceline is Main Street U.S.A., then
perhaps the fast-paced world of billion-dollar conglomerates, where
Snow White and Quentin Tarantino's foul-mouthed ``Pulp Fiction''
characters can live under the same roof, can be seen as
Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt designed his parks so that everyone who went in would go
down Main Street U.S.A. and experience Marceline,'' Malins said.
``After that, you could decide whether you wanted to go to
Tomorrowland or Fantasyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone in Marceline who wanted a copy of ``The Spirit of
Mickey'' video had to leave Main Street U.S.A. and go to the
nearest Wal-Mart, a dozen miles away in Brookfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Residents can, however, watch the film at the Uptown Theater,
where it will be shown for one week.

SENATE REPUBLICANS INTRODUCE THEIR OWN BILL TO PROTECT PATIENTS'
RIGHTSs

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans proposed legislation to protect
patients' rights on Wednesday, joining the battle with Democrats
and the American Medical Association who have sought much more
sweeping protections, including the right to sue managed care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan, to be followed Thursday by a bill from House
GOP leaders, seeks to give patients a greater choice of doctors and
provide tax breaks to make insurance more affordable. But the
Democratic plan would cover 150 million people; most of the GOP's
patients' protection provisions would affect only one third as
many.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said he plans
to bring the measure, which is still being written and finalized,
to the floor before Congress leaves for vacation the first week of
August. But prospects for either the Democratic or Republican plans
remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not really interested in political games, we are
interested in serious quality health care,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,
the second-ranking Republican and chief architect of the bill.
``Some of the other proposals, particularly the Democratic
alternative, is well-intended, but the net result would be that it
would greatly increase costs, reduce access, and frankly, it would
increase the bureaucracy and the regulations by unbelievable leaps
and bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats reacted swiftly and forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of health and human services, Donna Shalala,
called the Republican plan ``too little, too late,'' but added that
she hoped the two sides could compromise on a bipartisan bill. And
Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who helped draft the
Democratic bill, called it ``Gingrich lite,'' deriding it as even
weaker than the version House Speaker Newt Gingrich described last
month.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, at a round table discussion on Wednesday at
the offices of the American Medical Association here, listened to
the heart-wrenching stories of patients and doctors who described
their personal run-ins with health maintenance organizations and
pressed Congress to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is about even more than health care; this is
about how people feel about America,'' Clinton said. ``These
stories are not the kind of stories any American of conscience
would ever want to be told in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many similarities between the Democratic and
Senate Republican proposals, there are also stark differences.
Generally, the consumer protections in the Republican proposals
would apply only to federally regulated health plans in which
employers directly assume the financial risks for workers' medical
care, so-called self-insured plans. About 48 million Americans are
covered by such plans, most of them working for large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 million consumers belong to health plans that would
continue to be regulated by state laws, which vary widely in the
protections they offer patients. The Democratic proposal would
extend patient protections to all 148 million.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance and HMO groups did not waver in their opposition to
all the managed care bills, including Wednesday's proposal by
Senate Republicans. But they said they liked the ``new approach''
of limiting most of the protections to patients covered by
companies that insure themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of compliance and and costs alone, it's
attractive,'' said Bill Gradison, the president of the Health
Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican announcement comes just as Democrats are
ratcheting up the pressure to overhaul managed care plans in
Congress and on the campaign trail. In a rather lackluster election
year, managed care has emerged as one of the more tantalizing
issues before the November elections, and Democrats have seized it
to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying by special-interest groups, including the American
Medical Association and insurance organizations, has been intense
since early this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO announced it would launch a nationwide
radio and television advertising campaign backing the Democratic
bill. ``Insurance companies and HMOs are turning health care into
big business,'' one of the labor federation's flyers claimed.
``They get the profits _ and too often we get stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   For months Senate and House Republicans tried to sidestep the
issue of regulating managed care, which is unpopular with business
and insurance groups. But they found the issue was too popular and
politically perilous to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans organized a task force early this year to
begin studying the issue, but maintained there would likely be no
bill this year. That changed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to steal the Democrats' thunder, the Senate Republicans
virtually adopted the Democratic bill's title for their own. The
GOP measure is called ``The Patient Bill of Rights.'' The
Democratic bill is called ``The Patients' Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Democratic bill, sponsored by Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan,
would drive up costs and the number of uninsured, as well as lead
to unnecessary regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican proposal, which was released as an
outline, shares some common ground with the Democratic bill. Both
bills require that patients be allowed to see a doctor outside an
HMO without paying the entire cost and see that health plans pay
for urgent emergency room care.
</P>
<P>
   They also stipulate that pregnant women and terminally ill
patients can continue seeing their doctor, at least temporarily,
even if that doctor leaves the health plan, and they would permit
unfettered communication about care between patients and
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike the Democratic bill, those protections would apply
only to employees in self-insured plans. Republicans argue that
state laws already protect the other 100 million consumers, but
Democrats maintain that state laws are not uniform on protections
and patchy at best. And the Republican plan only permits direct
access to only permits direct access to three types of specialists:
obstetricians. gynecologists and pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than open the process up to lawsuits, the Senate
Republican plan would allow all privately insured consumers to
challenge the denial of medical services by filing appeals, first
internally, and then with an independent reviewer selected by the
managed care company. The decision by an outside reviewer would be
binding and would apply only to procedures that cost more than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot sue your way to better health care
quality,'' said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a member of the GOP
task force.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to conservatives, the Senate plan also includes several
new tax breaks. It would greatly expand medical savings accounts,
special tax-free accounts for medical care that are now available
on a limited basis. Democrats steadfastly oppose the savings
accounts, saying they will lead to inferior health care and are
designed for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal also allows self-employed people to
deduct the full cost of their health insurance starting next year.
Sen. William Roth of Delaware, the chairman of the Finance
Committee, said the taxbreaks would be paid for in a
``noncontroversial manner.''

HE'S BACK: MADISON SQUARE GARDEN REHIRES MARV ALBERT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marv Albert's career, which virtually ended after a
sensational sexual assault trial last year, was revived Wednesday
when Madison Square Garden rehired him to call New York Knicks
games on radio and host the nightly ``MSG Sportsdesk'' television
program.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 months ago, Albert resigned from the Garden _ where he
had called Knicks games on television on the MSG Network _ after
pleading guilty to a misdemeanor for biting a former lover, Vanessa
Perhach. NBC Sports fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, president of the Garden, said Albert was
``immensely loyal to this place'' even after he attained a national
following on NBC. ``It's because of that we are standing here and
returning the favor. Loyalty means a lot here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the notoriety surrounding his case would help the
ratings for ``Sportsdesk'', Albert deferred the question to
Checketts, who said, ``I won't deny we made a business decision
about helping ratings.'' The program is being overhauled with a new
set to coincide with Albert's first telecast on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts discussed Albert's fitness to be rehired with
executives of Cablevision Systems _ the Garden's parent company _
and Albert's psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a therapist talk to me and my therapist,'' Albert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Checketts: ``We were satisfied that this was the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a judge in Arlington, Va., deferred sentencing Albert
to as much as a year in jail and a $2,500 fine and instead ordered
him to obey the law and attend weekly counseling sessions. Barring
problems in abiding by the conditions, the judge said that Albert's
record could be wiped clean by Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Albert said he was uncertain if he has to appear in court again.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ms. Perhach, with whom the sportscaster had a
10-year affair, as well as the Virginia Commonwealth Attorney's
office, had no comment on the Garden's rehiring of Albert,
according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Albert, 57, would not specifically discuss the legal imbroglio
that made him into tabloid fodder, except to say, ``I went through
a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Redmond, the president of the National Coalition
Against Violent Athletes, said she believed Albert has not shown
enough contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't proven he can be a productive member of society and
not harm others,'' she said. ``He pleaded guilty, but he should
make a definite apology to his victim and volunteer for an
organization that helps abused women.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albert appeared serious and humbled in his first formal news
conference since the one in May 1997 that he used to denounce the
indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did was wrong,'' Albert said Wednesday at the Garden.
``What I did hurt a lot of people, including my fiancee, my
friends, my employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert now faces the task of re-establishing his credibility
with viewers and listeners who heard tawdry stories about sodomy
and his wearing of lingerie. ``I think I'll be taken seriously in
time,'' he said. ``It's something I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time in his and his agent's talks with Garden officials
did he seek a better offer than the multiyear contract for 40 to 50
Knicks games on WFAN and the host's job on ``Sportsdesk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it was the perfect package,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed, but he will make far less
than he did before his trial. Prior to last September, his total
pay from NBC and MSG exceeded $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to MSG _ and getting an additional job recently,
helping to narrate the Chicago Bulls' championship video for NBA
Entertainment _ is not a precursor to another broadcast network
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC's position has not changed,'' said Ed Markey, an NBC
Sports spokesman. ``As of right now, there is no movement to bring
him back at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Albert, returning to call Knicks games on radio is a step
into the past. Albert was the Knicks' radio voice from 1966 to 1985
before shifting to television full-time. Hosting ``Sportsdesk''
harkens back to his being a sports anchor on WNBC-TV in New York
from 1975 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Albert said he does not regard his MSG redux as a step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's like a step up from what I've been going through,''
he said. ``I want to work. It was a void not being involved on an
everyday basis.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 16:
</P>
<P>
   Louis Freeh is a lawyer and former federal judge who has spent
his life interpreting and enforcing the law. As director of the
FBI, he leads the agents investigating White House fund-raising
during 1996 and the possibility that the Chinese government
funneled money to the Democrats in an effort to influence the
election and American policy. Now we have learned in an important
public forum, the Senate Judiciary Committee, that Freeh told Reno
last December that she was flatly misreading the Independent
Counsel Act when she refused to acknowledge her conflict of
interest and appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the
fund-raising of her boss, President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hurray for Louis Freeh! Wednesday Sen. Fred Thompson read into
the record a memo in which Freeh told Reno ``it is difficult to
imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an independent
counsel.'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, who normally treats Reno with
deference, took the trouble of explaining to her the obvious
meaning of the discretionary clause that requires an attorney
general to remove herself from a case when her superiors may be
involved in her department's investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Reno got a little more rattled than usual. She was grumpy that
the American people got to learn what their FBI director thinks.
But she was, she made it clear, unswayed by everyone's silly
insistence that this section of the federal code means what it says
and that she ought to obey it.
</P>
<P>
   Look, this is getting exasperating. Reno keeps celebrating her
stubbornness as if it were some sort of national asset or a
constitutional principle that had legal standing. It is neither. It
is a quirk of mind or personality that has blinded her to the clear
meaning of the statute requiring attorneys general to recuse
themselves when they are sunk to the axle in conflict of interest.
It is a quirk that is preventing Congress and the American people
from getting the benefit of landmark legislation aimed at political
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, that benefit is being denied at the moment when we
need to know the truth about a threat to American political
principles _ the possibility that an autocratic superpower with an
interest in buying access to the White House tried to sway the
choosing of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the alleged beneficiary of Chinese money, has an
obligation here that transcends whatever trouble an investigation
would cause him and the core of advisers who planned and monitored
Democratic fund-raising. Some years ago, when Reno was locked in
the ceremony of her own recalcitrance, Clinton ordered her to
appoint an independent counsel on Whitewater for reasons of
conflict of interest. This is a more momentous matter, and Clinton
is a lawyer too. It's time for him to emulate Freeh's service by
explaining to Reno the law's requirements _ and the right of the
American people to have the benefit of a statute clearly written
and duly passed by their representatives. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Nobody recognizes me with my clothes on'' is a
statement few people get to make with plausibility and a straight
face.
</P>
<P>
   But the marathon swimmer Shelley Taylor-Smith says it
matter-of-factly when asked whether she is recognized on the street
when she returns to her hometown, Sydney, Australia, usually after
winning a race or breaking a world record in a far-flung waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I walked around with my bathers on and goggles, greased up,
they would all go, `That's Shelley Taylor-Smith,''' she said.
``With jeans on, I'm just any ordinary girl.''
</P>
<P>
   A modest way of putting it, but it's a safe bet that no one who
has ever met Ms. Taylor-Smith walked away with the impression that
she was ordinary. Last Saturday, at 36, she won the 28.5-mile
Manhattan Island Marathon for the fifth time, seizing the lead from
two men in their 20s who were half a mile ahead. (She called it
``catching up the boys.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she set the record for both men and women for the
circuit around Manhattan, completing it in 5 hours 45 minutes 25
seconds and breaking the women's record she had set a decade
earlier. Five months before that, she had set another record (she
has set 15 of of them) for a grueling 53-mile swim from Sydney to
Wollongong, a steel town to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor-Smith broke those records the same year she was told
that she had chronic fatigue syndrome, which she believes she
developed after contracting dysentery while competing in a polluted
river in Argentina. Instead of letting herself recover, she plunged
back into a 16-mile daily training regimen, kept racing and
eventually ended up hospitalized with fatigue, jaundice and a
series of infections, unable even to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time, in a life built around overcoming
physical challenges, that Ms. Taylor-Smith had been forced to
listen to her body.
</P>
<P>
   And last February in Perth, the western Australian town where
she grew up, she hit a crisis point. She had begun training again
for a final Manhattan marathon but was exhausted. One day in her
car, she said, she slumped her head against the steering wheel and
struck a bargain with her soul: ``I said, `I'll listen to you; just
get me around Manhattan one more time.'''
</P>
<P>
   In what her friends call ``true Shell'' fashion, it was not a
deal she intended to keep; she scheduled other races through the
end of the year. But on Saturday, when she passed the Chelsea piers
in the lead, she said it all seemed too perfect. She would hang up
her goggles for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I'm coming down Manhattan, and I'm winning,''
she said over breakfast on Tuesday in her flat, friendly Australian
twang. ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would end my
career on such a fairy tale note.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits that accepting retirement will be something like
going through the stages of mourning. Her career, which has made
her one of Australia's most popular sports heroes (a ferry line was
just renamed in her honor) has always been about pushing ahead
precisely because someone told her to stop.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Ms. Taylor-Smith had scoliosis, a spinal curvature
that required her to wear a back brace. In the water, one of the
few places she could be without the brace, she exhibited ``all the
grace of a wounded buffalo'' while her younger sister excelled, she
wrote in her autobiography, ``Dangerous When Wet'' (Allen &AMP; Unwin,
1996). But she kept at it when her sister lost interest, and she
was soon winning races.
</P>
<P>
   She received an athletic scholarship from the University of
Arkansas in Fayetteville, where she sold peanuts at college
football games and worked as a head waitress in a faculty dining
room to make ends meet. (She waited several times on Bill Clinton,
who was then the Governor of Arkansas.) When her back began
bothering her again, she ignored it and awoke one day from a nap
partly paralyzed, with a collapsed vertebra pinching a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pivotal point in her life. Before she healed, she lost
her scholarship. So when a former coach suggested that her stubborn
determination would make her a perfect marathon swimmer, she tried
it, and by the next year she had set her first record around
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming for a living has never been glamorous or comfortable.
She blames her career for the breakup of her marriage to another
swimmer, Peter Smith. Advertising contracts and endorsements are
scarce in marathon swimming, which has never received the attention
of its counterpart on the land. So she has had to struggle to raise
enough money to live and travel to races.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike swimmers who compete in pools, Ms. Taylor-Smith has
also constantly worried about disease and injury in clogged,
polluted waterways. Over the years, she has been cut, bruised and
badly infected with dysentery.
</P>
<P>
   Though she says the waters around Manhattan are now among the
cleanest of those she competes in, for many years she assigned a
crew member on her follow boat to look out with binoculars for
hypodermic needles, condoms and other flotsam.
</P>
<P>
   There are few water horror stories she likes to recount, but she
will tell one: When she broke the Manhattan record in 1985, she
went back to someone's house to shower after the race. ``And I had
a noodle in my belly button, like from soup,'' she said. ``It was
disgusting. I was, like, how did that get there?''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Gordon holds slight lead, but points race promises to be tight
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of NASCAR fans who would like to see someone,
anyone, besides Jeff Gordon win the Winston Cup championship this
year, we will give you the good news first.
</P>
<P>
   Four other drivers have a legitimate shot at winning the title
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the bad news. With the 1998 season just past the halfway
point, Gordon is on top of the points standings again and remains
the man to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid in the 24 car,'' as Dale Earnhardt calls him. ``He's
the mark to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   With 17 of 33 races completed, NASCAR has experienced a little
bit of everything this season. Things started on a high note with
Earnhardt finally getting that elusive first Daytona 500 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the same track was the site of the low point of the season
five months later when wildfires in Florida forced NASCAR officials
to postpone the Pepsi 400, an event that was going to be the first
race shown in prime time by a major network (CBS).
</P>
<P>
   In between those two occurrences, there have been a lot of
surprises along the way. Jeremy Mayfield has moved up to contender
status on the Cup circuit; the track at Texas Motor Speedway has
been rebuilt; and a rising star with a familiar name has emerged in
the Busch Grand National Series _ Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in a year or two, the younger version of The Intimidator
will be a challenger to Gordon, because the days of Junior's dad
being able to compete for a title may be over. In the last 76 Cup
races over three seasons, Earnhardt Sr. has one victory. Gordon has
24.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon hopes to add to that total in the second half of the
season. This weekend is the final break before the drivers race for
16 consecutive weeks to decide the 1998 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a deep breath and try to regroup for the rest of the
year,'' Gordon said. ``When you have a good first half, it kind of
motivates you for the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   With four victories, five poles and 11 top-10 finishes this
year, it doesn't look like Gordon needs much additional motivation.
But he will need to keep up the pace in the DuPont Monte Carlo if
he hopes to win his third championship in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was the closest three-way finish in history when
Gordon edged Dale Jarrett by 14 points (4,710 to 4,696) and Mark
Martin by 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   All three drivers went to the final race at Atlanta with a
chance to win the title, and this season could have a similar
finish. Three drivers are within 137 points (less than a one-race
difference) of Gordon. Martin is 52 points back (2,527 to 2,475),
and Jarrett is 46 points behind Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield trails by 137 points in the fourth spot, and teammate
Rusty Wallace remains within striking distance at 220 points behind
Gordon in the No. 5 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the championship is as wide-open as it has even
been,'' Martin said. ``But you can't get too hungry and look too
far ahead. We've got a lot of races to go.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has come closer to the title without winning it than
Martin. The 39-year-old Arkansas native has finished in the top six
in each of the past nine seasons, including second place twice and
third place three times. In 1990, he fell just 26 points short of
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just about taste it,'' said Martin, who drives the
Valvoline Taurus. ``We've been so close that I know what it feels
like to have a shot at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my heart broken in this sport a lot more times than
I've experienced overwhelming joy. But we know we have awesome
equipment, and we just have to keep coming up with strong finishes.
Then, we will see where we are at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who drives the Quality Care Taurus, has been in the
battle at the end the past two years, finishing third behind Terry
Labonte and Gordon in 1996. At age 41, Jarrett knows what it takes
to stay in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have some really good teams with drivers that are hungry
for a championship,'' Jarrett said. ``I think the next five or six
races will show who is going to be there down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team in the top five has had slumps this year, and the
teams that can show the most consistency over the rest of the
summer are the ones that will have a shot at it. You can't afford
many bad weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield hasn't had many bad weeks this season, but he had one
last weekend at New Hampshire when he finished 30th after an
accident. It was the first time this season Mayfield had failed to
finish in the top 25. The 29-year-old Kentucky product has 10
finishes in the top 10, including eight in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who drives the Mobil 1 Taurus, earned his first Cup
victory in the Pocono 500 on June 21. Even before he won, he was in
the points lead for several weeks, and he clearly has benefited
from the alignment with Wallace in forming the Penske/Kranefuss
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there would be some ups and downs in a long season,''
Mayfield said. ``But with all these races in a row, you can't get
too high or too low. You just have to move on and try to stay
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys have told me that once you get the taste of that
first win, you'll never be satisfied with second again. Well, I
never was satisfied with second before we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon feels the same way, but at age 26 he has won more races
in less time than any driver on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, every race I don't win is a disappointment,'' Gordon
said. ``There are many more disappointments than victories in this
sport. But you know you are working for something special _ the
championship. It's not a great race car or great driver or great
crew chief. It's everyone on the team coming together for a common
goal.''

FERRARO'S FUNDRAISING LAGS IN BID TO TAKE ON D'AMATO
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geraldine Ferraro, who has repeatedly portrayed
herself as the dominant Democrat in the race for Senate in New
York, is struggling to raise money, trailing far behind both Sen.
Alfonse M. D'Amato and one of her Democratic rivals, Rep. Charles
Schumer, according to reports made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly two months to go until the primary, Ferraro, who
said when she entered the race that she would need $5 million for
the primary, has collected just over $2 million, with $701,000 of
that coming in over the last quarter. By contrast, D'Amato, the
Republican incumbent, has raised about $20 million, and Schumer,
$11 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the most direct measure of her financial position as she
enters the most competitive period of the primary campaign, Ferraro
has, after expenditures, just $1.1 million in the bank. Schumer has
$7.2 million on hand, while D'Amato has $12.1 million. Mark Green,
the third Democratic candidate, has the same amount of money on
hand now as Ms. Ferraro: $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, in a statement on Wednesday night, sought to put the
best light on her fund-raising efforts, saying the combined
contributions to all the Democrats this last quarter _ including
Schumer and Green, the New York City public advocate _ were
equivalent to what D'Amato had raised, ``which means that Democrats
are just as competitive as Republicans this election cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed to polls that show her far ahead of Schumer and
Green, and said voters were not concerned with a candidate's
fund-raising efforts. ``Frankly,'' she said, ``what I'm finding is
that they're concerned about how much is in their bank account, not
how much is in my bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ferraro's financial report came at what clearly is
a difficult time in her campaign. Her campaign manager, David
Eichenbaum, quit last week, and many of her supporters have
expressed concern that her candidacy seems adrift. And the report
came after a period in which her advisers said she had kept a
relatively low public profile because she was spending her time
fund raising, both in New York and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the financial reports was on a day in which
Ferraro, a former congresswoman and vice-presidential candidate,
had an unusually packed campaign schedule, which, intended or not,
distracted attention from campaign finances. She spent the morning
campaigning in the Bronx, where she was repeatedly recognized and
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   She attacked D'Amato's record on the elderly at a forum at the
Jewish Home for the Aged, at one point asserting, to some murmurs
of concern, that the senator supported placing part of the Social
Security system under private control.

   ``There are lots of problems with privatization,'' Ferraro said.
``The president doesn't support it. I don't support it. By the way,
Al D'Amato does. But let me say to you that _ or at least he did.
He may have changed his viewpoint rather recently, because he tends
to do that when he's running for re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   A D'Amato spokesman, Harvey Valentine, said the senator had
never supported such a step. An aide to Ferraro later said she had
misspoken and was referring to his efforts to change the Medicare
system.

   In the other major race to be decided this year, it appeared
increasingly likely there will be a four-way Democratic primary for
governor on Sept. 15. Lt Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and James
Larocca said Wednesday night that they had gathered enough
signatures to earn them a spot on the Democratic primary ballot
with Peter Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, and Charles
Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, who state Democratic leaders
had put on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to McCaughey Ross said she had in excess of 50,000
signatures, or more than three times the requirement of 15,000.
Larocca is said to have considerably less than that, though he
declined to release an exact number.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that may not matter; all four candidates said they were
not planning to raise legal challenges to knock a rival off the
ballot, though others could with the private encouragement of a
candidate. The deadline for filing petitions is today.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross also released a 30-second television
advertisement Wednesday, signaling the start of a long-awaited
television campaign from the former Republican who is seeking to
challenge her boss for his job. The ad is directed at women voters,
stressing McCaughey Ross' record on abortion rights and day care,
reflecting the calculation of her advisers that her biggest
strength in the contest is being the only woman in a field of men.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance statements showed two Democrats _ Eliot
Spitzer, who is running for attorney general, and McCaughey Ross _
are to a large extent using their own money for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has now raised $3.6 million, including $3.2 million in
personal funds. McCaughey Ross has raised a total of $3.6 million,
including $1.2 million in the first six months of this year. Almost
$3 million of that money came from her husband, the investment
banker Wilbur L. Ross Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, George Pataki, reported that he had
collected $15.5 million. Vallone has raised $3.6 million, while
Hynes has raised $450,000. Larocca did not release his fund-raising
figures.

   NEW YORK - Law-enforcement officials scoured the three New York
metropolitan airports and parts of northern New Jersey Wednesday in
their search for Irene Silverman, the 82-year-old widow who
vanished 11 days ago, but Police Commissioner Howard Safir said
investigators had found no hints of her whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said investigators searched parts of Newark International, Kennedy
International and La Guardia Airports. Safir, who would not confirm
the airport searches, said police had searched six acres of
undeveloped land in Mount Olive, N.J., owned by Silverman, but
found no new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of leads and lot of holes,'' Safir said. ``This
is a big puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir also said that traces of blood found on the sidewalk
outside Silverman's Upper East Side town house could not be used as
evidence, because they had been too damaged by sunlight to be
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   One of Silverman's former tenants, Kenneth Kimes, 23, and his
mother, Sante Kimes, 63, are the leading suspects in her
disappearance, according to the police. Law-enforcement officials
have said the Kimeses, who were arrested on an unrelated federal
warrant accusing them of writing a bad check in Utah, may have been
trying to defraud Silverman out of her East 65th Street town house.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator who spoke on the condition of anonymity
Wednesday said that the police discovered blank deed forms and two
bank checks among Kenneth Kimes' belongings. The checks, one for
$1,500 and another for $5,600, were payable to the New York City
Department of Finance. The checks were dated July 2, three days
before Silverman's disappearance, and had not been used, the
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   James Moses, a spokesman for the city Department of Finance, had
no comment on the checks. The department includes the city
register's office, which handles property titles, as well as
numerous other divisions. The Kimeses' lawyers, Jose Muniz and
Matthew Weissman, did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a search warrant prepared by the Manhattan district
attorney's office, investigators discovered a good deal of
potential evidence in the Kimeses' car last week. Investigators
said they are awaiting the results of DNA tests on a saliva-stained
pillow and a hair found in a large black duffel bag discovered in
the car's back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to start up a laptop computer that was found in the car,
as well as inspect and check for fingerprints on hundreds of pages
of documents found in the car, also continued Wednesday.

DEAD MAN FEARED CRIME-SPREE SUSPECT, HIS LAWYERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MISSING-MILLIONAIRE) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly after a Los Angeles businessman began to
suspect that Sante Kimes had taken out a fraudulent $280,000 loan
in his name, he received an ominous visit from a mysterious woman
and several phone messages from Ms. Kimes before he was murdered
last March, the man's lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   These contacts mark the first direct links that have been
disclosed between Ms. Kimes, the suspected mastermind of a wild
spree of swindles and murders, and the businessman, David Kazdin,
in the weeks before his death. One of the lawyers, Phillip Eaton,
said Kazdin had long feared that Ms. Kimes was ``crazy'' and would
``do anything,'' and investigators think that she and her
23-year-old son were attempting a similar swindle against Irene
Silverman, an elderly New York socialite who disappeared on July 5
and is presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Kazdin's case, the new information suggests that Ms. Kimes
was trying to persuade him to lie to cover her involvement in the
suspicious loan, which was being investigated by a bank in Florida
_ and that Kazdin wanted no part of what seemed to be an elaborate
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton and another lawyer, Martin Handweiler, said Kazdin
immediately suspected Ms. Kimes as soon as he became aware of the
loan. After Kazdin told the bank that he had not applied for the
loan, a woman who appeared to be working with Ms. Kimes knocked on
the door of his house in Granada Hills, Calif., the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Handweiler said Kazdin later told him that in this brief visit
in February, the woman simply said that ``you know you're
responsible for that loan'' and walked away without identifying
herself. After that, Kazdin received several messages from Ms.
Kimes on his telephone answering machine, though the lawyers would
not detail what she said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, Kazdin was shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Kazdin, who owned a document-copying business, had known Ms.
Kimes and her husband, Kenneth Kimes Sr., a wealthy motel owner who
died in 1994, for more than 20 years. The lawyers said Kazdin had
become caught up in Ms. Kimes' dealings only because he had once
done a favor for her husband and allowed him to list Kazdin as the
owner of one of several of the Kimeses' houses _ this one in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said they did not know why Kazdin had done this
favor. But Eaton said Kazdin came to regret it when the elder Kimes
told him _ probably in 1993 or 1994 _ that tenants had damaged the
house and that the Kimeses needed Kazdin to cooperate in filing an
insurance claim. Kazdin refused to make the claim, and he later
told Eaton that Kimes promised to take his name off the title.
</P>
<P>
   But Kimes died shortly after that, and unbeknown to Kazdin, his
name remained on the title until early this year. Detectives in Las
Vegas and Los Angeles now believe that Sante Kimes forged Kazdin's
name on the loan documents in late 1997 and got them notarized
improperly.
</P>
<P>
   After she collected the $280,000 in loan proceeds, she switched
the title of the five-bedroom house in January into the name of a
homeless man. Investigators say she also took out a home insurance
policy in that man's name _two weeks before the house burned in
what fire inspectors say was a clear case of arson.
</P>
<P>
   These transactions are at the heart of theft, arson and murder
investigations of Ms. Kimes and her son, Kenneth, that stretch from
Los Angeles to the Bahamas, where a banker disappeared in 1996
shortly after meeting with Ms. Kimes. Investigators suspect that
Ms. Kimes planned the swindles and pulled her son along with her.

COUNCIL HEARS TESTIMONY BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Laying the groundwork for a lawsuit against Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, the City Council heard testimony Wednesday from
budget experts who said the city had far more money than the mayor
anticipated in his budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came a month after Giuliani vetoed $200 million
from the council's budget plan, saying it included reckless
spending that would create deficits. When the council swiftly
overrode the vetoes, Giuliani threatened to use his considerable
powers to hold down spending. He started two weeks ago when he
asked every city agency to look for ways they could cut their
budgets by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Council members have said that the mayor's actions were a
political vendetta against them, and that city agencies should not
suffer when the economy is flourishing. The hearing Wednesday, held
by the council's Finance Committee, was part of a strategy to force
Giuliani to start spending the extra money the council has allotted
for various programs and for paying off debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city shouldn't squander this opportunity to dramatically
improve its fiscal standing,'' said Thomas McMahon, director of the
council's finance division. ``You can't escape the fact that the
city is way underestimating its revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Newman, a deputy city comptroller, told the Finance
Committee that his office was expecting the city to reap at least
$800 million in extra revenues this year. Kathleen Grimm, a deputy
state comptroller, said her office was anticipating well over $600
million, while Douglas Criscitello of the city's Independent Budget
Office predicted an extra $685 million.
</P>
<P>
   The council also released figures showing that Wall Street had
reaped nearly $7 billion in profits during the first half of this
year, $1 billion less than Giuliani had projected for the entire
year. The taxes on those profits are one of the city's most
substantial sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the budget experts who testified warned against
spending the extra money, saying it should be saved to plug holes
in future budgets. They also warned that the economy could take an
abrupt turn for the worse, saying extra money should be used only
for capital projects, paying off debt and building up savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is not yet in hand,'' said Raymond Horton, president
of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors
the city and state budgets. ``It is important to remember that
economic fortunes sometimes change in unanticipated ways, and
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said the
administration purposefully underestimates revenues every year in
hopes of creating a surplus. He said the city should save any extra
money to address projected deficits in the coming years. Lhota also
said the council had no grounds for a lawsuit, because city law
gives the mayor the power to ``determine how things are spent and
when they are spent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this bravado is a continuing effort to get Peter
Vallone's name in the newspaper,'' he said, referring to the
council speaker, a Democrat who is running for governor. ``This is
the beginning of the summer of silliness on their part, all because
it's an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lhota said the council had been reckless in overriding
Giuliani's vetoes, and particularly in tucking a tax cut worth $200
million this year and $500 million in future years into its budget.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani often asks city agencies to find ways to trim
their budgets, he did so with more urgency than usual this year
because of the council's spending plan, Lhota said. The
administration will announce whether spending cuts are necessary
next month, he added.

IRABU, YANKS MAUL TIGERS 11-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Hideki Irabu loves sushi, all kinds, tuna and white
fish, and the night before each of his starts for the Yankees, he
goes for the soft stuff, his own ritual. On the mound, however,
Irabu's back to the hard stuff.
</P>
<P>
   His good fastball is back, and with it Irabu shut out the
Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night, 11-0, the Yankees' 16th victory
in their last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was Irabu's best outing in more than a month, and after
flirting with demotion last week, he once again is firmly
entrenched, after generating the Yankees' fourth shutout in their
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada had two hits, including his ninth home run, and
Chuck Knoblauch hit his third home run in six games. In six games
against Detroit this year, the Yankees have outscored the Tigers,
44-15.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (67-21) continue to match the 1902 Pirates stride
for stride: The teams now share the mark for the best 88-game
record in the game's history. If the Yankees won just half of their
remaining 74 games, they would finish the year with 104 victories,
more than any season since 1963, when the Yankees won 104.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Yankees complete the final four games of this 11-game
road trip, they will play 42 of their remaining 70 games at Yankee
Stadium, where they've won 33 of 39 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his start July 10, Irabu had concentrated on correcting
his arm angle, which had dropped _ from 12 o'clock, on the hands of
a clock, to about 11 o'clock _ and the velocity of his fastball had
increased somewhat. Afterward, Yankees Manager Joe Torre said he
thought Irabu had improved, but that there was still work to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   So, in his bullpen session last weekend, Irabu continued to
refine his fastball and also addressed his diminished command of
his split-fingered fastball: When he's most effective, Irabu gets
ahead in the ball-strike count with his fastball and then throws
his split-fingered fastball in the dirt, forcing hitters to chase.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a team he routinely overmatches, Irabu was at his best
Wednesday night, back to the form he had in April and May, the
scouts' radar guns behind home plate brightening with red, glowing
numbers like 93 mph and 94 mph.
</P>
<P>
   He threw strikes with all of his pitches, getting ahead in the
count enough to keep the hitters honest and then throwing his
split-fingered fastball, which had more movement than at any time
since the summer solstice.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu pitched into trouble only once in the first five innings,
walking Geronimo Berroa on four pitches with two outs, before Gabe
Alvarez pulled a double down the third base line, Berroa stopping
at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu spun a curveball with his first pitch to the next batter,
Paul Bako, and it broke over the plate _ too low, according to home
plate umpire Marty Foster. Jorge Posada, the catcher, threw the
ball back to Irabu, who caught it head high and held his glove in
place for a moment or two, glaring in at Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu beat himself at times in this manner last year, obsessing
on the mound over ball-strike interpretation. Wednesday night,
Irabu climbed up the mound, paused, and then stepped to the back,
picking up the resin bag, juggling it a bit, looking down.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the rubber again, Irabu dropped the bag to the side _
last year, he would fire it down _ and returned to the business of
pitching to Bako. Irabu threw another curve, this for a strike,
pumped a fastball past him and then dropped a curve over again for
a called strike three, perhaps the first time this season Irabu has
finished off a hitter with his curveball. End of inning, and
perhaps for Irabu, the end of his in-season crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu had allowed at least one home run in each of his six
starts since June 4, a total of 12 home runs in that span. But he
did not give up a home run Wednesday night, and the Tigers' only
extra-base hit was Alvarez's rolling double. Irabu is 3-0 in four
starts in his career against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Greisinger, Detroit's square-shoulder 6-foot-3-inch
starter, shut out the Yankees through the first four innings. In
the fifth, however, Posada singled and Chad Curtis walked.
Greisinger tried blowing a fastball past Ricky Ledee, and Ledee
offered a defensive swing, leaning back on his heels as he reached
out with his bat _ and poked a hit just inside the third base bag,
into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Posada scored, Curtis stopped at third, Ledee at second, and
both Curtis and Ledee subsequently scored on sacrifice flies,
giving Irabu a 3-0 lead. Tim Raines and Curtis had RBI hits in the
sixth inning to finish Greisinger. Posada blasted a two-run homer
in the eighth inning.

STARS TURNING OUT FOR CALIFORNIA SPEEDWAY RACES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ NASCAR auto racing returns to Southern California
this weekend, with appearances at Fontana's California Speedway by
the Craftsman Truck Series on Saturday and the Busch Grand National
tour Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And the expected guest showing of several Winston Cup drivers
promises to keep the weekend of speed from being strictly a
showcase for career minor-leaguers and young talent on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   With the Winston Cup circuit taking a rare weekend off, drivers
Dale Jarrett, Ernie Irvan, Bobby Hamilton, Dick Trickle and Michael
Waltrip plan to come west to take part in either the Busch Kenwood
Home &AMP; Auto 300 on Sunday or the Craftsman Truck No Fear Challenge
200 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, 1997 Cup runner-up in season points, is entered in
Sunday's Busch event, where he will face off against son Jason,
among others. Trickle is also entered in the Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, a crowd favorite since his miraculous comeback from a
near fatal crash in 1994, will drive in Saturday's truck race as
will Hamilton. Waltrip plans to drive in both events.
</P>
<P>
   Also making a cameo appearance in the truck race is former
Houston Oilers and Atlanta Falcons football coach _ and sometimes
racer _ Jerry Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the guests, of course, will be each tour's
established veteran racers.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Busch champion Randy LaJoie and reigning Kenwood 300
champion Todd Bodine are back in Busch cars after spending much of
the season on the Winston Cup tour.
</P>
<P>
   Up-and-coming stars Buchshot Jones and Dale Earnhardt Jr. _
already a three-time winner in just his first season on the tour _
will run.
</P>
<P>
   Another driver on the rise, Tony Stewart, will not be in Fontana
this weekend. Stewart, a regular on the Indy Racing League and
Busch circuits, will be at the IRL race in Delaware instead.
</P>
<P>
   And in the trucks, all-time truck champion Ron Hornaday Jr. of
Palmdale is coming in off the 21st victory of his truck career in
second place in season points, 26 behind 1997 season-champ Jack
Sprague. Hornaday will also drive in the Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the Winston West tour will run its California 200
at the conclusion of the truck race. Valencia's Sean Woodside takes
a 19-point lead over runner-up Kevin Harvick into the event.
</P>
<P>
   Practice for the weekend races begins today but is closed to the
public. The track opens to customers Friday with Busch and truck
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of tickets remain for each day of racing.

BATES SAYS PLAY WAS MOTIVATED BY TICKET BUYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVE IVEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Through the 15 seasons he endured savage
hits, broken bones and torn ligaments in the NFL, Bill Bates was
never playing merely for his own personal glory or just to support
his family.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when superstars often shun their responsibilities as
role models, Bates understood he was also playing for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect from the fans is all I have ever really wanted in my
career. They pay the money to come to the games and watch,'' Bates
said yesterday. ``Having the fans behind me, that has meant
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes beyond wanting to be liked, which he is without
question.
</P>
<P>
   If he just wanted to be popular, he did not have to play through
intense physical pain. During the 1994 season, for example, Bates
broke his left wrist against Detroit, and fractured his right thumb
against Washington. He remained in the game both times.
</P>
<P>
   That dedication, toughness and work ethic got the undrafted free
agent from the University of Tennessee through a Cowboys
record-tying 15 seasons and should help him in his new role as an
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think of me as this gritty, hard-working stiff who
stuck around despite limited ability, that's fine with me,'' Bates
said. ``That's maybe one of the best compliments I could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he worked so hard, why he never quit despite being
written off so many times, he gave a thoughtful answer.
</P>
<P>
   He said to try to imagine that there is a guy out there
somewhere, a solid high school player with a chance to play college
football. But he never played in college, or even went to college,
because he had to take care of his family at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that those guys, if they were me, they would work just
as hard for this as I've done,'' he said. ``I want those guys to be
able to look at me and say, `Hey, I'd be doing the exact same
thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bates, 37, never took anything for granted. Even after recording
84 tackles as a rookie in 1983 and being selected as the NFL
special teams player of the year, he tried to become a better
athlete the next year, and the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you lift the weights and run up and down the
hills,'' he said. ``I don't have the greatest athletic ability, but
God has given me a body that has been good enough to run with these
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm, the Cowboys' president when Bates joined the team,
noticed one quality that enabled Bates to run with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bates was one of those special people that made all he
has possible because of his heart,'' Schramm said. ``He didn't have
spectacular athletic ability. He just played because he had such
raw determination, will to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was last there, and the eight or nine years that
proceeded that, he was the one that wasn't going to make it. But he
had such a will and determination that you couldn't let that type
of person off the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Bates was the first NFC player to go to a Pro Bowl as a
designated special-teams performer. He recorded his career highs
for interceptions (four) in 1985 and sacks (five) in 1984. He
became the starting strong safety in 1986 and held that position
for three consecutive seasons. Bates was selected special-teams
captain in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, he is one of the toughest guys ever to strap
on a helmet and knock heads,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said.
``Bill is one of a kind. He will bring the same intensity to the
sidelines that he always brought onto the field, day in and day
out.''
</P>
<P>
   At virtually every training camp this decade, Bates has been the
subject of retirement rumors. But he kept making the cut, in spite
of the constant influx of younger, faster and stronger bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year ... the media has always anticipated whether I
would be on the field again. Every year, I have made it a personal
challenge to try to stretch it out one more time, one more year,''
he said. ``This year, I have the chance to be out on the field once
again and be part of a team that has meant so much to me and my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will miss playing, a future possibility that hasn't
been totally ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision not to play for another season would be a tough one
for me, no matter when it was. Now is the right time,'' he said.
``I believe I will be as much a part of this team as a coach as
I've been as No. 40.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Casino tribes put money on Mauro
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Indians fighting to keep their casinos
open have pumped $54,000 into Garry Mauro's long-shot effort to
unseat Gov. George W. Bush, who believes the tribes' slot machines
are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's campaign finance report, filed Wednesday, shows that the
Tigua Indian Reservation in El Paso was among his largest donors
this year, coming up with $39,000 for the Democratic challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The Kickapoo tribe of Eagle Pass pitched in with $15,000 for
Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tiguas and the Kickapoos are law-abiding citizens who
operate within the law and obviously they support Garry Mauro's
vision for Texas,'' said Billy Rogers, Mauro's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Both Indian tribes, thanks to their casinos, are new to
high-dollar contributions to statewide candidates. Tribal officials
signed on with Mauro earlier this year after Bush urged legal
action aimed at the slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro went to Speaking Rock, the Tigua casino, in May to
criticize Bush's efforts and urge the governor to sign a deal in
which the state would get a portion of the profits. The tribes
claim their operations are legal under federal law allowing Indians
to operate any type of gambling that is legal in their home state.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes claim their machines are similar to games offered by
the Texas Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very evident that Garry Mauro will probably represent
the best interests of the Kickapoos better than Governor Bush,''
said Isidro Garza, a tribal spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kickapoo officials are due in Austin on Friday for a meeting
with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Tigua officials, unavailable for comment Wednesday evening, have
filed a federal lawsuit to get a ruling on their machines. A
similar suit filed by the Kickapoos produced a ruling last month
that their devices are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Kickapoo casino is remaining open while the decision is
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal money is crucial to Mauro, who is up against a
money-raising machine. Bush has almost 66 times as much money on
hand as does the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has more than $14.5 million. Mauro has $221,659.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's report showed he raised $1.6 million in the first half
of 1998, including a $100,000 loan from Houston businessman and
former state party chairman Billy Goldberg. Mauro spent $1.7
million, more than half of which was for TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's top contributor in the first six months of this year was
Houston businessman Tilman Fertitta, who gave $60,000. Waco
insuranceman Bernard Rapoport, a longtime Democratic financier,
gave $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose report covered March 1 through June 30, showed
contributions of $4.4 million and expenditures of $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's top donors were Houston businessman Thomas
Soriero and A.J. Perenchio of Los Angeles, each of whom gave
$50,000. Perenchio is the owner of Univision, a Spanish-language
television network.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting periods for the two gubernatorial candidates were
different because Bush faced token opposition in the primary. Mauro
was unopposed and has not had to file a report since Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic challenger said the numbers look good and the
future looks bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built a solid foundation to raise an additional $4
million in the closing months of this campaign,'' said Mauro, the
state land commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said Mauro is not taking any cost-cutting steps. Joe
Cutbirth, the press secretary, left the campaign Wednesday, but
Rogers said it was not a financial decision. Cutbirth is returning
to Mauro's staff at the General Land Office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his substantial edge in the money chase, Bush wants
more. A current Bush fund-raising letter offers a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I must make certain the campaign has enough money to
withstand any assault by the governor's opponents,'' Don Evans of
Midland, chairman of the Bush committee, said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript printed to appear hand-written, Evans added:
``Mauro has already gone on TV in selected markets and is moving
around Texas aggressively _ both signs that the national Democrats
and big labor have promised him more than enough resources to
sustain an all-out assault on the governor. We need your help
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reports indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's cash on hand will not buy a significant TV campaign for
the home stretch. And the president of the Texas AFL-CIO said Mauro
probably cannot count on a major cash infusion from labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given what we think is probably close to our max,'' said
Texas AFL-CIO President Joe Gunn, adding that the group has given
Mauro about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's latest report shows $37,000 from labor groups, as well
as $21,000 from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gunn said he believes Mauro is a long shot, at best, he
wants the Democrat to put up the best fight possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somebody ought to oppose (Bush). At this point, nobody
is opposing him but Garry Mauro,'' said Gunn, overlooking minor
party candidates who could wind up on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go to Las Vegas, they play the long shots all
day,'' Gunn said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat John Sharp reported
Wednesday that he raised $2.6 million this year, bringing his
overall total to $7 million. Sharp said he has $5.4 million in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   GOP nominee Rick Perry reported Monday that he collected $3.5
million this year, for an overall total of $6.7 million. The Perry
campaign declined to pinpoint how much he has on hand, but said it
was close to $5 million.

BUSH SEEKS QUICK FEDERAL HELP FOR HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As temperatures topped 100 degrees for the
10th straight day, Gov. George W. Bush urged the federal government
Wednesday to expedite requests to declare more than 100
drought-stricken counties disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the counties seeking aid, only Terrell County in West Texas
has been approved, state officials said. A disaster declaration by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture would make farmers and ranchers
eligible for low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas counties that have asked for the aid include Ellis
and Denton.
</P>
<P>
   The drought has cost agricultural producers statewide about $1.5
billion in lost revenues, with a ripple effect on Texas' economy of
an estimated $4.6 billion, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losses are staggering. When you combine the loss with
1996, our farm economy is taking a serious hit,'' Bush said,
referring to the drought of 1995-96, one of the worst on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a serious situation in Texas,'' said Bush, who was in
Fort Worth to speak to about 6,000 people attending the opening
session of the Future Farmers of America's 70th annual state
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is working
with water districts drowning under demands for service, Bush said.
The governor discussed the drought with the state's top water
officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency has identified about 150 systems that, because
of months of high demand, are reporting problems such as pumps
going out and water pressure going down, making it difficult to
deliver water to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to see demands (for water) in June that we
typically see in August,'' said commission Chairman Barry McBee of
Austin. ``But it stopped raining and got hot earlier and stayed
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures since May have been unusually high statewide. The
extension service's $1.5 billion estimate of agricultural losses _
triple the estimate in June _ shows that this year's drought is on
its way to becoming as economically painful as the $5 billion
drought in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some regionwide crop losses are approaching 100 percent on
nonirrigated dry-land fields, particularly in the major cotton- and
grain-growing areas of the northwestern High Plains and the western
Rolling Plains, the extension service said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pressing hard. Like a lot of times with the federal
bureaucracy, we press and press and press, and hopefully we get
some response,'' Bush said. ``The long-term remedy is pure and
simple: rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA is moving as quickly as possible to process the
requests it has received for disaster relief, said Larry Mitchell,
a spokesman for the federal Farm Service Agency, a division of the
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell County filed its request for help in late April. By
Tuesday, requests from 65 other counties were pending before the
U.S. Agriculture Department. Bush had requests from 13 counties on
his desk, and 32 counties were preparing their appeals, state
records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those applications were prepared in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very aware of the problems in Texas and the surrounding
states and are moving as quickly as we can ...'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell County learned Tuesday that it had been declared a
disaster area. Because they border the disaster area, Brewster,
Crockett, Pecos and Val Verde counties are also eligible for
emergency aid, a state official said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency loans that the counties will receive may be used
to cover expenses incurred to continue farming operations. Loan
repayment time is usually one to seven years but may be up to 20
years for production losses. Those applying must be able to
document at least a 30 percent crop loss, according to federal
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our farmers and ranchers it is very crucial, realizing
that quite a few producers took it on the chin in 1996 with that
drought,'' said Beverly Boyd, a Texas Department of Agriculture
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, some of the counties waited four months for
approval.''
</P>
<P>
   To help water systems that are struggling with the drought,
McBee said his agency is providing technical expertise as well as
identifying adjacent systems to which they can attach if a serious
water availability problem arises.
</P>
<P>
   The conservation commission may also expand a program being used
in the Rio Grande Valley to encourage water conservation, McBee
said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, the agency asks people to take shorter
showers, not to water their lawns in the heat of the day and to
wash their vehicles at car washes where the water is recycled, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advice on how to conserve water is distributed in water bills
and through public service announcements on television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to look at as many ways as we can to make sure we are
thinking about every drop of water and if we are using it wisely,''
McBee said.
</P>
<P>
   To protect drought-stricken rural areas, Bush is also providing
$200,000 to the Texas Forest Service to fund matching grants to
purchase up to 400 dry hydrants, which offer rural firefighters
quick access to fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Dry hydrants are nonpressurized pipes that are permanently
installed at water sources such as lakes, ponds, water storage
tanks and irrigation wells. The hydrants are invaluable to Texas'
40,000 rural volunteer firefighters.

BATES BECOMES FULL-TIME COWBOYS ASSISTANT, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The intense work ethic and competitive
fire that first earned Bill Bates a job with the Cowboys as an
undrafted free agent 15 years ago put off yesterday's emotional
announcement for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   After laboring over a request by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones in
June to end his playing career and join the coaching staff, Bates
accepted a position as a special-teams coach, it was announced at a
news conference yesterday that opened the Cowboys' 1998 training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   One year short of setting a team record for most seasons played,
Bates said he wanted to play another year but realized the move
might be in the best interest of the Cowboys and himself. Bates,
however, did not call it a retirement and plans to continue working
out with the team. Jones said the Cowboys would consider re-signing
Bates as a player if there is an opportunity to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play,'' said Bates, who read an emotional speech
that nearly moved him to tears a couple of times. ``But to not play
another year would be tough on me, no matter when it was. I think
this is the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates added, ``You did not hear a retirement speech. I will
train and get ready to play. So if the opportunity (arises) I will
be ready. But I'm not focusing on that. I'm focusing on helping
this team win as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the attitude that led the former safety and special-teams
star to make the Cowboys as a rookie free agent in 1983 and become
one of the most popular players in team history, Jones said it was
imperative to keep Bates in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bates will also help coach defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those skills that helped him do that I think could make him be
the chairman and president of many corporations in this country,''
Jones said. ``If you were in my shoes you wouldn't want to let him
leave your sights. You would want to keep him somehow associated
with your organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys wanted to make this move during the team's minicamp
in June. Bates resisted the offer then, as he clung to hopes of
getting a chance to make the team as a player and breaking the
service record. Bates holds the honor of 15 seasons with Ed Jones
and Mark Tuinei.
</P>
<P>
   Bates blamed part of the situation on his $325,000 veteran
salary, understanding that a team can sign two rookies for his
salary. He also cited the team's poor play last year, which
resulted in a host of changes.
</P>
<P>
   But because of his love of the Cowboys and his appreciation for
what it has done for him, he said he had no problem accepting a
coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who knows me and followed my career knows how
important it is for me to be a Cowboy,'' Bates said. ``I've always
tried to make a contribution and been willing to take on whatever
part I was asked. After meeting with Jerry and head coach Chan
Gailey and discussing how I could make the most important impact on
the Cowboys, I decided to accept a whole new challenge and become a
part of the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates carved out a legacy, on and off the field, that dwarfs his
6-foot-1, 200-pound frame. He appeared in 217 regular-season games
_ second all-time for the Cowboys _ and recorded 701 tackles while
playing for each of the three previous Cowboys coaches _ Tom
Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected NFL special-teams player of the year in 1983 and
1984. In 1984, he became the first NFC player to be selected to the
Pro Bowl as a special-teams performer, and his play in that arena
is credited as a reason the NFL added special-teams players to the
Pro Bowl roster.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Brandt, the Cowboys' former director of player personnel,
said Bates had a way of making people notice him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Bill's first camp with us,'' Brandt said. ``We had
a bunch of guys trying out, about 20 defensive backs. Bill's
40-yard dash time was not that good, and if you didn't have
scrimmages he wouldn't have made the team because people would look
at him and say he wasn't fast enough. But he worked hard to excel
and he stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Bates has done work for many charity
organizations and he gained attention as host for annual Cowboys
pep rallies at the Bill Bates Cowboys Ranch north of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Jones acknowledged that the decision on Bates was not based on
talent. He said he believes that Bates could win a roster spot over
a first- or second-year player. Jones, however, said the move was
in the team's best interest for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys are anticipating tough roster decisions
to get down to the regular-season limit of 53, making it tough to
carry Bates. Jones also said he will not hesitate to re-sign Bates
if the need arises, but ruled out a ceremonial move during the
season just to allow Bates to get the service record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to, and we would like him to, make an on-the-field
contribution this year and do some things that would mean a lot to
all of us and extend the playing record,'' Jones said. ``But this
isn't a token thing we are talking about, because this isn't a
token season about anything. We are trying to win a Super Bowl.
Bates will make a valuable contribution one way or another.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: DROP THE `48-HOUR RULE` 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 16:
</P>
<P>
   The perception that police officers are above the law erodes
confidence in the entire criminal justice system. The Giuliani
administration and the police sergeants' union took an important
step toward repairing public confidence when they agreed in
principle to discard a rule allowing New York City officers
involved in shootings to wait two days before answering
investigators' questions. The rank and file in the sergeants' union
have yet to vote on giving up the so-called ``48-hour rule.'' But
the time has long passed for all the police unions to surrender
this special and unreasonable right.
</P>
<P>
   The rule gives officers who are involved in crimes two days to
coordinate their stories _ or try to influence witnesses. Some
argue that the rule plays no role in the most serious
investigations, since the District Attorney often delays
questioning officers. Even so, it leaves the public impression that
officers are exempted from standard legal procedures, even in
instances when a citizen has died under suspicious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the sergeants' union did the right thing by
surrendering the rule. But the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association,
which has clung to the rule for years and represents the bulk of
the police force, needs finally to yield to the public will.

 Rising From the Ashes of Borland   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
For Philippe Kahn, redemption fits in a shirt pocket.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three and a half years after being crucified over the troubles
of Borland International, Kahn has rebounded, thanks to technology
that runs a credit card-sized personal organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The organizer, called Rex, uses an operating system from
Starfish Software, the company that Kahn sold to Motorola this week
for several hundred million dollars. Motorola plans to build Rex's
information-sharing technology into millions of cellular phones and
pagers in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout lifts the mantel of failure that Kahn has carried
ever since Borland _ the company he built into one of the largest
software-makers in the world _ ousted him as chief executive in
January of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 46-year-old French-born Kahn found himself in
the media spotlight for the first time since the dark days when
Borland was going down the tubes and the media was clamoring for
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to managing all these phone calls anymore,'' he
said jokingly as he juggled two calls during a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Borland cut him loose, the Scotts Valley company had
been losing gobs of money for two years and its revenues were
falling steadily. It was apparent that though he was a technical
whiz (with two degrees in mathematics), Kahn didn't have the right
stuff to manage a nearly $500 million company with 3,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   He was guilty of strategic blunders, such as trying to
under-price Microsoft products, and his decision to acquire
Ashton-Tate turned into folly because of delays in producing a
Windows version of that company's popular dBase database program.
</P>
<P>
   Borland continued to skid after Kahn's departure. Today, it is a
small maker of software-development tools. It recently changed its
name to Inprise Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As his life at Borland was unraveling, Kahn co-founded Starfish
with Sonia Lee, a graphic designer whom he eventually would marry.
The new company, also based in Scotts Valley, gave him a chance to
do what he does best _ create technology in an intimate setting
where business didn't get in the way of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half years ago, a lot of people were saying life
was over for Philippe,'' says industry analyst David Coursey, a
friend of Kahn's. ``But as soon as he settled into something
smaller and development-oriented, it was only a matter of time
before something good would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few years seem to have softened Kahn, who once called
himself the ``barbarian'' of the software industry. At the peak of
his fame in the early '90s, he was known for flying his own
airplane, playing jazz flute, staging a corporate toga party and
building a $100 million headquarters for Borland.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kahn disowns the ``flamboyant'' image that has followed
him around. ``Flamboyant!'' he says derisively, pronouncing it the
French way. ``I'm a very private person. Tell my kids I'm
flamboyant and they always laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kahn has maintained a low profile at Starfish, which has
just 100 employees. It kept its technology under wraps until it was
ready for market. ``It took us three years before Rex came out,''
he says, adding, ``Why would you want any publicity before you
build the technology?''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn has dubbed Rex, which was introduced last year, as the
first ``wearable computer.'' Manufactured by Citizen and marketed
by Franklin Electronics, it sells for for $180 (including a docking
cradle for a PC).
</P>
<P>
   The key technology in Rex _ the Starfish part that Motorola
coveted _ lets the device link up with other wireless devices such
as pagers and portable computers. It has the potential to turn cell
phones into smart phones that can store addresses, appointments and
other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kahn has scrupulously avoided any technology that would put
Starfish in competition with Microsoft, having learned at Borland
that it's tough to beat Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kahn blames much of Borland's troubles on Microsoft,
whose spreadsheet and database software grabbed market share from
Borland products, including Quattro Pro and Paradox.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, people said the Borland guys were crazy, they
didn't know what they were doing, they were idiots,'' Kahn recalls.
``But what we've seen is that Microsoft became the Muhammad Ali of
the industry. A lot of great boxers lost to Ali, but that didn't
make them crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn says he has no plans to leave Starfish after Motorola takes
charge. ``Part of my mission is to help them pass all the
competition and be the market leader for digital wireless phones
and pagers,'' he says. ``And I really believe it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Coursey thinks Kahn will stay ``for a decent period of time. But
he adds, ``Something makes me think this is not Philippe's last
company.''

CITY COUNCIL PANEL OKS LETTING THEATERS SELL AIR RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid fractious negotiations with the theater
industry, property owners and neighborhood residents, a City
Council committee Wednesday scaled back, but then approved, a plan
to allow the sale of air rights from landmark theaters in the area
around Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, advocated by many in the theater industry as a way to
preserve theaters and promote small, high-quality productions, had
provoked passionate debate. On Tuesday, actor Tony Randall and
composer Stephen Sondheim testified in favor of it, and several
residents of Clinton, the neighborhood on the west side of the
Theater District, said they feared being overwhelmed by traffic and
new skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the version approved by the City Council's Land Use
Committee, and expected to be approved next month by the full
Council, was modified to placate Clinton residents and other
interests as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Council members who said Broadway has
become alien territory to New Yorkers of modest means, the plan
included a provision that would dedicate some of the money raised
from developers to providing discount tickets for residents of
neighborhoods above 96th Street in Manhattan and in the city's
other boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had to confront very conflicting pressures,'' said
Council member Walter McCaffrey, chairman of the Land Use
Committee. ``This version strikes the best chord possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As an untested attempt to meld development incentives with
support for cultural institutions, the plan leaves large financial
questions unanswered. Chief among them is how much developers would
pay for the theaters' air rights, and if any such transactions
would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, supported by both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, the owners of many theaters in an
area would be allowed to sell the development rights, or air
rights, above their buildings to developers who would build far
larger apartment buildings or commercial structures on the same
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For any money that would be raised from the sale of those
rights, the plan provides broad outlines for how it would be used
to support the theater industry. Theater owners, whose financial
gain from the sale of their air rights could extend into millions
of dollars, would be required to turn over part of that gain _ $10
per square foot of development rights that they sell _ into a
city-controlled fund. The owners would also be required to operate
their buildings as theaters in perpetuity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Money in the theater fund would be allocated for several
purposes. Part of it would be used to maintain the historic
theaters. Another part would be dedicated for programs to attract
more New Yorkers to plays; one possibility under discussion is the
creation of discount ticket booths in low- and middle-income
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Another component of the plan would reserve some of the money
for direct financial support of producers and theatrical companies
working on plays and small-scale musicals _ the sort of production
that would not necessarily be expected to attract large enough
audiences to make money but would still elevate the quality of
theater in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In that role, the plan brings the city into a novel coalition
with powerful forces in the theater industry, where a large group
of producers, theater owners, unions and actors' organizations has
formed an organization, called Broadway Initiative, to generate
funds from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Although that group has not disclosed its plan in final form,
Joey Parnes, the group's coordinator, said Wednesday that it
planned to start fund-raising programs before the end of the year
that might include collecting fees from within the industry based
on things like ticket sales or union dues.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan approved Wednesday wins final approval, its fund
would be separate from that of Broadway Initiative and controlled
by an eight-member Theater Subdistrict Council appointed by the
mayor and other elected officials.

LITERARY LONG ISLAND  
 OLD-SCHOOL TYPES  
 TRASH TALK  
 COMMISH VS. COMMISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH ALEX KUCZYNSKI, MONIQUE P. YAZIGI AND DAVID
KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crowd at the party for Victoria Gotti's second
whodunit, ``I'll Be Watching You,'' split into two distinct camps:
literary types, who favored rumpled seersucker suits and
horn-rimmed glasses held together with Scotch tape, and a more
snappily dressed group that included Ms. Gotti's friends Diane and
Carl Gambino; her husband, Carmine Agnello, and her aunt, Mary
Gotti. A brother, John Gotti Jr., was invited. But isn't he in
prison, awaiting trial on racketeering and extortion charges?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes,'' a Crown spokeswoman said, ``but we thought we'd
better put him on the list. Just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gotti seemed unconcerned, choosing instead to discuss more
pressing issues: her dress (a tight black satin sheath by Bob
Mackie that would have put Imelda Marcos to shame) and someone else
who was not there, the author Nelson Demille.
</P>
<P>
   His 1990 novel ``Gold Coast'' was about a WASPish family that
lives on a big estate on Long Island and is drawn into organized
crime's web. ``I'll Be Watching You'' is about a WASPish family
that lives on a big estate on Long Island and _ well, there is a
father-in-law with shady business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gotti said that she had read ``Gold Coast'' eight or nine
years ago. ``You can't say you know Long Island unless you've read
it,'' she said. But she said the similarities were superficial, and
DeMille said by telephone Wednesday that he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But the two authors do have something in common: a Barnes &AMP;
Noble bookstore in Carle Place, N.Y. Of a chance meeting between
the shelves, he said, ``I remember a lot of blond hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Alumnae Reunion
</P>
<P>
   It was billed as a party for the National Women's Cancer
Research Alliance. There were hints that it might include a
performance by Sarah McLachlan of Lilith Fair, the summerlong
``celebration of women in music.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a few moments, anyway, it was nothing more than a
reunion of Manhattan private school alumnae from the 1980s, as
Gwyneth Paltrow, who went to Spence, chatted with Shoshanna
Lonstein, who went to Nightingale-Bamford. Ms. Lonstein said that
she wants to spend the post-Seinfeld era designing strapless
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford was circulating with her husband, Rande Gerber.
The waiters served water in martini glasses after running out of
tumblers. And Ms. McLachlan, like Elvis, left the building. Without
performing.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Never Sleeps
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Siegal can expect nice new suitcases real soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The New York Post reported that her boyfriend, the
financier Richard Nye, had packed clothes belonging to Manhattan's
high priestess of publicity into garbage bags, which then landed in
the driveway of his house in Southampton, N.Y. The Post said Nye
was angry that Ms. Siegal had been out working the Hamptons party
circuit on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the two were laughing about the purported clothing
defenestration as they celebrated her 51st birthday at Elaine's,
the Upper East Side watering hole. In a toast, Nye promised her
Gucci luggage to eliminate the need for garbage bags. The crowd,
which included Dominick Dunne; Nora Ephron and her husband,
Nicholas Pileggi; Regis Philbin, and Vera Wang, roared with
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ms. Siegal denied that the garbage bag incident
had happened, and offered her version of how she spent her Saturday
night: ``I was at a party at Bill Richardson's, and the only people
who knew I was there were me, Richard and the houseman.'' She
paused. ``So much for the houseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Czar Speaks
</P>
<P>
   Even after two and a half years in the big office atop 1 Police
Plaza, Commissioner Howard Safir is still chasing the well-tailored
shadow of his predecessor, William Bratton. On Wednesday, Safir
found himself countering Bratton's ideas about how the Police
Department should deal with the drop in crime. New York magazine
quoted Bratton as urging a reduction of 3,300 officers and giving
the remaining 35,000 a $100-a-week raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill's a little lonely,'' Safir said after dismissing
the idea as ``fuzzy thinking.'' He added that cutting the payroll
would forfeit federal funding for 6,000 other officers. Besides, he
said, whenever the force has been trimmed, crime has climbed.

 Levi's May Cut More Jobs   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is developing a cost-cutting and staff
restructuring plan that is expected to result in additional layoffs
over the next two years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sources close to the company said the effort is designed to cut
$200 million to $220 million in operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco clothes-maker laid off 7,400 workers and
closed 11 factories last year in an effort to save $288 million.
</P>
<P>
   All divisions of the company are evaluating ways to shift their
resources, including personnel, to put more emphasis on marketing,
said Clarence Grebey, the company's director of global
communications. He said, however, it is too early to say how many
jobs may be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worldwide we are looking at a cost reduction program over a
two-year period,'' Grebey said. ``I am not denying that the
potential exists for there to be a loss of jobs, but there is a
positive there as well in terms of ... opportunities for people to
do new things within the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Grebey said Levi's has not settled on a definitive cost-cutting
goal. ``I don't want to say that numbers in that ballpark ($200
million to $220 million) have not been used in internal documents,
but they are by no means definitive numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be unfair and not accurate to say Levi's is
looking to do this (cutting costs by that amount),'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's employs about 30,000 people worldwide, including 18,000
in the United States and 1,500 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Levi's USA division is expected to finish its
restructuring plan in the next two months, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Many current staffers are expected to receive new job
descriptions and an undetermined number will probably be let go.
The company will open some newly created positions to outsiders. In
the past, the company has tended to promote from within.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cost-cutting efforts, poor sales of Levi's flagship
denim products pushed 1997 sales down for the first time in 13
years, to $6.9 billion. And sales do not appear to be improving
this year, although the privately-held company has not disclosed
any 1998 numbers. Sources close to the company said Levi's is
suffering from serious supply problems. A retailer said he was
expecting a large shipment of cargo pants in July for the crucial
back-to-school season but was told last month that the pants will
not arrive until September or October.
</P>
<P>
   Another source said only a small fraction of the ``hard jeans''
slated to be on store shelves for a big advertising push in June
actually made it to the stores on time.
</P>
<P>
   Grebey admitted that there have been ``wrinkles'' in the supply
chain, but would not discuss details. He said demand is strong for
the hard jeans but would not comment on the reported inventory
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the restructuring, Levi's is attempting to change
its corporate culture by encouraging employees to take more risks
and be more innovative in their thinking, Grebey said.

 Apple's Profit Beats Expectations   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Continuing a dramatic financial comeback, Apple Computer yesterday
wowed Wall Street by reporting a quarterly profit that was almost
twice what analysts were expecting.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bolstered by strong sales of its Power Macintosh G3 and cost
cutting, the Cupertino computer-maker earned $101 million (65 cents
per share) during its fiscal third quarter ended June 26. Analysts
were expecting 33 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time items, Apple earned $75 million (50 cents) in
the latest quarter. In the same period a year ago, Apple lost $56
million (44 cents).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely gratifying to see results that match the
talent at Apple,'' interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in an
interview yesterday. ``It was sad a year ago, when we had just lost
something like a billion dollars. Obviously, some people had to go
and we had a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Apple's third-straight quarterly profit came from cost
reductions. The company has laid off hundreds of people, integrated
its Claris software subsidiary into the parent company and closed
its Newton unit, which made handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's sales actually slid 19 percent, to $1.4 billion in the
third quarter from $1.74 billion in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   But profits grew largely because the company was selling more
computers with higher profit margins, namely the Power Macintosh
G3. The company has sold more than 750,000 of the speedy computers
since they were introduced last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said Apple is also benefitting from better sales
forecasting, more efficient manufacturing and a smaller, focused
product line that doesn't intimidate consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly profit was Apple's third in a row. The company
earned $102 million in the previous two quarters combined. The
latest profit is the largest since third quarter of June 1995, when
Apple made $103 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Apple can make money in the current quarter, the company will
post its first profitable year since 1995. The company lost nearly
$2 billion in fiscal 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give Jobs high marks for the Apple resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is like the cleanup hitter who drove in the men that
(former Apple CEO) Gil (Amelio) put on base for him,'' said Lou
Mazzucchelli Jr., vice president of Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co.
Inc. ``Some of what you see _ the operational cuts and efficiency
in Apple's organization _ was started under Gil's watch and carried
out by (chief financial officer) Fred Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people questioned whether Steve would capitalize on
the situation, but he has,'' Mazzucchelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts say the company is hardly home free. They
point out that Apple's quarterly sales and unit shipments are
lagging from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turmoil of the last few years may have driven away too
many fence sitters to Windows machines,'' said analyst Steve Dube,
of Wasserstein Perella in New York. ``Apple's primary objective is
to stabilize its installed base. Right now, they would be happy to
avoid further erosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also concerned about the company's middling market
share. Apple's share of the domestic personal computer market has
stalled at 4 percent, according to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose
market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple executives insist the company's market share will grow
with the August 15 introduction of its $1,299 iMac home computer.
``Our sights are set on an aggressive foray into the consumer
market,'' Apple's Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Market researchers predict the company could ship as many as
400,000 of its iMac home computers by the end of September. ``The
reaction has been off-the-charts,'' Jobs said, pointing out that
177 software programs have been designed or updated for the iMac in
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The table has been set for growth,'' said Charles Wolf,
director of equity research at Credit Suisse First Boston in New
York. ``And we will see that when iMac sales begin to take off in
the September quarter. Finally, Apple has some focus _ and Steve
has everything to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jobs' performance as CEO has led to a groundswell of
support among Macintosh enthusiasts, developers, Apple executives
and board members for him to drop the ``interim'' from his title.
</P>
<P>
   But the Apple co-founder insists he isn't ready to take the
permanent plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months ago, I woke up and decided that ... &UR;  &LR; I will do
as best as I can for as long as I can and not worry about what
other people think,'' he said. ``My focus is on my family, Apple
and Pixar (where Jobs is CEO), in that order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company's stock _ which had sunk to $12.94 per
share in December _ rose $1 yesterday to $34.44 _ a
two-and-a-half-year high. Trading in Apple was halted before
yesterday afternoon's announcement. It will reopen today.

 Apples Makes a Comeback in Classrooms and Wall Street   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
Jeanne Hayes has been tracking computer sales in the public school
market for 15 years. But when she finished crunching the latest
numbers the other day, even she didn't believe them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``For the first time in five years we saw an upswing in orders
for the Mac,'' she said. ``We went nuts. I ran the numbers again
just to make sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who is president of Quality Education Data, a market
research firm in Denver, said after surveying 5,000 public schools,
she found that 38 percent of all new computers ordered for the
coming school year are Macs.
</P>
<P>
   That's up from 32 percent of new orders last year.
</P>
<P>
   And though schools will still buy two Windows PCs for every Mac,
Hayes said Apple's rebound will be her headline when QED releases
its report later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attribute a lot of it to (Steve) Jobs' leadership,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no denying the Steve factor yesterday, as Apple
reported earnings that were nearly double Wall Street's
expectations. Analyst Craig Cline of Seybold Media, who follows the
desktop publishing market, said Apple is doing a little better in
that key market as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cline said publishing types, all Mac-o-philes to the bone, are
jazzed about the new G3 Macs. Yet they still find themselves
holding their noses and buying Windows systems.
</P>
<P>
   Cline cautioned against euphoria, because Apple still has a long
way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to drink the Kool-Aid and say everything's
totally turned around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Mac fans have every reason to cheer today, investors might
be wary of jumping into Apple, whose shares have risen so
spectacularly since Jobs took over last summer, from the low teens
to $34.44 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   George Shirk, editor of The Insider's Newsletter in Florida,
notes that Apple execs and board members haven't been buying the
company's stock, with the exception of Edgar Woolard, who recently
bought 3,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one reason insiders buy their company's stock and
that's because they anticipate higher share prices,'' Shirk said.
``If we saw more insiders buying, we'd say these guys are
bullish.''
</P>
<P>
   So hats off to Apple for great earnings and solid gains in the &QL; 
K-12 market share. But be careful with the stock, for now.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; The laugh test: &LR;  Legal documents rarely make good reading, but
I got a chuckle out of the response Intel filed this week to the
Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it was no surprise that Intel said it has no
microprocessor monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But who would have expected this: ``Intel denies that a new
entrant (to the microprocessor industry) would have to establish
both product reputation and technical compatibility with a computer
operating system and the application software desired by a
significant number of computer users.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Intel have us believe users are ready to throw out their
current hardware and software should a niftier chip comes along?
</P>
<P>
   Mac fans could only wish that were true! But the FTC will try to
prove that Intel benefits from the so-called ``network effect.''
That is, the more people who use its chips, the more likely it
becomes that Intel microprocessors will keep new chips from
entering the market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said his company ``would explain

continues.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Junk revival? &LR;  Junk bonds got a bad name in the 1980s because
they financed so many leveraged-buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Chamberlain, an investment banker with Morgan Stanley,
said junk bonds have come into favor over the last few years as a
way to finance high-tech firms that need cash but aren't ready for
initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The most recent example is provided by competitive local
access providers, or CLECs. These are companies like Covad or
NorthPoint that compete with Pacific Bell in selling high-speed
Internet access and other telecommunications services to
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain said privately-held CLECs have collectively raised
$6 billion to $8 billion in junk financing to pay for the wires and
switches to create their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This significant inflow of bond financing has come at a time
when equity investors have seen substantial risks in putting money
into businesses that compete against Pac Bell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So bond buyers, who can get 10 percent returns on investments
secured against million-dollar machinery, have stepped in to
finance the CLECs.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain expects the CLECs to go public one day. Meanwhile,
if junk bonds kick start this industry, it could start a pattern
for other capital-intensive tech industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Real Gold Rush?  &LR; Everyone wants to jump on the Internet
bandwagon, including lawmakers in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Already more than 50 pending bills in the House and Senate seek
to regulate _ or de-regulate _ everything from pornography and
e-mail, to taxes and private information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This outpouring of legislative interest prompted venture
capitalist Floyd Kvamme to tell my colleague Mark Simon that
although some of the bills were well-intentioned, they reminded him
of one of life's three great lies, ``I'm from the government and
I'm here to help.''

COLUMN: CAN YOU JUDGE A SEX SHOP BY ITS VIDEOS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a big question about female wrestling movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the women wrestle topless. Sometimes they don't. In
the former case, it is pretty clear to see how the movies fall
afoul of the city's new sex shop zoning laws, which give a precise,
indeed to some sensibilities practically pornographic, account of
what defines an adult video. But what to do in the latter case?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wrestle with tops, is it sports or sex?'' asked the
troubled owner of a midtown video store who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``There are a lot of gray areas. There's questions
about spanking movies, about tickling movies. I really feel
violated by a stupid law like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling
that could allow the city finally to begin enforcing its new sex
shop zoning laws as early as next week. But rather than simply
throwing in the G-string, as many city officials had predicted they
would, sex shop owners are scrambling to get on the right side of
the zoning laws. Which is to say, they are busily trying to devise
ways to continue to sell sex without having their stores
technically defined as sex shops, or, as the law more
diplomatically refers to them, ``adult establishments.''
</P>
<P>
   They are reducing their stock movies like ``Squeeze Play,''
picking up bargain-basement tapes of ``Jacques Cousteau,'' debating
the finer points of foot fetishism and pasties and ordering up
Potemkin tchotchkes. As a man behind the counter at the Playpen on
Eighth Avenue said, only half in jest: ``We're going to order some
nasty T-shirts that no one wants to buy. We're going to be the
cleanest dirtiest store in town.''
</P>
<P>
   When the City Council passed the sex shop zoning laws in 1995,
at the urging of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, pornography itself was not
the target but rather the stores that peddled it. Limits were
placed on ``adult establishments,'' which were legally defined as
those that either devoted a ``substantial'' part of their stock to
adult videos and books or ``regularly featured'' adult
performances.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this distinction, state and federal judges
consistently ruled in the city's favor despite the constitutional
protections on free expression. But also as a result of this
distinction, enforcing the new zoning laws is likely to prove an
enormous headache. Just what do the critical phrases
``substantial'' and ``regularly'' mean, exactly, when applied to
pornography?
</P>
<P>
   An often-cited memo from the City Planning Commission suggests
that ``substantial'' should be interpreted to mean that 40 percent
or more of a store's accessible floor area is devoted to adult
material. But this is merely a recommendation and is, in any case,
open to considerable interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Would a store, for example, that gave more than 60 percent of
its space to dusty, overpriced models of the Statue of Liberty but
did its real business in briskly circulating videos of ``Riding
Lessons'' and ``Georgia Peaches'' be considered in compliance?
</P>
<P>
   How about a store that operated a busy row of private viewing
booths that featured ``The Sound of Music'' on six channels and
``Debbie Does Dallas'' on the other four?
</P>
<P>
   City officials have been profoundly reticent about how the nuts
and bolts of enforcement would be applied. Ted Birkhahn, a
spokesman for the city's Buildings Department, which would have the
primary authority for enforcing the zoning laws, promised to
respond to questions about how compliance would be measured but did
not do so, even after half a dozen follow-up calls. Similarly, a
call to the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement, which was
referred to the City Hall press office, went unreturned.
</P>
<P>
   Sex shop owners themselves complain bitterly that their requests
for information have been unavailing. One owner griped, ``We're
changing our inventory to be in compliance, but the city doesn't
know what compliance is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the sex shops and their clients who have followed
the zoning laws through their three-year legal odyssey say this
lack of clarity is only going to lead to a whole new round of court
cases as shop owners test the city's as yet obscurely defined sense
of what is and is not an ``adult establishment.'' As Beth Haroules,
a lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union who has represented
sex shop patrons, wondered aloud: How would you define women
dancing naked but slathered in latex?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really going to happen,'' she predicted, ``is years and
years of litigation.''

 Rising From the Ashes of Borland   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
For Philippe Kahn, redemption fits in a shirt pocket.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three and a half years after being crucified over the troubles
of Borland International, Kahn has rebounded, thanks to technology
that runs a credit card-sized personal organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The organizer, called Rex, uses an operating system from
Starfish Software, the company that Kahn sold to Motorola this week
for several hundred million dollars. Motorola plans to build Rex's
information-sharing technology into millions of cellular phones and
pagers in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout lifts the mantel of failure that Kahn has carried
ever since Borland _ the company he built into one of the largest
software-makers in the world _ ousted him as chief executive in
January of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 46-year-old French-born Kahn found himself in
the media spotlight for the first time since the dark days when
Borland was going down the tubes and the media was clamoring for
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to managing all these phone calls anymore,'' he
said jokingly as he juggled two calls during a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Borland cut him loose, the Scotts Valley company had
been losing gobs of money for two years and its revenues were
falling steadily. It was apparent that though he was a technical
whiz (with two degrees in mathematics), Kahn didn't have the right
stuff to manage a nearly $500 million company with 3,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   He was guilty of strategic blunders, such as trying to
under-price Microsoft products, and his decision to acquire
Ashton-Tate turned into folly because of delays in producing a
Windows version of that company's popular dBase database program.
</P>
<P>
   Borland continued to skid after Kahn's departure. Today, it is a
small maker of software-development tools. It recently changed its
name to Inprise Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As his life at Borland was unraveling, Kahn co-founded Starfish
with Sonia Lee, a graphic designer whom he eventually would marry.
The new company, also based in Scotts Valley, gave him a chance to
do what he does best _ create technology in an intimate setting
where business didn't get in the way of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half years ago, a lot of people were saying life
was over for Philippe,'' says industry analyst David Coursey, a
friend of Kahn's. ``But as soon as he settled into something
smaller and development-oriented, it was only a matter of time
before something good would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few years seem to have softened Kahn, who once called
himself the ``barbarian'' of the software industry. At the peak of
his fame in the early '90s, he was known for flying his own
airplane, playing jazz flute, staging a corporate toga party and
building a $100 million headquarters for Borland.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kahn disowns the ``flamboyant'' image that has followed
him around. ``Flamboyant!'' he says derisively, pronouncing it the
French way. ``I'm a very private person. Tell my kids I'm
flamboyant and they always laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kahn has maintained a low profile at Starfish, which has
just 100 employees. It kept its technology under wraps until it was
ready for market. ``It took us three years before Rex came out,''
he says, adding, ``Why would you want any publicity before you
build the technology?''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn has dubbed Rex, which was introduced last year, as the
first ``wearable computer.'' Manufactured by Citizen and marketed
by Franklin Electronics, it sells for for $180 (including a docking
cradle for a PC).
</P>
<P>
   The key technology in Rex _ the Starfish part that Motorola
coveted _ lets the device link up with other wireless devices such
as pagers and portable computers. It has the potential to turn cell
phones into smart phones that can store addresses, appointments and
other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kahn has scrupulously avoided any technology that would put
Starfish in competition with Microsoft, having learned at Borland
that it's tough to beat Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kahn blames much of Borland's troubles on Microsoft,
whose spreadsheet and database software grabbed market share from
Borland products, including Quattro Pro and Paradox.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, people said the Borland guys were crazy, they
didn't know what they were doing, they were idiots,'' Kahn recalls.
``But what we've seen is that Microsoft became the Muhammad Ali of
the industry. A lot of great boxers lost to Ali, but that didn't
make them crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn says he has no plans to leave Starfish after Motorola takes
charge. ``Part of my mission is to help them pass all the
competition and be the market leader for digital wireless phones
and pagers,'' he says. ``And I really believe it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Coursey thinks Kahn will stay ``for a decent period of time. But
he adds, ``Something makes me think this is not Philippe's last
company.''
</P>
<P>

SORENSTAM AIMS TO PUSH PAK OFF SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ Coming into the JAL Big Apple Classic,
which begins here on Thursday, Annika Sorenstam has found out what
a difference two weeks can make on the Ladies Professional Golf
Association tour.
</P>
<P>
   After winning her second tournament in a row in Absecon, N.J.,
late last month, Sorenstam was not only the leading money winner on
the LPGA tour but she was also acknowledged as the circuit's best
player. That was understandable because she had finished in the
top-10 in 10 of the 11 tournaments she had played in.
</P>
<P>
   But then Sorenstam, a Swede who has won 14 titles during her
five years on the LPGA tour, finished in a tie for 41st in the U.S.
Women's Open _ which she had won in 1995 and 1996 _ and skipped
last week's Jamie Farr Kroger Classic in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Se Ri Pak of South Korea won the Open and the Ohio
event, where she shot a 10-under-par 61 to break the LPGA record
for a tournament round and finished at a record-tying 23 under par.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Pak, a 20-year-old rookie, has pushed the 27-year-old
Swede out of the spotlight. But Sorenstam will have an opportunity
to get back on track this weekend at the JAL Big Apple, in which
she finished second to Michele Redman last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-hole tournament at the century-old Wykagyl Country Club
offers $775,000 in prize money, of which $116,250 will go to the
winner. The 144-player field includes 41-year-old Nancy Lopez, the
Hall of Famer and winner of 48 titles, who will be paired with Pak
during the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Se Ri will play very well here,'' said Lopez, who won nine
tournaments during her rookie year in 1978, the third of five
consecutive events being the Golden Lights Championship here at
Wykagyl. ``She's a good putter and she's aggressive, and that's
what it takes to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez did not eliminate herself or Sorenstam as contenders in
the JAL. Sorenstam said Wednesday: ``Now that I'm married, I've
taken a new approach and taken more time off between tournaments. I
water ski and have a lot of other interests now, including my two
cats. And I feel refreshed when I come back.''
</P>
<P>
   That formula seems to have worked well, even though Sorenstam
has been overtaken on the prize money list by Pak and Donna
Andrews, both of whom have played in 16 tournaments compared with
12 for Sorenstam, the fewest for any player in the top-25.
</P>
<P>
   But Pak's presence has dominated the pretournament conversation
and speculation. ``What she's done is incredible,'' Sorenstam said
of Pak's astonishing recent performances _ a triumph in the U.S.
Open and an earlier victory in the McDonald's LPGA Championships,
two of the four majors on the women's circuit. ``And I'm glad for
her because we need new faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez missed the cut in her last three tournaments. Last year,
she won one event and finished second in the Women's Open. She said
she was ``very excited'' about being paired with Pak for this
event.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was asked if she thought Pak would be under pressure
playing with her. ``I don't think so, not the way she's playing,''
said Lopez, who has had two top-10 finishes in 13 tournaments this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, Lopez and Sorenstam are far and away the biggest names in
the JAL Big Apple. The tournament usually draws most of the world's
top players. But this year, only four of the top-10 money winners
and 10 of the top 15 over all are entered.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ritts, the LPGA commissioner, said he was satisfied with the
field and added, ``We try to encourage players to come here, but
the JAL is right between the Open and the du Maurier Classic _ the
fourth and final LPGA major, which is played in Windsor, Ontario _
and some of the top players chose this week to rest.'' &QL;

A YEAR AFTER BEING FREED, 13 DEAF MEXICANS GO HOME
</HEADLINE>
   ( rm ) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
  MEXICO CITY _ As some of them raised the two-fingered sign that
means ``Hello, I'm OK,'' and as others simply looked dazed and
uncertain, 13 deaf Mexican men and women, along with four babies
born to them while they were in the United States, returned to
Mexico Wednesday for the first time since they were discovered
living in virtual slavery a year ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am very happy to be back in Mexico,'' said Alberto Vasquez
Avila, 21, using sign language that was translated by an
interpreter. Like the others, he cannot speak or hear. He wore a
white T-shirt with the initials NYC over a print of the New York
skyline and looked healthy, although tired.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans arrived at Benito Juarez International Airport on a
commercial flight from Newark that dropped them off at a government
hangar early this afternoon. There they were reunited with their
families in private, before a few of them were taken to the main
airport terminal to meet with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As their 6-month-old son, Javier, cried loudly, Vasquez Avila
and his wife, Anna Bertha, 20, told reporters that they decided to
return to Mexico because of the brutal way they were treated by the
leaders of a smuggling operation who forced them to sell trinkets
in the New York subways and beat them when they did not bring back
enough cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the United States because I wanted to work, but they
didn't help me at all,'' Vasquez Avila said, referring to the
ringleaders who controlled the lives of 50 deaf illegal immigrants
who were forced to live in two cramped apartments in Queens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many problems, many arguments,'' Vasquez Avila
said. ``We were all forced to stay in the same room and sometimes
they came in and abused my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the abuse was committed by members of the Paoletti
family, some of whom have already been convicted on various charges
connected to the exploitation of the deaf workers.
</P>
<P>
   Using the testimony of the deaf Mexicans, prosecutors in New
York brought charges against 20 of the bosses. Of those, 18 have
pleaded guilty, and two are in Mexico awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   There are still 35 deaf adults and six children remaining in New
York, as well as two more adults who will leave shortly, officials
said. The Immigration and Naturalization Service had held all the
deaf Mexicans and their children in custody since the ring was
exposed last July.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the agency agreed to allow all the Mexicans to
remain in the United States. Those who decided to remain have
applied for S-type visas, a special category that the government
uses for people who contribute significantly to criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Pinto, the Mexican consul general in New York, said all
those who returned Wednesday had made their own decisions and were
not pressured in any way. He said that besides the 17 who arrived
Wednesday, two others had asked to return to Mexico but were
waiting until the woman, who is eight months' pregnant, delivers
her baby.
</P>
<P>
   Scott A. Rosenberg, a Legal Aid lawyer who has represented the
deaf Mexicans in New York, said that many of them were afraid to
return to Mexico because they had testified against the ringleaders
and feared retaliation if they returned to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But some for whom family ties were the strongest consideration
decided to go home anyway. ``They have family, children and parents
that have not seen them in a long time,'' Rosenberg said in an
interview in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as they left the airport, the members of the Vasquez
Avila family were driven back to their home in Santa Barbara
Azcapotzalco, a poor neighborhood in the northwest section of
Mexico City, for a homecoming celebration. They have been gone
since February 1997, and their families had heard almost nothing
from them since they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a birthday party here,'' said Pedro Avila Portillo,
Anna Bertha's father, in a telephone interview from the house where
the party was going on.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the families gave the newly returned couple exactly
what they asked for, ``a big reception filled with happiness, lots
of music and Mexican tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear to Avila Portillo and others that to survive in
Mexico and keep from returning to a life of selling cheap trinkets,
his daughter and the other handicapped people who returned are
going to need the kind of training and assistance that they did not
receive before. The lack of such assistance was one reason many
left Mexico for the United States in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Elva Leonore Cardenas Miranda, a deputy director of the
Comprehensive Family Development program, known as DIF in its
Spanish initials, said that the returning deaf Mexicans, and any
others who decided to come back, would receive medical and
psychological screening from the government. They will be taught
Mexican sign language, which is different in some ways from the
signs used in the United States, and will be provided job training
to help make sure they do not end up on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all things that have been available since 1995, but
these people probably did not know about them,'' Cardenas Miranda
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Valladares, Alberto Vasquez Avila's father, did not
agree that such services had been available, a complaint of many
deaf Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was overjoyed that the Mexican government had
helped bring back his son and was willing to provide so much help
now, but he reminded the government officials that the deaf were
among the most forgotten parts of Mexican society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico really doesn't have the infrastructure with which the
deaf can develop,'' Valladares said. ``I hope that all this
experience means the government will give permanent attention to
the problem.''

EDITORIAL: FOSSELLA GOES ASTRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 16:
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vito Fossella of Staten Island got elected to Congress last
year with the help of nearly $1 million in ``soft money'' from the
Republican National Committee. Soft money flows through a loophole
in campaign finance laws that lets political parties collect
unregulated contributions from special interests. The grateful
Fossella is now eagerly assisting the Republican House leadership
in its effort to scuttle any serious campaign finance reform. The
parties want to continue raking in money from tobacco, casinos and
other industries in need of political favors, and recycling the
money into issue ads for their candidates this fall. But principled
Republicans have united with Democrats to press for a fair vote on
a campaign finance reform bill now pending before the House.
</P>
<P>
   This week Fossella successfully sponsored an amendment that
would ban campaign contributions by non-citizens who are legal
residents of the United States. The amendment was billed as a
response to scandals connected to the last presidential election,
when foreign contributors apparently used legal aliens as middlemen
in order to help the Clinton campaign. But in reality, it was
simply another ploy to undermine the campaign finance bill itself.
</P>
<P>
   Like all big contributions to political parties, those gifts
were soft money. The reform bill would ban them anyway, along with
all the funds that came Fossella's way via the same loophole. In
the unlikely event that it survived a court challenge, the only
practical consequence of his provision would be to prohibit
non-citizen legal residents, many of whom are in the process of
applying for citizenship, from making small personal contributions
to candidates they favor. Fossella's district includes many people
who are, or used to be, non-citizen residents. He ought to realize
that it is the soft money, not the legal aliens, that poses the
threat to open and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   Undesirable as it is, this provision is only a minor flaw in an
exceedingly important package of reforms. No member of Congress
should hesitate to support the bill because of the amendment. But
Fossella's constituents might be wondering why their brand-new

ONE YEAR AFTER PUBLISHER'S SLAYING, MEXICAN JOURNALISTS PLEDGE
SOLIDARITY
</HEADLINE>
 LUIS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LUIS RIO COLORADO, Sonora _ A year to the day since a
muckraking publisher was gunned down outside his newspaper, jour
nalists from around northern Mex ico converged on this crime-ridden
border town demanding that justice be served.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to continue Benjamin Flores' brand of crusading
journal ism, they also vowed to defy the risks of aggressive
coverage on the drug trade and corruption that makes reporting the
news in Mexico a dangerous profession these days.
</P>
<P>
   But even among those who con tinue the mission defiantly, there
is increased caution.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing for his safety, Jesus Blancornelas, a Tijuana publisher
ambushed in an assassination at tempt at Thanksgiving, skipped the
gathering. Back in Tijuana, his sons continue to cover the news for
Blancornelas' weekly, Zeta, under constant police and military
escorts assigned to keep them alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that in this country a journalist can't move about
freely without fear for his life,'' said Norman Navarro, a reporter
who represented the Inter-American Press Association. ``This is the
true Mexico, where journalists die for their words.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, gathering the news has become increasingly
risky in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Flores was one of three Mexican journalists slain while
Blancornelas survived a machine-gun assault that killed his body
guard. An additional five reporters were kidnapped, several were
beaten, and dozens received death threats or were slapped with puni
tive lawsuits, making it ``the worst year for attacks on the press
in Mexico in a decade,'' according to the New York-based Committee
to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have fared better this year. So far, only one has paid
for his work with his life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risk is ever-present.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Barraza, who edited La Prensa after Flores' slaying and
has since resigned to open the weekly Pulso in San Luis, says
reporters on the border are the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is one of the most dangerous zones for journalists
in Mexico,'' he said from his un marked office inside a modest
home.
</P>
<P>
   These days when Barraza and his colleagues take to the streets,
they look around before stepping into their cars and constantly
check the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are at risk, but we're meeting our mission, and we
don't plan to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation by drug traffickers has become one of the primary
threats to reporters. Both Blancornelas and Flores angered drug
lords by contin ually spotlighting the narcos' activi ties.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in press attacks also has coincided with the emergence
of a more independent press in Mexico that has become openly
critical of the government since the assassina tion of presidential
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But covering government and police corruption also can be haz
ardous.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Luis Mario Garcia, a Mexico City reporter for a
small daily paper was shot to death outside a federal police
substation while being assaulted by eight police agents. He had
been writing about the sale of federal police commander posts.
</P>
<P>
   The growing violence against journalists has led reporters
around the country to seek strength in numbers. Recently, a
national group, the Society of Journalists, was formed. Members say
they plan to respond to attacks by setting aside competition among
rival media companies to highlight coverage of individuals or
agencies targeting journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a message to the dark powers that reporters
are not alone and that the political and social costs of attacking
one of us will be very high,'' said Jorge Zepeda, editor of the
Guadalajara newspaper Publico, who will be the group's first
president.
</P>
<P>
   In San Luis on Wednesday, re porters also pledged solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have killed one of us, but they are not going to kill
us all,'' Navarro said.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Flores' death started on a somber note, with
a visit to his grave at the outskirts of town where chaotic,
burgeoning San Luis gives way to a still rural, agricultural
valley.
</P>
<P>
   There, employees from La Prensa, friends and family members
tearfully set a bountiful arrangement of roses, chrysanthemums,
daisies and carnations over the tombstone and remembered the
audacious Flo res.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a public forum to discuss his murder, they formed a
plan for action.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, they voiced dissatisfaction with the handling
of the case by the Sonora state Attor ney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Many San Luis reporters believe the man charged with the killing
is not the actual shooter and say two drug lords who planned the
murder and several accomplices remain free and are not being sought
by police.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Palafox, a state legislator who was a friend of Flores,
said he will propose that the case be turned over to the federal
government during a meeting of the Sonora state Legislature on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Palafox was among those who remembered Flores as a ``commu nity
conscience'' who voiced the fears, complaints and concerns of the
citizens in his daily column.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the journalists said they will not sit idle.
They, too, plan to form their own investigative project calling on
reporters from various news organizations to follow up on the
unanswered questions surrounding the murder. &QL;

COMMENTARY: RUSSIA FINDS NO PEACE IN BURYING ITS LAST CZAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP TAUBMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Romanovs are making a comeback of sorts in Russia these
days. For a small fee, visitors to Red Square can have their
picture taken with a lookalike of Nicholas II. Across town, a
gigantic statue of Peter the Great towers over the Moscow River. It
seems an odd monument for the city Peter abandoned in favor of a
new northern capital on the Baltic.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has always had trouble managing its history. Epochs have
vanished with the stroke of an airbrush, only to reappear decades
later. So it ought not to come as a surprise that on Friday, with
considerable anguish, Nicholas II, Russia's last Czar, will be
buried alongside his relatives in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   This long-delayed funeral is rich in bitter irony. For one
thing, the bones of Nicholas are being interred and honored when
the corpse of the man who ordered his execution, Lenin, has
overstayed its welcome in Red Square. It seems only a matter of
time before Lenin's body is removed from the mausoleum that bears
his name. The strapping honor guard that long watched over the
marble edifice with goose-step precision has already departed,
replaced by shabbily dressed policemen who stand wearily by the
locked entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the curious role of Boris Yeltsin in the
rehabilitation of the Romanovs. Long before he became president,
when he was the top Communist Party executive in his hometown of
Yekaterinburg, he ordered the destruction of the building where
Nicholas and his family were incarcerated and executed by the
Bolsheviks in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin later called the demolition of Ipatiev house a ``piece
of barbarism,'' and argued that he had had no choice but to carry
out the decision of the Politburo in Moscow. Still, it was Yeltsin
who sent the bulldozers out in the middle of the night. A small
shrine to Nicholas now stands on the vacant lot, and Yeltsin, eager
to make up for the destruction, arranged for the proper burial of
Nicholas this week.
</P>
<P>
   But he will not be in St. Petersburg to witness the event,
perhaps the most painful irony of this affair. Yeltsin dropped the
occasion from his calendar when the leaders of the Russian Orthodox
Church declined to attend the burial, ostensibly because they were
not certain the remains belong to Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   There is little dispute about the authenticity of the bones
among the forensic scientists who examined them. The real reason
for the church's absence seems to be division within the church
itself. Religious nationalists, an increasingly virulent force in
Russia, do not want anything to do with a state ceremony honoring
Nicholas. They despise Yeltsin for his Westernizing influence, and
hope to use the symbol of Nicholas and his murder to rally support
for their authoritarian views and misplaced reverence for the
imperial family. In May, religious nationalists in Yekaterinburg
staged a book-burning, an act of intolerance that understandably
unnerved many Russians but provoked little criticism from church
leaders. The nationalists hope that Nicholas will eventually be
canonized.
</P>
<P>
   So Nicholas re-enters St. Petersburg as a source of conflict,
much as he exited eight decades ago after his abdication, when the
Provisional government of Aleksandr Kerensky packed the royal
family and their servants on a train headed to Siberia and an
uncertain future. That he would remain the subject of contention is
partly attributable to the manner in which he died and the brutal
revolution in whose name he was killed. But it also testament to
the political and religious divisions that continue to torment
Russia.

 A MAN FINDS SUCCESS IN A `WOMEN'S' SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the memorable moments of television comedy: Martin
Short on ``Saturday Night Live'' as a synchronized swimmer, an
uncoordinated man with a silly fixed grin trying to crash a women's
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was funny,'' Bill May said Wednesday, ``because
I know what synchronized swimming really is. People know what he
did wasn't real and was intended to be taken as a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   May should know that better than anyone else. At 19, he is
Martin Short's character come to life, the only man competing on an
elite level in this water-ballet sport. On Sunday and Monday, in
the first days of competition in the Goodwill Games, May will swim
in the duet and team competition at a new aquatics complex in East
Meadow, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He and his duet partner, Kristina Lum, are also on the
eight-member U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized swimming traces its roots to ancient Greece, where
only men competed. In modern times, Stephane Miermont won the
French duet title in 1991 and 1992, and 85-year-old Fred Wing of
Lynn, Mass., takes part in masters competitions along with his
wife, Louise, 83.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, women have dominated, none more than Esther Williams,
whose many movies in the 1940s and '50s introduced the public to
synchronized swimming. A few years ago, when she saw May in duet
competition, she was impressed. ``You bring a new romance to this
sport,'' she said, ``and this is what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   International rules governing synchronized swimming bar men from
the Olympics and world championships. But American officials hope
that next year's Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, will add
mixed-duet competition. If that happens, they will try to have
mixed duets added to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney as a demonstration
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized swimmers often hold their breath for a minute while
keeping their heads under water. In 10th-grade biology class, May
said, he once held his breath for three and a half minutes. On
Wednesday, after a team practice at the Asphalt Green AquaCenter at
York Avenue and 91st Street, May talked about being a man in a
woman's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of support from my family and friends,'' said
May, who is 5 feet 9 inches tall and 150 pounds. ``The only thing
they say is that I'm so lucky to swim with all those women. I think
I've been received very positively. This is good for the sport
because a lot of the time it gets a bad rap. Some people don't
think it's a real sport, but it is. It takes hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   May grew up in Cicero, N.Y., near Syracuse. When he was 10, he
was in a swimming class, and his 7-year-old sister, Courtney, was
in a synchronized swimming class. Their mother would drop them off
together, and he had to sit through his sister's class before he
could swim. One day, he tried synchronized swimming and liked it,
and he switched to that.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school junior, he moved to Santa Clara, Calif., to
train with the Santa Clara Aquamaids, America's leading team. He
shares an apartment there with two teammates, Tuesday Middaugh and
Anna Kozlova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this sport because I loved it,'' he said. ``I love
the competition. I love creating new things. I love performing. It
didn't occur to me that not many men were doing it. Now I think I'm
just another member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, May was paired with Lum as a duet, and they won
the national championship this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's exciting,'' Lum said. ``Hopefully, we're starting
a new era in synchronized swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   His U.S. teammates enjoy having him on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have the strongest people, and he's one of them,''
Becky Jasontek said. ``It's different. It took a little while
getting used to, just knowing I'm swimming with a man. I've been
swimming 17 years and I've never done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carrie Barton said: ``It's great. It adds so much strength
to our sport. We're so used to change, and we want the best on our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone seems to like May, except for a few athletes who
say he is taking the berth of someone who could swim in the
Olympics. But he has heard only one person booing him. ``It was in
Tonowanda, N.Y.,'' May said. ``I was 15. I just won a competition,
and this one man in the stands booed. Then someone told me I had
just beaten his daughter.''

HERE'S THE PITCH: YANKS' STARTERS BEST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ On the nights he doesn't pitch, Orlando Hernandez sits
outside one end of the New York Yankees' dugout, his cap pulled
low, his eyes watching everything carefully, like a sheep dog
monitoring the flock. David Cone often stands in a corner of the
dugout, overseeing the mound, particularly when Hernandez pitches.
David Wells retreats to the clubhouse to watch Andy Pettitte, the
other left-handed starter, on a big-screen television.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' starting pitchers study each other and analyze
themselves to great effect. Manager Joe Torre's rotation, expected
to be the team's weakness at the season's outset, is its strength.
The Yankees' starters lead the American League in earned run
average with a 3.47 mark _ more than a run below the league median
of 4.71 _ and a 50-15 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' rotation went from good to exceptional on June 1,
about the time that Hernandez replaced Ramiro Mendoza as a starter.
Since then, the Yankees' rotation is 23-6 with a 2.60 ERA,
including seven complete games; it has allowed three or fewer runs
in 31 of the 37 games; it has allowed 72 walks and struck out 209,
a strikeout-to-walk ratio of nearly 3 to 1. Since June 1, opponents
are batting .178 with runners in scoring position against the
Yankees' starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I wasn't very happy with some of the mistakes they
were making,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach.
``But lately they've just been outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Joe Girardi said: ``They all have ability to bear down
and turn it up a notch when they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre believes his starters compete with one another, that
a good performance by Cone will spur Wells. Pettitte said that part
of his frustration in May stemmed from the fact that he seemed to
be the only starter who was losing games.
</P>
<P>
   They watch each other, learn from each other. Stottlemyre
believes that the other starters have benefited from witnessing
Hernandez's ability to read the body language of hitters. Cone says
he is amazed how Hernandez is determined to make great pitches when
he is behind in the count _ ``he's absolutely fearless'' _ and Cone
has followed suit. They have all seen how Wells thrives with his
aggressive approach of challenging hitters with fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is 13-2 over all, leading the major leagues in victories.
Since May 19, he is 8-1 with a 1.87 ERA. He has 111 strikeouts and
27 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is that he's gotten his arm strength back,''
said Torre, who did not plan on having Cone until May 1 at the
earliest after the veteran pitcher had shoulder surgery last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The additional arm strength has enabled Cone to control his
slider, the pitch that is the foundation of everything he does.
Against left-handed batters, he deploys the slider to get ahead in
the count. Against right-handed batters, Cone uses his slider as
the coup de grace, the pitch that generates strikeouts and weak
swings. His fastball is consistently clocked at 90 to 91 mph, and
once as high as 92 mph last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was younger,'' said Frank Howard, a coach with the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays after years with the Mets, ``he had great
power stuff, just electric. But he's made a complete transition to
being a very smart pitcher with good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu led the league in earned run average into the
middle of June before slumping. Interestingly, the Yankees believe
that Irabu's problems were caused by his decision to try different
arm angles and different pitches, having seen the effectiveness of
Hernandez. Irabu had taken to throwing more two-seam fastballs,
having been impressed by the movement on Mendoza's two-seamer.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was better in his first start after the All-Star break,
and he took the mound Wednesday night against the Tigers, watched
closely by his brethren. In his best start in a month, Irabu
shutout Detroit, 11-0, giving up only one extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, Pettitte was 6-5 with a 4.88 ERA, and his wife,
Laura, had just given birth to the couple's second child, in Texas;
Pettitte admitted to being bothered by his family's absence
throughout May. But he has turned around his season, winning six
straight decisions, with a 1.76 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi, who often catches Pettitte, said that the left-hander's
control is the best it has ever been. His cut fastball is chopping
at the hands of right-handed hitters, Girardi said, and his
changeup and sinker ``have never been better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said, ``I've got a lot of confidence right now.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees signed Hernandez, they thought he would be a
No. 3 or No. 4 starter, good enough to be competitive, but not
dominant. Others teams saw less in Hernandez, projecting him as a
middle reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a month into his big-league career, the Yankees
and rival executives and scouts _ having seen his vast repertory
and the intelligent manner in which he pitches _ now think the
Cuban defector has the stuff to be a front-line starter on a
first-division team, and the Yankees have him locked up to a
four-year, $6.6 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   An American League scout who saw Hernandez pitch on Monday said,
``He's the best athlete for a pitcher I've ever seen, and he's got
a much better fastball than what everybody was saying in the
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the American League's starting pitcher in the All-Star
Game, has allowed as many walks (20) as home runs, and he is 11-2,
with a chance to win 20 games for the first time in his career.
Cone and Stottlemyre both believe that Wells gained something
intangible from pitching his perfect game on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Stottlemyre suggested last week, it reinforced to Wells
just what a good pitcher he is.

 &HT;    Yusef Lateef's ``The African American Epic Suite'' debuts in
Atlanta
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- That urge to merge concepts of jazz improvisation
with the compositional structures of classical music can tend to
produce work that awkwardly bends to one form or the other without
properly serving either.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner or later, the most ambitious jazz composers take
their crack at it, and even the flawed or messy efforts of an
Ornette Coleman or Charles Mingus can generate sparks amid creative
tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African American Epic Suite'' (1993), which had its North
American premiere Wednesday night in an Atlanta Symphony Orchestra
program part of the National Black Arts Festival was, in contrast,
smooth and tidy despite its often slow-moving 45-minute length. The
subject, nothing less than the 400-year history of African-American
life from pre-slavery roots to the post-civil rights era is more
easily evoked than realistically condensed in such a setting.
(Wynton Marsalis took three hours to deal with slavery alone in
``Blood on the Fields''). As such, this four-part suite worked best
not as comprehensive saga but in moments where musical ideas most
beautifully or jarringly cohered.
</P>
<P>
   It was composed by Yusef Lateef, the 77-year-old tenor
saxophonist and educator whose multi-instrumental gifts and
investigations into African and Asian traditions marked him as a
pioneer long before ``world music'' was a voguish marketing term.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the orchestra, he was joined onstage by his
four-piece Eternal Wind ensemble (Charles Moore, Ralph Jones, Adam
Rudolph and Adam del Monte), which played an encyclopedic array of
percussion and reed instruments, touching on cultures from North
Africa to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, initially dramatic, felt somewhat routine by the
suite's final note; more stirring was Lateef's soulful outbursts on
the tenor, stark and ruggedly sculpted against the stately swell of
violins.
</P>
<P>
   Also purposeful was Charles Moore's solos on flugelhorn, which,
with the orchestral backdrop, reflected some of the chilled
grandeur of 1960s Miles Davis-Gil Evans teamings.
