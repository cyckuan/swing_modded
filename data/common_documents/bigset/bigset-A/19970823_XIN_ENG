<HEADLINE> Japan Confirms It May Send War Planes Abroad for War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese military official
confirmed to the press today that Japan's Air Self-Defense Force
may send a main battle fighter jet force equipped with F-15 jet
fighters abroad for a multinational war game and inflight
refueling training next year.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese forces can exercise all-dimensional actual combat
in the joint war game in Alaska and the United States, without the
restriction of narrow air space as in Japan, said Muragi Koji,
chief of staff of Japan's Air Self-Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The war game, which will involve U.S., British and Canadian air
forces, is held four times a year and was started by the United
States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Shimbun reported last Sunday that it will be
unprecedented for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force to participate in
a military exercise and inflight refueling training abroad.
</P>
<P>
The F-15 jet fighters, which can fly at most 4,600 kilometers
in the air without refueling, will practice inflight refueling
with U.S. refueling planes on the 7,000-kilometer-long way to
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Air Self-Defense Force started to dispatch
researchers to watch the exercise in 1992. In 1996, Japan sent
two C-130 transport planes and surface-to-air missiles to
participate in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
On June 9-20, the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force participated
in the exercise in the same scale.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Shimbun commented that as a country pursuing a
national policy of pure defense, Japan has always been strict in
sending war planes abroad.
</P>
<P>
On inflight refueling training, former Japanese Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka pointed out in 1973 that "Japan does not possess
inflight refueling planes, nor does it participate in inflight
training or exercises."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Social Party, the predecessor of the present
Social Democratic Party, then also strongly opposed inflight
refueling training, holding that "inflight refueling extends the
time combat planes can stay in the air, enhancing aviation ability
and imposing greater threat to neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
The opposition forced the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force to
remove the inflight refueling devices from its F-4 jet fighters.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Foreign Currency Reserves Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's foreign currency
reserves have risen to cover five months import over the past two
months, dealers said on today.
</P>
<P>
When the tobacco auction season opened in April, a month later
the reserves had improved to cover four months import.
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with the Zimbabwe News Agency, dealers
said five months import cover was quite sufficient bearing in
mind that the Central Bank considered four months import cover
sufficient to cope with demand.
</P>
<P>
Normally when floors opened, reserves would rise to about five
to six months' import cover, and this was expected as the season
continued.
</P>
<P>
''Now that sales for this season's tobacco have been reviewed
due to reduced yields, this is not going to have any negative
impact on foreign reserves, as four months cover has always been
enough to sustain the market,'' said one dealer.
</P>
<P>
This year's tobacco sales had been revised to 196,000 tons
from 214,000 tons due to reduced yields resulting from excessive
rains.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that at the moment there is pressure on the
exchange rate resulting in few buyers on the market, especially
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''In two months time we should expect depreciation pressure of
local currency against the U.S. Dollar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the large buying on the market by importers
early this month after news of a possible devaluation of the
local currency by five percent by the end of the year had
settled, after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe started selling hard
currency to the market.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Praises ASEAN's Role in Regional Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said today China attaches importance to the active role
played by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in
the regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement of ASEAN conforms with the development trend of
global multi-polarization and is conducive to peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region, Li Peng stated during his
talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad here today.
</P>
<P>
"China supports ASEAN for its increasing role in the region,"
Li said when referring to the relationship between China and
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He said that in recent years, the relationship between China
and ASEAN enjoyed significant improvement with the mechanism of
dialogue and cooperation in full operation, moving into a stage of
stable and increasingly matured development.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to work with ASEAN for establishing a
relationship of friendship and cooperation geared to the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that the meeting between leaders of
ASEAN and China, South Korea and Japan is a very good idea and it
is of great importance that the East Asian leaders get together to
look forward to the future and to exchange views on cooperation at
the time when the new century is approaching.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China is prepared to work closely with Malaysia for
the success of the meeting."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir thanked China for its active participation, saying
China's support is very important.
</P>
<P>
Both Li and Mahathir noted that the main feature of the current
world situation is that the world is accelerating the development
of multi-polarization, which they said is conducive to peace and
stability in the region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the days when one or two countries dominate
the world has gone forever and in such a situation, various forces
and countries in the world should strengthen consultation and
coordination for this is conducive to resist hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng agreed with Mahathir on this point.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed other regional and international
issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng invited Mahathir to visit China again at his
convenience and Mahathir expressed his thanks for the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has paid four visits to China since 1985 with the
latest one last year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Honors Famous Physicist Wu Youxun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A gathering was held in Beijing
this morning to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of a
famous Chinese physicist Prof. Wu Youxun.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Liu Huaqing, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, called on noted figures in China's scientific
and technological world to learn from Wu's patriotism and fulfill
the strategy of invigorating the country through science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wu (1897-1977) was one of the pioneers of modern physics
in China, as well as one of the founding fathers of the Chinese
Physics Society. He also served as vice-president of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wu's scientific achievements were mainly for the confirming the
theory of "Compton Effects" produced by electromagnetic radiation
in fields of x-rays and gamma rays. The theory was initiated and
developed by Dr. Arthur H. Compton, who won the Nobel Prize in
1927.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Chen Ning Yang, a Chinese-American scientist who won the
Nobel prize in physics in 1957, recalled the days when he studied
physics under Wu.
</P>
<P>
"Today's meeting has shown that the Chinese government attaches
importance to anyone who has contributed to China's scientific and
educational causes," Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dazhong, president of Qinghua University, spoke highly of
Wu's teaching style, saying that "we will try to turn Qinghua into
one of the world's top universities in the next century, and train
more first-class talents for our country."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urges More Efforts for Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
seriously looking into the possibilities of establishing a
tourism venture fund to allow more blacks to enter the lucrative
industry, a deputy minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mines, Environment and Tourism Deputy Minister Edward
Chindori-Chininga said there is potential for tourism development
in Zimbabwe which went untapped due to lack of finance and
"entrepreneurial creativity".
</P>
<P>
"My ministry has submitted proposals for such a venture fund
mechanism to a number of financial institutions which are working
with us in this effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This thinking comes as a result of the realization that the
local financial supporting environment is not friendly to the
extend that the indigenous persons in particular cannot start
business in the tourism sector and survive," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a one-day preparatory workshop for the
Southern African Development Community Regional Tourism Investors
Forum to be held in Harare from October 28-30.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public and private sector to ensure success of
the conference through logistical support.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Industry Records Sustained Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China's petroleum industry will
enjoy sustainable growth with the maximum annual oil production
probably reaching 200 million tons by the year 2010, according to
a senior Chinese oil official.
</P>
<P>
After 40 years of development, China now produces an annual oil
output of 157 million tons, retaining the status of the world's
fifth-largest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
The official told a press conference here today that China's
has achieved great success in "stabilizing the East while
developing the West and offshore" oil resources.
</P>
<P>
China has built 350 oilfields and 110 gasfields. It has also
set up 24 oil and gas producing bases including Daqing, Shengli,
Liaohe, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Dagang, Bohai, East South China Sea,
West South China Sea, and basically formed four major oil and
three major gas producing regions.
</P>
<P>
Among these, the oil output of Songliao region in 1996
accounted for 38 percent of the national total, contributing
greatly to the growth of the national economy. The production of
Bohai Bay in 1996 shared 36.9 percent of the national oil
output. Xinjiang produced 14.3 million tons of crude oil last
year, making up 9.1 percent of the national total. The offshore
production reached 15 million tons, accounting for 9.5 percent of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to oil experts, the annual oil output of east China
will stay at around 110 million tons in 2010. The annual oil
output of 53 million tons at Daqing Oilfield will be maintained
until 2010.
</P>
<P>
The exploration will be further accelerated in the west and the
oil output may reach 40-50 million tons in 2010. Offshore oil
production is estimated at 10 million tons or more by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Up to late 1996, the total onshore areas open to foreign
companies reached 2.5 million sq km and 30 petroleum contracts
were signed with 35 foreign companies, involving a total of 770
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 offshore contracts have been signed with a
foreign capital of about three billion US dollars, which amounts
to 58 percent of the total investment of offshore oil exploration
and development for that period.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Concerned With Deadlock in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
Commissioner for External Relations, Hans Van den Broek, expressed
deep concern today with the deadlock of the peace process in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the second round of U.N.-led direct talks
last week in Switzerland, Van den Broek said that the precondition
set by the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, implying the
freezing of an EU decision to start accession negotiations with
Cyprus in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable", he was quoted as saying in a statement
following a report to the U.N. Security Council by
U.N. Secretary-General's Special Advisor on Cyprus, Diego
Cordovez, according to Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He reconfirmed that accession negotiations would be launched
by beginning of next year, as agreed by the EU in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner, who is responsible for relations with Cyprus
and Turkey, also criticized the signing of an "association
agreement" between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime as not
being conducive to creating the right negotiating climate.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed a few days before last week's five-day
direct talks between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Denktash in Switzerland, calls for the partial
integration of the Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus with Turkey
if the EU accession negotiations go ahead with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot communities' leaders held first round of
face-to-face negotiations in the U.S. in July.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek underlined that a window of opportunity now
exists to build a framework for a mediated settlement to the
protracted Cyprus problem before the start of accession talks,
noting that Cyprus' adhesion to the EU would be in the interest
of both communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that attempts to frustrate any progress, even
of a procedural nature as demonstrated last week in Switzerland,
are detrimental to the whole population of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU official recalled the recent pledge by the
Turkish government to play a constructive role in the search for a
negotiated Cyprus solution, stressing that such a role would also
favor the deepening of the relations between the EU and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek strongly urged the two parties in Cyprus to
reach an early agreement on the continuation of direct talks and
pledged the European Commission's full support for further
efforts to be undertaken by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey sent troops and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Will Hampers African Labor Integration: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
harare, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The lack of political will,
varying degrees of economic development and different labor laws
in African countries were seen as some of the major obstacles to
regional labor market integration, according to a seminar today.
</P>
<P>
The five-day Seminar on Regional Integration and Labor
Administration, which concluded here today, reached this
conclusion in its resolutions passed at the end of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, attended by more than 40 delegates from a number
of African countries, said in the resolutions, "it was realized
that there is mutual suspicion by individual countries of the
erosion of national sovereignty and inherent fear that bigger
economies stand to gain immensely at the expense of weaker
countries."
</P>
<P>
On the economic obstacles, the participants said
non-liberalization of regional trade contributed to current
limitations that made labor integration difficult.
</P>
<P>
Another problem noted by participants was multiplicity of
economic groupings advancing similar ideals which resulted in
overlapping jurisdiction and divided loyalties among members.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, however, also outlined the positive aspects of
labor integration covering economic growth and greater job
opportunities resulting in improved living standards.
</P>
<P>
It was also recommended that the African Regional Labor
Administration Center could play an important role in addressing
training needs of the labor force on how to deal with effects of
structural adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations from the workshop were expected to be
submitted to all African labor ministers.

<HEADLINE> Two Papers Shut Down in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Two leading independent
newspapers in Sierra Leone said today they are suspending their
publications with immediate effect "due to insecurity."
</P>
<P>
The two biweeklies, Standard Times and the Vision now join a
chain of nine other papers off the streets since the military
seized power on May 25.
</P>
<P>
The nine include the Punch, For Di People, the Democrat, New
Tablet, Freedom Now, Unity Now and The Sierra Leonean.
</P>
<P>
The editors claimed "harassment by security officials" as the
main cause of their decision to shut down.
</P>
<P>
The editor of Standard Times, Philip Neville said in an
interview, "I decided to suspend publication because I was
virtually haunted by fierce looking men at night. They will knock
on my door and smear paint on my windows."
</P>
<P>
Neville was beaten up three days after the coup by uniformed
men and so far nobody has been caught.
</P>
<P>
The editor of Unity Now, Frank Kposowa had to go underground
when security officials stormed his office three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Kposowa, who is the president of the Sierra Leone Association
of Journalists, only surfaced after junta officials promised he
would not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
Other journalists including the correspondent for the Voice of
America, Kelvin Lewis and BBC correspondent Victor Sylver were
briefly detained in recent weeks by the regime without
explanation.
</P>
<P>
Many journalists have fled to neighboring Guinea and Gambia.
Over 30 Sierra Leonean journalists in Guinea have now formed the
Sierra Leone Journalist Association in exile.
</P>
<P>
Only eight out of the 52 newspapers existing under the
civilian government continue to publish. They include the
government-owned Daily Mail, Expo Times, both with strong
leanings to the junta, and independent publications like Concord
Times, the Point, The Pool, Torchlight, Herald Guardian and We
Yone.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner of Information and Broadcasting, Sedu Turay
said the editors are just blaming the government for their own
shortcomings. Journalists must keep in mind they should know that
they should be responsible for what they are reporting.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Tutsi Refugees Killed in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 107 refugees have been
massacred and 30 others wounded in a raid on a camp housing
ethnic Tutsis from former Zaire in Gisenyi, a town at Rwanda's
northwestern border, the U.N. refugee agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Pamela O'toole, spokeswoman of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNCHR) said preliminary reports showed that the ethnic
Tutsis, who fled fighting in the Masisi region of the former
Zaire, were slaughtered with machetes by unidentified attackers
late on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"This is shocking and extremely worrying," O'toole said.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan government officials put the death toll higher at 120
including local civilians in the area, she said.
</P>
<P>
O'toole said the massacre at Mudende camp near the border town
of gisenyi, was reported to the UNCHR by Adventist Relief, an aid
agency working in the camp in the early hours today.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 remaining ethnic Tutsi refugees fled the camp after
the attack, she said.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said Rwandan troops today began a hot-pursuit of
rebels in the mountainous region, where more than 2,000 Hutus
have been killed by the army in recent months in
cordon-and-search operations, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The attack is the latest in the bloody ethnic Hutu-Tutsi war
in Africa's troubled Great Lakes region, which aid officials say
is far from over.
</P>
<P>
Hutus, the majority tribe in Rwanda, massacred more than half
a million minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates in 1994. Many fled
to Zaire, now renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo, when the
Hutu government was toppled after minority Tutsis swept to power.
</P>
<P>
The victims were part of some 15,000 ethnic Tutsis from the
Masisi region who returned to Rwanda in 1995 and 1996 because of
fighting between Hutus and Tutsis as well as other indigenous
local tribes in the hilly area.

<HEADLINE> Feature Film to Be Shot in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A feature film of "To Walk With
The Lions" will be shot in Nairobi and the Shabba Game Reserve in
Kenya at a cost of 10 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The film is based on the story of the late George Adamson who
dedicated his whole life to the conservation of wildlife in the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
John Buchanan, executive producer of the film to be produced
by Canadian Kingsborough Greenlight Pictures Inc., was quoted as
saying that his company intended to import tame lions for the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a bill would soon be tabled in Kenya's
parliament in order to promote film-making industry in the
country.
</P>
<P>
If the bill passed, Kenya would establish a film commission
which is designed to promote Kenya as a film-making destination.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Information and Broadcasting Minister Johnstone Makau
said Kenya had taken various measures to make Kenya an attractive
film location when he received Buchanan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These measures include reduction of duty on filming equipment,
easing immigration regulations for artists and processing
application within a week.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that if the film-making industry in Kenya
boomed, the tourism industry, the biggest foreign exchange earner
of the country, will be the immediate beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
He said that the film "Out Of Africa" had led to a boom in the
tourism industry in the mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG to Check Armed Robbery in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, said today it had intensified
security patrols in and around the capital Monrovia to check the
menace of armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOMOG force commander Major-general Victor Malu,
this is part of the efforts his troops have perfected in
conjunction with other security agencies to combat the robbery
menace.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the new measures would soon start to yield
positive results.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, Malu was trying to
allay the fears of Liberians over the persistent reports of armed
robbery incidents, which he said was being exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to Liberians, especially the residents of
Monrovia, to assist the efforts of the security agencies to
tackle the rising wave of crimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
To maintain security is one of the most crucial tasks for
Liberia's new government in the course of national reconstruction
after seven years of bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
The first bill signed into law by President Charles Taylor
charges ECOMOG, which has helped bring the country back into
normalcy, with the responsibility to maintain security.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in Abuja, Nigeria, by Liberia's
factional leaders a year ago, ECOMOG will help restructure the
Liberian army and police force in six months after the new
government was installed on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The stay of ECOMOG, however, may be extended because the
training of the forces has not begun.
</P>
<P>
The summit of west African leaders coming next Thursday is
expected to make decision on the forces' stay in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Speaker Meets U.S. Congressmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis today met with a visiting U.S. Congressmen
delegation on issues of Greek-Turkish relations and developments
in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their talks, Robert Menendez, who
is heading a delegation of members of the House of
Representatives' Foreign Relations Committee, expressed concern
over the Cyprus problem and the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"we are concerned with the tensions in the Aegean and the
Cyprus issue, and are seeking a just and viable solution to the
Cyprus problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Greece was "a very important ally" of the
U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thomas Niles, U.S. ambassador to Greece, said later
that the process which began in Madrid was alive and Washington
believed that progress would continue.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S. had "a clear commitment" and would
work for a settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In July, Greece and Turkey signed a joint communique on the
sideline of the NATO summit meeting in Madrid, Spain, signaling
the start of the process in which the two countries try to better
their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
But recently, the signing of a partial integration pact between
Turkey and northern Cyprus as well as the failure of the second
round of direct talks between Cyprus' Greek and Turkish
communities have shadowed the process.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Demonstrators Protest Closure of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Around 2,000 demonstrators
gathered today at Beyazit Mosque in Istanbul, the largest city
of Turkey, to protest closure of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that the
demonstrators launched the protest following their Friday prayer
service, chanting anti-government slogans such as "The Islamic
development can not be prevented."
</P>
<P>
The conservative Islamists rally every Friday around mosques,
especially in Istanbul, since the Turkey government headed by
Mesut Yilmaz initiated the controversial eight-year compulsory
education reform bill on August 17.
</P>
<P>
They were enraged by the adoption of the bill in the
Parliament, which is believed to be a heavy blow to the
fundamentalists in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The authorities sent a large number of policemen to disperse
the demonstrators, but no clashes took place.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Murat Baseskioglu said Thursday that
evidence collected by his ministry shows that radical Islamic
groups are behind the recent regular Friday rallies to protest
the education reform plan, according to early reports.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Interior Ministry was determined to stop
such illegal demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Yilmaz government initiated the
education law in order to curb the further expansion of the
fundamentalists in the secular country.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, students have to finish eight years of
elementary education before they are permitted to start
religious studies. The law led to the closure of many religious
schools in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in Northern Brazzaville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Troops loyal to Congolese
President Pascal Lissouba have intensified attacks on the central
and northern parts of Brazzaville held by the militiamen of
former president Sassou Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
Congo's government radio reported today that several
rival-held districts in the capital have fallen to Lissouba's
soldiers, which Sassou has dismissed the claim as a lie.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Sassou's home is said to be stricken by
shells.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the government radio claimed that
Lissouba's forces had located Sassou's hideout in the capital and
warned that he can either surrender or get himself killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has denied reports of the fallen
Ouesso - the largest northern city in the country to Sassou's
supporters. Sassou insists that he still holds it.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have died since fighting broke out in
Brazzaville between forces loyal to President Lissouba and the
rival militia of former president Sassou.
</P>
<P>
Sassou has accused Lissouba of looking for every means to
maintain in power. Lissouba has denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> China's Role Key in Global Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China has made considerable
contributions to and played a "cooperative and productive role"
in world environmental affairs, said U.N. Environmental Program
(UNEP) Executive Director Elizabeth Dowdeswell today.
</P>
<P>
"China is involved in making contribution in almost every
global issue, such as ozone protection, or climate change... At
all major international, global environmental discussions, China
is there," she said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China's reaction to key challenges facing the earth such as
ozone reduction and climate change is particularly important for
the whole world, said Dowdeswell, who has visited China almost
once a year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
China is always ready and willing to share experience and
information with other countries on environmental issues, she
said, adding China is the most supportive nation for
Nairobi-based UNEP, the sole U.N. body with headquarters in the
third world.
</P>
<P>
Dowdeswell also spoke highly of the Chinese government for its
great efforts to draft and implement environmental laws and
spread environmental protection knowledge around the country
through education systems and mass media.
</P>
<P>
"The (Chinese) government is on the right track. I think it is
taking environment issues very seriously," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last ten years, China has been most successful in
ensuring that environmental protection is built into governmental
policy-making... at the highest-level," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said that China faces a main challenge to
maintain rapid economic growth and sound environment at the same
time since it holds a huge population.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Smoking Causes Permanent Higher Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Long-term smoking triggers a
biological switch, encouraging both healthy and mutated lung cells
to multiply -- permanently increasing the odds of developing
cancer, a new study said.
</P>
<P>
The study, released by the University of Pittsburgh, was
published in the August issue of the Journal of Respiratory and
Critical Care Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Once this switch is turned on, it appears to be permanent,
which may explain in part why long-term ex-smokers who have not
had a cigarette in over 25 years are still at high risk for
getting lung cancer," said Dr. Jill Siegfried, who directed the
study.
</P>
<P>
Researchers define as heavy smokers those who smoke the
equivalent of one pack a day for 25 years or two packs a day for
12 years.
</P>
<P>
An abnormal protein was found on the surface of lung cells from
the heavy smokers. The protein attracts a type of hormone that
stimulates cells to divide.
</P>
<P>
Siegfried said that the more cell growth you have, the greater
the chance that one of those mutated cells will be the one that
grows.
</P>
<P>
In the light smokers, the harmful protein was not found, but
Siegfried said a larger survey would be needed to determine when
irreversible damage sets in.
</P>
<P>
Many smokers mistakenly believe that when they stop, their
lungs will eventually become healthy again, Dr. Frank Cuttitta, of
the National Cancer Institute, was quoted as saying. The new study
shows why that doesn't happen, he added.

<HEADLINE> White House Shifts Position on White Teacher's Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The White House told the
Supreme Court today that a white teacher was dismissed illegally
by a New Jersey school board seeking to promote racial diversity
by keeping an equally qualified black instructor.
</P>
<P>
But in a legal brief, the administration maintained its support
for the principle that affirmative action can be used to attain
racial diversity as well as to remedy past bias, as long as the
diversity serves a narrowly tailored compelling interest.
</P>
<P>
The brief argues that the board did not show a need for racial
diversity in a part of its faculty, the business education
department, particularly since its overall faculty was racially
diverse.
</P>
<P>
News reports quoted White House spokesman Barry Toiv as saying
from where President Bill Clinton is vacationing outside
Washington, "We think this case ought to be decided on narrow
grounds and the facts of the case and should not be used for
affirmative action."
</P>
<P>
But the brief said that if the court looks at the larger
question, then it should rule that an appeals court erred in
ruling that affirmative action could only be used to remedy past
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The brief represents the third position taken by the government
during the Bush and Clinton administrations.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration initially opposed the school board. In
1994 during President Clinton's first term, the government
switched sides and backed the school board.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Clinton administration completed a long process of
backing off that position while still arguing that affirmative
action can be used to promote racial diversity so long as it
provides demonstrable benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration in June, apparently fearing the
Supreme Court would use the New Jersey reverse-bias case to
further restrict affirmative action, unsuccessfully urged the
justices to steer clear of the case altogether. That would have
let stand a lower court ruling against the school board.
</P>
<P>
The dispute dates back to the school board's 1989 decision to
abolish one teaching position in Piscataway High School's business
education department.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey law requires that tenured teachers be laid off in
reverse order of seniority, but two teachers -- Sharon Taxman and
Debra Williams -- had been hired on the same day nine years
earlier. The school board laid off Taxman, who is white, saying
that Williams, who is black, was the only minority teacher in the
10-teacher department.
</P>
<P>
Taxman filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and the Justice Department in President Bush's
administration, argued for her and against the school board,
saying her dismissal was an unlawful act of reverse
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge agreed with her assertion that her dismissal
violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act. When the school board
appealed, the Clinton administration reversed the Bush
administration's stance, and directed Justice Department lawyers
to defend the school board.
</P>
<P>
After the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1996 also agreed
with Taxman, the Clinton administration decided to abandon the
court fight. But when the Supreme Court decided in June to take
the case, the administration left open the possibility it might
file a brief.
</P>
<P>
The court is expected to hear the case in its 1997-98 term
beginning this fall and is expected to render a decision next
year.

<HEADLINE> IMF Disburses 21 Billion CFA Francs to Cameroun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has disbursed 21 billion CFA Francs (nearly 40 million U.S.
Dollars) to the government of Cameroun to finance its three-year
economic financial and social program, Radio Cameroun reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken on Wednesday night in Washington by the
IMF Board of Directors after signing the fifth standby accord of
economic cooperation with Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
According to Jean Gaukou, a senior official from the Ministry
of Economy and Finance of Cameroun, this fifth standby accord
goes a long way to re-establish Cameroun's credibility with the
international financial institutions and places Cameroun in a
better position to settle its debts.
</P>
<P>
The fifth standby accord is a financial aid mechanism between
the IMF and Cameroun, a loan scheme which seeks to prop economic
reform programs, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The accord is accompanied by a three-year middle term
financial and economic program which will take the nation into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The program is based on a policy to promote a minimum annual
economic growth rate of 5 percent, contain inflation between 2 to
3 percent, and reduce poverty in the country, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The program also aims at promoting social and economic welfare
by the creation of jobs, human and infrastructural development,
restructuring of the banking and the public sectors, improvement
of the institutional environment, and promotion of public and
private investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese-Tanzanian
Joint Shipping Company (SINOTASHIP) held a ceremony here this
evening to mark the company's 30th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Among over 100 guests invited to the ceremony were Chinese
Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong and Tanzanian Minister
for Communications and Transport William Kusila.
</P>
<P>
In their toasts, the two ministers reviewed the achievements
SINOTASHIP has achieved in the past 30 years and expressed the
wish that the company will make further progress which will
benefit developments in both Tanzania and China.
</P>
<P>
SINOTASHIP was found as a joint Chinese-Tanzanian venture by
the Chinese and Tanzanian governments on June 22, 1967 at the
initiative of former President Junius Nyerere of Tanzania and the
late Premier Zhou Enlai of China.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is based on the principles of friendship,
cooperation, equality and mutual benefit. The main objective of
SINOTASHIP was and still is to provide a maritime transportation
service for the trade between China and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the company's vessels had carried
4.42 million tons of cargo, mostly imports and exports between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ever since its formation in 1967, SINOTASHIP has made profits
totaling more than 21 million U.S. Dollars from shipping
operations.

<HEADLINE> Korean Motor Plant Under Construction in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Korea-designed Hyundai
motor company is under construction in Gaborone, Botswana, the
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 51.06 million U.S. Dollar car assembly plant is planned to
start full operation in April next year, 18 months ahead of
original schedule. The pilot production would begin in January,
informed sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plant will have an initial capacity of 30,000 vehicles a
year. Production of 40,000 vehicles per annum is an early target,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning for 30,000 units for export to South Africa
and 10,000 for the rest of the region," Director of the plant
Billy Rautenbach told a press conference in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
The production of Hyundai Botswana has steadily grown from 200
cars a month in 1993 to 2,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"From 1994, motor vehicle exports became Botwana's second
largest foregin exchange earner after diamonds," Minister of
Commerce and Industry George Kgoroba said.
</P>
<P>
"The plant has significantly contributed to the growth of our
economy and our policy of economic diversification."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Botswana's total exports to South Africa were worth
351 million U.S. Dollars, of which motor vehicles accounted for
262 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year Botswana's total exports were up to 411 million U.S.
Dollars, and motor vehicles exports were 311 million U.S. Dollars
with 63 percent of motor exports being Hyundai.

<HEADLINE> VAT System Also to Be Introduced in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Value Added Tax (VAT)
will also be introduced in Zanzibar, Tanzanian Minister for
Finance Daniel Yona told the National Assembly in Dodoma in
central Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Winding up a debate on the VAT Bill shortly before it was
endorsed by the house, Yona said that the Isles government has
agreed to adopt the TAX.
</P>
<P>
"The Isles government has in principle agreed to adopt VAT and
the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) will provide the necessary
technical assistance in preparations for the scheme," Yona said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister, however, said that VAT was not a union
matter, thus the TAX would be applied in accordance with Zanzibar
laws.
</P>
<P>
He said VAT would have a single tariff fixed at 20 percent and
would be imposed on traders with an annual turn of over 20
million Tanzanian Shillings (about 33,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The minister said initially about 10,000 such traders were
expected to be registered in the Mainland.
</P>
<P>
The VAT will be introduced in the Mainland July 1, 1998.

<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Timea Nagy of Hungary won
her country the first gold medal at the 19th World University Games
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nagy beat her Russian rival Karina Aznavourian 15-13 in the final
to win the title of the women's individual epee, the second gold of
the Universiade fencing tournament.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, twice world champion Samuel Tucker of Cuba took the
men's individual foil title.
</P>
<P>
World fencing powerhouse Italy failed for the second consecutive
day to win a medal in fencing tournament.
</P>
<P>
The final was an exciting one with Nagy a slight better than her
opponent. But Aznavourian never gave up and put up some brilliant
performances.
</P>
<P>
Victoria Titova of Ukraine and Barbara Ciszewska of Poland shared
the bronze medal after losing to Nagy and Aznavourian in the
semi-finals respectively.
</P>
<P>
Monkia Maciewska of Poland finished fifth, followed by Yang Shaoqi
of China in the sixth place.
</P>
<P>
Guo Ying, coach of the Chinese fencing team, said that he was
satisfied with the performance of Yang Shaoqi.
</P>
<P>
"Yang Shaoqi did good today. Her problem is that she is not strong
enough and can not follow the pace of her opponent." Guo Ying said.
</P>
<P>
The level of the women's individual epee competitions is very high
as the gold medalist and runner-up of last month's world championships
at Cape Town were all eliminated before the quarter-finals.

<HEADLINE> US Banks Tighten Standards for Consumer Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks in the U.S.
continue to tighten standards for consumer loans, a survey by the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) said today.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also showed that the pace of the tightening is
slowing down, suggesting that many banks believe they have
achieved sufficient protection against defaults.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's quarterly survey found that less than 25 percent of
the banks had tightened standards for credit card applications and
less than 10 percent had more stringent rules for other consumer
loans. Only 25 percent had lower borrowing limits on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
"The August survey was the seventh in a row that found a
tightening in standards for loans to households," the survey of
senior loan officers at 54 domestic and 21 foreign banks said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that increased competition for business
credit apparently led many banks to ease terms on commercial and
industrial and commercial real estate loans.
</P>
<P>
The Fed added that a small but significant share of banks
reported easing standards on commercial real estate loans.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these tighter standards and terms, about 10 percent of
the banks, on net, said that their willingness to make consumer
installment loans had increased over the past three months," the
Fed said. It was the largest increase since the May 1995 survey.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
telephoned Jordan's King Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, asking them to persuade Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat to crack down on terrorism, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed on the phone Friday that the Palestinian
leader was not keeping his commitment to fight terrorism and this
was jeopardizing the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks coincided with a prevailing sense of
discontent in Israeli officials at Arafat's convening of
"national unity" conclaves with Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) and Islamic Jihad leaders early this week in Gaza and
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI -- The Burundi government said today it only wants
peace talks put off for two weeks or less after organizers
cancelled their Monday opening when asked for a postponement, a
report from the Burundi capital said.
</P>
<P>
Bujumbura is trying to contact international mediator and
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere to ask for a new date
for the talks, Institutional Reform Minister Eugene Nindorera was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be postponed for a small time only but Nyerere
might be very angry and he might take some severe decisions. We
are going to try to convince him that the delay is just for a few
days, two weeks probably, or less," he said.
</P>
<P>
MOGADISHU -- Heavy fighting reportedly broke out between rival
factions in the western town of Baidoa Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Reports from field radios close to the town said at least one
hundred heavily armed militiamen from the Rahanwein Resistance
Army (RRA) attacked the town from the southern end and crushed the
main checkpoint, making their way through the center of the town,
245 km west of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the area said the RRA guerrilla fighters have
bitterly fought with the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid at a
place known as the presidential palace inside Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Heavy looting also took place during the fighting which lasted
a few hours. The reports added that the RRA fighters were also
involved in ransacking several business stalls. Two communication
field radios (VHF) were also taken away by the RRA forces.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan People Have Final Say on Tibet Issue: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tibetan official in an
interview with Xinhua reporters today commented critical remarks
made by a US congressman who recently traveled to Tibet in the
guise of a tourist.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, chairman of the People's Congress of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, said Frank Wolf, a Republican congressman
from the state of Virginia, traveled to Tibet with ulterior
motives and spread irresponsible remarks intended to upset and
confuse the international community.
</P>
<P>
"All people with a sense of justice, including the Tibetan
people, are enraged by his actions," Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
Raidi spoke out after Wolf's secretive tour of Tibet, which he
followed up with a widely-covered new conference in the United
States on August 20.
</P>
<P>
"Who has the final say on the Tibetan issue?" Raidi
queried. "The Tibetan people, who have witnessed the profound
changes that have occurred in Tibet in the past four decades, are
the most qualified."
</P>
<P>
He said that Tibet before the democratic reform in 1959 was a
serf society which combined political and religious powers.
</P>
<P>
"Though only made up of the five percent of the Tibetan
population, the three categories of manorial lords, the former Tibet
local government, the monasteries and the nobility together ruled
Tibet and owned all the farmland, grassland and forests, as well
as the majority of livestock and production materials," Raidi
said. "The serfs, the overwhelming majority of the people, had no
political rights or personal freedom at all."
</P>
<P>
Tibet was liberated in 1951 and carried out a democratic reform
in 1959. "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China,
Tibet experienced the most profound changes in its history during
the past 40 years, particularly after the democratic reform,"
Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
"The former serfs now are the masters of their own destiny. The
economy and culture have steadily developed and the living
standard of the people has kept improving," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan People Have Final Say on Tibet Issue: Official (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Wolf's remark that "China is swallowing Tibet,"
Raidi said that Wolf had lacked "the most basic common sense."
</P>
<P>
"Tibet has been an inseparable part of the Chinese territory
since after the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the central government after 1959 has
motivated the whole country to support Tibet, which "registered
the fastest social-economic development in its history."
</P>
<P>
He quoted latest statistics to elaborate: The gross domestic
product in Tibet totaled 6.476 billion yuan in 1996, "posting
double-digit growth for successive years," he noted; the grain
output last year hit 775,000 tons, registering the ninth bumper
harvest in the past years; the foreign trade volume in 1996
reached more than 100 million US dollars; and the annual net
income of farmers and herdsmen hit 975 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Now Tibet is witnessing a growing economy, stable political
situation, ethnic solidarity and improved living standards," he
said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, in Lhasa, the regional capital, the city
proper has expanded from only three square kilometers in 1951 to
the current area of more than 50.
</P>
<P>
"Wolf said that he saw 'more Chinese in Lhasa than Tibetans.'
This can only reveal his ignorance or show his ulterior motives,"
Raidi said. "In fact, the Han nationals only account for three
percent of Tibet's total population," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that more Tibetans are now wearing
Western-style suits in public, finding such clothing more
practical and often necessary for their frequent exchanges with
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Even though the central government sent cadres and technicians
to Tibet for the purpose of advancing economic development, these
people return to the inland areas after their term of service,
according to Raidi.
</P>
<P>
"In this year alone, some 2,000 returned to their hometowns,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Russian, Finnish Premiers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and his Finnish counterpart Paavo Lipponen met today
in Russia's northwestern republic of Karelia, which is bounded by
Finland, said a report from the republic's town of Kostomuksha.
</P>
<P>
Russia greatly appreciates Finland's stance on dealing with
many European political issues including enlargement of NATO and
the European Union, Chernomyrdin said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Russian premier said he hoped that Finland could play a
role in solving the problem of the status of Russian-speaking
people in the Baltic states through its special ties with Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin hopes to "open more border passages" between the
two countries to promote development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
A check point with 10 lanes was recently opened on the
Russian-Finnish border. It is capable of handling 500 vehicles
and 1,500 passengers a day, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Another check point is scheduled to be opened on the
Russian-Finnish border during the first half of 1998, said Anatoly
Kruglov, chairman of the Russian State Customs Committee, who is
accompanying Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, who arrived at Kostomuksha on Friday, said he was
satisfied with both economic and political talks with
Chernomyrdin.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Breaks out between Somali Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting reportedly
broke out between rival factions in the western town of Baidoa
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Reports from field radios close to the town said at least one
hundred heavily armed militiamen from the Rahanwein Resistance
Army (RRA) attacked the town from the southern end and crushed
the main checkpoint, making their way through the center of the
town, 245 km west of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the area said the RRA guerrilla fighters have
bitterly fought with the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid at a
place known as the presidential palace inside Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Heavy looting also took place during the fighting which lasted
a few hours. The reports added that the RRA fighters were also
involved in ransacking several business stalls. Two
communication field radios (VHF) were also taken away by the RRA
forces.
</P>
<P>
There has been no clear picture about the casualty figures of
the fighting as all Baidoa radios were out of the air today.
However, the death of one person were confirmed, but the death
toll is believed to be much higher according to travellers
reaching Mogadishu today.
</P>
<P>
RRA spokesman Mohamud Ali Aden Qalinle in north Mogadishu told
the press that his forces have captured two technical battle
vehicles and a civilian car belonging to Hussein Aidid's men in
their operation last night.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle admitted that his forces have withdrawn from the town
early in the morning for what he described as a military tactic,
which he said was a complete success.
</P>
<P>
RRA have furthermore claimed to have released dozens of
prisoners from the central prison in the town.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle said his men who were involved in last night's attack
are currently stationed eight kilometers south of the town ready
to mount more attacks on target areas controlled by Hussein Aidid
in the region.
</P>
<P>
There's no word yet from Hussein Aidid's side over the
fighting in Baidoa which they controlled for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
The RRA hit and run attacks in Bay and Bakol regions have been
increasing ever since the Ethiopian forces supported by the
militiamen from the Somali National Front faction invaded the
border region of Gedo.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians are suspected to be equipping the RRA with
small arms, ammunition and other logistics in their campaign
against Hussein Aidid's faction.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Arts Being Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Folk Arts Research
Institute has recovered and saved many Tibetan art forms in its
efforts to compile ten books covering folk songs, dance, music and
literature.
</P>
<P>
All the books will come before the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The 800,000-word "Collection of Tibetan Operas," published in
1996, provides information on the origins, schools and performance
troupes of all kinds of Tibetan operas.
</P>
<P>
Two collections will come out this year, one about folk dancing
and another on Quyi (Chinese folk art forms).
</P>
<P>
The institute, with the help of the central and regional
governments, has collected large quantities of material on Tibetan
folk arts, including 560-hours of tape recordings and about 600
hours of videotape, at least 8,000 pictures, and more than ten
million characters of written material, according to Tendzin
Cering, head of the institute.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is unusual, both at home and abroad, to
organize such a large-scale operation to save a local culture.
</P>
<P>
New art forms have been discovered during the survey, among
them is a dance called "Xian" from the Zhang-zhung Culture in the
northwest part of the region. Performances of this rare dance have
been highly praised by world experts.
</P>
<P>
The culture of monasteries, which are the dominant feature of
Tibetan life, has affected most art forms in the region, from
architecture and murals to music and dance. Some ancient religious
rites have also been resumed, like the devil's dance performed by
lamas at the Temple Zhaxi Lhunbo to exorcise evil spirits.

<HEADLINE> Moi Visits Coast Where Killing Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) - Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi
today is touring Indian Ocean coastal region where bloodshed
violence entered the 11th day with death toll having hit an
estimated 45.
</P>
<P>
Two more people, who has sought refuge in Likoni Catholic
church in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city and key port, were
shot dead Friday morning by about 20 well-armed raiders with a
police officer seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
So far nobody knows where are the killers from, needless to
say their motives.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73 and in power since 1978, last night flew into Mombasa,
under heavy security.
</P>
<P>
He said here Friday that the police are under instructions to
arrest anyone who incites violence, saying he was saddened by the
killings on the coast.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic violence erupted in the normally peaceful tourist
resort of Mombasa on August 13 and has spread to the northern and
southern coastal towns including Malindi, Kwale, Kilifi and Taita
Taveta.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, opposition leaders accused ruling Kenya
African National Union (KANU) of exploiting ethnic tensions and
dodging constitutional reforms ahead of multi-party elections
which Moi must call this year.
</P>
<P>
But Moi dismissed the allegations and said Friday the
constitution of the country is sacred and only through parliament
that the constitution could be repealed or revised.
</P>
<P>
He also announced he would not extend the term of parliament
as it is being demanded by the opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
A considerable amount of foreign tourists have reportedly
canceled their hotel booking in Mombasa and other tourist towns
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan police, strengthened by the General Service Unit
troops, have arrested hundreds of suspects, including two senior
activists with KANU and some supporters of the opposition in the
coastal area.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Hails National Unity Forum Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official said
today that Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat had reasserted his leadership at the recent National Unity
Conference which grouped different political forces.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Arabs Radio, Palestinian
Liberation Organization PLO Executive Committee member Zakaria
Agha hailed the two-day conference as having achieved "positive
results."
</P>
<P>
Despite oppositions from the U.S. and Israel, Arafat summoned
the "national dialog" last Wednesday with militant groups
including Hams, which has claimed responsibility for several
deadly attacks on Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
"The various Palestinian forces with their varied orientations
reiterated their support to Yasser Arafat," said the PLO official.
</P>
<P>
"They also underlined the importance of maintaining Palestinian
unity to face the deteriorating situation resulting from the
Israeli siege imposed on the Palestinian people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed economic sanctions and overall closure of the
Palestinian areas after the July 30 suicide bombings in a
Jerusalem market place, and demanded Arafat to crack down on
extremists.
</P>
<P>
Agha condemned the Israeli and American criticisms launched
against the PNA as aimed at weakening the position of Arafat and
called upon Washington to be more serious to salvage the
peace march.
</P>
<P>
"The recent visit paid by U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis
Ross to the region took only into consideration the Israeli
security interests while ignoring the Palestinian needs," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The American mediator helped repair the Palestinian-Israeli
security coordination system but did not revive peace talks during
his renewed shuttle diplomacy in the region early this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Aged cared health professionals
today called on world leaders at a congress in Australia's
southern port city of Adelaide to immediately address issues
affecting the elderly, including abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the 1997 World Congress of Gerontology today
released the Adelaide Declaration on Aging entitled A Message for
World Leaders and Policy Makers.
</P>
<P>
"The findings reported at this congress have led us to a
profound concern for the quality of life of older people
everywhere," the declaration was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, malnutrition, disease, marginalization, abuse and
neglect were identified as major threats to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The 16th World Congress was held in Adelaide from August 19-23
and attracted 1500 delegates from 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called for wider education about ageing, more
research and improved policies and practices for aged care.
</P>
<P>
It advocated encouraging older people to have an active
lifestyle and looking after the elderly in their chosen
environment.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Language Enriched by Scientific Terms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- With the development of modern
science and technology, more specialized terms are enriching the
old Tibetan language which is used by the Tibetan ethnic group
mainly inhabiting the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "roof of
the world."
</P>
<P>
At the time of its liberation in 1951, Tibet was a feudal serf
society which integrated politics and religion. Most of the
vocabulary of the Tibetan language was related to religion, daily
life, farming and recreational activities. There were few
scientific words.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the Tibetan ethnic group at that time was
little influenced by modern science and technology, for language
reflects the development of a society," said Hu Tan, a professor
with the China Tibetology Research Center, who participated in the
1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies which ended today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-Tibetan Dictionary, published by the Nationalities
Publishing House in 1991, includes more than 80,000 entries
concerning modern science and technology. In recent years, words
in both Chinese and Tibetan languages, covering a number of
categories of natural sciences, have been newly-formed in the
Tibet Autonomous Region and its neighbor Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
"These words have greatly boosted economic growth and
scientific and technological progress in Tibet and other areas
inhabited by Tibetan people," said the professor who has been
studied the Tibetan language for more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
Hu explained that the terms are mainly created by academics, in
addition to some colloquialisms fashioned by the Tibetans.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Language Enriched by Science Terms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For example, "clone" has been translated into "asexual
propagation," and the Tibetan expression for "computer" is
"electric brain or brain using electricity," which borrows its
usage from its Chinese equivalent.
</P>
<P>
Other terms adopt the method of transliteration.
</P>
<P>
"By now, the vocabulary in the Tibetan language about basic
sciences is complete, and the development of Tibetan has scored a
big step forward," Hu Tan said.
</P>
<P>
"However, considering the speed of scientific and technological
advancement in the world, the disparity remains rather large. The
Tibetan language has a long way to go to keep pace with the
times," he said.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, a government-sponsored Tibetan language
standardization committee was formed to take charge of creating
science and technology terms in Tibetan, and also for
standardizing the words in current use.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, scientists and linguists in the Tibet
Autonomous Region and Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces
have been making concerted and persistent efforts to enrich the
Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the science terms appearing in Tibetan language
in recent years, the professor said, more new words have popped up
along with the reform, opening-up and modernization drive in
Tibet. The new words reflect the changes in various fields of
life, such as politics, economy, culture, education and sports.
</P>
<P>
At present, important government documents can be translated
into Tibetan language, and Tibetans who attend the annual sessions
of the National People's Congress (NPC) are able to receive
simultaneous interpretation, the professor said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Asks Arab Leaders to Use Influence on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) --Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has telephoned Jordan's King Hussein and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, asking them to persuade
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to crack down on terrorism,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed on the phone Friday that the Palestinian
leader was not keeping his commitment to fight terrorism and
this was jeopardizing the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks coincided with a prevailing sense of
discontent in Israeli officials at Arafat's convening of
"national unity" conclaves with Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) and Islamic Jihad leaders early this week in Gaza and
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Arafat's show of cordiality toward Hamas and
Islamic Jihad leaders, Israeli Cabinet secretary Dan Naveh
Thursday assailed Arafat for initiating the "national unity"
talks, saying he is "two-faced."
</P>
<P>
"If he is truly a partner in peace, the way he claims he is,
he must fight these organizations and certainly not embrace
them," Naveh said.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials contended that the dialogue between
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the Islamic
fundamentalists was not being held to appease Hamas but to assert
Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) domination.
</P>
<P>
"I can not understand what Netanyahu is worried about. We are a
society which believes in democracy and pluralism. We will not
allow Hamas to form an alternative society," chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat stressed.
</P>
<P>
Erekat alleged that "Netanyahu has brought relations between
the Israeli and Palestinian people to their worst point since
the beginning of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeness, chief adviser to Arafat, also said that
the PLO was leading the meeting and that "our strategic choice
is peace."
</P>
<P>
He explained Arafat's "all options are open" remark at the
opening session of the "national unity" Wednesday as meaning that
"if Israel is not interested in peace it will push Palestinians
to reconsider things."

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Bank Reports Growth in Settlement Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank
(CCB), a state-owned commercial bank, has recorded a rapid
development in its business in international settlements this
year, a bank source said.
</P>
<P>
CCB's business in international settlements so far this year
has reached 22.56 billion US dollars, a rise of 7.28 billion US
dollars from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The source attributed the rapid growth to the effort of the
bank's branches in the coastal areas, such as those in Fujian,
Zhejiang, Guangdong and Beijing, to expand their client bases.
</P>
<P>
An investment of 700 million yuan (84.34 million US dollars)
designed to expand settlement business last year resulted in an
increase of one billion US dollars in international settlements in
CCB's Fujian branch. The provincial branch's settlement business
is expected to reach 2.5 billion US dollars at the end of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Minister Leaves for Turkey for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Minister of
Commerce and Industry Jassem Al-Mudhaf left for Turkey today on a
four-day visit to hold talks with Turkish officials on ways of
promoting commercial exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister will hold talks with his Turkish counterpart
Yalim Erez and other officials on sidelines of the four-day Izmir
International Exhibition which will open Sunday in Turkey, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Historic and distinctive ties binding Kuwait and Turkey have
facilitated exportation of Turkish products to Kuwait," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
But so far there is no organized navigation lines between the
two countries and some customs technical problems exist, he
indicated.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti-Turkish committee meets once a year to assess
commercial exchanges and tackle problems hampering cooperation
between the two countries' businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume amounted to some 150 million U.S.
dollars in 1996 in Turkish favor.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Turkey signed several accords over the past two
decades, including an agreement for transit, transfer of
passengers and commodities in 1970, an agreement for
encouragement and protection of investments in 1988, a deal for
industrial, economic and technical cooperation in 1992 and an
agreement on avoiding double taxation in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Wants Peace Talks Put Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi government said
today it only wants peace talks put off for two weeks or less
after organizers cancelled their Monday opening when asked for a
postponement, a report from the Burundi capital said today.
</P>
<P>
Bujumbura is trying to contact international mediator and
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere to ask for a new date
for the talks, Institutional Reform Minister Eugene Nindorera was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"i think it will be postponed for a small time only but
Nyerere might be very angry and he might take some severe
decisions. We are going to try to convince him that the delay is
just for a few days, two weeks probably, or less," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi Officials said the government would also consult with
Nyerere's envoy to Bujumbura Felix Mosha, who arrived in Burundi
on Thursday and is expected to leave later today.
</P>
<P>
An aide of Nyerere's said Friday the talks, which had been
scheduled to start in Arusha, a northern tanzanian town Monday,
were cancelled because Bujumbura had asked for a delay.
</P>
<P>
However, organizers in Tanzania said today Burundi peace talks
would still open Monday but without the Burundi government team
since it asked for a delay.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks would start as originally scheduled Monday
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Bujumbura requested a postponement on the grounds that
successful talks were unlikely. U.N. Security Council members
Thursday pressed Burundi and Tanzania to improve relations ahead
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Nindorera said today that Tanzania remains a viable talks
venue although the Burundi government accuses Tanzania of
harboring Burundi a Hutu rebels on its western border.
</P>
<P>
He said Nyerere's envoy Mosha came to Burundi and only told
the government how the talks were to be organized.
</P>
<P>
"We need more time to prepare so the negotiations can be
useful," he said.
</P>
<P>
The military government, formed after a coup by the
Tutsi-dominated army in July last year, also accuses Tanzania of
being behind a decision last weekend to maintain regional
sanctions against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The talks would have brought together the Burundi government
and the main Hutu rebel group the National Council for the
Defemse of Democracy (CNDD) for the first time in a public
forum.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the pro-Tutsi Uprona party, the
Hutu-dominated Frodebu party and parliament were to have joined
the talks aimed at ending Burundi's civil war and political
crisis in the peace talks.

TAIYUAN, August 23 (Xinhua)-- Ground has been broken for a
"hope project" primary school funded by the Taiyuan Coca-Cola
Company with 200,000 yuan (24,000 US dollars) in an old
revolutionary area in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The 2,450-square-meter Hope Project Primary School, in Tongyu
Town, Zhuoquan County, will benefit school-age children in more

</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Taiyuan company donated 240,000 yuan (28,900 US
dollars) last year to build the first "Coca-Cola Hope Primary
School" in relatively poor Lingqiu County, which will accept its
first batch of pupils in September.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Abacha Gears up for ECOWAS Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Repeated clashes have been reported between ECOMOG troops and
soldiers of the junta, but neither side has seemingly gained
substantial achievements.
</P>
<P>
No one could imagine ECOMOG troops would leave Sierra Leone
with internationally-condemned coupists still holding the power,
not to mention the oath of ECOWAS to restore civil rule there.
</P>
<P>
This, according to analysts, determines that the key objective
of Abacha's visits would focus on persuading his hosts to stand
by him.
</P>
<P>
So far, no response of the countries Abacha visited has been
released. But he is reported to be in the view that if the
military junta failed to explore the avenue to bow out honorably,
it might eventually be sent packing by force, as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
Then there comes a problem how the junta is given the chance
to show its willingness to step down "honorably" since its demand
to participate in the summit has been rejected and peace talks
which collapsed last month has not be resumed.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah will
represent Sierra Leone at the summit in Abuja next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While observers are expecting a breakthrough in the political
impasse caused by the junta's belligerent position, the United
Nations Security Council has expressed its support to any actions
ECOWAS might adopt to settle the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The council President John Weston said earlier this week the
key objective of the 15-member body now was to ensure that it was
speaking and acting with the same voice as ECOWAS ministers
regarding the Sierra Leonean issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has issued three statements urging the junta to
reinstate the elected government without delay. So has the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
All this might be a great encouragement to General Abacha in
his capacity as both ECOWAS chairman and military ruler of west
Africa's "big brother".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the one-year chairmanship is shared by ECOWAS
members on a rotation basis, Abacha's recent high-frequency
foreign visits may not be unconnected with an attempt to seek a
second term.
</P>
<P>
Without the capacity of ECOWAS chairmanship, it will be
difficult for Nigeria to play its leading role in the sub-region,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Then it will equally be an arduous task to maintain peace and
stability in west Africa as far as the tense situation in Sierra
Leone is concerned, without Nigeria's positive contribution in
terms of both human and materials resources.

<HEADLINE> Abu Simbel to Have Sound and Light Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- International bids for sound and
light plays will be submitted before the end of this year in Abu
Simbel, Egypt's famous archeological site that hosts four ancient
colossal stone statues in the wildness of sand.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Company for Sound and Light has finalized contracts
with a number of foreign companies to implement the sound and
light project, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The whole project is planned to be completed in eight months,
said Yousri Mohamed Hassan, director of the Aswan-based sound and
light company.
</P>
<P>
The company has sent a delegation to Abu Simbel to do research
on the various dimensions of the project and the impact of the
light on monuments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of an Egyptian campaign to promote tourism
development in the southern part of the country and increase the
number of tourist nights.
</P>
<P>
Abu Simbel, a key tourist site in Aswan about 900 kilometers
south of Cairo, is a rock-hewn temple carved into a jutting
promontory in the land of Nubia.
</P>
<P>
Twice a year, at the dawning of the spring and autumnal
equinoxes, the first beams of the rising sun shed flush on the
faces of four-seated figures (three gods and Ramsis II, Egypt's
longest-ruling pharaoh, whose reign was between 1304 to 1237 BC).
</P>
<P>
The sound and light show, a colorful entertainment combining a
pharaoh's autobiographical account and mock scenes in ancient
times, has been staged at Egypt's hallmarks -- three pyramids of
Giza and Sphinx.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Parole Dodgers Vanish in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 convicts
are on the run after skipping parole and absconding from
correctional supervision in Johannesburg and Pretoria region, and
no one is actively searching for them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, almost 4,000 hardened criminals have made a dash
for freedom while on parole after serving sentences, a local
weekly magazine Saturday Star reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, over 1,400 people who were sentenced
to correctional supervision, a more lenient punishment which is
served at home and subject to regular visits by prison officials,
have also slipped out of the hands of the law.
</P>
<P>
These convicts have leaked out of the criminal justice system
since 1992, and most of them are on wanted lists at police
stations across South Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the report further claimed, only a handful of
escaped convicts are re-arrested.
</P>
<P>
The over-burdened South African police service already has its
handful trying to trace people who have escaped from police
custody before conviction.
</P>
<P>
The police released alarming statistics this week, showing
there were more than 700 breakouts from police cells around the
country in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 crime suspects escaped from police custody
during these breakouts.
</P>
<P>
National Police Commissioner Georgy Fivaz this week warned
station commissioners that they would have to take responsibility
for escapes at their stations.
</P>
<P>
The station chiefs would face severe disciplinary action for
staff negligence that led to cell breakouts, he added.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Flows Again in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Water flowed from the upper
reaches of the Yellow River yesterday for the first time in more
than six months, to the mouth of the river in east China's
Shandong Province, where there was a serious shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
Since February 7, the upper reaches of the Yellow River, which
runs though most of north China, have been dry, and the lower part
of the river had no water for 147 days, the longest period on
record in this century.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dongying and the Binzhou region near the river
mouth have suffered from a serious drought since this spring, and
the area had difficulty obtaining the large amounts of river water
needed for irrigation, industry and everyday use.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and National Water-Control Headquarters paid
close attention to the water shortage and drought in the
area. Meanwhile, the Yellow River Water-Control Committee exerted
considerable effort to bring the water down from the upper reaches
to lower reaches and river mouth area, by taking measures to limit
the use of water in the areas along the upper reaches of the
river.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Committed to Implementing Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic and
financial center, Shanghai, will continue to practice a moderately
tight monetary policy in the remaining months of this year to
support economic growth and state enterprise reform, a senior
banking official said.
</P>
<P>
The moderately tight monetary policy is aimed to cut bad loans,
control the money supply, improve financial services and prevent
financial risks, said Mao Yingliang, president of the Shanghai
branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Mao said that the proportion of non-performing loans should be
reduced by two percentage points in a bid to improve credit
quality.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to strengthen the management of cash and
strictly control the money supply, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an arduous task for us to control the supply of money,"
Mao said, urging all local banks to make greater efforts to
withdraw money from circulation.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that financial services will be improved to
render greater support to the reform and development of the
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Banks should take an active part in the work involved in
enterprise mergers and bankruptcy, Mao added.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that commercial banks are prohibited from
extending bank credits into the stock market and must not accept
deposits or grant loans illegally.
</P>
<P>
Both financial opening and refrom will be deepened in the
remaining months, Mao said.

<HEADLINE> Ashrawi Warns Against Israel's Anti-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- In another sign indicating
further worsening of relations between the right-wing Israeli
government and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), a senior
Palestinian official has warned Israel not to kill the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, minister of Higher Education and former
spokeswoman for the Palestinian peace delegation, said today that
the PNA is taking seriously a report that Israel is forming
special units to carry out assassinations and other operations in
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi issued the warning when she was speaking to reporters
in the West Bank city of Ramallah following a late night meeting
of the Palestinian leadership composed of cabinet members, PLO
executive members and speakers of the Palestinian National Council
and Palestinian Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
On Friday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu phoned President
Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan, asking them to use
their influence on Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to change
what he called a policy toward terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that Arafat was not keeping his commitment
to fighting terrorism and was jeopardizing the entire peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources were quoted as saying in Israel Radio
saying Friday that the PNA was refusing to arrest some 200 Hamas
activists, who, Israel believes, might be linked to the last
month's Jerusalem suicide bombing attack killing 14 Israelis and
wounding dozens more.
</P>
<P>
The sources also expressed disappointment with the fruitless
meeting in Ramalla Thursday night attended by Israeli, Palestinian
and U.S. security officials, which focused on investigation into
the suicide bombing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report of the U.S. TV network, CNN,
the Israeli authorities have launched a campaign to marginalize
Arafat since the peace process hit the rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Ilan, Netanyahu's senior advisor, told CNN that
Arafat has used terrorism as "a weapon in trying to achieve
what he wants to achieve." "This is one weapon which is used
simultaneously with another weapon which is negotiations," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Portuguese Civil Servants Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 Macao civil servants
coming from Portugal will be leaving by the end of next year, a
civil service official said.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Baptista Bruxo, director of the Public Administration and
Function Service Department, told the local newspaper "Tai Chung
Pou" that those people will leave before 1999 after their
contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has some 990 contracted Portuguese civil
servants. Most of them will not get renewal of their contract term
and will have to return to Portugal next year, the director said.
</P>
<P>
The localization of civil service is deemed one of the leading
tasks in the transitional period of Macao. Up until now, most the
middle and senior positions are held by those from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The total forces of Macao civil servants have gradually
expanded to more than 18,000, compared with a total population of
some 420,000.
</P>
<P>
The director said that their leaving will not affect the normal
function of government departments, as most departments would have
been well prepared by the time of their leaving.
</P>
<P>
However, Bruxo said that before December 31, 1998, government
departments can still submit applications to the governor to hire
some individual Portuguese civil servants.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Abacha Gears up for ECOWAS Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha, who used to spends almost all his time to manage the
country in the state house in the capital Abuja, has launched a
whirlwind of foreign trips this week.
</P>
<P>
He ended a one-day official visit to Mali and the Gambia on
Friday, following a similar one to Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
As Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), General Abacha also visited Ghana and Benin in late
July.
</P>
<P>
All these countries covered by his rare foreign visits are
members of the sub-regional organization that is to hold its 20th
summit of heads of state and government next week.
</P>
<P>
There must be quite a few issues there for the leaders to
discuss with each other, particularly on how to keep the
16-member body on the right track to its ultimate goal of
economic integration and a common market in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, no economic achievement can be made without a
peaceful and stable environment when collective efforts are
emphasized to bring common prosperity to the sub-region, which is
believed to be a club with the biggest number of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
The view of peace and stability ahead of development was
shared among west African leaders when they met at a summit last
year.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore logic that General Abacha's recent diplomatic
initiatives dwell on the crisis in Sierra Leone, which has posed
a threat to regional peace and stability, especially after the
return of normalcy in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
West African countries stood up to call for an immediate
return of power to Sierra Leone's legitimate government shortly
after it was overthrown by a military coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, which also embraces Sierra Leone, set up a committee
composed of Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea to tackle
the crisis in a combination of three measures -- dialogue,
sanctions and the use of force.
</P>
<P>
To date, dialogue has been failed as the military junta
insists on staying in power until the year 2001, while tightened
sanctions and embargo seem not to put enough pressure on the
coupists.
</P>
<P>
The last option, namely military intervention, has now been
placed before ECOWAS members to decide.
</P>
<P>
However, it is obviously a difficult decision to make,
especially when Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea are reported not
to share the same zeal with Nigeria in resolving the Sierra
Leonean crisis by force.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops are already in the troubled country under a
defense pact with the ousted civilian government and reportedly
supported by their comrades-in-arms from a few west African
countries in the name of west African peace-keeping force known
as ECOMOG. (to be continued)

<HEADLINE> German Children Spending Billions of Marks Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Annual spending by German children
and youth runs as high as 15 to 20 billion marks (8 to 11 billion
U.S. dollars), which is equal to about three percent of the annual
retail sales of the country, a German retailers' group said today.
</P>
<P>
This consumption group spends most of its money on music,
sports and fashion. Music and sports idols like "Backstreet Boys"
and Michael Jordan have an extremely strong influence on
children's spending behavior, said Thomas Werz, leader of the
German Retailers Association.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more of this youth group's money is flowing
into computer markets, Werz said, adding that computers in
children's rooms alone are worth 5 billion marks (2.7 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to his estimates, more than half of all German
children between the ages of six and nine now have their own
computers.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Foreign Minister Leaves on 6-Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today expressed hope that his multi-leg tour of southern
Africa could achieve good results in economic cooperation field.
</P>
<P>
He was making the remarks in an interview to Good Morning Egypt
on local TV station before embarking on the trip early this
morning to six African states of Lesotho, South Africa,
Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
He said he will deliver messages from President Hosni Mubarak
to the African leaders on bilateral relations, political matters
on common interests and means of boosting economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his talks with African officials will cover
investments, trade, tourism and economic cooperation and several
agreements will be signed in this score.
</P>
<P>
The African tour, the second of the kind by Moussa this year,
is regarded as another show of Egypt's interest in promoting
economic and political links within the continent. He is being
accompanied by a large team of businessmen and representatives of
private sector companies.
</P>
<P>
"This tour will cover political matters at both the African and
Mideast levels. But mainly it will focus on consolidating economic
ties," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister said a similar tour to East
Africa last May, during which he visited Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda
and Nigeria, is "very fruitful."
</P>
<P>
During Moussa's two-day visit to Pretoria, South Africa, his
second leg of his tour, the two countries will sign five
agreements covering cooperation in taxation, marine and air
transport, culture and technology.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will also sign a number of accords on trade and
investment with Mozambique, according to today's Egyptian Mail.

<HEADLINE> China Adjusts Development Goals for Chemical Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top chemical official
says the country has adjusted the chemical industry's development
goals to keep up with the fast growth of the sector in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xulian, Chinese minister of Chemical Industry, recently told
Xinhua that her ministry has revised the industry target to earn
20 billion US dollars from chemical exports in the year 2000,
double the figure set in the previous plan.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate overseas investment used by the country's
chemical sector till the year 2000 is to increase from the current
six billion dollars to 12 billion dollars, or 20 percent more than
the target set six years ago, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade volume of China's chemical industry in 2000
is proposed to reach 40 billion dollars, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ministry plans to foster 100 enterprises and
enterprise groups that are well-equipped, well-managed and
competitive in the international market, she added.
</P>
<P>
The chemical industry, recognized one of the basic industries
and one of the key sectors in the former development plan for
China's economy, is also used by the Chinese government to attract
overseas capital and boost export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China is to expand the channels for raising
capital and present more flexible means of development for
overseas investors, according to Gu.
</P>
<P>
Her ministry has planned to increase the use of export credits
and other commercial loans while concentrating efforts on "drawing
investments from major multinationals and putting it into key
projects as well as major technical renovation projects."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said that the ministry has decided to offer more
incentives for those who are involved in regional chemical
development and encourage overseas investors to package smaller
projects into bigger ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the existing cooperative projects, overseas investors will
be encouraged to broaden their business scope to such new fields
as upgraded chemicals and chemicals for the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the ministry expects to foster a group of new
exported-oriented chemical industrial bases in the country with
the aid of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Gu said the introduction and application of new- and high-tech
chemical techniques should also be put on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the ministry, China's chemical
industry in the past five years registered its fastest growth ever.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign trade volume between 1992 and 1996 came to
110.4 billion US dollars, of which export amounted to 46.1 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industry posted a total export volume of 12 billion dollars
and a trade volume of 30 billion dollars in 1996, up 230 percent
and 190 percent over that of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated overseas investment utilized by the chemical
sector in the past five years hit six billion dollars. The
investment of some 150 projects exceeded 10 million dollars each,
and there are 6,800 chemical ventures with overseas investment
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry expanded its cooperation with foreign
governments and corporations. Of the 25 leading chemical
multinationals, 70 percent have set up operations in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Chemical Industry has signed all-round
cooperative agreements with eight foreign government departments,
including those from the Netherlands, Mexico, the United States
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, similar relations were established between the
ministry and 13 other corporations such as America's DuPont,
Germany's Holst and Bayer, Britain's Imperial Chemical
Incorporation and Rhone-Poulenc of France.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government's Tibet Policy Is Good: Western Scholars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A number of Western scholars
said that the Chinese government's policy toward Tibet is a good
one, when they addressed the Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies,
which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Po You Hsing, from the US, said that Tibet has entered a
new era since the mid-20th century, putting an end to its feudal
system of serfdom.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has allocated a lot of money and sent
many personnel to help improve Tibetan economy...the facts are
known to the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Tibet was officially incorporated into the
Chinese territory in the 13th century. "The Tibetan people are
members of the Chinese family, and the region is an inseparable
part of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a few people who advocate the independence of
Tibet have even colluded with those who blow the trumpet of Taiwan
independence. People who support the unification of the motherland
are not happy to see what these groups are doing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Colin Mackerras, president of Griffith University in Australia,
told Xinhua that the Chinese government's policy toward Tibet is a
wise one because it encourages the survival of the Tibetan
culture. And the modernization drive in Tibet is also positive, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Religion, architecture and Tibetan arts will always remain,"
he said, adding: "There will be more blending of cultures. But I
don't think that the distinctive Tibetan culture is going to be
lost or disappear."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many people in the West have said that the
Chinese government is destroying Tibetan culture, but that does
not correspond with what he has seen.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think it is a wise way to maintain Tibetan culture by
splitting Tibet from China. If it is split from China, it would be
very bad economically, and also would be very dangerous," he
said.

<P>
Nancy Levine, a professor from the University of California,
said that a policy which takes local conditions into consideration
is being adopted in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
She noted that modernization is reshaping Tibetan people's way
of life. There is no need for people to work 30 days a month
nowadays, residents have more time to travel.
</P>
<P>
"They are good things," she said.
</P>
<P>
Elaine Roboson, a British scholar who has visited Tibet four
times, said she saw for herself that the Tibetan people are
enjoying high religious freedom, and can follow any religious
belief they choose.
</P>
<P>
Graham Clarke, a British professor studying Tibetan economy,
said that the region is undergoing rapid economic change, and,
locally, economic development is welcomed.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Epstein, a professor from the University of
Washington, said that since the 1980s, the Tibetan people have
been exploiting ethnic and natural resources, including developing
tourism, and the local ways of life have been largely reshaped. At
the same time, the process has enhanced the locals' self-awareness
of the Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, sponsored by the Tibetan Studies Center
and the third of its kind in China, touched on issues of
socio-economics, religion, culture and language in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Visit France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri will pay an official visit to France next month, indicating
that the good bilateral relations will not be affected by the
recent French elections.
</P>
<P>
The recent French elections, which ousted Lebanon's traditional
right-wing allies from power, aroused fears in Lebanon that
Lebanese relations with France will be affected, local Daily Star
newspaper said in comment of the visit today.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said last night that Hariri will start his
three-day trip on September 11 and will be accompanied by key
members of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was formally invited by his French counterpart and
socialist leader, Lionel Jospin, who assumed office in June after
defeating the right-wing supporters of President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that Lebanon would fall victim to
the tense relations between Chirac, Hariri's personal friend and
ally, and Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that topping the agenda of the political
discussion is the Middle East situation and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
plans to visit Beirut as part of a Middle East tour that
aims to emphasize the new government's commitment to a role in
the region's peace-making effort.

<HEADLINE> Large Jadeware Market in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A visit to the Kunming World
Trade Center and its 1,500 stalls, where the fifth export trade
fair is underway, can be a dazzling affair.
</P>
<P>
About 300 of the stalls are for jadeware produced locally and
as well as from Thailand, Burma, Malaysia, and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Judging jade, because it is sometimes a luxury, can be
difficult. A pair of jade bracelets sold by local jewellers can
cost thousands of yuan, while similar products can be bought at a
rather low price from a Burmese dealer.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan and Burma account for a large part of the jewelry
exhibition. One jewellery from Burma says that he earned over
100,000 yuan in one day.
</P>
<P>
A Yunnan jadeware market is taking shape. The province has two
advantages in this business. One is that, in addition to its own
abundant jade resources, it borders Southeast and South Asia,
which are famous for their jade products. The other is that Yunnan
has a long history of dealing with jade. Jadeware occupies a major
part of Yunnan's tourist trade.

GUIYANG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's deep-going financial
reform has proved successful in southwestern Guizhou Province, as
both financial risks and the ratio of non-performing loans of the

The rural credit cooperatives have turned for the better since
financial reform in the countryside was launched, a provincial

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Largest Port City in Grip of Loadshedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The erratic power supply coupled
with loadshedding hit Chittagong city, the biggest port city of
Bangladesh, over the past week, seriously affecting the production
and normal life, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The port city now receives supply of only 35 megawatt of
electricity as against its minimum requirement of 170 megawatt a
day, according to the Power Development Board (PDB).
</P>
<P>
The extreme poor state of power supply has again put the port
city dwellers in sufferings beyond all bounds. Hardly an area of
the port city now goes without experiencing power failure a day.
Even at night, the dwellers experience power failures and
loadshedding several times.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fluctuation of voltage is also now worse than
ever before and the low-voltage too has reached all time high.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented loadshedding has seriously affected the
production of over 4,000 mills and industries of the port city.
</P>
<P>
With the present pace of development of the city, the demand
for the supply of electricity is fast going up. It is informed
that Chittagong city needs the supply of more than 250 megawatt
electricity a day.
</P>
<P>
Compared to that necessity, the PDB is used to supply there 70
to 100 megawatt a day during the normal period, the local press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The PDB attributed the loadshedding to the poor generation of
electricity at three power plants in the Chittagong area, which
significantly shrunk over the past one week following the cut down
of supply of gas.

SHANGHAI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Books on how to bring up better
children are popular in east China's Shanghai, and statistics show
that there were 2.4 million children below the age of 14 by the
end of 1996, accounting for 18 percent of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
There are medical centers all over the city for pregnant women
and infants, and more than 85 percent of the children have been
vaccinated. The city's infant mortality rate and incidence of
physical defects has dropped to the level of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
It is common for parents to attend special classes on how to
raise children scientifically.
</P>
<P>
Children between the ages of three and six get preschool
education, where they learn to count, draw, and sing.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 2,470 kindergartens in the city, with
268,200 children.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has nine years of compulsory education that is
tuition-free. Local governments at different levels spent a total
of 5.8 billion yuan (728 million US dollars) on education last
year, 4.6 times the amount six years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, about 99.9 percent of school-age children were in

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Helping Education in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Elementary education in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been greatly improved
through the help of loans provided by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The region's largest overseas-funded education project for
improving education conditions in poverty-stricken areas, is
scheduled for completion in 1999. The project will cost an
estimated 360 million yuan (about 45 million US dollars),
including 19.3 million US dollars in loans provided by the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the region's most impoverished counties will
benefit greatly from the project, which will help build school
buildings and libraries, supply better facilities, and train
better teachers for local schools. So far, these counties have
built 270,000 sq.m. of school buildings, bought 40,000 desks and
chairs, and trained more than 6,800 teachers and staff members.
</P>
<P>
Elementary education in Xinjiang has remained at a low level as
a result of a shortage of education funds and facilities. The
region is inhabited by many ethnic groups and textbooks have to be
written in different languages, adding further to complications in
elementary education.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government has taken
measures to ensure that this traditional agricultural country will
have enough to feed its people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters recently, Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, and
Minister of Agriculture Ventsislav Varbanov reassured that the
grain crisis earlier this year would not recur, and the bread
price will remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Their reassurance was based on an optimistic assessment of this
year's wheat harvest, and the government's compulsive wheat
purchasing policies.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Bulgaria enjoyed an average of one third of grain
production surplus each year. But since early 1990s, the country
has been suffering from a dramatic drop in production, due to
economic problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The grain shortage culminated in a serious food crisis in
February this year when the country had to purchase 280,000 tons
of wheat from Poland. Enitem

statistics.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry for Labor and Manpower, the total

During the first half of this year, a total of 125,056 persons
were sent officially to different countries. They include 2,330

COLOMBO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- About 70 Tamil rebels were
killed and many others injured Friday when government troops
continued their attack on the rebel-control Puliyankulam town in
the Northern province of Sri Lanka, a military spokesman here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Ink Dewage, the spokesman, said the troops, advancing north
westwards from the Puliyankulam railway station Friday, had
retaliated with tank fire and artillery to force the rebels to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Progress on Friday was slow due to the fact that the rebels
fired mortars and automatic weapons from well prepared defenses,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said one officer and six soldiers were killed in the
fighting on Friday. Four officers and 29 soldiers were also
wounded.
</P>
<P>
However, Dewage noted that very satisfactory results are being
achieved since troops have been able to draw and kill large groups
of rebels in their concentrations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan troops launched operation "Jaya Sikuru" (Sure of
Victory) in May to capture the 90-km highway that links Vavuniya
to Kilinochchi further north.
</P>
<P>
This was the third day the government troops continued their
attack on Puliyankulam, a town near a vital supply route that runs
from Colombo to the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>

"Religion, architecture and Tibetan arts will always remain,"
he said, adding: "There will be more blending of cultures. But I
don't think that the distinctive Tibetan culture is going to be
lost or disappear."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many people in the West have said that the
Chinese government is destroying Tibetan culture, but that does
not correspond with what he has seen in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely believe that the Chinese government is extending
every possible effort to preserve Tibetan culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mackerras added that Tibetan traditions are stronger in the
1990s and are, in fact, stronger than virtually any other
traditional culture in China.
</P>
<P>
He voiced total disagreement with those who advocate the need
to split Tibet from China to maintain the region's distinctive
traditions.
</P>
<P>
"It would be economically unsound and dangerous to split Tibet
from China," said Mackerras, "and it would devastate the local
cultural tradition."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government's policy toward Tibet is a wise one
because it encourages the survival of the Tibetan culture. And the
modernization drive in Tibet is also positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Elaine Robson, a British scholar who has visited Tibet four
times, said she saw for herself that the Tibetan people are
enjoying high religious freedom, and can follow any religious
belief they choose.
</P>
<P>
Graham Clarke, a British professor studying Tibetan economy,
said that the region is undergoing rapid economic change, and,
locally, economic development is welcomed.

Nancy Levine, a professor from the University of California,
said that a policy which takes local conditions into consideration
is being adopted in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
She noted that modernization is reshaping Tibetan people's way
of life. There is no need for people to work 30 days a month
nowadays, residents have more time to travel.
</P>
<P>
"These are good things," she said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Epstein, a professor from the University of
Washington, said that since the 1980s, the Tibetan people have
been exploiting their ethnic and natural resources, including
developing tourism, and the local ways of life have been largely
reshaped. At the same time, the process has enhanced the locals'
self-awareness of the Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there is a revival of traditional culture in
Tibet and the Chinese government is actively involved in
preserving grottos, paintings and renovating temples," said
Professor Richard Strassberg from the department of East Asian
Languages and Cultures, University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate that there are people who take interests in
preserving the old city of Lhasa," said Dr. Peter Schwieger of the
University of Bonn, Germany, who had been to Tibet and toured 11
towns and villages there since 1986.
</P>
<P>
"I had the impression when I went there last time that there
were positive changes. They now appreciate the cultural history of
Tibet more than before."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Po You Hsing, from the US, said that Tibet has entered a
new era since the mid-20th century, putting an end to the feudal
system of serfdom.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has allocated a lot of money and sent
many personnel to help improve Tibetan economy...the facts are
known to the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Tibet was officially incorporated into the
Chinese territory in the 13th century. "The Tibetan people are
members of the Chinese family, and the region is an inseparable
part of China," he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 More Foreign Banks to Start Operation in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Three more foreign banks will be
given permission soon for doing business in Bangladesh to
supplement the activities of the banks in the country's financial
sector, informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
According the sources, three leading banks, one each from
Germany, Japan and Denmark, have sought permission to start
operation in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Bank has already given them green signal that the
necessary permission will be given by this month.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 13 foreign banks are doing business in
Bangladesh. Those banks are from Australian, Britain, Pakistan,
India and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The major operations of the foreign banks so far were
restricted to only trade financing. But, in the wake of the
serious liquidity crisis faced by the local commercial banks in
extending term loans, the government has withdrawn the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks have also expressed their willingness to
expand their lending to the fund-starved industrial sector,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks are now examining the feasibility of
industrial financing and a proposal to this effect will be
submitted to the Finance Ministry at the end of this month,
sources informed.

<HEADLINE> Western Scholars Criticize Wolf's Remarks as "Absolutely nonsense" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Leading Western scholars on
Tibetan studies expressed their "shock" at US congressman Frank
Wolf's remarks that "Tibetan language and culture are being
destroyed" and criticized him as being "arrogant and ignorant."
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Frank Wolf, who recently sneaked into
Tibet in the disguise as a tourist, sensationally announced on
Wednesday that during his four-day tour to Tibet he saw that the
region was being "swallowed" by China through mass arrests and
brutal repression and Tibetan language and culture are being
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
He called on the West to "take urgent action to save" the
Himalayan Buddhist culture.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the United Sates, Britain, Australia and
Germany attending the ongoing '97 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan
Studies refuted Wolf's arguments by citing their own
experience. Tibetan traditional culture is flourishing, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Wolf's remarks are nonsense. It's absolutely nonsense. He must
be blind," said Professor Colin Mackerras, a professor of
Tibetology of Griffith University and chairman of the Modern Asian
Studies School in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"He seems to know everything, but his remarks obviously show
that he knows nothing of the Tibetan culture and obviously he has
never been to Tibetan rural areas," Professor Mackerras said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Mackerras, who has made five visits to the Tibet
Autonomous Region as well as the Tibetan areas of Qinghai, Gansu
and Sichuan provinces, said that "Tibetan culture is stronger than
ever before."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Increases Taxes to Bridge Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
raised excise on petrol and diesel, rate of value added tax
(VAT), and license fees for vehicles and drivers in a bid to
bridge the budget deficit for the 1997/98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The new revenue measures are expected to earn Kenyan Finance
Ministry an additional 2.8 billion Kenya Shillings (about 43
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
A legal notice signed by the Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi
on August 21 said the new tax measures would be complemented with
a further strengthening of tax administration.
</P>
<P>
The main measures include the strengthening of organizational
and operational capacity of the Kenya Revenue Authority and
strict enforcement of maximum compliance with payment of import
duties and VAT.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the notice said, the Kenyan government will
cut non-essential recurrent expenditure and defer development
expenditure for non-priority projects, amounting to a saving of 5
billion Shillings (77 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The implementation of these expenditure control measures will
limit the government's expenditure to 156 billion Shillings
(about 2.4 billion U.S.Dollars) during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
All these measures are prompted by the recent decision of the
International Monetary Fund to suspend a three-year Enhanced
Structural Adjustment facility to Kenya, of about 205 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The expected shortfall for the current budget following the
decision include budget funding amounting to 8.3 billion
Shillings (abut 127.7 million US Dollars) and balance of payments
support totalling 4.4 billion Shillings (67.6 million US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The notice said that the measures were taken to maintain the
budget deficit at 1.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
as originally planned.

<HEADLINE> Electric Tempos to Appear in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The diesel and petrol-driven
tempos running in this capital city of Nepal will be converted to
electric ones with a view to reducing pollution, Nepali Minister
for Population and Environment Vidya Devi Bhandari said.
</P>
<P>
The Danish organization Danida has donated 25 million rupees
(about 440,000 U.S. dollars) for this purpose, Bhandari said
Friday when answering queries in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
She said trucks, buses, tempos and other transport vehicles
which have failed the pollution test will be displaced only after
appropriate alternative is explored, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 3,600 tempos now are going in the streets of Kathmandu,
which are blamed partly for the deteriorating environment of the
city.
</P>
<P>
However, initially only some of these tempos can be converted
with the fund of 25 million rupees (about 440,000 dollars) after
establishing a small battery charging station, said a press
release issued by the Danish embassy in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
This initiative came after urgent calls were made from all
walks of life in Kathmandu to start such a program to reduce
pollution before Visit Nepal Year '98 so as to attract more
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Denmark might donate an additional 300 million rupees (about
5.3 million dollars) to convert all diesel-operated tempos in the
Kathmandu Valley, the press release said.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany has given Zambia 17
million Deutche Marks (about 10.6 million U.S. Dollars) in
technical and project assistance under an agreement signed here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to improve water supply and sanitation,
privatization sector development, agriculture and natural
resources, as well as Germany-funded projects like the Industrial
Training Center (ITC), according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Germans as saying the 20 million
Marks (about 12.5 million Dollars) balance of payment support
will be released at the next consultative group meeting to be
held this December if benchmarks of good governance are met.
</P>
<P>
Elin Horn-Vormsschlag, Germany's head of division for southern
Africa, said at the signing ceremony that Germany will continue
to assist Zambia in other sectors like transport, health and
family planning to improve the people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Ben Mweene, secretary to the Treasury, said on the occasion
that the Zambian government will work hard to ensure projects are
successful.
</P>
<P>
"We are geared to eliminate obstacles in water and sanitation
and to overcome problems of German-funded projects like the ITC,"
said Mweene.

<HEADLINE> HK Tourism Receipts Slightly Down in 1st Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Total tourism receipts for the
first half of 1997 amounted to 39.8 billion HK dollars (5.14
billion US dollars), down 2.9 percent on the same period last
year, according to figures released today by the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
Per capita spending by visitors from all markets, except the
Chinese inland areas, dropped by between 0.5 and 15.6 percent.
Overall, per capita spending was down by 7.8 percent to 6,786 HK
dollars (875.61 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A HKTA spokesman said that the decline was mostly attributable
to visitor spending from the North Asian region, which showed a
decrease of 25.9 percent to 6.9 billion HK dollars (920 million US
dollars), in line with a slowdown in visitor arrivals from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from the Americas also spent slightly less, down 3.1
percent to 3.5 billion HK dollars (451 million US dollars), while
visitors from Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific spent
2.0 percent less at 1.3 billion HK dollars (167 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But visitors from China' inland areas increased their spending
by 9.7 percent to 8.7 billion HK dollars (1.12 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The HKTA is forecasting a year-end rise in tourism receipts of
about 7 percent to around 90.5 billion HK dollars (11.67 billion
US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Brazil Exports Most Footballers in the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, the sole four-time
champions in the soccer World Cup history, has exported the most
number of footballers throughout the world in the past years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Brazilian Football Association, Brazil has
contributed 2,148 footballers to more than 60 countries and
regions in the past eight and half years.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 326 Brazilian soccer players have flocked to 44
countries and regions in the European, American and Asian
continents in the first six months of the year, which almost
equals the number of players who went abroad in the whole year of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Their main destinations include Portugal, Spain, Japan, Germany
and the United States, while Finland, Indonesia and Macedonia,
where soccer is less developed, also showed strong interest in
importing Brazilian footballers.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians abroad are believed to be lured by envious
financial benefits as most of them only have a salary of some 600
U.S. dollars at home clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian exports are all welcomed all around the world as
they are adept in individual skills with strong stamina.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, Brazil boasts of a rich pool of
7,238 professional soccer players in the Southern American soccer
kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Negotiate with IMF on Suspended Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to
resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
over the key loan suspended three weeks ago, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi said Friday he had consulted with
IMF managing director who consented to send a mission here next
week for a review of the 215-million-U.S.-Dollar aid cut to the
east African country facing the general election this year.
</P>
<P>
A team from the World Bank and key bilateral and multilateral
donor and aid agencies would also be visiting the country for
similar talks, Moi disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The news sent positive signals to the foreign exchange market
where the Shilling recovered its worst beating in four years to
trade at a commercial mean of 65.85 against the Dollar -- a gain
of 4.6 percent from Thursday's close of 69.1.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based IMF suspended on August 1 its key loan to
Kenya, citing high-level corruption as a key reason.
</P>
<P>
The aid halt immediately created panic in Kenya's economy with
a three-week downward spiral of the Shilling, although the
Central Bank of Kenya has so far pumped in some 100 million
Dollars sold to commercial banks to stabilize the shock.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Cancel 2nd U.S. Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL)
announced today that it will cancel its flights to Los Angeles via
Seoul effective from September 1, the second U.S. route the
company was forced to cancel because of the "Category 2" rating
imposed on the Philippines by the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, PAL said that however, it will
continue to operate its popular non-stop daily flights from Manila
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, PAL said that it was suspending flights from
Manila to New York starting September 2. The airlines cited
significant losses arising from the effects of the Category 2
ruling on its operations as the reason for pulling out of both the
Manila-Seoul-Los Angeles and the Manila-New York routes.
</P>
<P>
Under the Category 2 rating imposed on the Philippines by the
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in 1995, any Philippine
carrier is summarily barred from increasing its flights as well as
introducing new services to the United States, unless it uses
aircraft wet-leased from Category 1 Countries, such as the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Wet-leasing an aircraft involves not only the plane itself but
also the flight deck crew. It is a prohibitively expensive deal
because it requires the payment in dollars for the aircraft, crew,
maintenance and insurance.

<HEADLINE> Mandela's Ex-Wife to Receive Legal Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
ex-wife of the South African President Nelson Mandela, will
appear at a closed inquiry by a special fact-finding group, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Winnie, President of the ruling African National Congress
(ANC) Women's League, is to answer questions of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) about some murder cases during
the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
A subpoena singed by Dumisa Ntsebeza, head of TRC's
investigative unit, has served on Winnie. However, no date has
been set for the inquiry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
TRC Acting Chairman Alex Boraine, speaking Friday at a press
conference in Cape Town, described Winnie as "a very key person
in the South African political landscape."
</P>
<P>
In another development, Boraine announced that TRC had also
invited former State President P.W. Botha and other former
ministers to testify in October at a special hearing into the
state security policy of the former apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Botha too would be subpoenaed if he refuses the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
The coming hearing reportedly would be preceded by an "armed
force public hearing." Members of the former South Africa
defense force, the ANC armed forces, Azanian People's Liberation
Army, the South Africa National Defense Force and the South
Africa police service would be invited.

LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's long-awaited tourism
policy will be launched at the end of this month following a
recent government approval, Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local paper quoted Deputy Tourism Minister Fidelis Mando
as saying here the new policy will change the approach to tourism
in Zambia because it recognizes the potential of tourism to the
economic development, providing for the participation of private
sector in the management and development of tourism in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"It is based on respect for environment, the habitat, wildlife
and interests of the local communities," Mando said on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anderson Mazoka, chairman of the Zambia National
Tourist Board (ZNTB) called for the formation of a committee to
market and double the number of tourists visiting Zambia in the
next three years from the current 263,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the special committee comprise the tourism
council, ZNTB and other players in the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Mzaoka said that time has come to stop talking about Zambia's
tourism in terms of potential but to utilize it for the benefit
of all.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Ousts Chang at Hamlet Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian Patrick Rafter
ousted top seed Michael Chang Friday night at the quarter-finals
of the Hamlet Cup at Commack, New York.
</P>
<P>
The eighth-seeded Rafter, who was ranked 14th in world, beat
world number two American Chang 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 in his warmup for
the U.S. Open starting next week.
</P>
<P>
Chang broke Rafter in the first game of their third set but
lost his own serve for a 1-1 tie. In the fourth game, Chang hit a
forehand long that allowed Rafter to overtake the lead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
In his next service game, Chang was down 0-40 but a Rafter
backhand error, a 146-kph ace and a stellar Chang forehand
crosscourt passing shot took it to deuce. Rafter used a forehand
half-volley to finally break for 5-1.
</P>
<P>
Rafter was down 15-40 while serving for the match, but Chang
mis-hit into the stands for 30-40 and was forced to opposite sides
of the court for three difficult retrievals with his third return
wide.
</P>
<P>
Rafter put the seal on the point by using his forehead to knock
home the high-bouncing ball for a "winner" into the open court.
</P>
<P>
After Chang blasted a forehand long, Rafter closed out the
match with a 145-kph ace.
</P>
<P>
Rafter improved his lifetime record against Chang to 2-5. The
two will meet again next month when the United States hosts
Australia in a Davis Cup semifinal in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Chang has never won the Hamlet Cup, despite playing it for five
of the past six years with the absence in 1995. He has been a
quarter-finalist all five years and advanced to the semis in 1992
and the final in 1993 where he lost to Marc Rosset.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Rafter will face Sweden's Thomas Enqvist,
who defeated Germany's Marc-Kevin Goellner 6-4, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> High Pollution in Lake Victoria Concerned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Lake Victoria is highly
polluted with over 980 kilograms of industrial waste and some 15
tons of domestic waste deposited annually in it, researchers have
said, according to a report from Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The pollution is high near the shores, V. Masanja and N. Mtega,
two academicians of the University of Dar es Salaam, told a
Southern African Mathematical Sciences (SAMSA) symposium in
Arusha on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A news dispatch from the northern Tanzanian town quoted
Masanja and Mtega as saying that they conducted a "mathematical
model", a research based on mathematics, to know the level of
pollution in the lake near Mwanza town and discovered that the
concentration of pollution differs from place to place.
</P>
<P>
Msanja, head of the Mathematics Department of the university,
said lack of treatment facilities and poor on-side sanitation
from domestic activities are major sources of pollution in the
lake.
</P>
<P>
There are in Mwanza town more than 56 industries, generating
effluents per day estimated at 6,500 cubic meters. "Unless
pollution is controlled, Lake Victoria can turn into a curse
instead of a blessing," participants of the symposium observed.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa. It is shared by
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.

PULAU PINANG (Malaysia), August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier
Li Peng arrived here today from Kuala Lumpur to continue his
four-day official visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from the capital city, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohammad bid farewell to Li Peng at the hotel
where the Chinese premier stayed.
</P>
<P>
Describing Li's visit as successful, Mahathir said, "During the
last two days, we had several meetings to exchange in-depth views
on a wide range of issues and reached consensus on a number of
important issues. There are no differences between Malaysia and
China."
</P>
<P>
He said Li's last visit to Malaysia seven years ago played an
important role in promoting trust and cooperation between the two
countries, believing his current visit would also make great
contribution to the all-round cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Thanking Mahathir and his government for warm welcome and
hospitality accorded to him and his delegation, Li Peng said, "The
several meetings between us were held in a very cordial
atmosphere. We have not only reached consensus on international
and regional issues of common concern, but also made new
achievements regarding bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
Li said that the friendly cooperation between China and
Malaysia not only has a strong basis, but also has a bright
future.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier once again conveyed to Mahathir warm
greetings from Chinese President Jiang Zemin, for that Mahathir
extended his thanks and requested Li to convey his best wishes to
Jiang and other Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Li and his entourage were seen off at the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport by Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Pulau Pinang International Airport, the
Chinese premier was greeted by State Chief Minister Koh Tsu Koon
and several state dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival in the state, Li visited the Penang
Development Corporation and the Motorola factory here.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Newspaper Blasts Japan for Mourning War Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today strongly condemned Japan for
mourning the war dead of World War II.
</P>
<P>
A commentary carried by the official newspaper Rodong Sinmun
said the mourning activities were conducted under the Japanese
government's sponsorship on the occasion of the 52nd anniversary
of the defeat of the Japanese imperialists.
</P>
<P>
"It is disgraceful and shameful to mourn those who died in the
war of aggression," it said.
</P>
<P>
Calling the allegation that Japanese imperialist aggressors had
played a "positive role" for Japan and Asia a "barefaced lie", the
commentary said "what the aggressors brought to the Japanese
people is only monstrous disasters, disgrace and ill fame as enemy
state."
</P>
<P>
"Japan's past crimes can never be distorted nor justified, and
seeking militarism again leads to their doom," it added.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM's Decision on Albanian Refugees Slammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian opposition parties today
slammed the country's Prime Minister Romano Prodi for trying to
delay the parliamentary-approved repatriation of some 3,000
Albanian refugees who fled to Italy earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Leading members of the Freedom Front opposition alliance
said in a joint statement that the government should discuss with
the opposition about the issue before making any decisions that
went beyond the parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Until just a few days ago, both Prodi and Interior Minister
Giorgio Napolitano had stood firmly for the parliamentary-approved
decree which fixed August 31 as the deadline for the return of the
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, Prodi announced Thursday that following an appeal by
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano, he would ask the
government for a delay in the repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Nano wrote to Prodi, persuading him to take the prevailing
Albanian situation into consideration and not to send back the
refugees immediately after August 31.
</P>
<P>
Terming Prodi's decision as a "surrender," the Italian
opposition alliance said, "There is no tension any longer in
Albania."

<HEADLINE> CT Scanning Questioned as Heart Attack Predictor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- CT scanning cannot predict
heart attacks and death from cardiovascular diseases accurately as
claimed earlier, a team of physicians here said.
</P>
<P>
The team studied 326 middle-aged to elderly people in the Los
Angeles area, using CT scanning for calcium deposits in the
cardio arteries, which had been claimed as an accurate indicator
of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study, which was published in the August
issue of the American Heart Association journal "Circulation",
cast doubt on the claim as it was found that even those with
little or no calcium in the cardio arteries can have heart attacks
and die of heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
The team said that the scanning results only predict future
bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Favors New Law to Debar Criminals from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral has strongly supported enacting a law to prevent criminals
from contesting elections and called for an all-out war against
crime and corruption in politics, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in Srinagar, Indian-held Jammu and
Kashmir, Gujral urged political parties to examine the possibility
of state funding of elections to make it more transparent.
</P>
<P>
Political parties in India are currently collecting election
funds by themselves, but the practice has led to rampant
corruption among politicians.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister suggested that a law should be framed making
it mandatory for contestants to various legislative bodies to
disclose details of whether they were convicted and jailed.
</P>
<P>
This would ensure that criminal elements were kept away from
democratic institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks in reference to the fact
that some corruption-tainted or even jailed politicians have
managed to contest in elections and win.

<HEADLINE> China, Georgia Further Improve Friendly Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIBILISI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shervardnadze said today Georgia is highly concerned with the
development in China, praising achievements made in the country's
reform.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, Shervardnadze
said relations between Georgia and China have developed smoothly
since they established diplomatic ties in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said that Georgia paid high tribute to China's foreign
policies, especially that of developing relations with small
countries.
</P>
<P>
Frequent contacts between leaders of the two countries had
established a good basis for bilateral ties and Georgia had had
great support from China since it declared independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Chinese for support at the United Nations
Security Council meeting on the resumption of Georgia's
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Sheravrdnadze said that his government would abide by the
principle of "one China" and support China in the Taiwan issue,
adding that Georgia would not seek official contacts with Taiwan
in any form.
</P>
<P>
He also said Hong Kong's return to China has set an example for
resolving territorial problems in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shervardnadze suggested that China, whose relations
with the Transcaucasus countries are developing, play a leading
role in holding bilateral or multilateral talks on reactivating
the "Ancient Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
He said the European-Asian corridor would help further improve
the ties between China and Central Asia and Transcaucasus
countries.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian praised the efforts to improve the Sino-Georgian
ties made by Shervardnadze, whose visit to China in June 1993 set
up a solid basis for stable development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed China had been holding the principles of respect
for other countries' sovereignty and independence, saying that the
Abkhazia issue was Georgia's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government would support Georgia in its
efforts to protect the state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said China is expecting to see national reunification,
stable politics and economic development in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China would support Shervardnadze's proposal of
"Peaceful Transcaucasia" which is aimed at resuming and
strengthening the overall cooperation in the Transcaucasus region
as well as jointly safeguarding the regional peace.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Shervardnadze on the preparatory work for the
15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which is an
important event for both China and the world.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 3 Months in Jail for Damaging Bernini Fountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sebastiano Intili, who damaged the
Bernini fountain in Rome's Plazza Navona, was sentenced today to
three months in prisonment and ordered to pay a fine of
undisclosed amount to the City Council.
</P>
<P>
Intili, 43, broke the tail of a marble sea monster on the
Plazza Navona as he dived off it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He had also to bear the court expenses of 2 million lire
(1,1120 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The court did not find the two other men who were arrested with
Intili guilty and set them free.
</P>
<P>
The three men were swimming and diving in the water under the
Four Rivers fountain designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in
1651. Intili climbed onto one of the four sea monsters and jumped
off, causing the tail to break into three pieces.
</P>
<P>
City officials said that it will cost about 15 million lire
(8,500 dollars) to repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a prank, " Intili told a judge Wednesday, "I had
gone out to get a sandwich. I saw the fountain and just felt like
jumping in (from it)."
</P>
<P>
Intili's lawyer, Aldo Ceccarelli, said that his client would
appeal the court decision and ask for compensation from the city
for the hurt on his foot he got when the fountain decoration broke
under him.
</P>
<P>
"I shall ask for 300 million lire (168,000 dollars), "
Ceccarelli said, "not only for the physical damage but also for
the moral damage that my client has suffered."

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration today
approved a request from the Archdiocese of Miami to sail a cruise
ship to Cuba taking Catholics to see Pope John Paul II when he
visits Cuba in next January.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, State Department spokesman James Rubin said
this was the only license so far approved for travel to Cuba for
the pope's five-day visit starting on January 20.
</P>
<P>
The license granted by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control would permit pilgrims to spend limited amounts of money in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration imposed the embargo in 1963 banning all
commerce with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that other requests would be considered on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Americans trying to visit Cuba have to go via third countries.
The cruise planned by the Miami Archdiocese will allow pilgrims to
travel directly from the United States to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Medical Devices to Steal Spotlight of Exports Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing enterprises producing
medical devices will get a prominent share of the spotlight in the
coming 82nd China Export Commodities Fair, a biannual grand event
in Guangzhou, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
five well-established enterprises of that type will compose a
delegation to demonstrate one cutting-edge aspect of Beijing's
high-tech industry, said Xu Xiaoxi, director of the Beijing
Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The move was proposed after the first Beijing computer group,
composed of several Beijing computer giants such as Founder, Stone
and legend, garnered numerous orders at the fair, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
She said that this year, the commission would set the medical
and computer groups as the most notable in the 60-member Beijing
delegation.
</P>
<P>
With the 10 booths and a product briefing conference during the
fair, the five medical device-producing enterprises will show
their key products to business people from all over the world, Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
The products include X-ray examination system, economical CT
scanners, accelerator, computerized breast-scan diagnosing
apparatuses and telephone-transmission ECG (electrocardiograph)
monitoring systems.
</P>
<P>
Exports of medical devices make up only a tiny portion of
China's annual four billion US dollars worth of exports of medical
products, said Zhao Chunhua, president of China chamber of
commerce of medicine and health product importers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing, with its high-tech advantages, boasts the
largest sales volume in each year's spring and autumn national
exhibitions of medical devices.

SANTIAGO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean fish catch stood at
4.587 million tons in the first seven months of this year, a 14.1
percent decrease over the same period last year, fishing
authorities said here today.
</P>
<P>
Although the capture of anchovy increased 42.6 percent and

The El Nino phenomenon, an abnormal meteorological happening,
had a negative impact on the survival of fingerlings and ova,
resulting in the future captures drop, the sources warned.

million U.S. dollars, a 4.6 percent increase over the same period

<HEADLINE> Capital Firm Reports Solid Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Yanhua Petrochemical Co
Ltd. reported a relatively satisfactory performance for the first
half year despite the sluggish domestic market, and released huge
expansion plans, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The company's H shares become listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in June this
year. The stock issue has brought the firm 232 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liu Haiyan, chairman of the company, said the firm's production
sales during the first half year reached 2.9 billion yuan (349
million US dollars), up 5.3 percent from the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Profits before tax and net profit for the period were 449
million yuan (54 million US dollars) and 300 million yuan (36
million US dollars) respectively, 17.3 percent and 6.2 percent
more than that of the first half year of 1996. Earnings per share
amounted to 0.13 yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said the performance was satisfactory, taking into account
the weak global petrochemical market and declining product prices
during the period. He attributed the growth to improved product
mix and enhanced operating efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Sales of higher value-added products of the firm during the
first half year almost doubled that of the corresponding period
last year, and the company developed nine new specialized resins
and plastics products, he said. Meanwhile, selling and
administrative spending declined by 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu said: "I'm confident that we can achieve the net profit
target of 684 million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the firm is to launch a big ethylene project, which
will expand its ethylene production capacity from 450,000 tons to
660,000 tons. The project is expected to gain formal approval from
related authorities in the near future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Yanhua is the largest producer of resins and plastics
in China, and one of the largest producers of ethylene of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Honduras' Archbishop Refuses To Command Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Oscar Rodriguez, archbishop
of Tegucigalpa and president of the Latin American Bishops Council
(CELAM), refused today to assume the command of the new civilian
police of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The Honduras Congress Tuesday approved the appointment of
Rodriguez as the chief of a national board overseeing the
transformation of the Honduran police.
</P>
<P>
Clergyman Pedro Drowing, general vicar of the Tegucigalpa
archdiocese and spokesman for Rodriguez, said that the archbishop
was not consulted before being appointed to the post.
</P>
<P>
The post of national police chief cannot be performed
simultaneously with his mission as the leader of the Honduras
Catholic Church, Drowing said.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has gone to Houston, the United States, for a medical
checkup and he will return Monday to Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
Vatican delegate in Honduras, Luigi Conti, said that Pope John
Paul II would not permit the CELAM head to be a police chief.
</P>
<P>
Canon law forbids clergymen to occupy government posts without
Vatican license. A similar limitation is established in the
Honduran constitution for all clergymen.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Rodriguez, 55 and a priest for 27 years, was elected
CELAM president in 1995 for a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran Congress amended the Constitution in last December
to transfer police, which in the past 33 years has been controlled
by the military, to the civilian power.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the archbishop to command the Honduran
police has caused controversy since some consider it illegal and
other see it as a way to facilitate the transition of the military
command to civilian dominion.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Relations Need New Spirit, Goal: Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said international relations need a new spirit and goal, namely,
partnership to attain progress, welfare and safety for all.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks here Friday night in his speech
at a state banquet in honor of visiting Zambian President Fredrick
Jacob Titus Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said Indonesia and Zambia as Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) members were obliged to constantly strive to create a new
order in the world that was more just and more responsible.
</P>
<P>
North-South cooperation was inevitable, he said, adding that in
the current era, all countries both the big and the small, the
rich and the poor, and the developed and the developing ones,
depended on each other.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto expressed his confidence that countries despite their
small capabilities would be powerful if they integrated into one
for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, Indonesia and Zambia had an
opportunity to enhance their bilateral economic cooperation
despite the current small trade volume between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the end of the cold war and the globalization had
caused the world to become freer and increasingly open in which
all nations had new opportunities to jointly create more peace,
welfare and justice in the world.
</P>
<P>
To materialize such a condition, it was important to enhance
South-South cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president, who arrived here Thursday for a four-day
state visit, held talks with Soeharto early Friday on developing
bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is scheduled to leave here for Singapore Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's currency baht Friday
further weakened, plunging to a record low on the local market as
the baht quoted at some commercial banks once exceeded 34 baht to
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The baht was traded at 33.25 to 34.05 against the dollar at
other local commercial banks, although the reference rate quoted
by the Thai Central Bank stood at 32.68.
</P>
<P>
The baht also was once traded at 34.10 to 34.30 against the
dollars at other commercial banks Friday, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The plunge was due to the recent disclosure by the Thai Central
Bank that it faced an outstanding currency forward obligations
totaling 23.4 billion dollars over the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the Central Bank will further dampen
investors' sentiment and the baht is expected to drop lower to 35
against the dollar in coming days.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Badaling Special Zone has
launched a two- to Three-year comprehensive program for the
protection of this most visited section of the Great Wall in the
northern outskirts of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The program includes two major projects, a Badaling
International Friendship Forest and a culture square around the
area, which averages more than 20,000 visitors a day, today's
China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the protection program, a culture square will be
built at the foot of the wall, where a market street and a parking
area now exist. The latter two have been attacked as distorting
the natural appearance of this section of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
The future square is suggested to contain an ancient-style
battlefield, statues of the famous people relating to the wall's
history and a forest of steles.
</P>
<P>
The scattered markets in the Badaling area will then be
concentrated into one trade center.
</P>
<P>
After a highway is completed late this year, the current
parking area will be removed and vehicles forbidden inside the
scenic spot, the paper quoted an official of the zone agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
At present there is only one road running through the scenic
spot, and all vehicles pass directly through the Great Wall
gateway.
</P>
<P>
According to the three-year blueprint, a more than 40 sq km
barren hill area along the west edge of the Badaling Great Wall
will be transformed into a forest park, with a man-made waterfall,
gardens and many other landscapes.

MADRID, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Emiliano Brembilla beat
the rainy weather to win the men's 400 meters freestyle at the
European Swimming Championships in Seville on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian destroyed Paul Palmer's hope of a third gold in the
pool when he overtook the pace-setter Briton at midway and touched
home first with a margin of more than two seconds against fellow
Massimiliano Rosolino.
</P>
<P>
Palmer was third after winning Tuesday's 200 meters freestyle

freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Brembilla clocked three minutes 45.96 seconds,

Rosolino, who finished second behind Palmer in the 200 meters
freestyle, took another silver in 3:48.11 and Palmer the bronze in
3:50.03.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Alexander Popov led Russia to victory

</P>
<P>
Alexander Goukov of Belarus and Agnes Kovacs of Hungary both

</P>
<P>
Goukov came from fourth at halfway to beat pace-setter Russian
Andrei Korneyev in the last length, adding the men's 200 meters
breaststroke crown to the 100 meters he won on Tuesday. Goukov
won in 2:13.90, half a second ahead of Korneyev.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs, who broke her own European record in the women's 200
meters breaststroke on Wednesday, took her second European crown
from 1995 double champion Brigitte Becue of Belgium by winning the
100 meters in 1:08.08.

<HEADLINE> China Aims for Better Art Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China will make more efforts to
enhance aesthetic education among the country's primary and middle
schools starting this year, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Turning the current examination-dominated education mode into a
quality-oriented one has aroused great attention in educational
circles in China, the paper quoted Liu Bin, vice-minister of the
State Education Commission (SEC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that aesthetic education plays a vital role in
fostering students' morality and interests.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, according to Liu, the SEC will set up art
lecture groups comprising aesthetic experts to train art teachers
among schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
On a conference marking the establishment of the groups
yesterday, 200 Chinese primary and middle school teachers of
aesthetic subjects received awards for their excellent work - the
first time that has happened since the People's Republic of China
was founded in 1949, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has mapped out its plan for developing aesthetic
education over the next few years, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
By the end of next year, a national network will be set up
focusing on teaching guidance for aesthetic education among
schools.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, all schools in regions that have popularized the
nine-year compulsory education are required to offer music and art
courses, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the state should also increase funding for
aesthetic education.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Angry Over U.S. Anti-Immigrant Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is strongly opposing
new anti-immigration actions being taken by the United States
along its border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mexican diplomatic sources said here today that Mexican Foreign
Minister Jose Angel Gurria has sent two notes to the
U.S. government over the actions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) announced
last week that from August 25, it would expand the first phase of
"Operation Rio Grande" between the U.S. city of Brownsville,
Texas, and the Mexican city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas.
</P>
<P>
The operation, aimed at "sealing" the border to prevent the
crossing of illegal immigrants, has been supported by a
considerable increase in the number of border agents (69 in the
first stage), and use of the most advanced military technology to
detect people illegally crossing at any time of the day.
</P>
<P>
In its notes, Mexico expressed concern over the recruitment of
a great number of inexperienced agents by the U.S. border patrol
for anti-immigration operations.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government said it was worried that these agents
lacked the necessary experience to perform anti-immigration work,
and they would trigger "an international incident between Mexico
and the United States."
</P>
<P>
The president of the College of the Northern Border, Jorge A.
Bustamante, said the aim of the expansion of U.S. anti-immigrant
operations was to palliate the dissatisfaction -- caused by the
U.S. military withdrawal along its border -- among those who
demanded a tougher immigration policy toward Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Has Links with 160 Countries Despite U.S. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has established links with
160 countries and absorbed a great amount of foreign investment
despite the long-term United States economic embargo, the official
Granma Daily said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba is blocked but it is not isolated," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The country has opened 85 embassies in the world, a
considerable increase over the 30 in the pre-revolutionary year of
1959, it noted.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries established relations with the island
country after 1993 when an economic crisis, mainly caused by the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union, hit Cuba, it added.
</P>
<P>
Besides the establishment of foreign ties with many countries,
Cuba also gained permanent representation in many international
organizations, it said.
</P>
<P>
It had experienced unceasing increases in foreign investment
and in the number of foreign tourists. More than one million
foreign tourists visited the country last year.
</P>
<P>
The 14th World Festival of Youth and Students, which was held
in Cuba recently with the attendance of 12,000 foreign guests,
demonstrated the solidarity between Cuba and the world, said
the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Sandinistas, Government to Sign Document on Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government and
the National Liberation Sandinista Front (FSLN) have agreed to
sign a law project on property next week to rid the country of a
major factor which often causes political instability.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Julio Centeno Gomez said, "I estimate that the
law project will be ready in four or five days to be submitted to
the persons who lead the policies in this matter for
consideration."
</P>
<P>
Centeno was quoted today by the "Nuevo Diario" newspaper as
saying that the document was drafted by the juridical
subcommission which President Arnoldo Aleman and Sandinista leader
Daniel Ortega created in February.
</P>
<P>
The subcommission comprises lawyers of the government and the FSLN,
the main opposition in the country.
</P>
<P>
The problem of property has been one of the biggest factors
which frequently lead to bloodshed and political instability in
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
When the Sandinistas ruled the country, they confiscated the
properties of the Somoza government officials and National Guard
officers through what was known as Decree 38, which the FSLN agreed
to annul now.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project, which has more than 70 articles, will
"benefit only the subjects of the social reform, those persons who
are qualified by the laws 85, 86 and 88," said Centeno.
</P>
<P>
Centeno said the project does not cover the properties in the
hands of Sandinista leaders and of the firms privatized by the
Public Sector National Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides considered that the Somoza family assets must not be
returned.
</P>
<P>
The project must be sent to the forum known as the National
Dialogue, where it is supposed to be subject to the "test of fire"
because there is resistance from a section of the government to
establish a political accord with the Sandinistas.

<HEADLINE> Two World Marks Fall at Belgian Athletics Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Kenyans shattered as many
world records at the annual Memorial Van Damme track and field
event, the third stop on the IAAF Grand Prix Golden Four circuit
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Komen went it alone on the way to clock a world record
time of 12 minutes 39.74 seconds in the 5,000 meters, beating the
10-day-old world mark of 12:41.86.
</P>
<P>
The previous mark was set by Haile Gebrelassie from Ethiopia at
the Zurich Grand Prix which was the second Golden Four event.
Komen asked race organizers to add the event to the Belgian meet.
</P>
<P>
Though Komen was the lonesome runner for most of the race, an
encouraging and appreciating crowd cheered him on and on.
</P>
<P>
Paul Tergat was second for most of the 10,000-meter race. He
overtook compatriot and pace-setter Paul Koech with two laps to go
and kicked home with the day's second world record.
</P>
<P>
His time of 26:27.85 was more than three seconds faster than
the world record time Gebrelassie clocked at the opening event of
the Golden Four in Oslo of Norway on July 4.
</P>
<P>
Tergat had two minutes for the last kilometer to beat the world
mark and he was cheered on by a capacity crowd that turned out on
the weekend after a morning drizzle and a whole day of overcast
cooled local temperatures.
</P>
<P>
"I just knew I was going to break that world record today in
Brussels," said a delighted Komen at the post-race briefing. "It
was in the air all night and even before going into the last
kilometer, I had the feeling that nothing could go wrong."
</P>
<P>
He said that he only expected Gebrelassie to better his record
again. "At this moment I see only one athlete who can break this
one and it's of course Gebrelassie."
</P>
<P>
The world record setter attributed the win to the spectators
and promised to come back next year.
</P>
<P>
Three more athletes had something else to celebrate from the
night.
</P>
<P>
Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, Gabriela Szabo of Romania and
Hicham el Guerrouj of Morocco all scored consecutive third
triumphs on the Golden Four circuit, winning their respective
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian, a disappointing fourth-place finisher at the
Athens Worlds, beat newly-crowned world champion Maurice Greene of
the United States again in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks scored a meet record of 9.90 seconds to win his
third Golden Four event, moving a step closer to sharing the
jackpot of 20 kilograms of gold offered by the circuit organizers.
</P>
<P>
The fourth and last stop of the Golden Four event will be held
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the fact that I can run good races during the
whole of the season," said 29-year-old Fredericks. "And it is
always fantastic to beat the world champion."
</P>
<P>
The Namibian sprinter said that today's win kept him in the
race for the Golden Four title.
</P>
<P>
Szabo overtook early leader Paula Radcliffe of Britain with 250
meters to go and sped home for the win which also kept her in the
race for the Golden Four title
</P>
<P>
Her time of 14:44.21 was also a meet record.
</P>
<P>
El Guerrouj kicked off only at the bell and never looked back
to tighten his grip over the Golden Four title. He won the
1,500-meter event on 3:28.92, still another meet record to fall on
the fast track in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Entering today's meet, there were three others who could be
candidates for the gold bullions. Yet off-form performance ended
their winning streaks.
</P>
<P>
Trine Hattestad of Norway, who won the Oslo and Zurich events,
fouled twice and tossed a 58.52-meter distance before pulling out
of the women's javelin throw. She finished ninth out of nine
competitors.
</P>
<P>
Deon Hemmings of Jamaica was beaten by Kim Batten of the United
States in the women's 400-meter hurdles while Allen Johnson of the
United States also lost his chance of chasing the gold as he was
defeated in the 110-meter hurdles by countryman Mark Crear with a
clocking of 13.20.
</P>
<P>
Wilson Boit Kipketer of Kenya, a world record setter at the
Zurich grand prix event, was unlucky when he was on a fast pace
and leading the 3,000-meter steeplechase. He lost balance jumping
off the last pool, only to give the lead to another Kenyan runner,
Moses Kiptanui, who won the race on 8:05.35.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24 current world champions and 16 Atlanta Olympic
titlists participated in today's meet.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meet, American sprinter and long jumper Carl
Lewis, winner of nine Olympic gold medals, bid farewell to the
Brussels stop of the IAAF Grand Prix circuit.

<HEADLINE> Testud Upsets Majoli to Advance to WTA Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Sandrine Testud of
France beat third seed and French Open champion Iva Majoli of
Croatia 7-5, 6-3 on Friday to enter the final of the 450,000 U.S.
dollar U.S. Women's Hardcourt Championships held at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Testud, ranked 18th in the world, will take on
the winner of tonight's second semifinal pitting fourth seed
Lindsay Davenport of the United States and fifth seed Amanda
Coetzer of South Africa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dry-up Period Ended in Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- This year's second round of
flooding washed over the Yellow River early this morning, ending
the seventh dry spell in the lower reaches of China's second
longest river.
</P>
<P>
Heavy flooding occurred in early August, ending the drought that
wreaked havoc on east China's Shandong Province for months. Huge
water demands along the riverbanks, however, soon dried up the
river again.
</P>
<P>
Major cities along the river, in particular those at the upper
or middle reaches, were setting water-use quotas so as to ensure
the supply of water in the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that efforts were to continue on water
resource management even though the waterflow had resumed.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Paid More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Salaries and wages in New
Zealand rose 2.5 percent in the year to June 1977, the biggest
annual increase in six years, Statistics NZ said today.
</P>
<P>
A big increase in teachers' salaries has contributed to the pay
rise. On average, a teacher now earns 6.5 percent more than one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Apart from teaching professionals, Salary and wage rates being
paid in the public sector rose 3.3 percent in the year, compared
with 2.2 percent for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Central government services had the highest industry group
increase in salary and wage rates in the year, rising 3.7 percent,
Statistics NZ said.
</P>
<P>
But manufacturing, an industry hit by poor performance in the
past year, recorded a lower-than-average annual increase of 2.1
percent, the office said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary, Russia Join Gold Medal Winners at Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Hungary joined
the gold medal winners at the 19th World University Games by taking
one gold each here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's gold came from women's individual epee as Timea Nagy beat
Karina Aznavourian of Russia 15-13 in the finals.
</P>
<P>
Russia took the women's gymnastics team event with a total of
110.537 points. The United States snatched the silver medal at 108.986
points, followed by Japan in the third place with a total of 108.624
points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's team, consisting of young and unexperienced
gymnasts, had a slow start in their first event of vault and finished
only fouth at 108.362 points.
</P>
<P>
In the fencing competition, Nagy is the brightest star on Friday.
She put up a steady performance and sailed all the way into the final.
</P>
<P>
Her rival in the final was Karina Aznavourian of Russia. Nagy was
more aggressive and quicker than Aznavourian. After an exciting
battle, Nagy finally edged Aznavourian 15-13 for the title.
</P>
<P>
The level of the women's epee competitions were so high that Cuba's
gold and silver medalists at last month's world championships at Cape
Town were eliminated before the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shaoqi, a World Cup winner from China, finished only sixth in
the event. She said that she was not physically strong enough to
follow the pace of her rival and that explained her early exit from
the competitions.
</P>
<P>
The group competitions of the football tournament ended at Palermo
today with eight teams from four groups qualifying for the second
round.
</P>
<P>
China, the first team to be ensured of a berth in the second round,
lost 3-1 to the United States. The American team finished as the
winners of the group which also includes Nigeria and Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Italy scored their second victory, beating Britain 3-1 and
also advanced into the second round. The other qualifiers from group
A are the Brazilians who beat Iran 5-1.
</P>
<P>
In group B, Ireland edged Japan by better goal difference to finish
as runners-up. Ukraine won the group with 5 points.
</P>
<P>
The group C saw the Netherlands and South Korea advance into the
next round. The two teams fought to a 1-1 draw to garner 5 points
each. South Africa and Uruguay were eliminated from the competitions.
</P>
<P>
The tennis tournament continued at Palermo on Friday. The men's
top-seeded player Yoog Yong Il of South Korea sailed into the third
round after beating Pablo Contardo of Chile.
</P>
<P>
The women's top-seed Wang Shi-Ting also entered the last 16 with a
6-4, 6-2 victory over Ding Ding of China.
</P>
<P>
The Universiade continued on Saturday with fencing, gymnastics,
volleyball, basketball and tennis.
