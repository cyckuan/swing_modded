<HEADLINE> German Upper House Rejects Tax Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany's upper house of parliament,
controlled by the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD), today
rejected as expected the Bonn government's 30 billion mark (17.6
billion U.S. dollar) tax reform bill.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesrat described the government's 1999 tax reform
package as financially shaky, socially imbalanced and off-target
in economic policy terms.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel refuted the criticism
during the debate, saying the plans showed social balance and
would give relief to wage earners.
</P>
<P>
On June 26, the bill is expected to be presented to the
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, where Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's center-right coalition government enjoys a 10-seat
majority. If the Bundestag passes the bill, the Bundesrat will
have to resolve the matter by mediation.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and the Bonn government held negotiations on a
compromise in late April, which ended in failure.

<HEADLINE> Italy's No.2 Most Wanted Mafia Boss Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALERMO, Sicily, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Pietro Aglieri, the
notorious No.2 Mafia godfather, was arrested this morning in a
raid by the police at Bagheria near Palermo.
</P>
<P>
Natale Gambino and Giuseppe La Mattina, two mob hitmen, were
also arrested in the sting which involved around 100 police
officers and 200 agents.
</P>
<P>
The operation was hailed as a severe blow to the organized
crime gangs and as the most important Mafia arrest since that of
Sicilian boss Giovanni Brusca last year.
</P>
<P>
"This very important success is the concrete proof that the
state is fully committed to the fight against the Mafia," said
deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni.
</P>
<P>
Aglieri has been accused of involvement in the car bomb
killings of magistrates Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone in
1992 as well as of former European parliamentarian and leading
Christian Democratic politician Salvo Lima who was gunned down in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
Aglieri, who will be 38 in three days time, has been sentenced
in absentia to life in prison for the murder of judge Antonino
Scopelliti in August 1991 and to 12 years for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
La Mattina has also been sentenced to life while Gambino has
been sentenced to 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Aglieri had been on the run since December 1989 and is
considered by investigators to be the right-hand man of Bernardo
Provenzano, the most wanted Mafia boss still at large, and ally of
godfather Salvatore "The Beast" Riina, who was captured in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Wants to See Tangible Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government wants to
see tangible results in the forthcoming direct negotiations
between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said today.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides, who is currently in the United States to meet
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, made the remarks at
the National Press Club in Washington, according to Cyprus News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government "would have preferred if these
negotiations were better prepared in advance and common ground
narrowing the gap between the position of the two sides were to
be established."
</P>
<P>
If negotiations were to collapse, he said, "this will
increase the people's frustration since they have built
expectations for a positive outcome."
</P>
<P>
Failure at the talks, he warned, would "erode faith in the
negotiating process and give an opportunity to hard-lines from
both sides to gain an advantage."
</P>
<P>
If the Turkish Cypriot side comes to the negotiating table
"with the political will to be constructive and ready to
negotiate a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem in a
spirit of give-and-take, then peace and reconciliation can at
last be achieved in Cyprus", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Cyprus and the Greek Cypriot community
understand fully the anxieties of the Turkish Cypriots. Our aim
is not to dominate," he said. He called on the Turkish side to
acknowledge that the legitimate concerns of the Greek Cypriots
must also be met to help find a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also underlined the need to have Turkey
convinced of the advantages it would gain from a resolution of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
"A great number of strategic interests for the western world
are at stake. Turkey must be convinced by her friends and allies
how much she stands to gain from a solution of the Cyprus
problem," Kasoulides told journalists.
</P>
<P>
A Cyprus solution, he pointed out, will have "a tremendous
impact on Greek-Turkish relations."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to issue
invitations to Clerides and Denktash for face-to-face
negotiations scheduled to be held in early July.
</P>
<P>
The two Cypriot community leaders have not met since October,
1994, when they held two rounds of informal talks under the
U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> OAU To Set up Radio Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) --Ministers of information of the 53
member countries of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) are
due to meet in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, from June 17 to 19 to
discuss information and communication issues affecting the
continent, the OAU spokesman of Ibrahim Dagash said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''Major issues which will dominate debate will be the
program of action for 1997-99 of the Inter-Governmental Council
for Communication in Africa (ICC), privatisation of the Pan
African News Agency (PANA) and the setting up of an OAU radio
broadcasting station.''
</P>
<P>
The OAU, which has PANA as its print media agency, now intends
to establish radio transmission to broadcast programs under the
title of ''Voice of Africa''.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''such a project is very important at the moment
because the OAU is trying to be very relevant and to be known to
the ordinary African.''
</P>
<P>
''The radio, we believe, is still the most far-reaching medium
accessible to the African majority,'' he said.
The radio station is likely to be based in Ethiopia.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Nine of the European Union's 15
prime ministers have gathered in the southern Swedish city of
Malmo for a European Social Democratic party congress.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 delegates have attended the three-day conference
since Thursday where leaders of Europe's social democrats have
been trying to harmonize their ideas ahead of an EU summit in
Amsterdam on June 16-17.
</P>
<P>
Employment, environment, education, and EU enlargement are the
top four fields social democrats must deal with, said Swedish
Prime Minister Goran Persson at the opening session of the
congress.
</P>
<P>
After Tony Blair's Labor Party won the British election and
Lionel Jospin's Socialists followed with a win in the French
election last weekend, 13 of the 15 EU member states are now
governed by center or center-left administrations.
</P>
<P>
But the shadow of the European Union's single currency hung
over the conference, with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok and Persson

economic and monetary union.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Voices Concern Over Radioactive Lobsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has expressed
grave concern over the "objectionable discharges" from a British
nuclear plant, which may have turned some lobsters in the Irish
Sea to become radioactive.
</P>
<P>
Irish Minister of State at the Department of Transport and
Energy Emmet Stagg was quoted by press reports from Dublin as
saying today that he was deeply concerned about the high levels of
radioactive Technetium 99 in the Irish Sea close to Britain's
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.
</P>
<P>
"I will pursue these issues relentlessly with the British
authorities and demand an early resolution to these objectionable
discharges and other problems," Stagg said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister also noted that he had requested an early
meeting with British government officials "to pursue this specific
problem."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) has repeatedly
dismissed the Irish government's allegations that discharges from
the plant were turning lobsters radioactive.
</P>
<P>
The Dublin government, which has long been worried about
discharges from the Sellafield nuclear plant, in February called
on the British ambassador to Ireland to lodge a complaint after
two incidents within 24 hours at the British nuclear plant.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Threatens to Ban Beef Imports From EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government has
threatened to block beef imports from the other European Union
(EU) countries unless they agree to implement anti-BSE or mad cow
disease measures in their countries before July 22.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham reportedly said in
a written statement to parliament that the British government
would ban beef imports from the other EU countries, which do not
apply the same controls against the BSE as Britain.
</P>
<P>
"I would very much prefer to have Europe-wide regulations
enforced, but if agreement cannot be reached at the (EU) council
of agriculture ministers on that date (July 22), I will have to
act unilaterally," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is no game. This is no bluff. I am in earnest in making
this announcement. The draft orders are in my briefcase," he said.
"It is nothing to do with protectionism. It is based on very
important advice to safeguard public health."
</P>
<P>
The British minister explained, "I thought it was an absurd
situation, with all the rigorous controls on beef in this country,
we are importing beef not subject to the same safeguards."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EU Commission officials reportedly said today that
if Britain acted on its own, it would be illegal.

<HEADLINE> Italian Generals Reported To Have Committed Human Rights Violations in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 6 (Xinhua)--An islamic court in north
Mogadishu has invited three Italian generals to appear in court
to answer allegations of human rights violations during their
activities as part of the U.N. multi-national forces operation of
UNOSOM.
</P>
<P>
The invited generals are. C.Fiore, Bruno Loi and Gambiero
Rossi who each has been the commander of the Italian contingent
of UNOSOM in separate times.
</P>
<P>
The invitation of the court came after a local organization,
the Somali Intellectuals Society (SIS), has submitted to the
court a complaint against the behaviors of the Italian military
personnel towards the Somali nationals in north Mogadishu,
Jowhar, Balad and Aden Yabal districts of Middle Shabelle Region.
The organization has accused the Italians for carrying out human
rights violations such as killing, rape, torture and propertty
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The intellectuals organization said these violations were
conducted by a brigade from the Italian regular army known as
BIS. The SIS also said that a number of Somalis have died while
many more others are still suffering from the effects of the
human roghts violation committed by the Italian army during their
stay in Somalia in 1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
A local human rights organization, Dr Ismail Jumale Human
Rights Center, has supported the SIS complaint and said they have
all the neccessary evidences to prove the mal-behavior of the
Italians. Hassan Shire Sheikh, one of the two co-chairing persons
of the human rights in north Mogadishu, said photos show somalis
being tortured and others who have been buried from the waist to
the legs and being beaten on the head by two Italian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The human rights organization has called the Italian govenment
to take the responsibility and conduct an official investigation
on the allegations by taking those reponsible to justice and pay
compensations about the human lives loss, torture and the
destruction of properties.

Fast-Growing Computer Market in Kenya
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of enthusiastic Kenyans
swarmed into the sixth Africa Information Technology Exhibitions
and Conferences (AITEC) which is to end here later today, a symbol of
the fast-expanding computer market in Kenya and the continent.
</P>
<P>
The three-day AITEC, the largest since it started in Harare
in 1987, attracted 67 exhibitors this year with the most advanced
software, hardware, telecommunication systems and office
equipment displayed and more than 2,000 visitors coming in a day.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 AITEC was attended by 30 exhibitors with more than
7,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a resounding success... The outstanding feature
of the show, besides tremendous exposure of the internet, is the
atmosphere of friendship and cooperation between exhibitors and
visitors," said Sean Moroney, head organizer of AITEC.
</P>
<P>
"All exhibitors have been very pleased with quality of
visitors and many have reported positive sales results already,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenya-based Africa Online, a premier internet
service provider in Africa with offices in Ghana, Cote D'Ivoire,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe, their visitors are curious about
the new technological advancement and most of them are keen on
doing serious business.
</P>
<P>
"We have sold over 10 subscriptions already," said a
representative of the firm.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big potential of the computer market in both
Kenya and Africa," a manager from the Comtech System Limited
company, one of all the seven local dealers here for world-famous
Compaq, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimism. The market here is very strong and
expands very fast," he said. His company sold 500 computer sets
in Kenya last year.
</P>
<P>
Computech, another local dealer of Compaq, sold some 1,000
computer sets in 1996. Compaq now holds more than 20 percent
share of the Kenyan computer market.
</P>
<P>
Now there are more than 300 information technology companies
in Kenya which holds 60 percent of the computer market in the
eastern African region partly as a result of the economic
liberalization in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Duties on imported computer-related products stand at
five percent, the lowest in east Africa, said an IBM officer at
the show.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are estimatedly 240,000 computer sets
operating in Kenya. The Internet users reached 5,000 in Nairobi
with a total of 11 internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has introduced a number of specialized
courses such as computer science, information technology and
management information services in national polytechnics and
other technical training institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The computer companies participating at the show also include
Carl Bro, Gath Management, Abacus, Modern Business
Communications, Microsoft, Copycat, DEC and other giants in the
field.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Raises Interest to Curb Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (xinhua) -- The Bank of England's newly
appointed monetary policy committee raised official rates to 6.5
percent from 6.25 percent after its meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The committee spent a whole day Thursday discussing interest
rates and announced its decision at noon today, said reports.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since the central bank was nationalized
in 1945 that it had changed interest rates without being
instructed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The bank said recent economic data were consistent with the
view it took in its Inflation Report last month that "on present
evidence, there is still likely to be a need for some further
moderate tightening of policy in the months ahead."
</P>
<P>
"The committee accordingly voted to raise the bank's reporate
by 0.25 percent to 6.25 percent," the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) had urged the bank
to hold fire on interest rates until after next month's budget.
</P>
<P>
With its latest survey of retailers, the CBI said that annual
growth in sales volumes fell to its lowest rate for a year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown in sales growth reported in May is disappointing
for retailers," said Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's
distributive trades panel.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey indicated that looking at the retail sector
as a whole, the three month average balance of retailers reporting
higher sales volumes stood at 32 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
It showed that "underlying sales remain on a firmly upward
track and retailers are optimistic about business over the short
term," Eperon added.
</P>
<P>
Although the underlying trend in retail sales remained on an
upward track, the CBI said that inflationary pressures were still
being restrained by intense price competition among retailers.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the bank's announcement, Britain's two
biggest lenders, the Abbey National and Halifax, upped mortgage
rates by 0.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the action to tighten the monetary stance,
taken with the aim of meeting the government's inflation target,
"offers the best chance of achieving continued growth in output
and employment at a sustainable pace."

<HEADLINE> Impact of Technology on Futures, Options Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Futures and Options Association
(FOA) published today a study into the broad technology issues
facing futures and options market participants, exchanges,
regulators and system providers.
</P>
<P>
The FOA is a London-based trade association for firms,
institutions and exchanges involved in futures and options
business.
</P>
<P>
It has an international membership of 200 banks and other
financial institutions, commodity trade houses, brokers,
exchanges, clearing houses, fund managers, corporate treasuries
and specialist firms which provide legal and accountancy services
to market participants.
</P>
<P>
The study is the first of its kind to access the impact of
technology on the futures and options industry and the changes
likely to take place over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
It provides a valuable insight into the issues facing various
segments of the market and their participants.
</P>
<P>
Technology promises to confer a competitive advantage on those
willing to incur the substantial risks and costs of being at the
forefront of developments.
</P>
<P>
But it will cut out those middle-men in the industry who
provide no more than a data-routing processing services, according
to the study.
</P>
<P>
It said that technology has the potential to lower costs and
enhance service levels, but the lack of industry standards will
hamper this trend.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jenkins, chairman of the FOA, said at the Fourth
International Derivatives Conference which ended today, "Despite a
preference by many exchanges for open outcry trading, it is
supported by the sophisticated use of technology, placing the
industry in the vanguard of innovation."
</P>
<P>
"But the industry is changing as fast as technology, and this
poses particularly difficult issues, which will need to be tackled
now," he added.

<HEADLINE> 2,252 PKK Rebels Killed in Turkey's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish high-ranking military
officer said today that 2,252 rebels of the illegal Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed since the Turkish government
troops launched cross-border military operations in northern Iraq
on May 14.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Erol Ozkasnak, secretary
general of the Turkish General Staff, said that the Turkish
security forces also wounded 289 PKK guerrillas in their military
campaign, which is still going on in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish incursion followed a request for aid by Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mesud Barzani to attack
the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Ozkasnak said that 95 military personnel, including 13
officers and 21 village guards were killed and 244 others wounded
in the massive military operations.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also captured a large quantity of various
kinds of weapons worth at least 2.65 million U.S. dollars from
the PKK camps and bases in northern Iraq, said Ozkasnak.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Turkish government troops had
controlled the PKK camps in the areas of Sinath, Haftanin,
Hayirsiz Dag, Beyaz Dag, Haruna, Metina, Zap, Gara Dagi in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Attachi, leader of the PKK, was quoted by a newspaper
as saying in Lebanon Monday that his group would attack Israeli
and U.S. targets in Turkish cities and tourist areas.
</P>
<P>
Attachi said that his organization would "carry out operations
against Israeli targets in Istanbul (Turkey's largest city), and
elsewhere in Turkey and against the U.S. enemy interests."
</P>
<P>
More than 23,000 people, including PKK members, civilians and
government troops, have been killed in conflicts since the PKK
started a separatist war for self-rule in eastern and
southeastern Turkey in August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Kohl Urge Closer UK-German Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl both expressed the hope
today for closer ties and cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
During their talks of two hours in the German chancellory, the
two leaders discussed issues concerning the single European
currency, the euro, which is planned to be launched from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among topics of their discussion were also the meeting of NATO
leaders scheduled for early July in Madrid and the summit meeting
of the world's top seven industrialized nations in Denver, the
Unites States.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived in Bonn from a meeting of Europe's Social
Democrats in Melmo, Sweden. He was welcomed by Kohl for his first
meeting with a foreign head of government since taking office a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
Before their meeting, Kohl told reporters that he saw the talks
with Blair as an expression of their common will to strengthen
bilateral ties. For Germans it was of fundamental importance to
travel the path to the future "in partnership with our British
friends as we have done in the last 40 years," said Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Blair stressed that a warm and strong UK-German relationship
was in the interest not only of the two countries, but also of
Europe and the world.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also expressed confidence that the upcoming European Union
summit meeting in Amsterdam 10 days later would be successful.
Blair said Britain would work hard for the success of the summit,
which is to prepare for the EU enlargement to Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said that EU expansion was "vitally
important for peace and stability in the world."

<HEADLINE> Germany to Suspend Repatriating Refugees From  Serbian-Controlled Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany will not for the time being
force the return of Bosnian refugees originating from
Serbian-controlled territory, it was decided at a meeting of
interior ministers today.
</P>
<P>
Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther and his counterparts
from Germany's 16 states agreed that the return of Bosnian and
Croatian refugees to their homeland that is now Serbian-controlled
was a sensitive issue. Therefore, repatriation of them "should be
regarded as low priority," they said.
</P>
<P>
Germany has taken in about 320,000 Bosnian refugees, about
30,000 of them having voluntarily left. About 150,000 of the
refugees remaining in Germany were from the Serbian-controlled
territory.
</P>
<P>
Kanther described the refugees as Germany's "temporary guests"
who would eventually have to return to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He also denied allegations of mass expulsions of Bosnian
refugees, saying only 269 people had so far been forced to return,
about half of whom had criminal records.

<HEADLINE> Troops, Rebels Confront in Capital of Republic of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Confrontation continued today in the
capital of the Republic of Congo between troops loyal to President
Pascal Lissouba and the rebels supporting former President Denis
Sassou Nguesso, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The French ambassador, who returned to Brazzaville from Paris
this morning, was escorted to the French embassy by French
soldiers stationed in the city, reported Agence France-Presse
(AFP).
</P>
<P>
Brazzaville is now divided into two parts, one controlled by
the supporters of Lissouba, and the other by those of Nguesso, who
set up a confrontation line along the Avenue of Peace, the city's
main thoroughfare, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Gunfires were heard throughout the day today, after the
government imposed a curfew Thursday evening following one day of
fighting between the soldiers supporting the two factions, said
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Telephone connection between Brazzaville and the outside is now
cut by the government, who accused the rebels of creating a chaos
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Government troops, backed by armored vehicles, surrounded the
residence of Nguesso Thursday morning and clashed with gunmen
protecting the former president, who ruled Congo from 1979 to 1992
and is now running for the presidential election scheduled for
July.
</P>
<P>
Some government troops have reportedly rallied with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Congo was plunged into chaos in 1993 after holding its
legislative election, whose results were disputed by supporters of
Nguesso. Thousands of people were killed in the violence in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Supports Establishment of Arab Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 6 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian diplomat stressed here
today his country's support for the establishment of an Arab
common market aimed at counteracting what the Arabs fear of an
Israeli economic hegemony in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Adel Al-Khodri, Egypt's ambassador to Lebanon, met with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz in the latter's office
today.
</P>
<P>
He said after the meeting that the discussions were
"concentrated on the Arab economic coalition" mentioned by Syrian
Vice-President Abdel Halim Khaddam here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We in Egypt are totally supporting the establishment of an
Arab common market," Al-Khodri said, adding that Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak is doing his best "to push the idea."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Egyptian government has begun seriously
thinking about the idea after it was put forward at first by Arab
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian envoy said that the idea is currently being
studied by Egypt and Syria in detail and the two countries will
present it, as the first stage, to a conference of the Damascus
Declaration states, which is to be held in the Syrian capital on
June 25.
</P>
<P>
But the diplomat denied that his country has taken a position
on an Arab economic conference, which was raised by Syria to
replace the Middle East economic summit scheduled for November in
Doha, Qatar, to which Israel is invited.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and
other Lebanese officials here Thursday, the Syrian vice-
president stressed the need for an Arab economic coalition which
would help Arab countries "face the various developments that we
are currently undergoing."
</P>
<P>
He said both Syria and Egypt had decided to prepare a joint
working paper to be submitted later this month to a foreign
minister meeting of the Damascus Declaration states, which
include the two countries and the six Gulf Arab states.

<HEADLINE> Low-Cholesterol Eggs Produced in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek scientists have produced
low-cholesterol eggs with no change to taste or smell.
</P>
<P>
The eggs, known as Omega Eggs, were reportedly created on an
experimental basis on the premises of the American Farm School by
scientists from the Veterinary Department of Thessaloniki
University in northern Greece, according to the newspaper Athens
News today.
</P>
<P>
The eggs contain very low levels of cholesterol and high
quantities of Omega 3 fatty acid, which help the human body form
chemicals know as prostaglandins, which lower the coagulation of
the blood, thus preventing blood clots.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Greek scientists as saying that Omega 3
acids lower arterial pressure while relieving the danger of
arthritis, high blood pressure, eczema and even some types of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that no genetic engineering or hormone tampering
was involved in making the Omega Eggs, whose high levels of
unsaturated fatty acids were achieved through a special feeding
program for hens at the school.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany announced today that it would
put activities of the Scientology organization under the scrutiny
of the intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther and his counterparts
from Germany's 16 states made the decision at a meeting after
hearing reports on operations in Germany of the organization,
which was founded in the United States in 1954.
</P>
<P>
Kanther said that the country's intelligence service, the
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, had concluded from
collected information that the Scientology organization aimed at
winning political power and influence to influence society in an
"absolutist" way.
</P>
<P>
The interior chiefs agreed that a surveillance report should be
presented in a year.
</P>
<P>
No details concerning the surveillance were released. Kanther
ensured that there would be no "witch hunt" or moves to proscribe
the organization.
</P>
<P>
The Scientology organization does not have religious status in
Germany and has been judicially proclaimed a profit-oriented
enterprise. It has protested strongly against its treatment by
German authorities, comparing it to that imposed by Nazis on Jews.
</P>
<P>
Scientology supporters today lodged protest in Bonn and other
German cities. The organization also vowed to resort to legal
steps against the interior ministers' decision.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Threatens to Ban Beef Imports From EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government has
threatened to block beef imports from the other European Union
(EU) countries unless they agree to implement anti-BSE or mad cow
disease measures in their countries before July 22.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham reportedly said in
a written statement to parliament that the British government
would ban beef imports from the other EU countries, which do not
apply the same controls against the BSE as Britain.
</P>
<P>
"I would very much prefer to have Europe-wide regulations
enforced, but if agreement cannot be reached at the (EU) council
of agriculture ministers on that date (July 22), I will have to
act unilaterally," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is no game. This is no bluff. I am in earnest in making
this announcement. The draft orders are in my briefcase," he said.
"It is nothing to do with protectionism. It is based on very
important advice to safeguard public health."
</P>
<P>
The British minister explained, "I thought it was an absurd
situation, with all the rigorous controls on beef in this country,
we are importing beef not subject to the same safeguards."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EU Commission officials reportedly said today that
if Britain acted on its own, it would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Kiely, spokesman for EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler, said in Brussels today, "As in all cases where a
government does something which is not in conformity with EU law,
you start out with infringement procedures and possibly end up in
the Court of Justice."

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Down to 4.8 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
U.S. was down further in May to 4.8 percent, resulting from the
second-longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department said today that payrolls rose by
138,000 jobs, the smallest increase in eight months. However, that
followed a huge 323,000 gain in April, the largest in 14 months.
The figure in April was revised up from a previous estimate of
just 142,000.
</P>
<P>
Much of the May job gains came in services. Construction
employment also rose by 23,000 jobs after declining in April. But
construction gains in the first five months of the year averaged
slightly below the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of factory jobs was largely unchanged over the past
two months, slipping by 5,000 after gaining 2,000 in April.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the jobless rate was 3.8 percent for
adult men and 4.5 percent for adult women. For all Blacks, the
rate was 10.3 percent and for Hispanics, 7.4 percent. But for
Black male teens, it was as high as 32.6 percent.
</P>
<P>

president.
</P>
<P>
Today's report also showed a 4-cent increase in workers'
average hourly earnings to 12.19 dollars, 3.8 percent higher than
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Noting the six years of growth, U.S. President Bill Clinton
welcomed the report as an endorsement of his policies.
</P>
<P>
"The American economy has now added 12.3 million new jobs since
I took office, and unemployment has now been below 6 percent for
almost three years," Clinton said in a statement today. "America's
economy is the strongest it has been in a generation."

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti MP, Wife Shot on Way Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti parliamentary
member and his wife were shot by an unknown gunman today while
they were driving back home in the southern outskirts of Kuwait
city, but they escaped the assassination, Kuwait News Agency
(Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Al-Neibari was hit twice with one bullet on his
right shoulder and the other on the lower jaw and his wife was
also hit on her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
They were immediately rushed by a private car to Al-Adan
hospital to the south of Kuwait city where medical sources said
their conditions were stable.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time a gun shooting incident occurred in
Kuwait this year. On April 9, a 15-year-old student shot twice
and seriously injured his science teacher Mutaz Mahmoud Ibrahim,
35, in Asmaei Secondary School campus for failing him in
geology.
</P>
<P>
The reason of the gunman's attempt to kill the parliamentary
member is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, who rushed to the hospital after he was
informed about the assassination bid, said the attack
"constitutes a discord which doesn't target a specific person or
some people, but all Kuwaiti people and the state of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked when I heard the news," he said, adding that "I
hope the Ministry of Interior will stop those who try to incite
this discord and unveil their identities."
</P>
<P>
On whether this assassination attempt was linked to organized
crime, the minister said "I assure you it is a discord targeting
the Kuwaiti people."
</P>
<P>
Many Kuwaitis have been keeping firearms and explosives left
over after the Gulf War in 1991, although government authorities
repeatedly urged people who still keep illegal weapons to
hand them over.

organizations as the existing Urban Council, Regional Council and
District Boards cease to function on June 30, 1997, a PLC source
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the bills, the Provisional Urban Council and the
Provisional Regional Council will each consist of not more than 50
members to be appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR, and
each of the Provisional District Boards will be composed of not
more than 40 members also to be appointed by the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
The provisional district organizations will therefore operate
with the same statutory powers, functions and framework, and adopt
the same procedures of deliberation and modus operandi as their
predecessors, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The fourth bill of the passed second package, the Legislative
Council Commission (Amendment) Bill, aims to facilitate
administrative support to the legislature of the HKSAR after June
30, according to Michael Suen, secretary for policy coordination
of the Chief Executive's Office of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He told the lawmakers here today that "the purpose of the bill
is to implement the recommendations of the Working Group on
Administrative Matters of the PLC to enable the continuing
application of the ordinance after June 30, and to make
transitional arrangements arising from the establishment of the
PLC and its supporting structure.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting also proceeded with the first and second
readings of the Immigration (Amendment) (N0.3) Bill 1997, the Hong
Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill 1997 and the Judicial
Service Commission (Amendment) Bill 1997, and decided to adjourn
the debate on the three bills for further scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Miss Elsie Leung, secretary of justice of the future HKSAR,
expressed the hope that the PLC members can pass the three bills
before the July 1 handover.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the lawmakers at the meeting about the amendment
immigration bill, Miss Leung said "the bill seeks to provide for
the status of the permanent resident together with the right of
abode in the HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
According to Miss Leung, the bill seeks to provide for: the
various categories of the permanent resident of the HKSAR and the
procedure of implementation; the circumstances in which the right
of abode may be lost and the right to land in HK after the loss of
such right; the transitional arrangements for those who are not of
Chinese nationality but are permanent residents of HK before its
handover; and the definitions or their amendments of certain
expressions in the bill.
</P>
<P>
Article 24 of the Basic Law stipulates that there are six
categories of permanent residents who have the right of abode in
the HKSAR, Miss Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that there is a pressing need to have the
bill enacted before July 1, 1997 by the PLC after examination,"
she said, noting that the bill on the right of abode, which is an
important task of the HKSAR, affects practically each and every
resident in the HKSAR. "Early legislation can ally people's
concern," she added.
</P>
<P>
As to the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill
1997, Miss Leung said the main purpose of moving the bill is to
include the provision of Article 90 in the Hong Kong Court of
Final Appeal Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the Chief Justice of the Court of
Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court of the HKSAR
shall be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of the
region with no right of abode in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the Judicial Service Commission (Amendment) Bill
1997, Miss Leung told the lawmakers that the purpose of the bill
is to ensure that the first party of judges of the HKSAR is
smoothly named.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, the lawmakers also resumed the debate
on a motion on the Transitional Budget for 1997-1998, which was
moved by the Chief Executive's Office in early May. The PLC
finally gave its support to the Transitional Budget for 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
Most of the legislators noted in their speeches that the
transitional budget fully accords with the established principles
of financial prudence and the relevant provisions in the Basic
Law, and seeks to ensure that on its establishment, the HKSAR
government has healthy fiscal reserves to meet the needs for
medium- and long-term development.
</P>
<P>
The PLC's House Committee opened its eighth session here this
afternoon after the one-day plenary meeting of the PLC closed its
doors.

<HEADLINE> Increase In Charitable Activities In Shanghai </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Afghan Situation Takes Dramatic Turns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Since middle of May, the
situation in northern Afghanistan has taken a few dramatic turns
like a Hollywood action suspense movie.
</P>
<P>
What looked like a swift-paced end-game in the protracted
Afghan civil war has thus fallen into a see-saw pattern of
military engagement between the Afghan Islamic Taliban militia and
its rivals in the north.
</P>
<P>
The drama began on May 19 when General Abdul Malik,
second-in-command of Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, ousted his boss
in an unexpected coup and switched his support to the Taliban,
which enabled the Islamic militia to make a breakthrough in the
opposition-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by their landmark victory, the Taliban, who entered on
May 25 the historic city of Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters,
have once claimed that they would complete "in days" their
three-year campaign to take over the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Yet the euphoria created by the rout of Dostum, who is now in
Turkey, has turned into a nightmare for the Taliban as Malik
performed another about-face shortly after the capture of
Mazar-e-Sharif by his forces together with Taliban fighters.
</P>
<P>
When asked to disarm his forces by the Taliban, Malik quickly
broke rank with the Islamic militia just four days after Dostum's
flight and chased them out of Mazar-e-Sharif following a 15-hour
fighting, leaving some 300 Taliban fighters killed and over 1,000
including Taliban's foreign minister Mullah Ghaus captured.
</P>
<P>
As fighting spread across the north, the Taliban suffered their
worst defeat since they emerged from southern Afghanistan 30
months ago while Malik's troops retook four northern provinces of
Takhar, Faryab, Jozjan and Sar-e-Pol which the Taliban have
occupied for less than a week.
</P>
<P>
In the south, Tajik warlord and ousted military chief Ahmad
Masood has lost no time in launching an offensive against the
Taliban north of Kabul along the Salang highway which links
northern and southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few strategic points and towns at the mouth of the
Panjshir valley, stronghold of Masood, and elsewhere have
meanwhile changed hands -- captured, recaptured and lost again -
between the Taliban and their opponents. As a result, a large
force of Taliban traveling north have been trapped, cut-off and
completely surrounded by opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of fighting in northern Afghanistan has drawn
serious attention of the world community. Norbert Holl, the United
Nations special envoy to Afghanistan, who flew to Kabul at the end
of last month, has started a new round of shuttling diplomacy to
call on all the warring parties to solve the current critical
situation through negotiations and not by fighting.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, a country composed of multiethnic groups, cannot
function smoothly under the complete domination of one particular
group even though it might be militarily the strongest, Holl said
in an interview at his office just one day before his departure
for Kabul last week.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic changes in northern Afghanistan have proved once
again that the only solution to the protracted Afghan conflict is
to form a broad-based government as envisaged by the UN, Holl
said.

YANTAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Federico Chavez, a commercial
attache with the Mexican Trade Commission who is in charge of
market affairs in China, Hong Kong and Macao regions, says that
Mexico will increase trade cooperation with China in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chavez is heading a trade delegation to the Second Exposition
of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Yantai, Shandong
Province, where he made the remarks to reporters today.
</P>
<P>
Five fields Mexico will get involved in are food, building
materials, chemicals, textiles, and the electronic industries. It
will also expand its business in China in things like interior
decoration and carpet making,
</P>
<P>
Mexico's trade with 17 other members of APEC now makes up over
80 percent of the country's foreign trade, which is dominated by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's trade with China accounts for less than one percent of
the country's total foreign trade, and stood at about 500 million
U.S. dollars in 1996, which he said was a small amount and that
they should increase trade cooperation with China.

<HEADLINE> Provisional Legislature Supports Transitional Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) today gave its support to the Transitional Budget for
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
At its 10th plenary meeting held here today, the PLC resumed
debate on a motion moved in May by the Chief Executive's Office of
the HKSAR to seek support of legislators for the Transitional
Budget for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The budget was worked out in line with the Basic Law -- the
constitutional document of Hong Kong after July 1, 1997, and the
consensus reached by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG)
through 19 rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The British Hong Kong government looks after the first three
months covered by this financial budget, while the HKSAR
government will take care of the remaining nine months.
</P>
<P>
Many legislators rose to voice their favor of the budget,
which, they said, was conducive to the smooth transition of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, they urged the future HKSAR government to
take into consideration such pressing issues as housing,
education, welfare for the elderly, industry, technology,
infrastructure and environment.
</P>
<P>
In a written report submitted today to the PLC, the Financial
Committee under the legislative body suggested that legislators'
views serve as useful reference points for compiling the budget
for the next financial year between 1998 and 1999.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Provisional Legislature Adopts Three Bills on District Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Urban Council (Amendment) Bill
1997, the Regional Council (Amendment) Bill 1997 and the District
Boards (Amendment) Bill 1997 were adopted here today by the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
The three bills were tabled to the PLC for first and second
readings on May 17 by Michael Suen, secretary for policy
coordination of the Chief Executive's Office. The debate was then
adjourned and a bills committee composed of 18 PLC members was set
up to scrutinize the bills.
</P>
<P>
At today's full sitting, the three bills passed the third
reading with a great majority.
</P>
<P>
Under the bills, the Provisional Urban Council, the Provisional
Regional Council and 18 Provisional District Boards shall be
formed along with the founding of the HKSAR to operate in place of
the existing district organizations.
</P>
<P>
Considering that the tenure of office of the existing district
organizations end on June 30, 1997 and that members of the first
district organizations of the HKSAR can not be elected before July
1, 1997, it is necessary to set up the Provisional bodies to fill
a resultant vacuum.
</P>
<P>
Main contents of the three bills are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- The Provisional Urban Council and the Provisional Regional
Council consist of not more than 50 members each, a 25-percent
increase over the existing councils, while each Provisional
District Board consists of not more than 40 members, also a
25-percent increase over the existing board.
</P>
<P>
-- The members of the bodies will be appointed by the Chief
Executive with their terms of office running not later than
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- The members are required to swear that they will uphold the
Basic Law and that their allegiance is to the HKSAR before taking
up membership at the provisional district organizations.
</P>
<P>
-- The first meeting of the Provisional Urban Council, the
Provisional Regional Council and each of the Provisional District
Boards will be arranged before July 7, 1997, to elect a chairman
and a vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
-- The rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the
existing bodies will be assigned to the provisional bodies so as
to achieve a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
The existing Urban Council and Regional Council in Hong Kong
are responsible for matter concerning public health, sanitation
and hygiene, the provision of recreational, sports and cultural
facilities and activities for Hong Kong residents. The District
Boards have a mainly advisory role in the management of district
affairs and provide a forum for public consultation and
participation at the district level.
</P>
<P>
Having passed the third reading at the provisional legislature,
the three bills have yet to go through a confirmation process
during the early hours of July 1 and gain assent of the Chief
Executive to become HKSAR law.
</P>
<P>
On May 10, the PLC had passed the Holidays (1997 and 1998)
Bill, the first draft legislation tabled to the legislature.

<HEADLINE> Syria: Israel Violates Human Rights in Occupied Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Nasser Qaddour met here today with a delegation of
the UN Commission on investigating Israeli violations of human
rights in the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Syrian minister said his country was
keen on cooperating with the UN commission and was ready to offer
all possible facilities to help it fulfill the task of making
clear the human rights conditions in the Syrian Golan Heights as
well as other Arab territories occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria "seeks to brief the international community on
the reality of Israeli practices that harm the land and the
people."
</P>
<P>
Qaddour pointed out that the commission should continue its
task till the end of its mandate when the Israeli occupation of
the Arab lands draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
The human rights conditions in the Golan Heights deteriorated
significantly and the international community should not only
condemn the Israeli policies and practices but also pressure
Israel to comply with relevant UN resolutions, Qaddour added.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of the Israeli practices runs counter to the
efforts that aim to establish a just and comprehensive peace in
the Middle East on the basis of the Madrid Peace Conference, he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister said Syrian-Israeli peace talks should be
resumed from where they were broke off and Israel should withdraw
to the June 4, 1967, border lines.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israeli Experts Meet in Cairo Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian-Israeli expert meeting
will be held here tomorrow to tackle the Jewish settlements and
other important issues on the Mideast peace process, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will attend the meeting as an observer, said Moussa
following a meeting between Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
But the Egyptian top diplomat refused to describe such a drive
as positive or otherwise, saying it is necessary to wait and see
what tomorrow's meeting will lead to.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks broke down in March when
Israel began construction of a new Jewish settlement in disputed
Arab East Jerusalem. Palestinians conditioned the resumption of
negotiations on a halt to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was decided upon after Arafat meeting Friday a
advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu who conveyed
some Israeli ideas to bring closer views between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that no comments should be made before tomorrow's
meeting," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to comment on Netanyahu's plan for the final
settlement with Palestinians, only saying that "he (Mr. Netanyahu)
spoke about the issue of Jeursalem before."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu' plan, which was revealed early this week, includes a
partial Israeli withdrawal from 40 percent of the West Bank and
strengthening the Israeli presence in Jerusalem and the Jewish
settlement in the West Bank. The Palestinians have rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Instead of fresh U.S. suggestions to bring closer Palestinian
and Israeli view points, Moussa said there are only Israeli
proposals now.
</P>
<P>
"We should not delve into the details of those proposals
because only the Palestinians have the right to do so," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has taken a central role in mediating an end to the
crisis between the Palestinians and Israelis after U.S. Mideast
coordinator Dennis Ross's shuttle trips tappered off.
</P>
<P>
While pessimistic that tomorrow's meeting would be a step
towards a summit between Netanyahu and Arafat, Moussa voiced hope
it would be "beneficial to the Palestinian issue."
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Egypt and the Palestinians were working
on a five-point plan which includes a freeze on any change in the
status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West
Bank for a "sufficient period" of time.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Israel should start at once the final phase
negotiations and fully implement the Hebron agreement, including
further troop withdrawal from the West Bank, operating Gaza
airport, starting Gaza port construction and opening the safe
passage between the West bank and the Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to
address Israel's security demands, they added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Egyptian efforts, the gap remained wide, especially
on the question of Jewish settlement, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to stop the new construction and instead
proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the Jewish housing
project. He also proposed measures to ease the limitations against
the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission, has urged the defense industry to
improve its science and technology research to improve the quality
of China's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Liu, also a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the
comments while inspecting southwest China's Sichuan Province from
June 2-7, where he visited a number of military factories and
research institutes and met with senior army officers.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of new technology has brought great
changes to the economy and military, and has resulted in a new
type of competition in the military, Liu said, asking scientists
in the defense industry to meeting this challenge.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) is crucial to the defense
industry's development, he said, and asked leaders and scientists
in the defense industry to work with the sense of mission,
responsibility, and urgency. He asked them to hold high the banner
of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and to put the theory into practice.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Winds Up Brief Visit to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat left here at noon after his second visit here in
four days to discuss Egypt's mediation efforts to move forward the
deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The tete-a-tete between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Arafat later turned into an enlarged session that included
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, PA Minister of Local Administration Saeb Erekat, Arafat's
top advisors.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's several-hour visit came as Egypt's recent peace moves
seemingly stand a chance of reviving the peace process that
paralyzed in March when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Today's discussions would mainly focus on the lastest proposals
to break the peace stalemate, said Moussa on the eve of the
talks. Both sides are yet to give remarks after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Egypt and the Palestinians were working
on a five-point plan which includes a freeze on any change in the
status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West
Bank for a "sufficient period" of time.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Israel should start at once the final

including further troop withdrawal from the West Bank, operating
Gaza airport, starting Gaza port construction and opening the safe
passage between the West bank and the Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to
address Israel's security demands, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership, at a weekly meeting chaired by
Arafat in Gaza Friday night, approved convocation of
Palestinian-Israeli-Egyptian ministerial meeting in Cairo to
examine the peace-making efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have refused to return to the negotiating
table in the two-month-old Mideast peace crisis and made the
resumption of talks conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary
policy.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who has played a central role in bridging the
differences between the two sides after the failed U.S. attempt,
reportedly had proposed a six-month freeze to Har Homa, the new
settlement project in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But the sources said despite the Egyptian efforts, the gap
remained wide, especially on the question of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
After his talks here, Arafat was expected to go to the
Jordanian capital of Amman for talks with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's tour of Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries
that signed peace deals with the Jewish state, also focuses on a
peace plan drafted by Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The plan, revealed by a cabinet source earlier this week,
includes a partial Israeli withdrawal from 40 percent of the West
Bank and strengthening the Israeli presence in Jerusalem and the
Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected the plan, with Arafat branding it as
"a violation for the peace process and the accords signed."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to stop the new construction and instead
proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the Jewish housing
project. He also proposed measures to ease the limitations against
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> HK Amendment Immigration Bill Tabled to PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Hong Kong
 Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) tabled an amendment
immigration bill here today to the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC) for the first and second readings.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Immigration (Amendment) (No.3) Bill 1997, HKSAR
Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung told PLC members this morning in
the South China city that she moved that the bill be read a second
time.
</P>
<P>
"The bill seeks to provide for the status of a permanent
resident together with the right of abode in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region" in accordance with Article 24 of the Basic
Law, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
In drafting the bill, she said, "we have taken account of the
detailed arrangements set out in the decision of the Preparatory
Committee of the HKSAR made in July 1996 on the definition of Hong
Kong Permanent Citizens. It has also taken into account those
issues agreed upon in the (Sino-British) Joint Liaison Group," a
spokesman for the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office said in Hong Kong
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Leung told the lawmakers, there are six
categories of permanent residents with the right of abode in the
HKSAR. According to Leung, they are as follows:
</P>
<P>
(1). Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong before or after the
establishment of the HKSAR;
</P>
<P>
(2). Chinese citizens who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong
for a continuous period of not less than seven years before or
after the establishment of the HKSAR;
</P>
<P>
(3). Persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of
those residents listed in categories (1) and (2);
</P>
<P>
(4). Persons not of Chinese nationality who have entered Hong
Kong with valid travel documents, have ordinarily resided in Hong
Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and have
taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or
after the establishment of the HKSAR;
</P>
<P>
(5). Persons under 21 years of age born in Hong Kong of those
residents listed in category (4) before or after the establishment
of the HKSAR;
</P>
<P>
(6). Persons other than those residents listed in categories
(1) to (5), who, before the establishment of the HKSAR, had the
right of abode in Hong Kong only.
</P>
<P>
According to Leung, the bill includes four major parts: to
provide for the various categories of permanent residents of the
HKSAR and the procedure of implementation; to provide for the
circumstances in which the right of abode may be lost and the
right to land in Hong Kong after the loss of such right; to
provide for the transitional arrangements for those who are not of
Chinese nationality but are permanent residents of Hong Kong
before its handover; and to provide for the definitions (or their
amendments) of certain expressions in the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill does not provide for those who claim to enjoy the
right of abode in the HKSAR but have entered or sought to enter
Hong Kong unlawfully, she said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the issue, which has been a matter of public
concern, as "complex," Leung said a special task force set up
under the auspices of the Chief Executive's Office has now
undertaken to examine the issue and may soon make recommendations
on the ways to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
"An early legislation can allay people's concern," she pointed
out, adding that the Basic Law only is the basic principles and
policies and it must be implemented by detailed articles of the
HKSAR laws.
</P>
<P>
Leung stressed that "there is a pressing need" for the
lawmakers to have the bill enacted before the July 1 handover and
the legislation on the right of abode is "an important task" of
the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Bill Tabled at Provisional Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Court of Final
Appeal (Amendment) Bill 1997 was tabled here today at the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) for scrutiny by the Chief
Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The bill was moved for the first and second readings today at
the 10th plenary meeting of the post-handover legislature which
was meeting in Shenzhen, the Chinese city bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Secretary of Justice of the HKSAR, told the
PLC members that the main purpose of moving the bill was to
include the provision of Article 90 of the Basic Law in the Hong
Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance enacted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of Article 90 is missing from that Ordinance,"
said Leung. The Article provides that the Chief Justice of the
Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court of the
HKSAR shall be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of the
Region with no right of abode in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Article 90 also mandates that in the case of appointment or
removal of judges of the Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge
of the High Court of the HKSAR, the Chief Executive shall obtain
the endorsement of the Legislative Council and report such
appointment and removal to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress for record.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR's Secretary of Justice explained that in the Basic
Law, the constitutional document of Hong Kong after July 1, 1997,
Articles 88 to 90 contain provisions on the appointment of Judges
of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
"The substance of Article 88 and 89 have already been reflected
in the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal
Ordinance enacted in 1995," she added.

<HEADLINE> Legislative Council Commission Bill Passes Third Reading at PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A bill, which aims to facilitate
administrative support and services to the legislature of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) after July 1, won
unanimous support here today when receiving the third reading at a
plenary meeting of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council Commission (Amendment) Bill was tabled
by the Chief Executive's Office to the PLC for the first and
second readings at its previous plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The bill is to ensure the continued application of the existing
Legislative Council Commission Ordinance, which will continue to
be in force after the handover, and to make transitional
arrangements arising from the establishment of the PLC and its
supporting structure.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for the adapted definitions of the
"Legislative Council," "Legislative Council Secretariat" and
"Legislative Council Commission" and makes changes to several
existing references -- such as substituting "Government" for
"Crown" -- so as to adapt to the post-handover situation.
</P>
<P>
Three other bills concerning district organizations of the
HKSAR were also adopted at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
All the four bills, together with the Holidays (1997 and 1998)
Bill which had been passed earlier, have yet to go through a
confirmation process during the early hours of the establishment
of the HKSAR and to be signed by the HKSAR chief executive into
law.

<HEADLINE> Judicial Service Commission Bill Tabled at Provisional Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Judicial Service Commission
(Amendment) Bill 1997 was tabled here today at the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Moved by the Chief Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), the bill passed the first and
second readings at the 10th plenary meeting of the PLC here in
Shenzhen, the southern China city bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Secretary of Justice of the HKSAR explained
to legislators that the main purpose of the bill was to ensure the
smooth appointment of the first group of judges of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
At the HKSAR government inauguration and swearing-in ceremony
on July 1, 1997, permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal and
Judges of the High Court should take their oaths immediately after
the Chief Executive, the principal officials, members of the
Executive Council and Members of the PLC, according to a decision
made last month by the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Leung stressed: "We support this decision. The swearing in of
the executive, the legislative and the judicial bodies on the same
occasion can signify the establishment en bloc of the HKSAR
government."
</P>
<P>
But legally speaking, members of the Judicial Officers
Recommendation Commission (JORC), an independent body formed under
the Basic Law to make recommendations to the Chief Executive on
the appointment of judges, should have taken their oaths before
making such recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"However, this arrangement is not possible on July 1, 1997,"
the Secretary of Justice told the PLC members.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we propose that we should amend the law and add a
transitional provision to ensure that the recommendations made by
the JORC could not be challenged simply because its members have
not taken their oaths prior to making the recommendations," said
Leung.
</P>
<P>
She said that although the JORC Ordinance will not come into
force till July 1, 1997, the Chief Executive has already
appointed a JORC in order to make the necessary preparation for
the setting up of the Judiciary of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The JORC will officially be established on July 1, 1997, to
replace the existing Judicial Service Commission. Meanwhile, the
Judicial Service Commission Ordinance will also be re-titled the
Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission Ordinance on July 1,
said the Secretary of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The JORC has recommended to the Chief Executive that Andrew Li
Kwok-nang be the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal. The
recommendation has gained wide support form PLC members.

<HEADLINE> Two-time World Cup Winner Makes All-star Table Tennis Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Two-time World Cup winner Ma Wenge
crushed youngster Wang Liqin in straight sets to reach the
semi-finals of the China All-Star Table Tennis Tournament here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Ma, who hasn't played competitive table tennis
for a month, put up a nearly perfect righthanded attacking game to
beat the teammate 10 years his junior, 21-15, 21-14, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who has been among the world best for a decade but has
never won a world championship singles title, said he was
considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
"I feel wornout and want to call its quits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, tipped as China's best hope for his giant-killing run in
the last month's world championships, failed to find his form in
the game against the player he shared the same room with and has
beaten many times in training.
</P>
<P>
Wang, from Shanghai, had upset European stars Jean-Philippe
Saive, Carl Prean and Jorgen Persson and more favored Canadian
Johnny Huang in the world championships in Manchester, England,
before losing the semi-final to Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
World No. 3 and former world champion Kong Linghui also made
the last four after nipping Qin Zhijian in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ying, member of the reigning world champion team,
outlasted local favorite Zhu Fang in five sets to reach the
women's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chen, also from Beijing, came back from two sets down to
overcome Gong Yuechun 3-2 to reach the last four.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Coupists Plead for Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The coupists that toppled Sierra
Leone's legitimate government led by President Tejan Kabbah
called on Friday for dialogue to end the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, S. Koroma, the new
Chief of Army Defence Staff of the current military regime
appealed to the international community to employ diplomatic
option rather than force in restoring democracy in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
This has been seen as an apparent move of the coup leaders to
stave off imminent military offensive by West African Peacekeeing
Force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
S.Koroma, reported to be elder brother of coup leader Johnny
Koroma, urged representatives from the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and the United Nations to assess the situation in the capital
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"Give us time, i mean find time to come to negotiate, but
definitely we oppose military intervention," S. Koroma was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied earlier reports that the military junta
offered to restore democracy in Sierra Leone in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I did not say the military will have to stay in
power for 18 months. I just said that the people will have to
choose, especially the international community, between Tejan
Kabbah and peace. If you agree for Tejan Kabbah, i am sure peace
is not going to be in this country for 18 months."
</P>
<P>
The military leadership asked on Friday all workers in
government offices and agencies to return to work, but many
failed to oblige.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the workers were incensed about the massive
looting and mayhem that accompanied the May 25 coup and were
unsure of their safety.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have been fleeing the tension and
insecurity in Freetown. Many set off on Friday at a tense feeling
of danger that ECOMOG bombardment might take place this weekend.
A BBC report said that over 80 people died in Sierra Leone when a
packed bus plunged into a river that day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources in Nigeria said the Nigerian air force
airlifted on Thursday about 250 people, mostly Nigerians, who
were affected by the strife in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The returnees, most of them business people, were handed over
to "unprepared" officials of the National Emergency Relief
Agency, which later brought them to a camp in the outskirts of
Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that officials of the camp have been working
hard to meet the needs of the returnees though they were not
informed about the airlift operation before.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian air force operation took place shortly before the
departure of the U.S. helicopter carrier Kearsarge from off
troubled Sierra Leone for the Mediterranean after evacuating
2,509 people, including 451 Americans.
</P>
<P>
To keep a close watch at the developments in Sierra Leone, the
United Nations has set up a coordinating unit in Conakry, Guinea.
It will also prepare an inter-agency assessment mission to
Freetown to check the huanitarian needs there.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Calls for Closer Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister I. K.
Gujral today called on South Asian countries to work together to
tackle the region's common problems of slow growth and mass
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Nepal Council of World Affairs here today, the
visiting Indian prime minister said that his government is trying
to work out a South Asia policy based on cooperation, friendship
and goodwill.
</P>
<P>
As India will inevitably become part of the global economy, "we
realize that we can only move ahead hand in hand with our
immediate neighbors," Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
"The way forward for us is the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC)," he added, talking about the role of
the seven-nation grouping of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which was established in
1985.
</P>
<P>
A new pattern of relationships has been built between India,
Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka last year, Gujral said,
referring to a sub-regional cooperation mechanism under the SAARC
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new South Asian spirit will also
prevail in India-Pakistan relations in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time for Asian statesmanship to rise above petty
disputes and differences, to bury the divisive issues of the past,
and to embark on the new road to collective progress," Gujral told
the audience including diplomats, intellectuals and senior Nepali
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand was present at the
program organized by the Nepal Council of World Affairs, a
semi-governmental institute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint press conference was held here today by the
two prime ministers before Gujral concludes his three-day visit to
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Gujral said that his current Nepal visit, the
first bilateral one after he became Indian prime minister in
April, underlined the emphasis of importance of the bilateral
relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Chand told the press conference that he
was satisfied with the official talks between him and Gujral on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that one important decision made during the talks was
the time-frame for addressing each of the bilateral issues between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply appreciate India's acceptance of the demand by Nepal
for a transit route to Bangladesh," Chand said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister on Friday agreed to provide an
alternative transit route through the narrow strip of the Indian
territory between Nepal and Bangladesh for Nepal's foreign trade
on the experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to leave here for home later today.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- When attending Friday a summit of Socialist leaders of
Europe in Malmoe, Sweden, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair showed their difference over
ways to tackle the problem of unemployment. While Jospin
emphasized the importance of social solidarity, Blair talked more
about the flexibility of labor market and individual initiative.
</P>
<P>
-- On a central square in Brazzaville where the presidential
election was supposed to be held on July 27, the supporters of
Congolese President Pascal Lissouba and those of former President
Sassou N'Guesso fought for a second day on Friday. The "Cobra"
militias loyal to N'Guesso succeeded in launching a
"counter-offensive" and seized the northern part of the city,
divided from the southern party by a street ironically named
"Peace Avenue."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- When attending the Socialist Congress in Malmoe, Sweden,
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin reaffirmed the four conditions
presented by the Socialist Party for launching the European single
currency, which includes a call for the admission of Italy and
Spain into the monetary union, the establishment of a supervision
authority for the future European Bank, an interpretation of the
criteria for joining the euro, and a pact of solidarity and growth
as well as a policy for employment and social progress in the

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Import Liberalization in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank, the largest donor
agency to Bangladesh, suggested that the government should
announce a medium-term strategy in its next budget for further
import liberalization.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report on trade policy reform, the bank recommended
that a three-rate schedule of 10, 20 and 35 percent needs to be
adopted in the next budget with zero rates only for imported
inputs for exporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, low rates between zero and 20 percent should be
announced now for fiscal 1999-2000, the bank said, adding that a
maximum rate of 20 percent would retain some protection for
domestic industry against alleged foreign dumping.
</P>
<P>
Additional protection -- a 2.5-percent import permit fee, a
15-percent value-added tax on textiles and use of tariff values in
duty assessment -- should be removed to provide normal protection
by scheduled customs duties transparently.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said that for an open and stable trade regime,
which attracts investors and stimulates export growth, the
government should take the program of import liberalization as top
priority in its strategy for trade reform.
</P>
<P>
Dispelling the fears of large revenue losses, the World Bank
said a cut in the import-weighted tariffs to half of their present
level could lead to an estimated 19 billion taka (about 475
million U.S. dollars) revenue loss, but it should be offset by
increased volume of imports.
</P>
<P>
It noted that bans on import of sugar, salt and some other
commodities are somewhat meaningless because large amounts of
these commodities are imported illegally from India.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a survey, the bank said illegal imports constitute
approximately 18 percent of total imports into Bangladesh.
Smuggling from India totals 519 million U.S. dollars against
Bangladesh's export of 126 million dollars to India.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other countries, Bangladesh has a long way to go
in its trade policy reforms, the bank report added.

<HEADLINE> Pak Calls for Cuts in Indian, Pak Defense Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
called for the withdrawal of Indian troops from Kashmir and
suggested a cut in the defense budgets of India and Pakistan
"through a mutual agreement."
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the Indian prime minister that troops should be
withdrawn from Kashmir as a first gesture which will help in
building an atmosphere of trust," Sharif said in an interview with
a private Indian television, El-TV, here last week, sources from
the Prime Minister's Secretariat said today.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, however, conceded that there are
limitations on both sides.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time to fight, we must learn from our past
mistakes and should analyze what all we have gained or lost. We
fought wars and spent so much on budget instead of concentrating
on the development of both the nations. It is high time we should
change our attitudes," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani people want good relations with India, Sharif
said. He called for a new beginning in ties between the two South
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the next round of foreign secretary-level talks
scheduled to be held here from June 19 to 22, Sharif made it clear
that the Kashmir issue should be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be in the interest of the two countries to talk
without keeping the Kashmir issue on the agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to discuss all issues, but it would be better if we
talk about Kashmir," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he was hopeful that many problems between Pakistan
and India would be sorted out after the installation of a hotline
between the two prime ministers later this month.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Makes Thai Bourse Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) continued to sink these days, closing at an eight-year low
on Friday. The unchecked declining trend on the Thai bourse are
blurring the existing scene of the local financial sector and
causing more concern on how far it would go.
</P>
<P>
The broad-based SET index plunged 17.43 points to close at
530.62, the lowest since April 1989, amid heavy transactions with
declining issues outnumbering advancing ones 204 to 96. Analysts
said that the Thai government's tight baht policy may have fueled
the recent slump on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The total trading value Friday nearly doubled to 5.2 billion
baht from Thursday's 2.8 billion baht, while the trading volume
soared to 170.8 million shares from Thursday's 98 million shares.
Dealers continued to sell even blue-chip shares to cashing in baht
to arbitrage on the 10 percent gap in the price of the baht
currency between the domestic and offshore markets.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector saw the highest trading volume on Friday as
foreign investors sold blue-chip banking issues to cash in the
baht because of the scarcity of the currency on the market.
</P>
<P>
The medium rate of the baht against the US dollar was fixed at
25.81 on the local market on Friday, around 10 percent more
expensive on offshore markets where the Thai central bank late May
engineered a shortage of the baht currency to deter speculators
betting on a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The baht remained strong on Friday on offshore markets, traded
at 23.97/24.07 against the dollar after it jumped to a 13-year
high of 23.8/24 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SET index has been edging down at a pace between 3.04 and
6.78 points a day over the past week after the Thai central bank's
policy was in place. On May 30, the last trading day of May, the
index perked at 566.35 points.
</P>
<P>
Reports that the Thai central bank's tight baht policy would
remain for three to six months on offshore trading also fed the
trend on the bourse, as it could slow capital inflow and cause
other problems on the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, worries about the level of the non-performing
loans in the country, which could bring about liquidity problems
in the banking system, might also be a contributor to the market
movement, as financial institutions is to disclose their
non-performing loans by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts said that foreigners are expected to continue to
sell stocks for the baht and the Thai bourse will remain under the
pressure next week. Some dealers said that the SET index could
expect a new technical resistance mark at 500.00 points.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Foreign Reserves Rise to 31 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves have recovered to the level of 30 billion U.S. dollars
thanks to the improved balance of payments, said the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, foreign reserves reached 31.9 billion
dollars, up 2.07 billion from the end of April.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the trade balance, the stabilization of foreign
exchange rates also contributed to the sizable rise in the foreign
reserves, the central bank said in a latest report.
</P>
<P>
The slide of the value of won, the local currency, against
U.S. dollar continued from 840 to 1 in January to 890 to 1 in May
this year as the reserves dropped from 33.2 billion dollars last
December to 29.15 billion dollars at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in April, however, the amount of the country's
foreign currency reserves rose.
</P>
<P>
As speculative demands for foreign exchange subsided, deposits
of foreign currencies among South Koreans also declined:
outstanding foreign exchange deposits stood at 2.37 billion
dollars at the end of May, down 930 million dollars from April.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea predicted that the upward trend of foreign
reserves will hold steady as the improvement of the trade balance
widens and the inflow of stock funds from foreign investors is
expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
The optimal level of a country's foreign reserves as
recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an amount
equal to the total import value of three months. Based on the IMF
recommendation, South Korea's foreign reserves are still
considered insufficient as its imports are surpassing a monthly
average of 12 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ivory Debate: to Trade or to Ban? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES ) will start a 12-day meeting next Monday in
Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, to decide the fate of African
elephants.
</P>
<P>
At this meeting, the CITES member countries will cast their votes on
whether to lift the eight-year old ivory trade ban or not.
</P>
<P>
Long before the meeting, campaigns for and against the
trade of ivory and other elephant products had already been launched.
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia have been lobbying for the down-listing
of elephants from appendix i of the convention which entails a total
ban on ivory trade to appendix ii which will allow them to resume a
limited legal ivory trade. Some other African countries such as Kenya
and Zambia are firmly opposed to the down-listing.
</P>
<P>
The proponents argue that they have achieved success in protection
of elephants and the number of the animal has increased in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
They say that they need the resources to revamp their national
parks and promote their tourism as well as fight against poaching.
</P>
<P>
They also say the increasing number of elephants are threatening
vegetation, other species and even humen beings.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Mugabe said, "When culling operations and ivory trade
are stopped, the elephant herds get out of control and wreak havoc on
the lives and crop of our rural farmers adjacent to our game parks."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe even claimed that it is being unfairly punished by those
countries which fail to contain poaching and protect their elephants
effectively.
</P>
<P>
There are 580,000 elephants currently in Africa, of which
one-thirds are in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. The three also hold
a total of 100 tons ivory in government strongrooms.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe holds 65,000 elephants, which are far above that its range
can sustain. Ecologists said Zimbabwe can only sustain 35,000
elephants. If the limited trade is allowed, the country can sell its 40
tons of stockpiled ivory. In Botswana, elephant population is
increasing by five percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Opponents maintain that if ivory trade is allowed, whatever you do to
limit it, poaching will be promoted and become rampant and demand for
ivory supplies in the international market will increase.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Tourism Minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa said that lifting the
ban will "open the floodgate to senseless elephant slaughter due to
the demand that this will create."
</P>
<P>
The opponents also say that raising funds through ivory trade to
protect elephants is the same as raising funds through drug sale to
fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
They say elephants are important tourism resources and the revenue
from elephant-based tourism will be much more than that from ivory
trade and killing elephants will bring heavy inflict on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Some international organizations related to wildlife protection are
also divided on the issue. The London-based environmental
Investigation Agency (EIA ) said in a document on the success of CITES
that the seriously declining elephant populations are slowly being
reversed and elephants are now returning to areas once believed to be
extinct.
</P>
<P>
But TRAFFIC, the world's largest wildlife trade monitoring
organization, has announced its support for the proposal by Botswana,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
CITES imposed the ban on the ivory trade in 1989 in view of the
fast drop of the number of African elephants in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The petition for the limite trade needs support of the two-thirds
of the 136 CITES member states to be approved.
</P>
<P>
The debate on the issue will be much fiercer at this meeting.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pays Lightning Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat arrived here this morning for the second meeting in
four days with President Hosni Mubarak to discuss Egypt's recent
mediation efforts to move forward the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership, at a weekly meeting chaired by
Arafat in Gaza Friday night, approved convocation of
Palestinian-Israeli-Egyptian ministerial meeting in Cairo to
examine the peace-making efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have refused to return to the negotiating
table in the two-month-old Mideast peace crisis and made the
resumption of talks conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary
policy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Friday that the two leaders'
talks will mainly focus on the lastest proposals to break the
stalled peace process that collapsed since March when Israel broke
ground for a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Egypt and the Palestinians were working
on a five-point plan which includes a freeze on any change in the
status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West
Bank for a "sufficient period" of time.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Arafat discussions today are expected to revolve
around the five main points in order to reach an agreement between
the two sides, they said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Israel should start at once the final phase
negotiations and fully implement the Hebron agreement, including
further troop withdrawal from the West Bank, operating Gaza
airport, starting Gaza port construction and opening the safe
passage between the West bank and the Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to
address Israel's security demands, they added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who has recently intensified efforts to bridge the
differences between the two sides, reportedly had proposed a
six-month freeze to Har Homa, the new settlement project in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But the sources said despite the Egyptian efforts, the gap
between the two sides remained wide, especially on the question of
Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
After his talks here, the Palestinian leader is expected to go
to the Jordanian capital Amman for talks with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's tour in Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries
that signed peace deals with the Jewish state, would also discuss
a peace plan by Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The plan, revealed by a cabinet source earlier this week,
includes a partial Israeli withdrawal from 40 percent of the West
Bank and strengthening the Israeli presence in Jerusalem and the
Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected the plan and Arafat described it as "a
violation for the peace process and the accords signed."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to stop the new construction and instead
proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the Jewish housing
project. He also proposed measures to ease the limitations against
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Agrees to Pay Uganda Higher Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has agreed to pay Uganda a
higher rate of electricity supplied by Uganda to Nairobi, reported
the local daily the New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) led by
Managing Director Simon d'Ujanga left here for Nairobi yesterday
to sign agreements on the affair with Kenya Power and Lighting
Company.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, per unit of electricity supplied by
UEB to Nairobi has increased from 0.22 US cents in the 1950s to 8.5
US cents at present.
</P>
<P>
However, reliable sources here said that the Kenyan decision came
in the wake of increased pressure for tariff revision by President Y.
Museveni of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan decision followed a recent meeting between Museveni and
President Moi of Kenya at the OAU summit in Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Kenya will pay up to 8.5 cents for per unit
of power consumed between 5.00 a. m. and 6.00 p.m. The kenyans will
pay 6.5 cents for per unit of power consumed between 11.00 p.m. and
5.00 a.m. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Media Condemn Assassination of MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's leading newspapers
today all condemned the assassination attempt on parliamentary
member Abuddullah Al-Neibari's life Friday in their front pages
and described the crime as an ugly act against the nation.
</P>
<P>
Neibari and his wife were driving home from their weekend
villa near the Saudi border Friday evening when the attack took
place. Eye witnesses said he was stopped by two cars while driving
on a side way to Kuwait city and the attackers sprayed his car
with machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
Neibari was hit twice with one bullet on his right shoulder and
the other on the lower jaw and his wife was also hit on her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
They were immediately rushed by a private car to Al-Adan
hospital to the south of Kuwait city where medical sources said
their conditions were stable.
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the attack; but unconfirmed
reports this morning said the suspects had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Arabic daily Al-Qabas said the attack was aimed at "realizing
several targets at one time...it is an assassination against
democracy, the rule of institutions and public freedoms, if not to
say the assassination of a nation."
</P>
<P>
Another Arabic daily Al Watan said that "this criminal act
should be exploited to review the security situation in Kuwait
and particularly the crisis of the spread of weapons."
</P>
<P>
English daily Arab Times said "an iron fist is required
to grab hold of the country's affairs and strengthen
security."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Kuwaiti government, parliament and other
governmental governmental organizations all strongly condemned the
crime. They said this was unprecedented in Kuwait's history.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti parliamentary Speaker Ahmad Al-Saadoun accused corrupt
people and thieves of public funds of being behind the
attack, adding that "this is a message to the Kuwaiti people
and to the honest."
</P>
<P>
Neibari, 61, won parliamentary elections in 1992 and 1996
and headed the parliamentary panel for protection of the
public funds. He is now a leading member in the Kuwaiti
Democratic Forum (liberals).
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah who rushed to the hospital after he was
informed of the assassination said the attack "constitutes a
discord which doesn't target a specific person or some people,
but all Kuwaiti people and the state of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
This was the second gun shooting incident in Kuwait this
year. A 15-year old student on April 9 shot twice and seriously
injured his science teacher Mutaz Mahmoud Ibrahim, 35, on Asmaei
Secondary School campus for failing him in geology.
</P>
<P>
Many Kuwaitis have been keeping firearms and explosives left
over after the Gulf War 1991, although governmental authorities
repeatedly urged the people to hand them over.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market this week, the price of June South
fell gradually from 1,277.50 ringgit (about 511 U.S. dollars) per
ton to 1,217.50 ringgit (about 487 U.S. dollars) per ton at the
week's close, against 1,275 ringgit (about 510 U.S. dollars) per
ton at last week's close.
</P>
<P>
Trade houses liquidated their positions and most players were
sidelined ahead of the summer holidays.
</P>
<P>
June South dipped as the market reacted to some bearish
forecast figures for the month of May, released by private
forecaster, Ivan Wong, who forecast a production figure of 784,000
tons, an increase of seven percent compared with April while the
stock figure was at 745,000 tons, an increase of about 50,000 tons
compared with the previous figure.
</P>
<P>
The bearish sentiment on the CPO physicals market is expected
to prolong as players would continue to liquidate their positions
next week, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the metal price during
the week fluctuated between 13.79 ringgit (about 5.516 U.S.
dollars) and 14.08 ringgit (about 5.632 U.S. dollars) per kg
before closing 10 sen better at 14.08 ringgit per kg.
</P>
<P>
Weekly turnover rose to 508 tons against 406 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the week, the premium between the KLTM and that
of the London Metal Exchange (LME) narrowed to 85 U.S. dollars
against 135 U.S. dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
Tin price is expected to be volatile next week with the metal
hovering between 14.00 ringgit and 14.25 ringgit per kg, dealers
said, adding the KLTM's market direction will be dictated by the
uncertain movements on the LME, while demand for the metal is not
expected to be subdued.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market saw sentiment remain weak this week
although July RSS One gained half-a-sen to 284.00 sen (about 113.6
U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20 fell three sen to close at 263.00
sen (about 105.2 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for June 5 stood at 215.52
Malaysia/Singapore cents (sen) against 215.15 cents (sen) at the
end of last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average rose to 216.36 cents against 214.09
cents previously.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to drift further next week due to poor
demand, lack of market moving factors and buyers reserve, dealers
said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Prime Minister for Better Indo-pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said that both India and Pakistan should reduce their
defense budget by mutual agreement.
</P>
<P>
"But before that, we should try to generate confidence in each
other," he said in an interview given to an Indian TV channel,
which is to be broadcast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that he was hopeful of "breaking of ice in the
bilateral relationship with India because of the positive attitude
of Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral."
</P>
<P>
He said that India and Pakistan must learn some lesson from the
50 years of confrontation and that temperature must be brought
down immediately. "This is not the time to fight. We must learn
from our past mistakes and should analyze what all we have gained
or lost. We fought wars and spent so much on defense budget
instead of concentrating on the development of both the nations.
We have only suffered by adopting a path of confrontation. It's
high time we should change our attitude," he further said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to discuss all the issues but it would be better if we
talk about Kashmir also. I have requested the Indian prime
minister that troops should be withdrawn from Kashmir as a first
gesture which will help in building the atmosphere of trust. I can
understand the limitations of Mr. Gujral, but I too have got my
own limitations. I found Mr. Gujral a very nice person and I hope
he will respond positively," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to go to India to watch cricket matches and I want
Gujral to come to Pakistan to watch cricket," Sharif added.

<HEADLINE> Hyacinth Weed Has Economic Value: Prof. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A professor of agronomy in Kenya
has said that the water hyacinth, which now threatens Lake Victoria's
ecosystem, has economic value.
</P>
<P>
Eliud Omollo, a professor at the Egerton University,
said Friday that when dried, the hyacinth could be fed to
animals as its high protein content enabled the animals to
grow at a fast rate.
</P>
<P>
Students of agro-technology at the university are studying
how to use a large rake to clear the weed, dry it up and chop it
into small pieces to feed the animals like rabbits and pigs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Researches from developed countries like Australia and Japan
have shown that the weed has other economic uses, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he advised the Kenyan government to encourage the
physical extraction of the weed to complement efforts of beetles
introduced in the lake, the second largest fresh water lake
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The insect could only contain the weed's spread rather than
eradicate it completely, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 million Neochetina beetles, a natural enemy of the
hyacinth, would be released in at least 150 stations on the
Kenyan side this year, making Kenya the first in east Africa to
advocate the use of beetles.
</P>
<P>
The hyacinth now covers an area of more than 70,000 hectares
of water in Kenyan parts of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The hyacinth, one of the fastest-spreading plants
on the earth, was first noticed in Lake Victoria in the 1980s, but
did not pose a significant problem until the 1990s. enditem

<HEADLINE> Former Australian Prime Minister Supports China's WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) members should give their full support to China's accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the earliest possible
date, former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's accession to the WTO is in the interests
of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the second APEC exposition that opened in
this coastal city in east China on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the speech in response to the comment that China's
accession to the WTO will pose threat to the world.
</P>
<P>
Some persons' concern that China's rise to an economic power in
the first 25 years of the next century will pose a threat to the
world is groundless, he said.
</P>
<P>
He gives two reasons to support his view. First, he said that
people should not forget the country's history. China had
become powerful in the past 2,000 years, but it had never been
seeking hegemony in the world. Second, he believes that China
needs a peaceful environment to tackle the challenge of feeding
and keeping warm its population, which total 1.2 billion at
present.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the theory of "China threat" is absolutely
groundless, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kiswahili Urged to Be Made Compulsory in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Kiswahili language as a subject
should be made compulsory for all Kenyan students pursuing degree
studies, Kenyan university teachers have urged.
</P>
<P>
Kiswahili is vital for regional cooperation, national unity,
democratic development and the development of technological
sciences, Moi University Vice-Chancellor Professor Justin Irina
was quoted by today's local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 110 million people in more than 10 African countries
speak Kiswahili, he said at the opening of a two-day symposium
on Kiswahili language in Eldoret on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has a golden opportunity to develop the language because
over 80 percent of locals speak it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Africa depends on foreign languages for communication for many
years due to failure by Africans to develop a common and
indigenous language, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Ipara Odeo, a lecturer at Moi University, also called on
Africans to invest in the development of the language, suggesting
that Kiswahili be adopted as a medium of instruction from primary
to university level. enditem

NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The British Tourist Authority
(BTA) is willing to share its experience with the Kenya Tourism
Board (KTB) to promote tourism of the two countries, local press

</P>
<P>
The BTA can help the KTB in research and other related

the 30-year experience of their British counterpart, said Robin
Young, a BTA manager for Africa, Asia-Pacific and Middle East.

Kenya ranks the third in Africa in the number of visitors to
Britain with South Africa the first, Young said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Italian Trade Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China and Italy have to promote the
volume of bilateral trade and investment, which are not
proportionate to the scale of the two economies, Chinese Minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi told her Italian
counterpart here today.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Augusto Fantozzi, Minister of Foreign Trade
from Italy, Wu said that the Chinese government places importance
on its relations with Italy in all aspects, including trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She noted that in recent years, the increasing exchange of
visits between high-ranking officials of the two countries have had
a positive effect on the promotion of bilateral trade and economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, she pointed out that despite great progress has been
made in trade and investment between the two countries, the total
volume of investment and trade is yet to match the scale of the
two economies. She hopes that the two sides will work together to
fully develop the great potential of cooperation in these fields.
</P>
<P>
She said that China's reform, opening up and economic growth
have provided good opportunities for entrepreneurs from all over
the world. The Chinese government supports Italian businesses to
invest and conduct trade in China. Chinese enterprises will learn
from the experience of medium and small businesses in Italy, the
second biggest trade partner of China in the European Union (EU),
she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that Italian businesses will further
improve their competitivity in China market and actively
participate in the development of central and western parts of the
country, the technology up-grading of state-owned enterprises and
construction of basic industries such as agriculture, energy,
telecommunications and transport.
</P>
<P>
Fantozzi said that the Italian government attaches great
importance to developing economic and trade relations with China,
which will become one of the centers of growth of the world
economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Italian government will continue its efforts
to promote bilateral economic and trade cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
This is not only in the interests of the enterprises and
economic growth of the two countries, but also a contribution to
the prosperity of the world as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also met with representatives from Italian business circles
after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Fantozzi attended the signing ceremony of an agreement
between the two countries on setting up a joint training course of
management for the Chinese side. The joint venture training course
is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) of China and Bordiga Galgano and Associates
of Italy.

bank, show that China's personal savings rocketed to 4,155 billion
yuan (500 billion dollars) by the end of May.

out 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen had 27 points and Michael Jordan 26 as Chicago,
which trailed by as many as 24 points, began stealing the ball and
hitting 3-pointers to come as close as five points at 100-95 with
just over a half-minute to go.
</P>
<P>
But Stockton's pressure-charged free throws at the end held off
the Bulls, who now lead the best-of-seven series two games to one.
</P>
<P>
Games 4 and 5 will also be in Salt Lake City before returning
to Chicago, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz still have not lost at home in these playoffs and have
been defeated only once at the Delta Centre since the All-Star
break, winning 22 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have never swept the championship series. Neither
have they lost a Finals in four previous appearances.

<HEADLINE> Young Smokers Increasing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More people are smoking and many of
them start at a younger age, today's "China Daily" quoted a latest
national survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that about 590 million people in China, or half
the country's population, risk being harmed directly and passively
by cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Some 37.6 percent of people aged 15 or so are now smoking
cigarettes, up 3.74 percentage points compared with 1984,
according to the survey which was conducted among 120,000 young
people aged 15 or older by the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine and the Chinese Association for Smoking or Health.
</P>
<P>
Of cigarette smokers, 66.94 percent are male and 4.19 percent
are female. Based on the rates, the poll-takers estimate there
are 320 million smokers in China. There are more male smokers in
rural than urban areas, the survey reported. The proportion of
smokers among urban women is a bit higher than for rural women,
the survey reported.
</P>
<P>
Smokers usually begin lighting up at an average of 20, three
years earlier than in 1984. The number of young smokers has
increased by 9.66 percent among people between the ages of 15 to
19, and 36 percent for those between 25 to 29 and 43.6 percent for
those in the 40-44 age group. There are fewer smokers among
people above 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
Each smoker puffs an average of 15 cigarettes a day, two more
than 1984.
</P>
<P>
Chen Minzhang, Minister of Health, yesterday called upon all
Chinese to join the fight for a smoke-free society.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that China's anti-smoking campaign would get impetus
from the 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health which is
scheduled to be held in Beijing in August.

<HEADLINE> King: Strong Economy Frees Malaysia From Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic strength
has freed the nation from external pressures, Malaysian King
Tuanku Ja'afar said today.
</P>
<P>
The king was thankful for the rapid economic growth without
which he said Malaysia might not be able to enhance its image as a
developing nation and a respected Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, Malaysia achieved an average annual
growth rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians should be thankful because a number of developing
countries, because of their weak economy, were still not free
economically and politically, he said at an investiture here in
conjunction with his 75th birthday today.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "The country must move forward with
excellence by ensuring that the generation we create will reject
any form of malpractice and corruption."
</P>
<P>
The king is confident that Malaysia has a strong foundation to
move forward into a developed nation with its own characteristics.
But he said achieving this depends much on the people upholding
noble values like being hardworking, disciplined, dedicated and
observing high ethics.
</P>
<P>
He urged Malaysians to master the computer and the multimedia
technology in order to fully benefit from the country's Multimedia
Super Corridor project, which is a 50 kilometer by 15 kilometer
zone south of here devoted to multimedia products and services.
</P>
<P>
The people could not avoid their lives from being influenced by
the information technology (IT), the king said, adding, "If no
effort is made to learn and master the computer, I'm afraid a
segment of the population will be left behind in this IT age."

<HEADLINE> Hydropower Stations Threatened to Be Closed in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Two hydropower stations in northern
Vietnam are in danger of being shut down if no rain is expected in
the near future, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Water in the two reservoirs feeding the turbines are at a
record low following a prolonged hot and dry weather in northern
Vietnam since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The water level was about 30 percent of that during the same
time last year, and engineers at the country's biggest hydropower
station were forced to limit the eight turbines supplying the
national grid to no more than three hours a day to meet peak
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The three existing thermal power plants have been running at
full capacity to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
The possible shortage of electricity in northern Vietnam
signals a severe shortage of electricity throughout the whole
country for the coming dry season and summer.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Calls for U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has called for reforms in
the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) to make it more representative of
the composition of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is absolutely necessary to ensure that the actions
passed by the UNSC are supported by all members of the U.N.; after
all, all the UNSC's authority is based on the U.N. Charter and
acquired from all members of the U.N.," Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the Foreign Ministry, Alatas made the
remarks when launching the "Indonesia and the United Nations
Security Council 1995 and 1996" book.
</P>
<P>
"The UNSC needs to be open to transition, toward the creation
of a more secure, peaceful and humane world," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was clear that the UNSC's authority, capability and
credibility very much depend on the perception, interests and
political will of UNSC permanent members.
</P>
<P>
"This requires all of us to think critically and to strive to
create a more democratic and more representative UNSC to better
mirror today's global reality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The 200-page book published by the Permanent Mission of the
Republic of Indonesia to the United Nations, contains the views
and positions of Indonesia on issues discussed during its
membership in the UNSC, from January 1995 to December 1996.

<HEADLINE> Government Plans Panel to Watch Foreign Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry is planning to set up a high-level committee to protect
Thai employees from any mass layoffs by foreign companies, which
may flee Thailand when they face business problems, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which will be chaired by a deputy prime
minister, will watch some 2,500 foreign businesses in Thailand as
the ministry predicted that a large number of workers would lose
their jobs this year due to tougher economic conditions, the
Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed panel will be empowered to draw up rescue measures
for workers and enforce them on their foreign employers, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also be authorized to order state agencies
to take precautions to ensure that Thai workers are protected
under Thai law.
</P>
<P>
The formation of such a committee is aimed at bypassing the
existing criminal and civil laws to shorten the present
time-consuming process for protecting Thai workers' rights,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In the past, foreign executives were able to flee the country
before they were made to face their responsibilities for the
affected Thai employees under Thai law.
</P>
<P>
Eden Group, a major European-owned garment factory, has shut
down its operation in Thailand, leaving more than 300 workers
behind without any compensation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry last week said that some 40,000 workers are
expected to lose their jobs this year.

BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai hotels continued to face

Hotels around Bangkok underwent the significant impact of the
slowdown with an average occupancy rate of 56 percent posted,
dropping 6.2 percent, the biggest decreasing margin around the
country.
</P>

In Bangkok, the total room revenues reported 8.2 percent lower.
In other provinces, the average decline was between five and six
percent, but in the south it was three percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Nominated as Candidate for Yugoslav Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic has been nominated by his ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia (SPS) as the candidate for presidency of Yugoslavia later
this year, the local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The SPS made the announcement Thursday after officials from
Serbia and Montenegro met at Podgorica in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a party spokesman said earlier that Milosevic will
be the number one person in the SPS, Serbia and Yugoslav Federal,
no matter what political titles he will have.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement, some SPS local organizations and
associations have expressed their support over Milosevic's bid to
run in the presidential election, which is expected to be held at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic hoped to change the rules for the election to have
the federal president elected by popular vote instead of being
appointed by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the Yugoslav constitution, Zoran Lilic, the country's
incumbent president, who is due to step down when his mandate
expires on June 25, has no right to seek another term of
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Revoking China's MFN Damages Dialogue: White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- White House National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger warned Congress today that revoking Most
Favored Nation (MFN) trading status for China could damage the
"strategic dialogue" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the warning in a prepared speech for delivery tonight
to the Council of Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
"It would close one of the world's emerging markets to our
exports. And it would drastically weaken Hong Kong, which handles
over 50 percent of U.S.-China trade," Berger said in the speech.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest warning from senior officials of the Clinton
administration as Congress began its annual debate on whether to
renew China's MFN status.
</P>
<P>
Responding to some congressmen who have expressed their
opposition to the extension of China's MFN, Berger said they were
"destroying our economic relations with China."
</P>
<P>
"Treating China as our enemy could well make China our enemy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Berger emphasized that the U.S. interests would be "far better
served by increasing cooperation" with China, rather than by
severing the normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
"That is the course this administration has chosen," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has decided to renew China's MFN, but
some congressmen are opposed to the decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The two chambers of Romanian
parliament, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, on Friday
vetoed a no-confidence motion raised by opposition parliament
members against the government.
</P>
<P>
During the parliamentary meeting, up to 277 members were
against the motion with 156 votes for it.
</P>
<P>
Some 140 opposition deputies, who tabled the motion, attributed
the depressed economy in Romania in the past half years as well as
the drop of people's living standard to the economic reform
measures adopted by Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea's government.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea, who came to power in November 1996, said that the
current hard situation is a left-over by previous government
instead of his fault. He added his cabinet has adopted some
mandates to improve people's living standard.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Calls For Wider Cooperation with Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has called for wider
cooperation with Malaysia in an attempt to improve strained
bilateral ties, the Straits Times reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong as saying that the two neighboring countries should discard
old historical and emotional baggage and embark on a new era of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Giving a 50-minute speech in parliament Thursday, Goh Chok Tong
offered a framework of wider cooperation between the two countries
which would help overcome existing difficulties in their
relationship, he added.
</P>
<P>
The recent dispute between Singapore and Malaysia was sparked
by a court statement made by Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew on crime in Johor, a state in southern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government decided on March 26, 1997 to
temporarily freeze its ties with Singapore and postpone all the
ongoing bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Although Lee Kuan Yew made a public apology for his statement,
the Malaysian government said that bilateral ties could not be
improved in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong hoped that Singapore and Malaysia would continue
their talks over mutually beneficial projects, such as a
high-speed electric rail link between the two countries and a
long-term water supply deal from Malaysia to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore relies heavily on water from Malaysia and the two
agreements on water supply will expire in 2010 and 2060.
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong said in his speech that he had explained to his
Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad that Singapore sought a
water agreement within a wider framework of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"If Singapore and Malaysia can embark on a new era of
cooperation, we will signal to the present and future generations
that we have discarded the old historical and emotional baggage in
favor of fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation," he
said.

ZHENGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua)-- Henan Province in central China is
expected to hit a record high in its summer grain production this
year, which is estimated at some 23.68 billion kg, a year-on-year
increase of 15.4 percent.

ploughing and other practical technologies.

Early this year, Henan began to carry out a farmland

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- This leading industrial city of
China has made remarkable progress in developing old-age
insurance, which so far covered 6.15 million workers and staff,
representing 95 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is a city with increasing number of aged people, with
those above 60 years old accounting for 17 percent of the total
population, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The city started old-age insurance reform in 1992 and a
comprehensive insurance system covering the whole society has
initially taken shape.
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to the practice of the basic old-age
insurance system which aims to guarantee the basic living of those
involved, the city launched a complementary old-age insurance
which is designed to maintain living standards for the aged people
amid inflation.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 150,000 workers and staff from 100 Shanghai-based
enterprises have participated in the newly-launched drive of
complementary old-age insurance, with the old-age insurance fund
amounting to 200 million yuan.

MEXICO CITY -- The Foreign Trade National Bank of Mexico
(Bancomext) granted this week credits for 19.8 million dollars to
Central American entrepreneurs interested in acquiring Mexican
goods.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Lira, Bancomext representative for Costa Rica, Panama,
and Nicaragua, said the credits will be disbursed through private
banks and were placed with "very competitive" rates of interest,
attractive for the region entrepreneurs who make business with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican government will create a new entity
that will administer the risks in emissions of foreign debt, as
stated by the Mexican Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The new office, which will be named "Area of Administration of
Liabilities Risks" will be a branch of the Finance Ministry and
will be in charge of designing the mechanisms for the emission of
foreign debt in the international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Ministry authorities, this area is
necessary because Mexico needs a better planning for its
emissions, after the damages caused by the crisis started in
December of 1994 and maintained until 1995 have been surmounted.

SAN JOSE -- The price of wheat flour for bakery was reduced 4.6
percent Tuesday in Cost Rica, the second price reduction of this
year, said the Harina de Centroamerica manufacturing company.
</P>
<P>
The price reduction was attributed to more efficiency in the
imports of wheat, said Jorge Villalobos, the manager of the
company. With the price drop the price of a bag of wheat went from
19.3 dollars to 18 dollars.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Uruguayan manufacturing industry registered a
4 percent growth during the first quarter of the year, said the
National Statistics Institute.
</P>
<P>
The increase was accompanied for the first time in more than
two years, by a slight increase of 1.2 percent of the personnel
occupied by the sector, although a drop of 1 percent in the worked
hours was observed.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The production of the main cultivations in
Uruguay reached during the 1996-1997 cycle a total of 2.365
million tons, a 28.5 percent increase over the previous period.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Livestock Statistics Direction (DIEA), said
the wheat harvest increased 65 percent, corn 27 percent, rice 20
percent, and sorgum 19 percent. The four products lead the
harvests in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Colombian sugar production reached during
the first three months of the year 591,926 tons, a 4.67 percent
drop compared to the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was attributed to unfavorable weather conditions
for the sugar cane harvest, including a very cold winter that has
compacted the soils, said the Sugar Cane Growers Association in a
report published today by the press.
</P>
<P>
Exports dropped 18.31 percent during the period because of a
2.3 percent increase in the domestic consuming and the drop in
production. enditem

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alauddim Brajourdi yesterday held talks with leaders of factions
opposing Afghan Islamic Taliban militia in northern Afghanistan,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Brajourdi met with General Abdul Malik in Mazar-e-Sharif,
capital city of northwestern Balkh province, the Afghan sources in
Pakistan said.

<P>
Malik, whose revolt forced northern warlord Rashid Dostum to
flee the country, turned his back on the Taliban late last month
only four days after their allied forces entered Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Brajourdi told the press that the on-going
Afghan crisis could not be solved through military solution while
urging all Afghan warring parties to reach a consensus to form a
broad-based government, said the sources in Peshawar, Pakistan's
northwestern major city.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Brajourdi yesterday also held talks with
ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani in Feyzabad, capital
of Badakhshan province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban fighters were engaged in fierce fighting
with forces loyal to Malik and former military chief Ahmad Masood
in Samagan and Badakhshan provinces respectively, they said.

<HEADLINE> Food Crisis for Giant Pandas Alleviating (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The widespread natural death of
China's bamboo forests created a food crisis for wild giant pandas
fourteen years ago.
</P>
<P>
But zoologists in Minshan Prefecture, in northwest China's
Gansu Province, have discovered that giant pandas are eating
second-growth bamboo, which first appeared in 1989 in scarce
amounts. Bamboo has a growth cycle ranging from 15 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The "new" bamboo is now as high as 80 centimeters to one meter in
Wolong, China's largest giant panda natural reserve, located in
southwestern Sichuan Province, where one-tenth of the country's
giant pandas live.
</P>
<P>
"The bamboo will soon be ripe for eating by the giant
pandas. By then, their food shortage will be alleviated," said
Alan Taylor, a zoologist and botanist from the University of
Pennsylvania, who has come to China every year since 1983 to study
the bamboo and forests as habitats for the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas generally don't eat young bamboo shoots, Taylor
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In other natural reserves, newly-grown bamboo can be provided
as food for giant pandas in the near future, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
There are currently only about 1,000 giant pandas in the world,
mainly living in the provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and
Shaanxi. Sichuan claims about 80 percent of the giant pandas,
which are known as "living fossils."

<P>
NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
shot above 7,400 for the first time on Friday as the market was
calmed down by a further drop of the nation's unemployment rate in
May.
</P>
<P>
The Dow surged 130.49 points to 7,435.78, giving the blue-chip
barometer a gain of 104.74 for the week and easily beating May

in October and 7,000 in February.
</P>
<P>
Broader indicators also soared to record highs on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department report revealed that the nation's
unemployment rate, already the lowest in a generation, fell
further in May to 4.8 percent, which make investors feel that the
economy may be not as strong as expected.

As bonds rose Friday, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds,
which moves in the opposite direction from prices, fell to 6.78
percent, the lowest level since late February.

<HEADLINE> Food Crisis for Giant Pandas Alleviated (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study by the World Wildlife Fund in the mid-1980s revealed
that there are about 30 varieties of bamboo that can be eaten by
giant pandas in their habitats. At the time, there were more than
560,000 hectares of bamboo and a storage supply of over 16.8
million tons.
</P>
<P>
But in the next two or three years, support will be needed for
the giant pandas' food supply, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Bamboo blossoms every 45 to 55 years. The most recent crop was
in 1983, when about a quarter of the wild giant pandas faced
starvation.
</P>
<P>
The situation attracted worldwide attention. In China, a
national donation campaign was launched, encompassing students
through the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the Chinese government has taken a number
of steps to protect giant pandas, including:
</P>
<P>
-- setting up special areas where the pandas can be fed and
restored to health, and then returned to nature;
</P>
<P>
-- organizing disaster-relief teams to re-locate giant pandas
to a new environment with enough bamboo; and,
</P>
<P>
-- supplying food to giant pandas, such as meat, corn, and
sugarcanes.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has built 14 nature reserves for giant
pandas. However, experts point out, the survival of the giant
panda population depends to the greatest extent on regenerated
bamboo forests.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Uses Spiders for Insect Control on Tea Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- In an environmentally-friendly
form of insect control, Hunan Province, one of China's major tea
production bases, is replacing pesticides with spiders to wipe out
bugs that endanger the growth of profitable tea trees.
</P>
<P>
So far, tea produced by eight tea tree farms in Hunan has been
state certified as having especially healthful qualities.
</P>
<P>
In the past, chemical pesticides had been widely used to
eradicate the nearly ten types of insects that threaten the trees.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate the use of chemicals, biologists here caught
spiders and some other kinds of natural enemies of the tea tree
insects and raised them on the tea farms.
</P>
<P>
At Lanling Tea Farm, densely-spun spider webs are visible among
the tree branches, where spiders crawl about and munch on bugs.
</P>
<P>
Huang Houren, head of the farm, said 47 varieties of spiders
have been used to kill insects on the farm's 33.3 hectares of
trees.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, he invited eight experts from the Institute of Plant
Protection to battle the bugs in his trees with chemicals. The
experts also taught Huang how to raise spiders in vast tea tree
planting areas.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that his farm has established a strong spider
community which effectively protects the trees. He said that since
1993, no chemicals have been sprayed on his tea trees, and four
varieties of tea produced there have received state "green food"
certificates.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Proposes to Establish a New Angola Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today proposed to set up a new U.N. Angola mission for a
period of seven months beginning 1 July after its current
peacekeeping operation ends by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The new operation, which will be known as the UN Observer
Mission in Angola, is aimed to consolidate the peace process in
the country and to guide the demobilization of the UNITA soliders.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report to the Security Council, noted that the
peace process in the country showed significant progress, which
included the establishment of a coalition government, and the
normalization of state administration throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that the UN presence is still needed to guide
the demobilization of the former rebel UNITA soliders and to
monitor the rising tensions in the northern part of the country.
He said that the demobilization process is moving at a very slow
pace.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the United Nations has about 5,000 troops, military
observers and civilian police in Angola, known as the United
Nations Angola Verification Mission III. It was established to
monitor the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol signed in 1994.

<P>
ZAGREB, June 6 (Xinhua) - An agreement to reintegrate the
railway system of former Serb-controlled Eastern Slavonia with
that of Croatia was signed on Friday, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by representatives of Croatian Railways,
local Serbs and UN Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia
(UNTAS) which is temporarily governing the region before Croatia
resumes sovereignty in the middle of next month.
</P>
<P>
Souren Seraydarian, deputy head of UNTAS, said that the signing
of the document represents another important step forward in the
peaceful reintegration of the region to Croatia, following
introduction of Croatian currency and legislation as well as
establishment of local multi-ethnic governments.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Croatian railway company also promises
to retain Serb rail workers working in the region, which is a
major crossroad linking the eastern-south part with the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
But although some demining work has been done, it is estimated
that more than 100 million U.S. dollars have to be invested to
repair the railways damaged during the war.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Concerned over Violence in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan expressed concern on Friday at the reports of the recent
violent incidents in Indonesia-ruled East Timor.
</P>
<P>
At least 34 people have been reported killed as a result of
attacks by separatists seeking to disrupt Indonesia's May 29
general elections in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has never recognized Indonesia's authority
over the territory, which it invaded in 1975 after the departure
of Portugal and annexed the following year.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has called on all parties concerned to
exercise restraint," said U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
He said the Secretary-General is scheduled to hold a meeting
with the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal on 19 and 20
June in New York on the question of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the series of meetings aimed at finding an
internationally acceptable solution to the issue. They were
initiated in 1983 by then Secretary-General Javier Perez de Guellar
of Peru.
