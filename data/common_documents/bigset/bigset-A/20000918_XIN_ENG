<HEADLINE> Telecom Egypt to Be Offered October: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif said on Monday that the initial public offering of
Telecom Egypt will be made at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 percent of the shares of the national
telecommunications firm will be offered on Egyptian and world stock
markets as agreed by the cabinet, el-Sherif was quoted as saying by
the official Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The initial public offered, originally set for June and then
delayed, is expected to bring Egypt between 1.2 and 1.4 billion U.
S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian cabinet agreed on Monday that 10 percent of the
company's shares will be floated on the Egyptian bourse and another
10 percent on world markets, he added, without specifying.
</P>
<P>
Telecom Egypt currently has a monopoly over fixed local and
international lines, and two private companies, namely MobiNil and
Click, are competing in the mobile telephone market. But el-Sherif
said the cabinet has agreed that Telecom Egypt would start offering
mobile phone service from December 2002.
</P>
<P>
Telecom's assets are estimated at between 17 billion Egyptian
pounds (about 4.9 billion dollars) and 19.5 billion pounds (5.6
billion dollars), according to independent evaluations.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Yussef Boutros Ghali said earlier this year
that the company was growing at 20 percent a year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Supports Sudan's Bid for U.N. Security Council Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Monday that Egypt supports Sudan's bid to become a
member of the United Nations Security Council next year.
</P>
<P>
A consensus has been reached among the African and Arab
countries in favor of Khartoum's efforts to secure Africa's seat in
the Security Council, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will vote for Sudan, out of respect for bilateral
relations and the African-Arab decision, he was quoted as saying by
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the attempt by the United States to prevent Sudan
from becoming a Council member, Moussa said that every country has
a right to adopt a stance in line with its interests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is lobbying to stop Sudan from getting the seat, saying
it is "an unsuitable candidate" because it is under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Sudan in 1996
for failing to produce suspects in the 1995 attempt on the life of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Sudan
has denied charges that it masterminded the assassination attempt.
It has also normalized the relations with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Ethiopia and all council members except the United
States believe the sanctions should now be lifted. Washington has
asked the Council to defer a decision on the embargoes until mid-
November.

<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The first metro line in Istanbul, Turkey's largest
city, opened over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The 683 million U.S. dollar line, linking two main business
districts, runs for 8.5 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The metro line can carry up 70,000 passengers an hour in each
direction and is built to withstand earthquakes of 9.0 on the
Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
A consortium made up of French company Alstom and local
contractors started the construction in 1992.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A creation area, Kordon Sunset, in Izmir, Turkey's
third largest city, was opened over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit inaugurated the 35 million U.S.
dollar Kordon Sunset, which turned out to be one of the world's
most expensive recreation areas.
</P>
<P>
The 150-acre seaside area now features Izmir city landmarks --
the Korak Clock Tower and the Izmir Fair. Special events will also
be staged in the area.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The increasing oil price is expected to cost Turkey to
pay 5 billion U.S. dollars for crude oil imports this year,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the calculations of the State Planning Organization
(DPT), Turkey paid 25.8 dollars for one barrel of oil in the first
six months of 2000, compared to 12.5 dollars in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The price of one barrel of crude oil has increased by 108.1
percent for Turkey in one year.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- A senior Iranian official on Monday urged the
government to lower the tariffs on ship registration to attract
more ships to register in Iran.
</P>
<P>
If Iran reduces the ceiling of the tariffs on ship registration,
more international ship owners would register their ships in Iran,
said Deputy Minister of Road and Transport Mokhtar Kalantari.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Iran charges 5-10 percent of the
ship's price for registration while the tariff is lower in other
countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The cost of registering ships in Iran is so high that even
Iranian ship owners prefer to register their ships in other
countries, the official said.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Some 1,200 firms from more than 70 foreign countries
are to participate in the 26th Tehran International Trade Fair,
which is to be held from October 1-8.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries will include 31 from Asia, 25 from
Europe, 10 from Africa, five from America and one from Oceania,
Hussein Qassemi, managing director of Iran's International Fairs
Company, was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total exhibition area will be more than 90,000 square
meters, the official said, adding that the biggest pavilions will
belong to Germany, Japan and Italy respectively.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Host Conference on Curbing Illegal Diamonds Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from diamond
producing countries are to meet in Pretoria of South Africa on
Tuesday to discuss how to stamp out illegal sales of the gems
fueling different conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the conference is to protect the legitimate
trade of "clean diamonds", and stop that of the dirty ones, South
Africa's Department of Trade and Industry said in a statement
published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 foreign ministers and 150 delegates from the
diamond industry are expected to attend the three-day event, to be
hosted by the South African Department of Trade and Industry, said
the conference's co-ordinator Jeremy Mndaweni.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the United Nations envoy Paul Heinbecker is
expected to address the meeting on what a role the world body is
to play in severing the link between the precious stone and wars
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said countries to be represented include Sierra Leone, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Angola, Namibia, Botswana,
Belgium, the United States, Zambia, and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Diamond trade in countries like Angola, Sierra Leone and the
DRC has long been playing a role in funding civil wars. The
Western countries led by Britain and the U.S. recently accused
Liberia of helping channeling out diamonds produced in areas
controlled by Sierra Leone's rebels, thus prolonging the conflict
in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The "conflict diamonds", dubbed for diamonds funding conflicts
in Africa, account for at least 4 percent of the total diamond
trade volume of 6.8 billion U. S. dollars annually, said Mndaweni.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges U.S. to Abide by 1972 Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking the floor at the annual general debate of the U.N.
General Assembly, the foreign minister said Russia will introduce
a draft General Assembly resolution in support of the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
START III, or the third round of Strategic Arms Reduction
treaty, aims at lowering nuclear warheads of the two countries to
1,500 units, after START II enters into force. Russia's State Duma
ratified START II in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Under START II, the U.S. and Russia must cut the number of
nuclear warheads from 6,000 to no more than 3.500 on each side by
2007. The two countries agreed in 1997 to start their third round
of talks once START II enters into force.
</P>
<P>
Russian-U.S. consultations on strategic stability issues have
been held regularly since February 1999, but the two parties have
not been able to reach an agreement on the destiny of the 1972 ABM
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the notions of sovereignty and territorial
integrity of states are still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
"Disregard for these principles as well as military
intervention in circumvention of the U.N. Security Council, under
whatever humanitarian pretexts, undermine the very foundations of
the world order and pave the way to arbitrariness in international
affairs," he said.

He pledged his party would tax oil companies' excess profits if
they failed to ensure fuel supplies.

Kennedy was making an emergency statement on the fuel crisis at

</P>
<P>
"Fuel tax policy has to be fair -- if it's not, it won't work.
Let's be upfront about the environmental agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lib Dem leader also called on the government to take the
following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Cap fuel taxes for five years in real terms so it would not
profit from future increases in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
-- Use the value added tax windfall received from the higher-
than-expected fuel price to ease the burden on the traveling
public.
</P>
<P>
-- Ensure oil companies recognize their social responsibilities
in terms of price and supply security.
</P>
<P>
-- And support people in rural communities who rely on fuel,
for example by providing rate relief on rural fuel stations and
investment in public transport.

He chaired the first meeting of the government task force
designed to prevent another fuel crisis. There was no intention of
changing employment law affecting tanker drivers, he said at the
meeting, and the government would write to the trade unions to
reassure them.
</P>
<P>
Motorists in some parts of the country were still facing long
queues for petrol, but the major oil companies said deliveries
were gathering pace and up to two-thirds of petrol stations were
back in operation.
</P>
<P>
The National Health Service was taken off its red alert
emergency footing by Health Secretary Alan Milburn on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Straw said earlier that there must be no repeat of last week's
crippling shortages.
</P>
<P>
"One of the key things that emerged... at the beginning of last
week was the oil companies' lack of preparedness for a blockage of
this kind," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Water, gas and electricity firms already have a legal duty to
ensure supplies, and Straw said similar measures could be applied
to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He also said the task force would also look at supply
arrangements. The practice of supplying "just in time" had made
supplies particularly vulnerable, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fuel protesters have promised to resume the blockades unless
the government backs down on fuel tax -- though Downing Street
says legislation will not be introduced until after the Queen's
speech, which is expected in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Vice President
Gustavo Bell Lemus condemned Monday the kidnapping of 45 people by
the National Liberation Army (ELN) in western Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The vice president, who opened Monday a seminar on the Human
Rights and Military Criminal Law in Cartagena, coastal city of
this Caribbean country, said the matter is a flagrant violation of
basic rights.
</P>
<P>
"The ELN's action is a fact that shows this rebel group's scorn
to the rules of the International Humanitarian Law," said the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
"This kidnapping is a contradiction at these moments when the
ELN holds peace talks with the government," said Bell Lemus in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Director of the National Police Gen. Luis Ernesto
Gilibert Vargas revealed Monday that the guerrilla group kidnapped
45 people Sunday some 18 kilometers southwest of Cali, capital of
the state of Valle del Cauca, on the road that links this city
with Buenaventura, the main Colombian harbor in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Over half of the hostages were released a few hours after the
kidnapping, while the liberation of the rest will take place in
the months to come, he said.

<HEADLINE> Time Short for Palestinians, Israelis to Reach Peace Deal: Moussa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa warned on Monday that time was running out for the
Palestinians and Israelis to reach a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the current situation, there are still the possibilities
of success or failure for a peace deal, Moussa told reporters. But
the lack of time was not in favor of the success of an agreement,
he was quoted as saying by the state-run Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis are under pressure to hammer out a
deal as the Israeli parliament, which is threatening to topple
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's minority government, will reconvene in
late October after summer recess. And the presidential elections of
the United States, the major sponsor of the peace process, will
also take place in November.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called for intensive negotiations between the two sides,
saying that sufficient opportunity must be given for the efforts
exerted by all parties to bear fruit, especially in the coming few
weeks up to the end of October.
</P>
<P>
He said that no agreement has been made on any of the matters on
the table, including Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and final
borders, and that requires work to be focused in the short time
remaining.
</P>
<P>
Ideas put forward recently of placing parts of Jerusalem under
international sovereignty will apply only to the city's holy
places, he said. He reiterated that the Palestinians should have
full sovereignty over East Jerusalem as a whole and there is no
doubt about that.
</P>
<P>
Control over Jerusalem and its holy places has been the main
stumbling block in forging a final peace deal between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who returned to Cairo on Saturday from the United
States, where he attended the United Nations Millennium Summit and
the General Assembly, said Egypt was continuing its contacts with
all parties to try to advance the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Links with Rocket Attack in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry on
Monday rejected Iraqi allegations that Iran had involved in the
rocket attack in Baghdad on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has no links with such activities and Tehran has nothing
to do with Iraq's internal conflicts," an unnamed Foreign Ministry
official said, quoted by the official IRNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Three 122 mm rockets exploded at residential districts in
Baghdad Sunday morning, injuring one person and destroying several
houses.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Iranian agents of being responsible for the attack,
warning that "the crime would not pass without revenge."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, who fought a bloody war between 1980 and 1988,
are still divided on a range of issues. One of the thorniest issues
is the two countries' support of each other's opposition groups.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Endorses 2001 Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet announced
Monday evening that it had approved the Finance Ministry's budget
bill for the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
After seven-hour marathon debate, nine government ministers
voted in favor of the budget draft, while acting Interior Minister
Haim Ramon and Science, Culture and Sports Minister Matan Vilnai
voted against it, according to a cabinet statement issued after the
weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
Three other ministers, including acting Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami who was still not back from the United Nations General
Assembly, abstained in the voting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his ministers, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said that
the budget bill, which includes expenditures of 197 billion shekels
(about 49 billion U.S. dollars), will further boost the economic
development and narrow the social gap between "haves and have-
nots."
</P>
<P>
Barak rejected criticism inside and outside his cabinet that the
budget did not do enough to bridge the social gulf, citing as
evidence the increased funds allocated for education and
infrastructure building.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the defense budget slash, Barak admitted that the
cut in the defense budget is not nominal and is very painful, but
added that in light of existing conditions, there is no choice. He
said that he agreed to the budget cut after calculated the risks.
</P>
<P>
But Israel Defense Forces' Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz,
who recently developed a chilly relation with Barak, retorted that
the defense establishment needs a larger budget in order to meet
the army's working plans.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin also urged the prime minister to
direct more budget money to the Arab sector in Israel, which Beilin
claimed has been deprived for 52 years since the establishment of
the Jewish state in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Beilin stressed that the time has come for the government to
take the necessary steps to bring the situation to an end.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill is now ready to be presented to the Knesset
(parliament), which is scheduled to end its summer recess and
reconvene at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary debate of the budget will be a tough political
test for Barak, whose coalition now controls only one-third seats
of the 120-member Knesset. Some opposition factions had already
expressed their dissatisfaction with the bill.
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, former interior minister and leader of the
Yisrael Ba'aliya party, had proposed a no-confidence motion against
Barak on the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Likud termed the budget bill as "social apathy," saying that
the government has approved a budget which will hurt the health and
education systems and several sectors of the population,such as the
elders, recently-discharged soldiers and young couples.

<HEADLINE> Eight Muslim Brotherhood Members Detained in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday placed eight
members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood under two-week detention
in Alexandria for enquiry, the state-run Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Director of East Alexandria Prosecution Ibrahim al Saadani, who
ordered the detention, accused the eight of joining an illegal
organization and propagating the movement's ideas which threat
social peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The eight detainees were among the 15 Brotherhood members who
were arrested in the Mediterranean port city last Wednesday, Friday
and Saturday. But MENA did not specify what has happened to the
others.
</P>
<P>
Arrests and releases of members of the banned but partly
tolerated Muslim Brotherhood have increased in recent months.
Activists of the group have accused the authorities of intimidating
them and trying to stop them from taking part in the parliamentary
elections due in October and November.
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood, founded in 1928 and banned in 1954, says
publicly that it advocates an Islamic state through peaceful means.
But the authorities accused the group of encouraging violence
through collaborating with Islamist militant groups and have been
cracking down on it since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the movement, who cannot run for the parliament,
the People's Assembly, on a Brotherhood ticket, have reportedly
decided to stand as independents.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Consult Egypt, Jordan on Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians are consulting
Egypt and Jordan on the demarcation of the borders with the two
Arab neighbors, in an effort to facilitate the return of their
territories occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zakaria Al-Agha, member of the executive
department of Fatah movement, the mainstay of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The consultations were aimed at underscoring the necessity of
returning territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war to
Palestinian sovereignty, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the future borders with Egypt and Jordan will be the
same as during the British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The future Palestinian state, once declared, will be incarnated
in reality through presidential, parliamentary and local elections
and full membership in the United Nations, Al-Agha said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council decided to postpone the
declaration of statehood from September 13 to late this year to
give a new breath to the suffocating Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks. The talks have stumbled over the sovereignty on Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Truckers Threaten to Block Roads over Fuel Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli truck drivers have
decided to block national roads on Tuesday if no agreement is
reached with the government on fuel price reduction.
</P>
<P>
Israel Road Transport Board (IRTB) representatives will hold the
last meeting Monday evening with officials of the Ministries of
Finance and Transport to discuss the fuel price issue.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides failed to reach an agreement, then truckers and
bus drivers will begin road blocks at 6:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) on
Tuesday, IRTB said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Heavy truck, bus and taxi drivers will at first
move their vehicles only at 30-40 kilometers per hour on the
national high way between Haifa in the north of the country and
Ashdod just north of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, but all road
junctions along this highway will not be closed, IRTB said.
</P>
<P>
IRTB has members of some 15,000 heavy truck drivers and 4,000
bus drivers. Over 90 percent of the cargoes are transported by
trucks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Due to oil price increases on the world market, the Ministries
of Finance and Transport decided to increase fuel prices in the
country since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The price of diesel fuel has been increased by 13 percent,
bringing the price for diesel to 2.41 shekels (0.60 U.S. dollars) a
liter. Since the beginning of 1999, diesel price has been increased
by nearly 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The police said they recognize the trucker's rights to organize
a legitimate protest, but would not hesitate to take legal actions
against those who break the law.

KUWAIT CITY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said Monday that

stockpiles."
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid said
Kuwait was depleting Iraqi oil resource by drilling oil wells in a
joint border zone, warning that Baghdad "will take suitable
measures to protect its oil wealth."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Officials to Visit Cyprus to Discuss Immigrant Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A two-member delegation of the
Lebanese Ministry of Emigrant Affairs will arrive in Nicosia
Tuesday to solve the differences on immigrant issue between the two
countries, it was reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 266 illegal immigrants, mainly of Arab and Kurdish origin,
were saved from drowning last week by the Cyprus authorities when
their boat sank off the western island. They are now on two Cyprus
ships in the Limassol port, on the island's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus authorities claimed that the immigrants have set off
from Lebanon for Greece or Italy and wants them to be repatriated.
The Lebanese authorities, however, refused to take in these
immigrants, saying there is no evidence that the boat had sailed
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Interior Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said Monday

that the two Lebanese officials will be having talks on the issue
with the relevant Cypriot officials.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government has undisputable evidence that the
boat carrying the illegal immigrants had sailed from a Lebanese
port.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Lebanon signed an agreement in 1999 providing that
illegal immigrants showing up on their shores must be returned if
there is evidence proving the port from which they leave.
</P>
<P>
Due to the unique geographical location, Cyprus' shores have
been a major transit for illegal immigrants from the Middle East to
European countries. Some seek political asylum and many are conned
by foreigners who promise to take them elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Former U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Visits Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz on Monday held talks with Hans Von Sponeck, former U.N.
humanitarian coordinator who is now in Iraq again for a visit.
</P>
<P>
Aziz highly evaluated Sponeck's work when he acted as the U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, as well as his efforts to
acquaint the world with the crippling impacts of the decade-old U.
N. sanctions on Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also briefed Sponeck about Iraq's current humanitarian
situation.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sponeck said that the international community is
increasingly aware of the "disastrous" effect of the sanctions, and
the international efforts to lift the sanctions are mounting, the
INA said.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck resigned his post to protest the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A decade of sanctions against Iraq has "completely failed" and a
new approach is called for, Sponeck said in July.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation for civilians in Iraq as "critical," he
listed the diseases -- diarrhea, respiratory problems and
malnutrition-- from which Iraqis, especially children, are
suffering.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. oil-for-food is not working. Under the deal,
introduced at the end of 1996, Iraq is allowed to sell oil in order
to purchase essential goods under strict U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
Before he left his post at the end of last March, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein met him and expressed appreciation for his
stance.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the Iraqi president promised Sponeck
that he can visit Iraq at any time and need no visa.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, who was appointed as the top relief official in Iraq in
October 1998, angered the United States and Britain by saying that
the U.N. Security Council should treat Iraq's humanitarian needs
separately from the Council's aim to monitor Baghdad's disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Killing Disease Under Control in Saudi Arabia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia said Monday
that it has controlled a mysterious killing disease in southwest of
the kingdom, which has killed dozens of people since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The disease that starts with high fever, diarrhoea and kidney
failure broke out last Thursday in a valley region in the
southwestern Saudi province of Jizan near the border with Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Bin Faresi said after a cabinet
meeting that the cabinet listened to a report by Health Minister
Osama Abdel-Majid on the efforts made so far to control the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources Abdullah Bin Muammar
also reported the arrangements made for curbing the killing virus,
Farasi said.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that about 40 people, including some
entire families, have been killed by the disease, which may have
transmitted by mosquitoes from infested areas in Jizan following
recent heavy rains.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Explain Burundian Peace Accord to Refugees in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Former
President Nelson Mandela is to explain the Arusha peace accord
signed last month, to Burundian refugees in every camp in Tanzania
next month, reported the South African Press Association on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mandela's spokesman Mark Bomani as saying
that Mandela will made the tour with the companion of all
signatories of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The delegates will have the opportunity to tell the refugees
what has transpired during the two years of peace negotiations,"
Bomani said, adding Mandela would later made a similar mission in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Bomani also said that arrangements to repatriate Burundian
refugees in foreign countries would be made soon to enable those
willing to go home to do so without delay.
</P>
<P>
"But, this will be a voluntary exercise. No one will be forced
to go back to Burundi," Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who succeeded late former Tanzanian president Julius
Nyerere as mediator in the Burundi peace negotiations last October,
managed to broker the comprehensive political agreement late
August in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
So far 16 negotiating parties have signed the Arusha Peace and
Reconciliation Agreement aimed to end the country's seven-year
civil war and another three parties also agreed last week to sign
the accord on September 20 in Nairobi, Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls for Much More World Attention to African Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appeal came as Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin
took the floor at the two-week general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which began here a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The problems of Africa "are defined by those two very closely
related challenges. Africa's development continues to be arrested
by problems of insecurity, instability and lack of peace," he said.
"On the other hand, it appears unrealistic to expect durable peace
in Africa without hope in the future that could be brought about
only by visible indications about possibilities for progress."
</P>
<P>
"In both areas, Africa has not had the necessary support
commensurate with the complexity of the challenges it has faced,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is far from the truth that Africa has enjoyed sustained,
resolute and all-out support, either in the area of economic
development or in the sphere of peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He is echoing remarks by African leaders at the September 6-8
Millennium Summit that Africa needs quick and substantial support
in its efforts to stop conflicts, promote economic and social
development and check the spread of AIDS disease. The African
leaders blamed Western industrialized countries for double
standards or paying lip service in the area of the official
development assistance (ODA) to Africa, which has been on decline
over the past years.
</P>
<P>
"We have indeed been encouraged by the well-deserved emphasis
that was given to Africa and to Africa's predicament at the
Millennium Summit," he said. "It is our hope that the summit may
have helped create greater determination for cooperation with the
peoples of Africa so that Africa may make real progress in
addressing the challenges of development, and of peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
"But Africa's fate has been different," he said. "For whatever
reason, it has been easier to lose hope on Africa, than to give
the continent the benefit of the doubt."
</P>
<P>
On its border conflict with Eritrea, the Ethiopian foreign
minister said, "We are proceeding with full commitment to put
behind us the crisis we have had with Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
"Even before the deployment of peacekeepers, contrary to
experience in other places, the cessation of hostilities has held
for months now," he said.

The statement came as Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar of Pakistan
was speaking at the general debate of the 55th General Assembly
session, which began here on September 12.
</P>
<P>
"The Kashmir question, involving the life and future of the
people of the state, has been the root cause of tensions in South
Asia since 1947," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has consistently vowed for a peaceful settlement of
the Kashmir dispute," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ten million people of the state will not be denied their right
to freedom," he said. "They seek nothing more than the fulfillment
of the commitments contained in the resolutions of the (U.N.)
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"The right to decide their own future cannot lapse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Security Council once again emphasized the
need for solving the dispute which has been the source of tension
and conflict in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with intransigent rejection of peaceful means, the
Security Council has a responsibility to act. The charter empowers
the Security Council to do so," he said. "In its absence, mere
talk of crisis prevention and dispute resolution will lack
credibility."
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK R&AMP;D Spending Decline Threatens Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Substantial increases in
funding for the UK defense and aerospace research programs are
essential or it will lose jobs, a government taskforce has warned.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Department of Trade and Industry calls on the
government to reverse the long run decline in R&AMP;D budgets for
defense and civil aerospace.
</P>
<P>
The report also recommends scrapping the 50:50 rule whereby the
government will only provide funds for R&AMP;D projects provided it is
matched by upfront investment from industry.
</P>
<P>
The official report compiled by the Foresight Directorate's
defense, aerospace and systems panel says that it is of "
significant concern" that support from the UK government for the
defense and aerospace industries has continued to decline on a
yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The panel says it is a "regrettable fact" that UK R&AMP;D funding
fell by some 35 percent in real terms between 1976 and 1996 while
in Europe the budget spend by NATO nations on defense research is
10 billion US dollars compared with 36 billion US dollars in the
US.
</P>
<P>
In the view of the Foresight Panel, the UK needs to
reinvigorate its research base if future competitiveness is to be
assured.

<HEADLINE> UK Holiday Companies Hit by Soaring Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past 12 months, airline jet fuel costs have risen by
more than 90 percent in dollar terms, from 130 U.S. dollars to 250
dollars per metric tone.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed here that the price increase could
pose a serious threat to tour operators, such as Airtours, Thomson
Travel and First Choice, all of whom operate their own airline.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Reed, of BNP Paribas, said: "There is little these
companies can do to offset this massive increase in fuel costs."
</P>
<P>
Most of them were already operating at close to full capacity,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The full impact of the fuel hikes is unlikely to be felt for
several months, as companies tend to hedge in advance to help
protect themselves against price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
However, the trend for higher fuel prices provides a fresh blow
for travel groups, which are already battling with a slump in
European demand and aggressive discounting.

<HEADLINE> Chief of Shell Oil Group Opposes High Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde, Moody-Stuart, said
that the "wishable" price of oil should stand at 20 dollars a
barrel, while it attained 36 dollars last Friday in London.
</P>
<P>
He said that everybody has been affected negatively by the
recent rise of oil price, including oil producing countries and
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
"A too high price is bad news for everybody -- The producers,
because that lays stress on the demand for their production and
stimulates substitution energies. The consuming countries whose
tax policies are disputed. Developing countries, whose economies
are affected when fuel prices rise. And oil companies because it
is never good to have unhappy customers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although he hopes the oil price can stand at "a
little lower than 20 dollars" a barrel, it is not up to oil
companies alone to decide the price.

one side, the technological advances realized by oil companies to
exploit at low costs new oilfields are pulling the prices down...
On the other side, the OPEC intends to maintain the price at a

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. President Stresses One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter said there is only one China in the world and he
hoped that the Taiwan issue would be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Carter made the remarks while meeting with Zeng Jianhui, member
of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (
NPC) and chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee at his
native town of Plains, Georgia, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The former president called on the U.S. and China to strengthen
their cooperation and enhance their exchanges in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his talks with the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
about normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and
China, Carter said that both sides maintained that there was only
one China in the world and Taiwan was part of China.
</P>
<P>
All the U.S. administrations have since then abided by the One
China principle, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter was U.S. President from 1977 to 1981. After
leaving the White House, Carter returned to Georgia, where he
founded the nonprofit Carter Center in 1982 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, who led a seven-member NPC delegation on a two-
week visit to the United States, expressed his gratitude for
Carter's contribution in promoting the development of bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese NPC delegation arrived in the United States on
September 9 at the invitation of the U.S. Institute of
Representative Government.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Turkish Call for Dialog on Aegean Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday once again
rejected Turkey's call for direct talks on Aegean issues and urged
the neighboring country to make real steps for a rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Greece recognized no difference with Turkey apart from that of
the delineation for the Aegean continental shelf, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the request made by Turkish Prime Minister
Bullet Ecevit last Saturday for a dialog with Greece in order to
find a just settlement regarding the Aegean disputes.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Ecevit's call for direct talks, Reppas said that
such statements had no receiver because all other issues were
already clear.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent meeting between the foreign ministers of the
two countries in New York, he said that there had been "positive
elements" and "a constructive contribution" to relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Turkey must move in the right
direction because it had so far failed to contribute decisively to
improving Greek and Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have
closely gone to war three times over their territorial disputes in
the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but they have since
last June to take steps to improve their strained relations by
holding several rounds of bilateral talks and signing a total of
nine agreements for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With the politically improvement in Greek-Turkish ties, the
trade between the two countries have also increased significantly,
and the bilateral trade volume in the first half of this year have
risen to 491.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the relations between the two neighbors have shown
some improvement, Greece has complained that Turkey has not done
enough for the rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that only one issue, namely the
delineation of the Aegean continental shelf, needs settlement, and
calls on Turkey to take it up with the International Court at The
Hague.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Firm International Legal Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appeal came as Ghana's Foreign Minister James Victor Gbeho
took the floor at the two-week general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which began here on September 12.
</P>
<P>
"Ghana believes that the efforts of the United Nations to
promote and maintain international peace and security should rest
on a firm international legal framework, hence the need to
maintain support for the useful work being done by the
International Law Commission and related institutions in the U.N.
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the tremendous progress made in the
establishment of legal frameworks for the pursuit of crimes
against humanity for example must continue if our societies are to
be maintained," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the particular case of Africa, support for the
International Criminal Court is not only desirable," he said. "It
is a must, since censure by the international community is now
very necessary in dissuading warlords and rebels from committing
the heinous crimes that we continue to witness in countries such
as Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ghana recommends, therefore, that international law should
ensure that there is punishment for perpetrators of such crimes
and also that they do not enjoy amnesty from all countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of compromise, which led to the overwhelming
endorsement of the Rome Treaty of the International Criminal Court,
must be kept alive to our objectives in this field," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is taking an uphill effort to get into
effect the treaty creating the International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
So far, 112 countries have signed the treaty, and 19 countries
have ratified. At least 60 countries must ratify before the treaty
can enter into force.
</P>
<P>
The United States was one of the seven countries voting "no"
when 120 countries meeting in Rome in June 1998 approved the
tribunal, which would have jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity.

<HEADLINE> Israel Insists on Claims to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami Monday called for an "ideal compromise"
with the Palestinians over their long-standing disputes, while
giving no sign of backing off from its claims to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 55th session of the U.N. General Assembly, the
Israeli official said: "Peace is not about twisting each other's
arms, it is about defining a common interest. I believe that such
an ideal compromise is not impossible to achieve, while banishing
the sword from this Land of God."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that even at the height of "the Golden Age,
" "our people never abandoned their dream of, and yearning for
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami apparently echoed Prime Minister Ehud Barak who ruled
out hours earlier Islamic sovereignty over a key Jerusalem shrine
sacred to Muslims and Jews, and closed the door to a Palestinian
compromise proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side, insisting on sovereignty over
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, has proposed to consider the
option that the Islamic world's Jerusalem Committee exert
sovereignty over the Haram as-Sharif, Temple Mount as Jews call.
</P>
<P>
Barak told his cabinet members that "Israel is not only opposed
to transferring sovereignty on the Temple Mount to the
Palestinians, but it is also absolutely opposed to transferring
sovereignty on the Mount to any Muslim body," according to reports
from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the acting foreign minister told the General
Assembly session that the Jewish holy sites and shrines in
Jerusalem were "the very heart of the Jewish faith, identity and
history."
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem, the main dispute over who should be
sovereign on the holy compound, the holiest shrine of Judaism and
home to two major mosques, hindered progress in the July Camp
David Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and the latest contacts
resumed in New York and Jerusalem in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"Just as we do not question the sincerity of the sentiments of
others toward their holy sites in Jerusalem, we expect that others
will not question the Jewish people's deep, awesome attachment to
Jerusalem and its holy sites -- from which we will never again be
parted," said Ben-Ami, who said a deal with the Palestinians was
not promising last week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has responded to Barak's
latest statement by saying Monday that it was not up to Israel to
decide who will be sovereign over the Old City's shrines. "It is a
Muslim, Christian and Arab decision," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is scheduled to speak at the U.N. General
Assembly session Tuesday to further elaborate the Palestinian
stands on the thorny issues. In the meantime, the Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators would resume talks later Monday in
Jerusalem with no sign of immediate progress in sight.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli acting foreign minister also touched another
thorny issue, the return of Palestinian refugees, at the U.N.
session. He said the problem was "largely the inevitable by-
product of Arab and Jewish fears and the protracted bitter
fighting" and a future Palestinian state should provide for the
vindication of the Palestinian claim for the right of return.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has expressed its willingness to actively participate
in any international effort and fund aimed at providing the
financial foundations for the resolution of the refugee problem.
Out of humanitarian considerations, Israel may also accept a small
and very limited number of refugees within a scheme of family
reunification," Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has asked Israel to let the Palestinian
exiles return home and compensate them for their losses. It needs
time and hard negotiations to narrow their gaps.
</P>
<P>
The both sides were awaiting the United States to submit its
bridging proposal. President Bill Clinton has set the Middle East
peace process as one of his main diplomatic goals in his last days
at White House. U.S. presidential elections are scheduled for
November.

<HEADLINE> Annan Strongly Condemns Murder of U.N. Worker in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The condemnation was contained in a statement issued by Annan's
spokesman after the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
said in Geneva Monday that one worker was killed Sunday and
another still missing in an attack by unidentified gunmen in
southeast Guinea, near the border with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Annan "strongly condemns this senseless violence against
humanitarian workers, and appeals to West Africa leaders to do
whatever they can to secure the release of Ms. Laurence Djeya,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is shocked by the murder of Mensah
Kpognon, the head of the sub-office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees in Macenta, Guinea, yesterday," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He is also extremely concerned over the fate of another UNHCR
staff member, Sapeu Laurence Djeya, who was abducted by the same
unidentified armed elements who murdered Kpognon," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general conveys his condolences to Kpognon
family as well as to the UNHCR staff who are still mourning the
death of three colleagues killed in West Timor only two weeks ago,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The killed man, a Togolese national, is the fourth UNHCR staff
member murdered this month. The three others were killed in a pro-
Indonesian militia attack in West Timor on September 6.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based U.N. agency said it is calling on aid workers
worldwide to hold marches on Thursday to protest the abduction and
recent killings of UNHCR staff.
</P>
<P>
Several Guineans were killed and many houses burnt down in the
attack, which began early Sunday morning, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 460,000 refugees in Guinea -- about 330,000
of them Sierra Leonean and some 126,000 Liberian. Most of the
refugees in the Macenta area are Liberian, UNHCR said.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Highlights Freedom of Thought for Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reform-minded President
Mohammad Khatami stressed on Monday that the people should enjoy
the freedom of thought, which is the basis of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The basis of democracy is sovereignty of people over their fate,
and without freedom of thought, democracy cannot be realized,
Khatami told a public gathering in West Azarbaijan province in
northwestern Iran, where he is on an inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for "unity and unanimity of views"
among the Iranian people, the official IRNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the people should be united in resisting both pressures
from outside and the "narrow-minded stances" at home.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who won the 1997 presidential election as an advocate
of social, cultural and political reforms, has announced that he
will seek a second term in the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
But he and his reformist allies are facing increasing pressure
from the conservatives who are determined to safeguard by all means
their strict Islamic rule established since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who control the judiciary, the military and
many other key state organs, have stepped up crackdown on the
reformist campaign.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 pro-reform newspapers and periodicals have been
closed and several reformist journalists imprisoned by the
conservative judiciary on charges of violating Islamic principles
and advocating pro-American reforms.
</P>
<P>
The reformist camp under Khatami has maintained restraint to
prevent the situation from spinning out of control, which many
believe would only benefit the conservatives.

<HEADLINE> France Concerned With Kuwait's Security, Stability: French Commander </HEADLINE>

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior French military
commander said here Monday that France is concerned with Kuwait's
security and stability, hinting that Paris will protect Kuwait from
possible foreign attacks.
</P>
<P>
Herve Giraud, Commander of the French naval forces in the Indian
Ocean, said,"Kuwait's security is France's security," adding his
country is ready to interfere if Kuwait is attacked by any foreign
side.
</P>
<P>
Giraud, who was appointed to the post last August and arrived
here Saturday on a four-day visit, reasserted France is committed
to the joint French-Kuwaiti security agreement, the official Kuwait
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed a defense accord with France in 1992, one year
after a multi-national force, including the French troops, freed
Kuwait from the seven-month Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
The French commander said he has come to "express France's
priorities towards the security and stability of the Gulf and
Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Giraud also expressed happiness with Kuwait for the purchase of
eight French warships, a matter he thought would "make France hold
a special responsibility towards Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed a deal worth 475 million U.S. dollars in 1995 to
buy the French gunboats facilitated with high-tech fighting
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of four ships was delivered last year, and the
rest four boats are on their way home and will joint the Kuwaiti
navy next October.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Political Parties Urged to Settle Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A European parliamentary
delegation now on a visit to Bangladesh Monday urged the political
parties in the country to sit down and settle their dispute to
pave the way for the return of the boycotting opposition to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation had talks with both the ruling party and the
opposition and urged both sides to seek a solution of their
dispute so that opposition parties can return to the parliament
and take part in proceedings," the EU envoy in Dhaka, Antonio De
Menezes, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the two-member delegation coincided with the start
of preparations for election in Bangladesh amid strained relations
between the ruling Awami League and the opposition alliance led by
Bangladesh Nationalist party.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has been boycotting the parliament session for
over a year, alleging that their leaders and lawmakers were not
given enough time in the parliament to talk about problems of the
people. But the speaker of the parliament has rejected the
opposition claim.
</P>
<P>
Jeaqim Miranda, chairman of the EU Committee on Development and
Cooperation, and Bob Van den Bos, the committee's rapporteur for
Bangladesh, are now in Bangladesh on a five-day visit at the
invitation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to interfere in Bangladesh's politics, but we
have been asked to monitor the next general election to be held
next year," Miranda told a discussion at the Bangladesh Institute
of International Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
The EU team also visited the country's Chittagong Hill tracts
and held talks there with former rebel leaders who had been at
guerrilla war with the government for over two decades.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Tutsi Group Threatens to Bomb Refugee Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An unknown Burundi
Tutsi extremist group has threatened to start bombing Burundian
refugee camps in western Tanzania next month, the independent
Guardian newspaper reported here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bombing is set to start on October 15, Anti Hutu Revolution
Burundi Group (AHRBG), was quoted as saying in a secret letter
written to D.G. Ludamila, the Police Commander of Ngara District
in Tanzania's western Kagera Region, which hosts hundreds of
thousands of Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The group said it has already planted land mines close to camps
currently sheltering about 450,000 refugees, adding that apart
from land mines, the terrorist group possesses hand grenades for
the planned attacks, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Kigoma Regional Police Commander Placid Chaka said over the
weekend the movement of refugees and foreigners in the two regions
is being closely monitored by law enforcers, adding that stern
measures would be taken against any person or group suspected to
belong to such a terrorist gang.
</P>
<P>
The letter says that such attacks are necessary for "the
failure of Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa to repatriate all
Burundian refugees back home as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
"We requested President Mkapa to repatriate all Burundian
refugees back home similar to the 1996 repatriation of Rwandan
refugees. But, to date, he has done nothing," reads the letter.
</P>
<P>
"The AHRBG wants to destroy and wage an underground war against
any country, including Tanzania, which offers accommodation to
refugees of Hutu origin who used to launch military attacks
against our country," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist group also charges that it is not in support of
the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement signed in Arusha last month
by Burundi parties and possible involvement of armed rebel groups,
mainly CNDD-FDD, in the planned cease-fire negotiations scheduled
to start later this month, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In Burundi, fighting between the army led by the Tutsi
minorities and the rebels of the majority Hutus has claimed the
lives of around 200,000 people, most of them civilians, and
displaced 1.2 million others since 1993. Large number of refugees
fled into neighboring Tanzania to seek asylum.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Respect of Rights of Nations to Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese nuclear
energy official, in an address to a meeting of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) here Monday, urged the respect of
justifiable rights of IAEA member states to the peaceful use of
nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Huazhu, head of the Chinese delegation to the 44th
session of the IAEA General Conference, said that China opposes
hampering justifiable rights of member states of the IAEA to
peaceful application of nuclear energy under the pretext of non-
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
He said that nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful application
of nuclear energy are two well-balanced functions of the IAEA, and
that the IAEA should not over-emphasize one aspect while
neglecting the other.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is the Director of State Agency of Atomic Energy of
China, said that nuclear energy is clean, safe and economical.
Nuclear power accounts for one sixth of the world's power
generation at present. In the long run, nuclear energy should
play an important role.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the Chinese delegation believes the IAEA
should utilize its advantages to scientifically assess and
objectively popularize the function of nuclear energy in the
world's sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that the IAEA should organize information
exchange and answer difficult questions about technology to settle
the public's common concerns on nuclear safety and disposal of
radio-active waste.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating the research and development work of the member
states, improving training and helping developing countries
establish and improve nuclear infrastructure should be the IAEA's
missions, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged developed countries to transfer more technology and
provide expert service to developing countries while increasing
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On nuclear safety and disposal of nuclear waste, Zhang said
these are the major issues contributing to the public's negative
view on nuclear energy and require urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation believes the IAEA, as an authoritative
international organization, could improve international
conventions and standards on nuclear safety and improve
technological exchange to help member states maintain their
nuclear safety levels.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of establishing a reliable shield for non-
proliferation, Zhang said the Chinese delegation supports the IAEA
in setting up more safeguards and establishing a reliable non-
proliferation shield within its mandate.
</P>
<P>
China also holds that establishing a world-wide stable security
environment is key to preventing nuclear weapons proliferation.
Promoting international cooperation will also play a role, as will
removing double or multiple non-proliferation standards.
</P>
<P>
Non-proliferation should be supplementary to promotion
activities rather than hamper member states' justifiable rights to
peaceful application of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA is an inter-governmental organization established in
1957. Its main objectives are to enlarge the contribution of
atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world
and to ensure nuclear assistance under its supervision is not used
for military purposes. China became a member state in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The 44th Session of the IAEA General Conference started on
Monday and will conclude this Friday.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Railway and Shipping Transport Development in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- France called on the European
Union (EU) countries on Monday to seriously consider the
development of railway and shipping transport systems to lessen
dependence on road and air transport that consume a large amount
of oil.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot made the
proposal during an extraordinary session of EU transport ministers
held in Copenhagen, Denmark, to discuss the oil crisis faced by
Europe due to the rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the EU seek a new balance between different
means of transport, since the transport volume of Europe is
expected to double in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He warned against the serious consequences that could arise
from merely developing the road and air transport at the expense
of other means of transport.
</P>
<P>
Gayssot urged EU countries to focus on the social consequences
involved in the development of transport and encouraged the use of
a variety of transport means by reforming transport policies.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian crime reporter Michel
Auger is out of intensive care and rising to walk after a gunman
shot five times in his back Wednesday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old journalist was transferred from intensive care
in a Montreal hospital and surprised his family by rising from his
hospital bed to take several steps Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are all very pleasantly surprised he was able to do this
just four days after someone tried to murder him," said Stephane
Alarie, his colleague with the city's Journal de Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Auger, who remains under police protection, was shot a day
after he published an expose on a series of killings in the
criminal underworld.
</P>
<P>
The murder attempt prompted marches Friday in Montreal and
Ottawa by journalists and other walks of people to show solidarity
with Auger and protest against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested three suspects ever since the shooting
occurred in the parking lot of the Journal de Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Heyns Wins Bronze Medal in Women's Olympic 100m Breaststroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Breaststroke queen Penny
Heyns Monday lost her 100-meter Olympic crown as she finished
third behind teenagers Megan Quann of the United States and
Australia's Leisel Jones to claim South Africa's first medal in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Quann clocked 1:07.05secs, Jones 1:07.49 and Heyns 1:07.55.
Heyns led over the first 50m, but the South African duet failed
to hold off the charging Quann and Jones.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I'm glad it's over," Heyns said after the medal
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been an easy Olympics. For some reason, it hasn't
been in my legs this season. I had the first 50m, but I was gone
after that. The Olympic Games is difficult," Heyns added. "No
matter how good you are, the pressure here is something else."
</P>
<P>
Heyns, who had a brilliant run last year when she broke 11
world records in the space of two months, went off the boil after
taking a month off following the death of a close friend in Canada
early this year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just not sure what happened this season. It's been a tough
season and one day I will discuss more about that," she said.
</P>
<P>
But she further said she was satisfied with her bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
"I was a bit emotional out there (during the ceremony), but
that was more to do with that I'm coming to the end of my career."
</P>
<P>
Heyns will get to defend her 200m title later this week,
although she is not prepared to predict.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what happens," she said.

<HEADLINE> Top CPC Official Stresses Grass-Root Procuratorate Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), today urged
related officials to do better procuratorate work at the grass-
roots level.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, made this remark at a national working meeting on
promoting grass-roots level procuratorate work which opened today
and was presided over by Han Zhubin, procurator-general of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
"As an important law-executing body, procuratorates at all
levels should on one hand carefully observe the law, and on the
other hand enhance their supervisory power so as to guarantee the
justice and sanctity of the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, although progress has been made in the last
two years, some problems still need to be solved especially at the
grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the country's local procuratorates are still
not so satisfactory -- the overall quality of staff is relatively
low and not suitable for the need of the socialist market economy
and the rule of law principle.
</P>
<P>
"We must fight a lasting war to improve the work of the grass-
roots level procuratorates," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the related officials to improve the work in five
aspects: good leadership, good teamwork, good mechanism, good
performance and good image.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the party committees at all levels to instruct,
support and help the work of various procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Luo Gan, who is also secretary of the Committee
of Political Science and Law Under the Chinese Communist Party (
CPC) Central Committee and a member of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee, also attended today's working meeting.

cooperation between foreign experts and local professionals is not
only good for joint venture projects but also promotes friendship,

SHANGHAI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A reddish Ford Transit was
delivered to the Shanghai Orphanage today as a gift from the Ford
Motor China Ltd. and the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The 12-seat luxury bus will be used for a Sino-British foster
care program for orphans in the welfare organization, according to
a local official.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai pioneered in 1997 to encourage families to offer their
care to children in orphanages. Under the program, 240 orphans now
live with ordinary Shanghai residents, with the cost of their
education and health care covered by orphanages.
</P>
<P>
"Care For Children," a British non-government charity, became
involved in the program in 1998, and since then, many British
families have extended their warm hands to Chinese orphans.
</P>
<P>
Li Yanlin, director of the Shanghai Social Welfare Center, said
that the family foster care of orphans has been popular in Western
countries. Shanghai has a lot to learn from foreign charitable
organizations on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The collective foster care of orphans in charitable
organizations is the principal way of taking care of the children
in China.

International Union of Local Authorities, so as to explore
possibilities of cooperation between local governments of
different countries.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges between sister-cities in the areas of culture, people,
the economy, trade and sports promote mutual understanding and lay
a solid foundation for strengthening people-to-people friendship,
a local analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also vice-president of the CPAFFC, said the conference is
more likely designed to promote cooperation between medium and
small cities, in order to seek a common platform for development.
</P>
<P>
In another front, the 2000 China international Friendship City
Exchange Exhibition and Trade Fair will be held by the CPAFFC and
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, with
an effort to provide business opportunities for participating
cities.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair will have an auction of more than 100 websites,
which is sure to be the highlight of the event.
</P>
<P>
"Lots of work remains to be done due the fact that Chinese
cities are expanding and cities in developing countries will also
be developing, and perhaps we would preside over another
conference when the number of sister-cities will grow up to 1,500,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Southwest-Northwest Water Diversion Project infeasible: Geologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A noted Chinese geologist today
said the proposal to divert water from the Yarlung Zangbo River in
southwest China to quench the thirst of northwest China is not
feasible.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zonghu, an academician from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the proposed
project is too costly and technologically is not safe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual conference of the China Association for
Science and Technology (CAST) in Xi'an, the provincial capital of
Shaanxi in northwest China, he explained that the proposed water
diversion route runs through the most complicated and vulnerable
land forms, and much of the areas is subject to earthquakes and
geological disasters.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks in response to the water diversion
proposal raised by many experts over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The contradiction between water demand and consumption for
northwest China has been caused by out-of-order exploitation of
its natural resources, thus causing huge waste of water resources,
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"Improving water use efficiency is the best way to solve the
problem."
</P>
<P>
Northwest China is classified as a dry area, where there is
not rich water resources, but it has a lot of sparsely populated
land, where the per-capita water resources are much more than the
eastern part of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Raising water efficiency in farming is of great importance for
northwest China, where the farming industry accounts for over 90
percent of the water used in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The annual amount of water used in the region totaled 207
billion cubic meters, of which 139 billion cubic meters is usable.
</P>
<P>
There is still some potential to be tapped as only 59.2 percent
of it has been used.

BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Xiao Yang, president of China
's Supreme People's Court, today urged courts at all levels to
give priority to fostering high-quality judges who can meet the
needs of the new century and satisfy the Party and the people.

law. Judges must have a high professional quality, otherwise, it
is difficult to ensure judicial justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference called for strengthening the education
and training of judges. All judges and court leaders should
receive professional training before taking their jobs as well as
in-service training, according to the meeting. A training system

<HEADLINE> Manila Continues Military Operations Against Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
numbering some 4,000 continued to hunt Monday for the Abu Sayyaf
terrorists in the Sulu towns of Patikul and Talipao where the
group is believed to be holding 19 local and foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
Generoso Senga, spokesman of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines(AFP), said Monday afternoon in the southern Zamboanga
City that local leaders have expressed their support for the
decision to rescue the hostages through the ongoing military
operations.
</P>
<P>
According to Senga, AFP Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes met with
the officers and members of the Sulu Provincial Peace and Order
CounciL(PPOC) on Monday in the provincial capital of Jolo and
discussed with them the ongoing operations.
</P>
<P>
Senga said the PPOC passed three resolutions on support for
President Joseph Estrada's military option, for the immediate
lifting of the maritime and communication service embargo between
Zamboanga City and Jolo and for the government to set up a human
rights office in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
AFP Chief of Staff Reyes said the military will allow only
inter-island cargo vessels to resume operations starting Tuesday,
but the resumption of passenger service and the reconnection of
communication lines still have to be studied.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Senga described the situation in Jolo as "generally
peaceful." He quoted mayors of the various towns in Sulu Province
as saying that except for Patikul and Talipao, the other towns are
not affected by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senga denied reports that Caucasian soldiers,
especially American personnel, are in Jolo taking part in the
pursuit operations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there are no additional casualties, whether
killed or wounded, since the last figures were released to the
media Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The government said Sunday that since military operations began
at 1 a.m. Saturday, six Abu Sayyaf rebels were killed and 20
suspected Abu Sayyaf members captured while four government
soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Senga dismissed speculations that Abu Sayyaf elements are able
to escape through the dragnets and blockades, saying a maximum
deployment of military resources has been put in place to prevent
that from happening.
</P>
<P>
He said Brigadier General Narciso Abaya, who is the overall
commander of the anti-Abu Sayyaf operations, told General Reyes
that he expects to finish the mission within the week.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Up 26.1 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
totaled 42.92 billion Singapore dollars (23.81 billion U.S.
dollars) in August this year, expanding by 26.1 percent over a
year ago, Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said Monday in
its monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
TDB attributed the robust growth to buoyant demand for key
electronic products, as well as sustained demand from key Asian
economies.
</P>
<P>
In August, non-oil domestic export expanded by 17.7 percent,
driven by continued strong growth in domestic exports of
integrated circuits, telecommunications equipment, ink cartridges
and non-electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil re-exports grew by 34.5 percent during the month,
reflecting strong growth in all major markets and products.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports, excluding aircraft and ships, continued to
expand at a healthy rate of 25.9 percent in August, largely on the
back of the growth of electronic products such as integrated
circuits, telecommunication equipment, capacitors and CD-ROM
drives.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic export to Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong
expanded further in August by 28.3, 23.1 and 30.2 percent
respectively while that to the United States and the European
Union edged up marginally by 4.8 and 0.4 percent separately.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Takes Measures to Improve Children's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Identifying polio and diarrhea
as the main culprits for the high child mortality rate in the
country, the Bangladeshi health minister Sunday said the
government has taken up massive programs for the development of
child health.
</P>
<P>
"Eradication of polio and control of diarrhea can help reduce
the child mortality rate to a great extent," Health Minister
Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim said while inaugurating a national
workshop on child health development in Cox's Bazaar, a southeast
coastal district in the country, according to an official press
release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the present government has succeeded in its efforts to
reduce the child mortality rate, the rate is still much higher
compared with other countries, the minister admitted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's acute respiratory infection
program, Selim said it has contributed a lot to reducing the
country's child mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, he said, almost all doctors of the country'
s 64 districts have been given training. All health workers are
expected to complete their training by November 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in Bangladesh the under-five child
mortality rate is 9.2 percent, infant mortality rate 5.7 percent
and maternal mortality rate 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would observe the coming National
Immunization Week in a befitting manner with a view to eradicating
polio from Bangladesh by 2000 although the World Health
Organization (WHO) says Bangladesh needs another year to reach the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Selim also emphasized the need for providing education to
school students on malnutrition, blindness caused by Vitamin A and
iodine deficiencies, breast-feeding and diarrhea control measures
under the health education program.
</P>
<P>
Attending the workshop were all civil surgeons of the country'
s 64 districts, divisional health directors and country
representatives of the U.N. Children's Fund and the WHO.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rules Out Cease-fire With Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it will no longer be possible to order a cease-fire
and negotiate with the Abu Sayyaf as military operations against
the extremist group entered the third day.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it is not likely that there will be a cease-
fire or that negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf will resume for the
release of the hostages," Press Secretary and Presidential
Spokesman Ricardo Puno said in his regular press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be difficult to order a cease-fire at this
stage when soldiers are already in the field and military
operations are ongoing. "I think events have overtaken us."
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered a pre-dawn military
attack last Saturday against the Abu Sayyaf rebels who are now
holding one American, two French journalists, three Malaysians and
13 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The group has reportedly amassed millions of dollars in ransom
for the release of 20 of the 21 mostly foreign hostages they
seized from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23. While
freeing some of their captives, they took new hostages for ransom.
</P>
<P>
Puno also reiterated the operation guidelines ordered by the
president to the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the
Philippine National Police, the paramount of which is to exhaust
all means to safely rescue the 19 hostages still in the hands of
the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Other guidelines, according to Puno, are quick resolution of
the situation, an immediate stop to the lawlessness in the area
and deterring of other groups from doing similar terroristic acts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Puno said President Estrada has sought the
understanding of the whole world on the actions taken by the
government against the Abu Sayyaf in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
On criticisms coming from the French government of the military
operations, Puno said the president is asking for their
understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that through the Department of Foreign Affairs,
the president has made it very clear to foreign governments what
he considers to be of national interest on this particular issue.

<HEADLINE> Broadband Users Double to 250,000 in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of broadband
users in Singapore has more than doubled over the last six months
to 250,000, the InfoComm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA)
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by this trend, IDA said it is launching an
international content hosting scheme which aims to enhance
Singapore's position as a broadband content hub in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lim Swee Say, minister of state for the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology, said Monday at an IDA
seminar that the duration of support under the scheme will be
lengthened to two years, compared with six months under the
existing Online Hosting Scheme.
</P>
<P>
Describing the outlook for broadband in Singapore as exciting,
Lim outlined the focus for the country going forward.
</P>
<P>
"We have three key priorities in the coming years. First is to
speed up the pace of innovation in broadband applications; second,
to broaden the base of broadband penetration; and third, to foster
greater collaboration in the Asia-Pacific region," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, IDA also signed memoranda of understanding
with seven strategic industry partners, including Microsoft and
content providers from Japan, South Korea, India and China's Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
They will help build up a critical mass of broadband content
providers in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Another new initiative introduced is the setting up of an
industry-led broadband media association to help spur strategic
alliances and business networking.

<HEADLINE> Military Operations Aim to Free Hostage: Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Armed Forces Chief
of Staff Angelo Reyes said Monday that the ongoing military
operations against the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu are basically aimed at
rescuing the remaining hostages and not an invasion move to
pulverize the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the southern Zamboanga City,
Reyes said the military strictly abide by the four-point guideline
issued to the participating troops by President Joseph Estrada on
Sunday, of which the rescue operation is a part.
</P>
<P>
Reyes expressed satisfaction over the performance of the troops
in the field who have been infiltrating the Abu Sayyaf camp in an
effort to rescue one American, two French journalists, three
Malaysians and 12 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
He said Abu Sayyaf rebel camps in the hinterlands of Patikul
and Talipao towns in Sulu Province have been captured by
government troops after heavy bombardments by warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Reyes described as "fierce" the engagement between the joint
military and police forces and the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu Province.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources disclosed that the rebels led by Ghalib
Andang with some 200 loyal followers sought refuge at the
boundaries between Patikul, Indanan and Jolo towns while other
factions fled to nearby municipalities.
</P>
<P>
"This operation will continue and we hope to finish it as soon
as possible," Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada ordered a military attack last Saturday
against the Abu Sayyaf rebels who have reportedly amassed millions
of dollars in ransom for the release of some hostages they seized
from Malaysia on April 23.

MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso ended
weaker against the U.S. dollar Monday in line with the falling
regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed 45.82 against the green back, weaker than the
previous close of 45.59 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the peso tracked the downward direction of the
Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"We're just aligning with the prices of other regional
currencies.The baht and the rupiah dropped sharply over the
weekend. So this is just initial market jitters from weaker
regional currencies," a dealer at a U.S. bank said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers added that the market has largely discounted the
political strife in the south including the military's attack that
began Saturday against the extremist Abu Sayyaf group which is
holding 19 foreign and Filipino hostages.
</P>
<P>
"A positive reaction from the market may only be expected if
the government finally wins the war against the Abu Sayyaf," a

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Oil Boss Appeals to Strikers Back to Work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Managing director of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Jackson Gaius-
Obaseki, Monday appealed to the striking workers to return to work
in the interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the media in the capital Abuja, Obaseki said that
the strike, which began last week over payment disagreement, has
paralyzed the country's economy as most of the filling stations
went dry.
</P>
<P>
The workers from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff
Association of Nigeria and the National Union of Petroleum and
Natural Gas Workers went on strike after failing to reach an
agreement over their demand for a 25 percent payment increase with
the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The workers vowed Sunday that they would continue with the
action until their demands would be met.
</P>
<P>
However, Obaseki said the NNPC had been in touch with the
management of oil companies and the striking workers with a view
to finding a last solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the public not to resort to panic-buying as
the NNPC had sufficient stock of petroleum products to last the
nation several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest oil-producing country in Africa, depends
upon imported petroleum products for domestic consumption.

Moyo told provincial heads, captains of industry and commerce
in Bulawayo that "we cannot run this economy when the civil
service becomes inefficient and does not perform accordingly," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said as a result the government has introduced major reforms
within the service such as job evaluation exercise to help reduce
the duplication of duties, performance appraisals and cost-cutting
measures.
</P>
<P>
"We are not reforming just for the sake of it, but as part of
the economic measures to revive the country's economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the moves were in line with the Millennium
Economic Recovery Plan which aims at reducing the country's budget
deficit by cutting money going for salaries and channeling it to
infrastructural and capital projects.
</P>
<P>
He said less than eight percent of this year's budget was going
for capital and other infrastructural development, and yet those
were the critical areas which needed attention.
</P>
<P>
He warned civil servants who abused their powers and
manipulated communities where they operated that they would be
fired.
</P>
<P>
He cited the case of the land resettlement exercise where some
civil servants were said to be deliberately sabotaging the program.

<HEADLINE> More Deaths Reported As New Clashes Rise in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- More deaths have been reported
in Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya in the last three days,
as clashes rise throughout the war-torn region, Russian media
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that in Staryie Atagi, a
Chechen town of about 15,000 people, unknown men wearing uniforms
and masks dragged a local resident, Magomed Chikuyev, 34, out of
his house and shot him dead Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Five other civilians, aged between 15 and 70, were killed by
rebels in various parts of the town at dawn on Saturday. The
reasons behind these murders are still unknown, local police said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Alexei Dershelenya, ataman of the Kizlyar Cossack
District of Dagestan, together with an aide to the district
military commandant and a Russian army sergeant, were killed by
automatic weapons fire while traveling by car to the outskirts of
the village of Kargalinskaya, located in the Shelkovsky region of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, deputy head of the police department in
the Chechen district of Vedeno, Col. Shamil Azayev, was killed by
an unidentified assailant at his home Saturday evening after a
curfew was imposed, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new clashes and fire exchanges between Russian
troops and Chechen rebel groups are happening with increasing
frequency, deepening fears that the rebels have launched a more
intensive hit-and-run war against the federal units, causing more
casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Russian news agencies Sunday said that federal forces killed
six rebels and detained another while a group of militants
attempted to break through federal checkpoints outside the village
of Chechen-Aul towards the south village of Stariye Atagi.
</P>
<P>
Ammunition, including charges for an armored vehicle, was
confiscated after the fighting, the Russian military said.
</P>
<P>
Six other rebels were killed and four Arab mercenaries were
captured in Chechnya's Vedeno district Sunday during a special
federal operation, the Russian staff in the North Caucasus said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Mi-24 gunships also destroyed three rebel bases
identified by ground reconnaissance groups on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Su-25 attack planes flew eight combat missions and destroyed
rebel positions in Vedeno and Nozhai-Yurt districts, while Mi-24
and Mi-8 helicopters flew nearly 30 missions, destroying five
enemy strongholds and two arms depots.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, federal sappers averted two terrorist
attacks on office buildings. Meanwhile, checkpoints came under
rebel fire seven times. Police disposed of a powerful explosive
device set to go off in a marketplace in Chernorechye, a suburb of
Grozny, the staff said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The police said they also prevented a number of terrorist
attacks in other parts of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Rebels are avoiding head-on confrontation with the federal
troops, ambushing Russian units instead and then retreating in
orderly fashion, often with support of local populations,
according to the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
The military also reported that almost all temporary police
stations in the capital city of Grozny were attacked by Chechen
guerrillas on Saturday, but there were no losses of servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Rebel firings upon Russian police stations and block-posts
have lately become more frequent, and Saturday's incidents were no
more special than what happens everyday, Russian military official
in Grozny admitted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A drive-by shooting from a
motorcycle killed three people Sunday night in the Dutch town of
Tilburg, police sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Carel Bouwmans told the press it seemed that
the attackers, a gunman and a motorcyclist, used automatic weapons
"because there were dozens of shots fired through the windows."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to say whether the police had any clues
about the identities or the whereabouts of the attackers.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate in the period from June to August 2000
was 4.9 percent, the same as that in the three months between May

</P>
<P>
The underemployment rate in the June-August period, at 2.8
percent, was lower than the 3 percent in May-July, according to
statistics released by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Comparing June-August with May-July 2000, decreases in the
unemployment rate were seen mainly in the decoration and
maintenance, restaurants, import and export trade, financing and
insurance sectors, offsetting the increases registered in the real
estate and business services sectors.
</P>
<P>
The size of the total labor force, at 3,386,000 in June-August
2000, was larger than that of 3,380,200 in the previous three
months.
</P>
<P>
The number of employed persons also increased, from 3,207,700
to 3,213,000 over the same period.

persons also fell, from 102,100 to 96,000.
</P>
<P>
A government Secretariat spokesman noted that unemployment had
not risen in the latest period, even with the further entry of
fresh graduates and school leavers into the labor market.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that along with the sustained economic recovery,
these fresh graduates and school leavers were being increasingly
absorbed into employment, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Court Rules Against Death Sentence on Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of
Pakistan Monday ruled against death penalty to a member of a Sunni
extremist group in the murder of five Iranian cadets in Pakistan
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
A three-member bench of the apex court accepted a petition by
Muhammad Asif against his death sentence, awarded to him by the
Anti-Terrorism Court in 1998, which was also upheld by Lahore High
Court.
</P>
<P>
Five Iranian Air Force cadets, who were in Pakistan for
training, and their Pakistani driver were attacked and killed in
Rawalpindi, twin city of the national capital of Islamabad,on
September 17, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court bench ordered a retrial of the case and
directed the trial court to complete the trial within three months,
considering it as a fresh case.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 Iranian nationals, including two senior diplomats,have
been killed on Pakistani soil in different terrorist attacks in
the past 10 years. Mainly Sunni extremist groups have been accused
of committing these killings.
</P>
<P>
The apex court also rejected a prosecution appeal against the
acquittal of Muhammad Yaqub, another accused in the same case.
</P>
<P>
Iran had been unhappy over the slow pace of the trial of the
Iranians' murder cases and had been asking Pakistani authorities
at high level to step up the trial.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed a review
petition of a convict in the murder of an Iranian diplomat and
upheld his death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Thai Recovery on Track But Still Fragile: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic recovery
is on track but remains fragile, the World Bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai economy has continued to expand in 2000 while exports
remain the main driver of growth, the bank said in a report on
East Asia, expecting Thailand to grow by 4 to 5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, "the increased market volatility, the increase in oil
prices and the uncertainty arising from forthcoming elections may
have adversely affected consumer confidence," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The pace and quality of the financial and corporate reform
continue to be the major constraint to the full cementing of the
recovery," it said.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans still represent 32 percent of total credit,
which could jeopardize the financing of new investments in sectors
that are currently running close to full capacity, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
A major downside risk to the growth scenario is the observed
slowdown in manufacturing production which reflects weak domestic
demand while the dependence of the recovery on foreign demand
creates another important risk, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, while market volatility has increased, it is "unlikely
" to lead to turmoil, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's external position remains comfortable and its fiscal
policy continues to support the recovery. While public debt of the
country has increased and will pose challenges in the future, it
is manageable.
</P>
<P>
Monetary policy continues to be accommodating and total factor
productivity and the quality of the labor force are trending-up.
</P>
<P>
Possibly because the market was discontent with Thailand's pace
of reforms and political uncertainty, the Stock Exchange of
Thailand index has lost 36 percent of its value since January 2000
and the baht has depreciated by 7.7 percent to below 41 against
the U.S. dollar, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank pointed out that these adjustments "do not
point towards a new crisis as the balance of payments situation
remains comfortable."

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends More Troops to Kosovo to Secure Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain is sending an extra
600 troops to Kosovo to boost the NATO contingent in the Yugoslav
province to help secure the upcoming Yugoslav presidential and
parliamentary elections, the Times newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken amid fears that the elections, scheduled
for next Sunday, could lead to new unrest in the Balkans, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The troops will stay in Kosovo for two months in case anything
unexpected should happen during the election period, during which
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will run for a second four-
year term.
</P>
<P>
The extra British troops from the Second Battalion Light
Infantry will be joined over the next few weeks by three other
infantry battalions, from France, Italy and Greece, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces in Kosovo, which were deployed in the province
after last year's air campaign, is expected to increase by more
than 2,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgrade is holding a show trial against Western
leaders for the war crimes they committed, including British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, U.S. President Bill Clinton and 12 other
Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade's Palace of Justice is holding a trial for those
regarded as the most responsible for NATO's 78-day air campaign
which killed more than 800 people, including about 500 civilians,
and destroyed much of Yugoslavia's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are accused of using such illegal weapons as
cluster bombs and causing criminal damage such as polluting the
River Danube and attempting to murder Milosevic, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down in EU, Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Inflation went down in both
the European Union (EU) and the euro zone in August, Eurostat
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical agency of the European Union
said that inflation fell from 2.2 percent in July to 2.0 percent
in August in the 15-nation EU. It dropped from 2.4 percent in
July to 2.3 percent in August in the 11-nation single currency
area.
</P>
<P>
Yet just one year ago, the inflation rate for the European
Union and the euro zone were both at 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has set a ceiling for the 2.0 percent
inflation rate and the European Central Bank has been raising its
benchmark lending interest rate so as to curb the rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
In August, the lowest inflation among the 15 EU member states
was found in Britain, where the inflation was at 0.6 percent. The
highest inflation was registered in Ireland at 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, only five of the 15 EU member states had below-2.0
percent inflation in the month reported on by the Eurostat,
signaling bad news for the plummeting single currency.

MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A joint international
peacekeeping exercise, coded "Central Asian Peacekeeping Battalion-
2000" and conducted within the framework of the NATO Partnership
for Peace Program, ended in Kazakhstan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was intended to promote coordination between
Central Asian countries and NATO member nations in peacekeeping
operations and to improve the abilities of commanders and
headquarters staff to handle peacekeeping and humanitarian
activities, exercise headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 servicemen from the United States, Kazakhstan,
Russia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Britain, Turkey, Mongolia,
Azerbaijan and Georgia took part in the exercises, which began at
the Kazakh training grounds on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The idea of Centrasbat (the Central Asian Peacekeeping
Battalion) has once again demonstrated its feasibility, Kazakh
Defense Minister Sat Tokpakbayev said at the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Such exercises contribute to mutual understanding through the
coordination of activities among servicemen from different
countries, he said, adding that the peacekeeping units
demonstrated their good training and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
The Centrasbat was established in Kazakhstan in May 1996, with
over 500 servicemen from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>

The first joint drill between the peacekeeping camp and NATO
was held in September 1997, and the next annual drill will be

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- EMI and Warner Music have
offered concessions to get passed a potential European Union block
on their planned music joint venture, the European Commission said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting was held on Monday between European Union Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti and senior executives from the two
entertainment giants.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting took place in the morning," said Monti's
spokesperson Amelia Torres. "The merging parties made proposals
which they have yet to formalize."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, needs to examine the proposals made by EMI and
Warner Music and to test them on the market, according to the
spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the European Commission would be able to
consult with other entertainment businesses to see whether the
concessions are enough.
</P>
<P>
EMI and Warner Music had until midnight Tuesday to offer their
concessions concerning the merger review by the commission. The
two companies said late last week that it was still hopeful that
the European Commission will allow their joint venture to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to give its verdict on the 20
billion U.S. dollar music joint venture on October 18.

PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- On Monday, France called for a
rapid return to calm in Cote d'Ivoire after shootings took place
Sunday night in the residence of military junta leader General
Robert Guei.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for the rapid return to calm after the acts of
violence that occurred last night in Abidjan," said assistant
spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry Bernard Valero.
</P>
<P>
He said it is essential for preparations for the presidential
election on October 22 to be carried out in good conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also said the French embassy in Abidjan has gotten in touch
with the French nationals living in Cote d'Ivoire, but has not
made plans for evacuation of the expatriates.
</P>
<P>
Shootings took place Sunday night between gunmen who entered
the residence of Guei and his security guards, according to
reports from Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown yet whether Guei was injured in the shooting or
whether he was at the residence at that time.
</P>
<P>
Last week, France reinforced its troop deployment in Abidjan
and has sent a navy ship to the coast of Cote d'Ivoire in case an
evacuation operation should be necessary for French nationals in
the country.

</P>
<P>
-- Texas Governor George W. Bush sets off Monday on a week-long
campaign swing determined to outline cradle-to-grave differences
with Vice President Gore on the issues, determined to woo middle-
class voters.
</P>
<P>
-- President Alberto Fujimori's surprise announcement late
Saturday that he would leave office followed signs in recent days
that he was losing the support of Peru's powerful military in the
fallout from two major corruption scandals involving the country's
intelligence service, sources with knowledge of the situation said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A complicated war is being fought in the jungles of Congo,
despite a peace accord signed in August 1999 by all the country's
major combatants. A rebel leader has challenged President Laurent
Kabila to declare whether he will abide by the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- Pennsylvania and several other swing states have recently
shifted toward Gore, but in Ohio, Bush still holds a steady lead.
That is good news for a campaign that has been short of good news
lately. No Republican has ever been elected president without
carrying Ohio.

LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Three men were injured in an
explosion that occurred in the center of Northern Ireland's
seaside town of Bangor on Monday, following a night-time blast in
Belfast which caused damage but no injuries.
</P>
<P>
The three injured men were riding in a van along a main town
street when the explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blast has been under investigation and no one
has claimed responsibility for the explosions.
</P>
<P>
The blast came hours after a bomb shook the offices of the
Ulster Democratic Party (UDP), an organization with links to one
of the province's pro-British loyalist guerrilla groups, on
Shankill Road in west Belfast.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injuries, but the blast at the offices
caused substantial damage, a police spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
High tension lingers between the loyalist militias who are
involved in a feud that has claimed three lives in the past month.

<HEADLINE> China Lands First Olympic Gymnastic Team Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China's male gymnasts pulled
off a historic victory by landing their first ever Olympic team
gold at the Sydney SuperDome here Monday evening as defending
champions Russia stumbled and had to settle for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
China led from beginning to end and earned a total of 231.919,
1.613 points clear of the silver medalists Ukraine. Russia, who
finished atop in the qualifiers, only managed 230.019.
</P>
<P>
"That's a dream comes true," said an excited head coach Huang
Yubin. "We've been searching after this Olympic team gold for
several generations, and not until today does it materialise."
</P>
<P>
"We've won the golds in the World Championships and World Cups,
and we took the Olympic individual titles too. But the team gold
had been remaining elusive until today. We're happy that we
finally made it as we won't want to carry this dream over to the
next millennium."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team took the initiative after the first rotation
and has never looked back. Only a slight slip on the horizontal
bar by Huang Xu and an ankle injury to Xiao Junfeng, which made
him unable to complete in two routines, blemished China's
performance.
</P>
<P>
China's men gymnasts outscored their opponents on all but one
of the six apparatuses during the final, underlining their
phenomenal strength in depth.
</P>
<P>
"I was not nervous at all," Zheng Lihui said. "I have full
confidence in myself and my teammates. I know we are the strongest.
"
</P>
<P>
Consistency and depth were the keys to the Chinese men's
victory. When their Russian arch rivals were faltering in their
opening routine of the horizontal bar, the Chinese men just kept
piling up points. With the exception of Xiao Junfeng's two botched
efforts on the pommel horse and rings, the Chinese had no major
mistakes. They held on their nerves not to repeat any errors which
costed them the top qualifying berth two days ago.
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky that the mistakes happened in the qualifications
but not the final. In fact, after Saturday's mistakes, we're even
more determined to bring home the gold medal," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Though four-time consecutive world champions, China has never
won the Olympic team title. The gymnastic powerhouse claimed the
silvers four years ago in Atlanta, Barcelona in 1992 and in Los
Angeles in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Their Olympic nemeses Russia has won six gold medals in the
Olympic history including the last two where China was pushed into
second place.
</P>
<P>
But the day's individual top scorer was Russia's Alexei Nemov,
who accumulated 58.423 points and put himself in the pole position
to take the all-around title as well as five apparatus titles.
</P>
<P>
Top scorer for China's team was Yang Wei with 58.048, and Li
Xiaopeng's parallel bars routine received a 9.775, a joint-top
scorer with Nemov on the apparatus.
</P>
<P>
"My next aim is to win the parallel and floor golds, and I'm
sure I'll do them," an all-smile Li said.

<HEADLINE> World Class Mines Discovered in Hexi Corridor: Geologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists claim they
have discovered world-class mineral deposits in what used to be
part of the ancient Silk Road, the Hexi Corridor, in Gansu
Province, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Tang Zhongli, an academician from the Chinese Academy
of Engineering, made this announcement today at the ongoing annual
conference of the China Association for Science and Technology (
CAST) in Xi'an, the provincial capital of Shaanxi in northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
Tang said his latest research has shown the actual reserves of
nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum, tungsten and gold in the
corridor could be twice as much as the verified discoveries.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Tang discovered the Jinchuan Nickel Mine in the
corridor, the second biggest nickel mine in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the Hexi Corridor, there is a mine with "an
extraordinary amount of deposits of nickel, copper, cobalt and
plutonium and a mine with a huge amount of iron, copper, lead,
zinc, tungsten and gold".
</P>
<P>
The geologist called for the increased use of the latest
prospecting technology to locate the mineral resources in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Users to Outnumber Those of Conventional Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Wireless voice subscribers will
exceed wired, conventional telephone subscribers by the end of
2002, a leading scientist for the Motorola Company said today.
</P>
<P>
"Even more surprising is the fact that wireless Internet
subscribers will surpass wired (by computer) Internet subscribers
by the same date," said Dennis Roberson, a senior scientist for
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
Roberson made the remarks at the annual meeting of the China
Association for Science and Technology (CAST), China's largest
academic meeting in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered at the meeting, Dennis Roberson said
that while the incredibly rapid growth of the Internet is
generally understood, it is less well known than the wireless
telephone and in particular wireless Internet capability that are
also growing at unprecedented rates.
</P>
<P>
He said his prediction is based on the fact that in the near
future, most cellular phones will have Internet access capability.
</P>
<P>
"To fully realize the potential of wireless Internet access
requires three factors," said Roberson, "a wireless data rate
which roughly matches current wired Internet data rates, an
aggregate wireless capacity which roughly matches current wired
Internet capacity, and a novel user interface which allows for
limitations and advantages of a handled device."
</P>
<P>
Roberson said that Motorola is currently experimenting with a
full range of multimedia data types including video, image, data,
music and voice technologies which will create entirely new forms
of human interaction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June, China had 120 million
wired telephone subscribers and 60 million mobile phone users.

SHENYANG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Wen Jiabao has
urged local governments to spare no efforts in combating the
lingering droughts that have attacked many parts of the country
this year.
</P>
<P>
Wen made the call during his trip to northeastern Liaoning
Province which has been hit by drought, from September 16-18, to
visit local villagers and State-owned grain storage areas.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with local people, he urged local governments
to make sure the local people get food and drinking water and work
out plans for next year's farming season.
</P>
<P>
Learning that the province has suffered heavy losses of grain
and a serious shortage of drinking water due to the severe
droughts, Wen told the local people to try to reduce their losses
to a minimum and figure out ways to increase income.
</P>
<P>
He also presided over a forum on agriculture and rural work in
Shenyang, the provincial capital of Liaoning, which was attended

<HEADLINE> Iranian Navy to Launch Mini Destroyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian navy is about to
launch a mini vessel that will operate both as a rocket-launcher
and as a destroyer, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Vice Admiral Abdollah Maanavi, a naval officer, the
agency said the vessel will be launched on the occasion of the 20th
anniversary of the outbreak of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. The
anniversary is to be observed for one week starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The vessel is aimed to protect the country's water borders in
view of the fact that over 90 percent of its imported goods enter
the country by ship, Maanavi said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more than 70 percent of the body of the ship was
built by Iranian experts, but declining to name other countries
that helped in the building of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The officer referred to the 1988 attack by the United States on
Iran's oil platforms and ships in the Persian Gulf, which, he said,
was the stimulus behind the building of the destroyer (and rocket
launcher).
</P>
<P>
Maanavi, however, noted that economic sanctions imposed by
developed countries still exist and prevent Iran from making
necessary purchases of parts.
</P>
<P>
But Iran has made eye-opening improvements on naval facilities,
he added, pointing to the full-scale development of missile
systems, long-range anti-aircraft launchers and computerized
operations.
</P>
<P>
Last month Iran launched its first domestically-manufactured
mini submarine intended to transport commandos and lay mines in the
waters of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Alsabehat-15 submarine, which can accommodate a two-man crew
and up to three divers, is capable of being used in various
operations close to enemy territory such as making reconnaissance
patrols and dropping commandos, planting mines and guiding
artillery guns, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The bitter eight-year war against Iraq made Iran decide to
implement a drive for self-sufficiency in weapons manufacture, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Uncertainty Remains in Israeli-palestinian Talks: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- It is still not clear
whether Israel could reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians
during the coming several months, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
told his cabinet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There have been neither positive responses nor signals from the
Palestinian side and it is still uncertain whether the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks could be moved forward or the two sides
could strike a deal in a very short period of time, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak did not say what measures he will take to push
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Barak blamed the Palestinian side for the failure of the the
Camp David summit in July, saying Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has been refusing to make compromise on the key issues,
particularly the Jerusalem issue, which hinders the two sides from
striking a deal in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Low-level Israeli and the Palestinian negotiators met again on
Monday in a secret location in Israel to discuss the peace process,
but nothing has been announced.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side suggested over the weekend that the peace
talks be restarted as soon as possible with the participation of
the full Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams as well as
United States officials.
</P>
<P>
Under this proposal, Barak and Arafat would intervene in the
talks as necessary, while U.S. President Bill Clinton would become
involved if the negotiators failed to make progress.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath said on Sunday in Washington that the U.S. was
preparing a document which would summarize the conclusions reached
at the Camp David and could serve as the basis for the renewed
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials said on Sunday that Barak would be
reluctant to send high-level negotiators for more talks if the goal
is less than a comprehensive agreement that would also resolve the
issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war and later annexed by the Jewish regime, to be the
capital of their future independent state. But Israel insists that
Jerusalem is its "eternal and undivided" capital.

<HEADLINE> Iraq May Replace U.S. Dollar in Business Dealings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Resisting the United States
both politically and militarily over the past 10 years, Iraq is now
trying to show its defiance over the U.S. domination in the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
At present, a group of financial experts, appointed by the Iraqi
government, are studying the possibility of replacing the U.S.
dollar with another "politically correct" currency as termed by the
Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Their study will mainly focus on the euro, officially launched
on January 1, 1999 by the European Union (EU) as a counter-balance
to the U.S. dollar in the world financial market as well as in the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government made the decision during a cabinet meeting
last week, claiming that the dollar is manipulated by the Zionism
(Israeli) and American interests.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that the Iraqi leadership has made a rather
dubious choice, given the fact that the euro has fallen steadily
against the dollar since its inception.
</P>
<P>
The euro has been relatively weak in recent months. The latest
exchange rate between the euro and the dollar stood at 1:0.86, some
30 percent depreciation compared with the glorious figure of 1:1.18
when the EU single currency was born.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decision by the Iraqi government to dump the dollar,
the greenback remains the sole foreign currency of choice in Iraq,
as the Iraqi dinar has fluctuated wildly against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary Iraqis appeared not optimistic about the prospect of
replacing the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"This act represents our complete rejection of America. We want
nothing to do with America, but we have no choice but to deal with
the dollar," a money exchange shop owner who did not disclose his
name said.
</P>
<P>
"What can we do?" a man who called himself Mohammad said, "Iraq
can make little choice as its economy is now under the control of
the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, all the revenues for Iraq's oil exports
flow into the U.N. escrow bank in Paris and Iraq can get no direct
money from selling its oil.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Arab Baath Socialist Party came into power in
Iraq in 1968, Iraq's foreign reserves and overseas transactions
have all been in U.S. dollars.

ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Army Monday
claimed to have repulsed an Indian attack on a Pakistani outpost
in the disputed area of Kashmir and killed three Indian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Under the cover of fog, Indian troops launched the"unprovoked"

enemy.
</P>
<P>
Three Indian soldiers were killed and more than 10 wounded and
the enemy troops were seen dragging their dead and wounded while
retreating under the cover of heavy artillery and mortar fire,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, fire exchange has intensified between
Pakistani and Indian troops on the Line of Control which divides

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Nepal-China Relations Held in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A one-day seminar on Nepal-
China relations was held here Monday with the purpose of enhancing
mutual understanding between the two peoples and promoting
constant development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, former Nepali Prime Minister and
senior leader of the ruling Nepali Congress party Sher Deuba said
Nepal-China friendship, which can be dated back hundreds of years,
has seen even faster development since the two countries
established diplomatic relations in 1955.
</P>
<P>
"As close neighbors, we don't have any outstanding issues
between us, nor do we have border disputes," said Deuba.
</P>
<P>
Deuba expressed appreciation for China's enormous economic aid
to Nepal's development and hoped that the cordial relations
between the two countries will continue and economic, social and
cultural cooperation will be further increased in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Xuyong, Chinese ambassador to Nepal, said the past 45
years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and Nepal has witnessed sustained, stable and sound
development of the traditional friendship and friendly cooperation
between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations have stood up to the test of the changing
international situation and become a model of good-neighborly
friendship," said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
"Facts proved that China-Nepal friendship not only conforms
with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but is also
conducive to peace and stability in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador believes that China and Nepal should
further strengthen their close cooperation and mutual support in
international and regional affairs, so as to safeguard their own
independence and sovereignty as well as world peace.
</P>
<P>
About 100 people, including officials and academics from both
Nepal and China and foreign diplomats stationed in Nepal, attended
the seminar organized by China Study Center, a non-governmental
organization committed to promoting China-Nepal friendship.

<P>
N. Pakkialaksmi Siti, wife of Mohamad Noh Sulaiman, and Nancy
Nair, wife of Joe Joseph Jongkinoh, urged the Philippine
government to explore other ways first to secure the release of
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal when delivering letters, daily necessities
and medicine destined for their husbands in Jola, at the Tanjung
Aru Tours and Travel office in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, East Malaysia,
where Siti's husband was employed, according to Bernama news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Their deliveries will be handed over to Filipino businessman
Lee Peng Wee, a presidential adviser on the Mindanao economy, who
had played a role in helping secure the release of nine Malaysians
who were abducted together with 12 foreigners from a resort on
Sipadan island, also off Sabah by an armed group on April 23 and
taken by boat to Jolo, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
"Secure the safe release of the hostages first," Bernama quoted
Siti as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Noh Sulaiman and Joe Joseph Jongkinoh together with Kan

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Long-Term Returns Seen From Indian New Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- With the rapid development
of information technology (IT), investors in India's new economy
stocks have reaped a big harvest in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said returns on the new economy stocks were phenomenal,
ranging from 400 percent to 2,000 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
A person who purchased 100 shares of Infosys, the country's
software giant, on August 31, 1995, at 477 rupees with a face
value of 10 rupees would be holding 800 shares with a face value
of 5 rupees but a market rate of 8,373.15 rupees on August 31,
2000.
</P>
<P>
This means that an investment of 47,700 rupees fetched 6,698,
520 rupees for an investor. Thus an investor made a total
appreciation of 11,943 percent in five years with average annual
appreciation being 2,788.6 percent. Other IT stocks also did well
with Satyam Computers, Wipro and SSI following close behind.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for such appreciation are obvious. Infosys's gross
revenues increased from 930 million rupees in the year ended March
1996 to 9.2146 billion rupees in the year ended March 2000, a
growth of nearly 10 times in just five years.
</P>
<P>
Its net profits increased faster from 210.1 million rupees in
March 1996 to 2.8595 billion rupees in March 2000. The company
also issued two bonuses and a stock split in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In the five years, Infosys' stocks always did well but the
major leap came after it got listed at Nasdaq, the exchange for
technology companies in the United States in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other major IT companies also did well with Satyam Computers'
revenue rising from 537.6 million rupees in the year ended March
1996 to 6.7901 billion rupees in the year ended March 2000.
Profits growth kept pace, moving from 135.7 million rupees to 1.
3486 billion rupees in the five years.
</P>
<P>
However, not all IT companies did well. The stock price of
Onward Technologies moved nowhere in the past five years because
the company did badly. Only in the past year, it started to get
its act together.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that investors in tech stocks at current levels
should not expect the spectacular returns made in the past years
to continue and that returns are going to be just reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Also, they said, people who bought tech stocks in February 2000
are still licking their wounds because the markets have crashed
considerably. Companies, which have failed to meet the
expectations have been battered mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
However, they predicted that stocks of the tech sector should
continue to do well with a growth rate of over 500 percent for the
next few years and investors can hope for decent returns.

<HEADLINE> 158,000 Disabled Pupils Enrolled in Ugandan Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- About 158,000 disabled pupils
in Uganda have been enrolled under the Universal Primary Education
(UPE) program, a senior official told Xinhua in a telephone
interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the UPE program, everyone will have access to free
education including the disabled children, said Uganda Minister
for Primary Education Mrs.Geradine Bitamazire.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Education and Sports is working out a policy
to see that affirmative action on people with disability is put in
place," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot companies from some groups of people who want a
national special school syllabus formulated for people with
disability and we shall meet in dialogue to cover that issue," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Universal Primary Education is the provision of Basic Education
to all Ugandan children of school-going age. The main goal is to
enable Ugandan children of school-going age (6-12) to receive
quality education and remain in school and complete the Primary
Cycle of Education.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Scarcity Bites Nigeria Harder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The worsening fuel scarcity is
spreading from Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos to all the major
cities of the country at the weekend while oil prices in the black
market keep increasing, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The "no fuel" sign was displayed at most filling stations and
rowdy scenes were spotted in a few stations still selling fuel
with endless queues of vehicles waiting for petrol.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, black market transactions with touts hawking the
scarce petrol in cans at exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, the price of petrol in black market is hitting 450-
500 naira (about four to five U.S. dollar) for four liters while
the official price is 22 naira per liter.
</P>
<P>
In the neighboring states of Ogun, Ondo and Oyo, prices had
shot up to the same levels while in Benin, capital of Edo State,
four liters of petrol reached the roof of 700-800 naira.
</P>
<P>
The rowdy scenes at filling stations across the country have
brought back memories of the late Sani Abacha's era when Nigerians
suffered fuel scarcity almost perpetually.
</P>
<P>
With the strike from last week by the two industrial unions in
the fuel supply sector continuing to date, Nigerians have come
again under the excruciating pain of fuel scarcity and the
consequent agony of a people with so many vehicles but no petrol
to power them.
</P>
<P>
The situation would be even worse as the protesting oil workers,
Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria and
the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, vowed
Sunday night that they would continue with the strike action until
their demands are met.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Produce More Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 18 (Xinhua) Nigeria has been allocated an
extra 65,600 barrels of crude oil per day by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), local media reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increment of the oil production quota, effective from
October 1, was decided at OPEC's recent 111th Extra-Ordinary
Summit in Vienna, Austria. Nigeria takes a share of 65,600 bpd of
the agreed 800,000 increased production quota among the
organization's 11 member states.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest oil-producing country in Africa with a
daily output of over two million barrels, lists the sixth among
the world's leading oil-exporting nations.
</P>
<P>
A senior Nigerian official from the office of the Special
Adviser on Petroleum and Energy Matters, who attended the Vienna
Summit, was quoted as saying that the increment of oil production
quota was aimed to stabilize the rising price in the international
oil market.
</P>
<P>
There was a growing fear inside the OPEC that the world economy
might face a depression if the rising oil price is unchecked and
there would be an increase in the prices of other commodities at
the world market, hence causing damages both to oil consumers and
producers.
</P>
<P>
The oil price hit 36 U.S. dollars per barrel in the world
market just as the OPEC ended the summit when they failed to reach
agreement to bring down the price to about 30 dollars per barrel
after heated discussions.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique: Agricultural and Livestock Census Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maputo, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The national agricultural and
livestock census, to be carried out by the Mozambican Agriculture
Ministry and the National Statistics Institute, was officially
launched in Maputo on Monday and is expected to be completed by
the end of November.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Monday's issue of the daily paper "
Noticias", preparations for the work, particularly staff training,
have been completed only in the southern region of the country.
Training is due to start in the central and northern regions in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the central province of Manica, training is scheduled to
start before the end of September, whereas in the other central
and northern provinces it is planned for the first half of October.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director of the census, Domingos Diogo, said that
the 450 census staff will all have been trained by the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
The trainees will be organized into 77 brigades which will be
dispatched to the various provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enquiries will cover peasant family units, and medium and
large scale agricultural and livestock undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Diogo said that special attention is given to the training of
district agricultural directors since they are believed to be the
key to the mobilization of people and companies for this work, and
also because they must ensure the logistics for the brigades in
their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
This is the first agricultural census in the country since
independence in 1975, and is aimed at knowing the number of
agricultural and livestock units countrywide, their distribution
and productivity, and the main agricultural and farming activities
in each area, in order to facilitate the drafting of policies for
this sector.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Stresses Better Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said
here Monday that the Hong Kong government is placing as much
emphasis on the state of the environment as on the state of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The government fully understands that it is no good having a
hugely successful economy without commensurate quality of life
which includes clear air, fresh water, and a green and healthy
living environment, noted Tung when he delivered a speech at the
Better Air Quality Motor Vehicle Control &AMP; Technology Workshop
Opening Ceremony Monday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that controlling vehicle emissions is an
important component of the government's comprehensive program to
improve the air quality in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To curtail the two major pollutants in vehicle exhausts, the
government sets a target to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions by 30
percent by the end of 2005 and to cut particulate emissions by 80
percent by that time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to say that, over the past twelve months, we have
made considerable progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
As one of the first steps, the government has begun a program
to replace our 18,000 diesel taxis with those that run on cleaner
liquefied petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
From next week, the government will begin a program to retrofit
particulate traps on the 42,000 pre-Euro light diesel vehicles in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung said Hong Kong became the first city in Asia to introduce
ultra-low sulphur diesel, and a concessionary duty was levied on
the fuel to make it price-competitive with the normal diesel on
the market at that time.
</P>
<P>
In order to better co-ordinate inter-departmental efforts to
improve air quality, a task force chaired by the Secretary for the
Environment and Food was established in May.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to overseeing the implementation of measures
announced in last year's Policy Address, which were many, the Task
Force will investigate further practicable measures that can be
taken to tackle air pollution problems even more comprehensively,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 scientists,
engineers and officials on environmental protection from the
United States, Australia, Singapore and China's mainland gathered
here Monday to discuss the future policies and technologies on air
quality control.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region Tung Chee Hwa officiated at the opening ceremony of the
three-day workshop, entitled "Better Air Quality: Motor Vehicle
Control and Technology Workshop".
</P>
<P>
"It is no good having a hugely successful economy if we do not
have a commensurate quality of life which includes clear air,
fresh water, and a green and healthy living environment," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
Controlling vehicle emissions is an important component of the
government's comprehensive program to improve the air quality in
Hong Kong, he said, adding that from next week, a program will be
initiated to retrofit particulate traps on the 42,000 pre-Euro
light diesel vehicles in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A similar retrofitting program for pre-Euro heavy diesel
vehicles will also be launched after trials to identify catalytic
converters best suited to Hong Kong driving conditions, he added.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Hong Kong became the first city in Asia to
introduce ultra-low sulfur diesel, according to Tung. A
concessionary duty was levied on the fuel to make it price-
competitive with the normal diesel on the market at that time.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the Hong Kong Environmental Protection
Department and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the workshop
will provide a forum for local, regional and overseas experts to
share their experience and discuss new technologies of reducing
motor vehicle emission.
</P>
<P>
The main topics of the workshop include emissions control and
regulations, in-use vehicle testing technology, experience in
emissions control in China, diesel emissions exhaust after
treatment technology, new property diesel fuels, transport policy
and planning, and low emissions vehicles.

......a coherent picture," he said.
</P>
<P>
The accepted definition of biomedical engineering that it is
the application of engineering principles and methodologies to the
solution of biological and medical problems is much too narrow
today, Jaron said.
</P>
<P>
He gave the current definition as "Bioengineering integrates
physical, chemical, or mathematical sciences and engineering
principles for the study of biology, medicine, behavior, or health.
It advances fundamental concepts, create knowledge from the
molecular to the organ systems level."
</P>
<P>
Jaron is a member of a delegation comprising 20 leading
biomedical engineering express from the United States, the United
Kingdom and France, who kicked off their academic visit to China
Monday with a workshop held Monday in the Chinese University of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this delegation is to promote and improve
communication of biomedical engineering activities in universities,
professional organizations, and health care industries between
China and the countries represented in the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The 13-day visit, which will take the delegation later to
several Chinese mainland cities including Beijing, Xi'an and
Shanghai, is arranged by the People to People Ambassador Programs,
founded in 1956 by then U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower to
promote friendly relations among all the countries through the
medium of scientific, professional and technical exchange.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Integration of Disciplines Critical for Medical Development (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Dov Jaron, president of the
International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering,
emphasized on the importance of the integration of medicine,
biology, physics, mathematics and biomedical engineering during an
interview to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the health care will see dramatic progress in the
new century because of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
"New drugs will be developed through rational design procedures
rather than by trial and error as it is done today. They will be
tailored to individual needs," he said
</P>
<P>
"Diagnosis will depend on deep and full understanding as to how
genes, molecules, cells, organs and the whole organism function as
a holistic system. And finally, preventive methods and therapeutic
procedures will target the molecular origin of the disease."
</P>
<P>
Jaron said, to achieve these dramatic changes, people need to
expand the base of biomedical research and develop true
interdisciplinary team approaches to problem solving.
</P>
<P>
"But even more important, in my opinion -- medical and
biological scientists will need to establish ever close
collaboration with physical scientists, mathematicians and
biomedical engineers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Biomedical scientists are best at reductionism, which strives
to break up the living system to its most elementary constituents
and understand the structure and function of the smallest elements
of the organism, of the fundamental components of cells and
molecules, according to Jaron.
</P>
<P>
But it often ignores the effects of interconnections between
the individual elements, because the overall properties are often
different than the sum of their parts.
</P>
<P>
This disadvantage can be made up for by engineers, who excel at
integration.
</P>
<P>
"Engineers possess the analytical and quantitative tools that
make it possible to synthesize and understand how the different
system components interact and how the emergent properties of
complex systems are formed. Engineers are also adept at
consolidating large amount of data into a coherent picture," he
said.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Growth to Rise to 4.7 Percent: ADB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The global gross domestic
product (GDP) growth is forecast to rise to 4.7 percent in 2000,
based on the stronger economic performance in the first half,
according to a latest report of the Asian Development Bank
released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2000 Update revises upwards
the global growth forecast from the 3.5 percent projected by the
Asian Development Outlook 2000 published in April.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the world economy in the first half of this
year suggests a further strengthening of the global recovery that
started in 1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
The principal factor underlying the much stronger global
economic performance so far in 2000 has been the continuing growth
momentum of the U.S. economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
While there are some signs of weakening consumer demand, GDP
growth in the second came in higher than in the first, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, events in the first six months have reconfirmed ADO's
expectations that growth will be more evenly shared across the
United States, Europe and Japan and that the Asian economic
recovery will be sustained, it said.
</P>
<P>
There are clear signs of a strengthening of the cyclical upturn
in Europe, and even in Japan the recovery may be taking hold with
growth in 2000 expected to be about 1.5 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Within Asia, all the crisis-affected countries are expected to
achieve strong growth in 2000, while growth in China is now
expected to be higher than earlier forecast, it added.
</P>
<P>
Even as growth has strengthened, it said, inflation rates in
the advanced economies have remained subdued, edging up only
modestly in response to higher energy prices.
</P>
<P>
To keep inflation from accelerating, the U.S. Federal Reserve
raised short-term official interest rates six times over the last
12 months, and the European Central Bank also raised interest
rates twice in the first half of this year. As a result European
interest rates have also seen a net increase of one percentage
point over the average rate in 1998, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the improved outlook for the Japanese economy and
the steady shifting of growth momentum to more dynamic New Economy
segments prompted the Japanese central bank to reverse its
exceptional zero interest rate policy in August and raise rates by
25 basis points.
</P>
<P>
Globally, inflationary pressures are expected to increase
somewhat in 2000 due to recovery-induced demand efforts and the
strengthening of oil prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, the robust performance of the
global economy disguises some concerns, such as the possibilities
of a hard landing of the U.S. economy, the Japanese and European
monetary authorities' tightening of their monetary stance, and a
further rise in oil prices in the second half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urged to Disarm East Timorese Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
Defense Secretary William Cohen here Monday urged the Indonesian
government to be serious in dealing with East Timorese militia,
saying the failure to do so would jeopardize its relations with
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also reiterated the U.S. government commitments to
support Indonesia in building democracy.
</P>
<P>
"I have just finished meetings with President Wahid, Vice
President Megawati, Coordinating Minister for Political, Social
and Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Defense Minister
Mahfud, and Admiral Widodo, Commander of the National Security
forces (TNI)," Cohen told a press conference at the Halim
Perdanakusumah military airport, before leaving for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"In every meeting I made the same points: The United States
strongly supports Indonesia's historic transition to democracy,
but the transition must include a clear commitment to the rule of
law and an end to the violence in East and West Timor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen also reiterated the U.S. government's
condemnation against the armed attack in Atambua, suspected to has
been launched by East Timorese militia group on September 6, which
killed international workers.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and the entire international community have
condemned this brutal attack by militia killers and have called on
the Indonesian authorities to take immediate action to deal with
the Timor crisis," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"Fail to do so will have consequences for Jakarta's relations
with the international community and could jeopardize continued
economic assistance to Indonesia," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "the (U.N.) Security Council still intends to
send a mission to Jakarta and Atambua to discuss Indonesia's
implementation of the (U.N.) resolution."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has passed a resolution 1319, which insists
that Indonesia disarm and disband all militia elements, ensure the
safety and welfare of all refugees and humanitarian aid workers,
and arrest and prosecute those responsible for the Atambua's
incident.
</P>
<P>
"President Wahid and the leadership of the TNI have given their
assurances that Indonesia is prepared to move quickly and
decisively to deal with the West Timor crisis," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also implicitly warned Indonesia over possible
international sanction if the country failed in response the U.S.
government's calls.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here Sunday evening for a two-day visit,
said that the U.S. government also welcomed the Indonesian
government's move in dealing with human right abuser in East Timor
as well as other areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the United States keeps supporting the
ongoing reforms program in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and every country in the region wants these
reforms to succeed, so that Indonesia will be a country where the
people can live up to their potential, rather than be dragged down
by their problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But some forces in Indonesia seek to undermine these reforms
through violence and terror, such as the cowards who bombed the
Jakarta Stock Exchange last week. These destructive forces must
not succeed," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the TNI's future, Cohen said the United
States wants to see it to be more professional, saying that "
Indonesia needs a strong, professional military under civilian
control, and the United States is eager to help the TNI become a
professional force that respects human rights and is respected for
its military might."
</P>
<P>
During his Asia's tour, Cohen, who earlier visited the
Philippines, will go from Indonesia to Thailand, South Korea and
Japan. He is due to return to Washington on September 22.

<HEADLINE> Three Security Personnel Shot Dead in Indonesia's Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Amid strong attempts to put
an end to the bloodshed in the riot-torn province of Indonesia's
Aceh, at least three security personnel were shot dead there on
Monday, Antara news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The three persons were shot by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), an
underground armed Acehnese movement, who have been fighting for
the province's independence for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Local security officer, Senior Superintendent Kusbini Imbar,
confirmed that the three security personnel were killed after
being involved in an exchange of fire in Pidie regency.
</P>
<P>
Aceh saw a series of terror actions in recent two weeks
following the extension of a cease fire agreement early September
between the GAM and the central government.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has repeatedly called on
the Acehnese rebels to surrender and talk with the government. But
there is no signs that the calls will be met.
</P>
<P>
The central government issued a policy to implement the special
autonomy status bill to the province in a bid to calm down and
ease the independence's calls from the local people.
</P>
<P>
Under the status, the local authority will have a greater role
in determining policy of development. The province was also let to
implement the Islamic law.

<HEADLINE> One Kenyan Runner Left out in 400m Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Although Kenya's 400m runner
Simon Kemboi arrived in Australia for the Olympic Games in August,
but on Monday he still did not know whether he would be accepted
in the starters' list because his name was left out.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Amateur Athletic Association (KAAA) submitted three names
for the event, but only two entered in the starting list.
</P>
<P>
KAAA coaches are worried that Kemboi maybe would lose the
chance to compete, but the team's chef de mission, Jackson Tuwei,
said that they would persuade the Games organizers to include
Kemboi in the starting line scheduled for September 22 heats.
</P>
<P>
Tuwei said Games officials in Sydney were not convinced that
Kemboi had attained the qualifying time to run in Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said the KAAA had inadvertently sent to organizers the wrong
times, but on realizing this, the organization corrected the error
by sending updated information.
</P>
<P>
But one coach said that issue was far more complicated than the
Kenya management committee cares to admit.
</P>
<P>
The coach said that Kemboi's qualifying time was attained
during the Kenya's trials but the International Olympic Committee
officials did not recommend the timing devices used and could,
therefore, not ratify Kemboi's qualifying time.
</P>
<P>
But Tuwei said they had taken up the matter with International
Amateur Athletic Federation which endorsed Kemboi's result and it
is only a matter of time before Games officials in Sydney are
updated with the new development.

<HEADLINE> Day-3 Roundup: Drugs Dispute Cast Shadow over Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- It could have been a clear day
at the Sydney Olympic Games Monday, but drugs dispute between the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International
Weightlifting Federation (IWF) cast some shadow over the day's
competitions, which witnessed three world records in weightlifting
and one in pool.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the two sports organizations was from one
same issue: whether Romanian weightlifting team, which gave three
positive results in dope test within the season, could be allowed
to stay at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
According the "Three Strikes and Out" rule of the IWF, if three
or more members from an association are found guilty of drugs
offence, all lifters from the association should be suspended from
international competitions for a year. And the IWF also has a "
Money for Eligibility" rule which says that if the national
Olympic committee is willing to pay a 50,000 U.S. dollars fine, "
clean" lifters from the association could be allowed to compete
internationally.
</P>
<P>
The IOC made it clear this morning that the Romanian lifting
team wouldn't be allowed to pay a fine to get its "clean" lifters
reinstated to the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very clear. The whole team will have to leave the
village," IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
However, after IWF gave a green light to the four "clean"
Romanian lifters -- three men and one women--to stay at the Games
after the Romanian Olympic Committee paid a fine, the IOC's stand-
in boss, vice-president Dick Pound, said later that the
organization would not be intervening in the case, adding that the
eligibility of competitors was the responsibility of the relevant
international sports federation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, track officials upheld the two-year suspension of
former Olympic 5,000-meter champion Dieter Baumann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Baumann, who tested positive for nandrolone last October and
November, had appealed, arguing that someone had tampered with his
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
A total of nine Olympians have been suspended for drug use
found in pre-games, including six banned from the athletes'
village.
</P>
<P>
The village was off-limits for a weightlifter from Chinese
Taipei, , an Iranian boxer, a swimmer from Kazakhstan, a
weightlifter from Norway and two weightlifters from Romania.
</P>
<P>
The other three, two Egyptian wrestlers and a wrestler from
Morocco, were suspended before they arrived at the village.
</P>
<P>
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch's wife Maria Teresa
Samaranch was memorized in a special Mass on Monday. Teresa passed
away Saturday in Barcelona, Spain after a brave fighting with
cancer at the age of 67.
</P>
<P>
On the first day when commuters joined the extra Olympic
traffic, a jam caused by an accident delayed the Japanese softball
team for nearly an hour and pushed back the start of their games
against China by 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Sydney organizing committee officials said
admitted that several athletes have been briefly halted at the
entry to the athletes village because a computer check showed that
somebody had already entered on their pass.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if the cause might be
counterfeiting or confusion in the system of checks.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the hiccups, competitions rolled smoothly with
Chinese athletes taking the center stage.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, after two-day low-key performances,
began to make achievement with three gold medals from
weightlifting, shooting and gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
Chinese men's athletes made breakthrough in Olympics with the
men's gymnastics team winning the team title and an unknown
sharpshooter Cai Yalin taking the 10-m air rifle gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese gymnastics team, made of Li Xiaopeng, Huang Xu,
Yang Wei, Xiao Junfeng, Xing Aowei and Zheng Lihui, defeated arch-
rivals Russians and Ukrainians to win the Olympic team title for
the first time. The Chinese team had 231.919 points for the gold,
Ukraine finished second at 230.306 and Russia third at 230.019.
</P>
<P>
In shooting, Cai Yalin came from nowhere to take the limelight
of the Olympics, taking the men's 10m air rifle gold medal with
696.4 points, a new Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team manager Feng Jianzhong applauded the gold as a
breakthrough for the Chinese men's shooting team, which finished
only fourth at its best in world major competitions.
</P>
<P>
While on lifting platform, Chinese women's lifter Yang Xia
showed China's depth of women's weightlifting, breaking three
world records en route to winning the women's 53kg category
weightlifting title.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 23, who has never won a gold in big world competitions
except the 1998 Asian Games, broke snatch, jerk and total world
marks with 100kg, 125kg and 225kg repectively, before winning the
crown.
</P>
<P>
Mexican lifter Soraya Jimenez Mendivil took another women's
weightlifting title in the 58kg category.
</P>
<P>
In pool, unbeatable Ian Thorpe was beaten by Dutch wonder boy
Pieter van den Hoogenband in the men's 200m freestyle while the
United States landed two titles, which increased their gold tally
to five.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband touched home first in one minute 43.35
seconds, tying his own world record set Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Denied a third gold medal, Thorpe took silver 24 hours after
Van den Hoogenband broke Thorpe's world record in the semis.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe finished in 1:45.83 and Massimiliano Rosolino of Italy
was third in 1:46.65.
</P>
<P>
Lenny Krayzelburg gave the United States its fourth gold in
three days of swimming, winning the 100m backstroke in an Olympic
record 53.72 seconds and Megan Jones won the United States second
gold of the day from the pool, clocking 1:07.05 seconds in the
women's 100m breaststroke final.
</P>
<P>
Diana Mocanu became the first Romanian swimmer to win a gold
medal, taking the 100m backstroke in an Olympic record 1:00.21.
</P>
<P>
After three-day competitions, United States kept their leading
place in medal tally with six golds. France and China each had
four golds while Australia, Italy and Netherlands had three
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's competitions will decide 15 golds from eight sports
including swimming, judo, cycling, gymnastics and weightlifting.

BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries stayed
quiet within extremely thin trade today, partly due to the
tightened money supply caused by a listing announcement of the
Tree Gorges Construction Material plus the stock plus the stock
subscriptions late last week, which still "locked" in some capital,
though domestic stocks were weak at present.
</P>
<P>
Transaction value on T-bonds contracted by 476 million yuan to
1.31 billion yuan, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009905, listed in 1999, edged down 0.01 percent to end at
100.24 yuan, with the yield unchanged at 3.28 percent. All the
other bonds closed the session flat at the last close prices.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate of the three-day repurchasing agreement
recovered from 1.28 percent to 3.35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Greek FMs Add Momentum to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and Greek foreign
ministers agreed to work together to discuss and implement a series
of confidence-building measures between the two countries, Turkish
Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou on Sunday on the
sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
Following their talks, Cem said that Turkey was ready to discuss
Aegean disputes with Greece under the guidelines of international
law, adding that confidence-building measures would cover the
Aegean issues.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insists that the boundaries of either countries'
territorial waters and air space in the Aegean Sea be solved by
bilateral dialogue while Greece maintains that the only dispute in
the Aegean is that of continental shelf rights and wants the
International Court of Justice in the Hague to arbitrate.
</P>
<P>
The two North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members almost
went to war in 1996 over claims to rocky islets in the Aegean
called Imia in Greek and Kardak in Turkish. Tension was defused
only after mediation by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue also remains as a major sticking point in
promoting relations between Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 when Turkey
occupied its northern third in response to an Athens-engineered
coup.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two Aegean rivals have improved
significantly since last year, following a diplomatic rapprochement
and a burst of cooperation in the wake of devastating earthquakes
in both countries.
</P>
<P>
In a further sign of warming relations, Cem and Papandreou
decided to submit a joint bid to host the 2008 European Soccer
Championship, and agreed to organize a youth exchange program
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They have also decided to meet in October respectively in
Turkish northwestern city Marmaris and Greek Rhodes to discuss
bilateral relations, particularly issues relating to tourism.
</P>
<P>
Analysts viewed these moves as new steps taken by the two
countries to further the rapprochement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have proposed measures to improve relations,
including reducing the number of military exercises of the two
countries, opening direct lines of communication between their
chiefs of general staff, and the coast guard and military aircraft
flying unarmed over sensitive areas.

<HEADLINE> Four Civilians Killed in Crossfire in S. Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Four civilians were killed
when they were caught in the crossfire in the fighting between
Philippine government forces and Abu Sayyaf terrorists in Sulu
province, the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This brought to 10 people killed, including six Abu Sayyaf
members, during the three-day military operations. Four soldiers
were earlier wounded in the initial phase of the fighting last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mlgabal Capistrano, OCD chief, said 913 families evacuated from
their homes to avoid being cornered in the fighting now on its
third day in the southern Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Government forces backed by planes, helicopters and tanks
continued their ground and air assault on Abu Sayyaf lairs in the
jungles of Patikul, Talipao and Maimbung to rescue 19 hostages,
four of them foreigners, including American Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
Capistrano said all the four victims, including an 11-year old
girl, were caught in the crossfire. But he didn't mention when
these people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has released an initial amount of 900,
000 pesos (20,000 U.S. dollars) for the purchase of foods for the
evacuees who are now housed in 10 evacuation centers in Sulu
province.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the 19 hostages are still alive but
were brought along by their captors during their retreat.
</P>
<P>
Before the attack, the Abu Sayyaf had threatened to kill the
hostages if the military would rescue the captives.
</P>
<P>
The government has imposed a news blackout to prevent the
telegraphing of military moves, but some officials estimated that
the military will wind up its operation in a week's time.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Dutch wonder boy Pieter van
den Hoogenband upset Australian mega-star Ian Thorpe to win a
thrilling Olympic men's 200m freestyle Monday night, while the
United States landed two titles to raise their swimming gold tally
to five.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband touched home first in one minute 43.35
seconds, tying his own world record set Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Denied a third gold medal, Thorpe took silver 24 hours after
Van den Hoogenband broke Thorpe's world record in the semis.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe finished in 1:45.83 and Massimiliano Rosolino of Italy
was third in 1:46.65.
</P>
<P>
Lenny Krayzelburg gave the United States its fourth gold in
three days of swimming, winning the 100m backstroke in an Olympic
record 53.72 seconds.
</P>
<P>
He broke the old mark of 53.86 set by American Jeff Rouse at
the 1992 Games, but was 0.12 seconds away from his own world
record set in the same pool last year.
</P>
<P>
Australian Matthew Welsh took silver in 54.07, while Stev
Theloke of Germany won bronze in 54.82.

final.
</P>
<P>
Australian Leisel Jones came second in 1:07.49, while world
record holder Penny Heyns of South Africa, who had led over 80
meters, faded to finish third in 1:07.55.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband fought with Thorpe stroke by stroke until
the 150m mark when the Dutchman began pulling away.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband jumped to fame last year by beating Olympic
champion Alexander Popov of Russia in the 50 and 100 freestyle at
the European Championships.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it. I have so much respect for Ian," the
Dutchman said.
</P>
<P>
"I gave it my all in the race," Thorpe said. "That was a great
race on behalf of Pieter. It's a real privilege to be able to swim
that race.
</P>
<P>
"I was a bit run down. I had a sore throat and a bit of a
headache."

<HEADLINE> IWF Allows Romanian Weightlifters to Compete in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYNDEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The International
Weightlifting Federation (IWF) said in a statement here on Monday
that the Romanian weightlifters can compete in the Olympic Games
since the Romanian side has agreed to pay a fine of 50, 000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"A discussion took place between the IWF and the Romanian NOC
on 18th September 2000, when Romania stated that they would pay
the fine and were asking the IWF to consent to the participation
of the other four weightlifters at these Games," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with its rules, the IWF Executive Board accepts
the request of the Romanian NOC," it said. "While of course
maintaining the suspensions imposed on the two lifters who tested
positive - it gives its consent to the participation of the
remaining four weightlifers in the Games."
</P>
<P>
But the IWF warned if the fine can not be paid to the IWF Anti-
Doping Fund by 17:00, on September 20th, 2000, the Romanian
Weightlifting Federation will be suspended immediately. The
athletes who have already lifted in the Games will be disqualified.

BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Composite Index
closed at 1946.61 points Monday, down 31.68 points or 1.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 6.26 billion yuan, 3.13 percent more than
last Friday's 6.07 billion yuan, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no further news about the second board and
the listing of state-owned shares during the weekend, investors,
especially institutional investors, wanted to participate in the
second board market, and they would take some fund from the
current market.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 points to open at 1979.53
points Monday morning, but the selling pressure led down the
market and the index almost ended at the lowest level of 1946.18

The A-share market is likely to fall Tuesday and would try the

of China's archaeology news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
-- Protection of Cultural Relics Urged in Holiday
</P>
<P>
Steps should be taken to protect Chinese cultural relics as
tourists begin to rush to different relic sites during the
upcoming holiday, according to a circular issued by the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) recently.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged all departments to keep a vigilant eye on
protecting cultural relics as well as entertaining the tourists
during the coming National Day holiday at the beginning of October.
</P>
<P>
Holiday tourism will boom during the period due to the
improvement of Chinese people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
-- Ancient Tomb Opens to Public
</P>
<P>
A 2,000-year-old Han Dynasty tomb in western Beijing being
excavated by Chinese archaeologists was opened to the public on
September 15.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 200 people visited the excavation site, which
costs 30 yuan per entry. An additional 8 people went into the core
working area for a cost of 80 yuan per entry.
</P>
<P>
"Opening the excavation site to the public will help promote
archaeological knowledge among the citizens and enhance their
awareness of relics protection," said Yang Boxian, a cultural
official from the Shijingshan District, where the tomb is located.
</P>
<P>
-- Skeleton Found in Beijing Ancient Tomb Was Female
</P>
<P>
The skeleton discovered in a 2,000-year-old tomb in the western
part of Beijing was of a woman who was approximately 160
centimeters tall and 30 years of age.
</P>
<P>
This was just revealed by archaeologists who have been
excavating the ancient tomb for about eight months now. The
skeleton was discovered in the front chamber, or the sitting room
of the occupant of the tomb, in July.
</P>
<P>
-- Thousand-Year Old Chestnut Trees Found in North China
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of ancient chestnut trees about 1,000 years old have
been found in the Taihang Mountains in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The ancient chestnut forest is located in a mountainous tourism
zone at an elevation of 1,300 meters, according to local experts.

-- "True Tomb" of Ancient Mongolia Founder Discovered
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region recently discovered what they believe is the
tomb of Genghis Khan, who founded ancient Mongolia and whose
grandson Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
The tomb is located in Qinghe County in northern Xinjiang. For
years archeologists have theorized the body of Genghis Khan was
buried at a place in Mount Altay. The tomb is flanked by two lakes,
which are connected with a man-made canal.
</P>
<P>
-- Ancient Wine Workshops Found in Anhui
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have discovered about 20 ancient wine, cloth-
making, tea, edible oil and bean curd workshops in east China's
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The workshops are located in the village of Gaoluting, Shitai
County.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the 20th century, wine made in the village
was popular in Shanghai, Yangzhou and other major cities in China
and were even exported to southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Thousand-Year-Old Fresco Shelled off for Better Protection
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have succeeded in peeling off frescos
dating back over 1,000 years and originating from the Tang Dynasty
(618-907).
</P>
<P>
The frescos were discovered in a tomb located in the downtown
area of Anyang City, central China's Henan Province, earlier this
year. The complete and clear paintings cover more than 20 square
meters. They visualized the life of the occupant before his death.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists highly value a portrait of a noble woman who had
a willow leaf-shaped ornament on the face.
</P>
<P>
-- Precious Porcelain Sold for Over One Million Dollars
</P>
<P>
Shanghai auctioned over 100 pieces of Kuan Yao Porcelain on
September 16 at prices over 11 million yuan (approximately 1.3
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
There were 123 pieces for the auction, with almost 100 of the
pieces being provided by Aisingiorro Qimeng, a descendant of
Emperor Daoguang of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) born in 1968.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time such a large number of Kuan Yao Porcelain
pieces were on auction in China, as the porcelain was rarely
handed down from ancient times.

<HEADLINE> ADB Revises Upwards Asia's Economic Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank has
revised upwards its forecast for developing Asia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth this year to 6.9 percent from a previously
projected 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The upward revision of the regional growth forecast for 2000 is
based on stronger domestic demand and sustained growth in external
demand, the bank said in its latest regional economic report
released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The regional economic growth in 2001 is forecast to moderate to
6.5 percent, according to the report, The Asian Development
Outlook 2000 Update, which is a mid-year update of the annual
Asian Development Outlook, published in April.
</P>
<P>
The report says that domestic investment demand, while still
below pre-crisis levels in most of developing Asia, is likely to
strengthen, as excess capacity is utilized and competitive
pressures force production capacity to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Improved private consumption demand is expected to offset
slackening public sector demand as governments restore fiscal
balances within the region, it says.
</P>
<P>
External demand is likely to remain buoyant on account of
stronger growth in interregional trade, a consolidation of
recovery in Europe and Japan, and continued, though slower, demand
growth in the United States, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report notes, however, that growth is uneven among
economies in the region and warns that volatility in the region's
financial markets underscores concerns that need to be addressed
if growth is to be sustained over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
These concerns include inadequate progress on structural
reforms, perceived inability of some governments to address
macroeconomic imbalances, political uncertainty, and rising world
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
China's Hong Kong, The Republic of Korea and Singapore are
expected to lead in the region with GDP growth in 2000 of 8.5
percent, 8.3 percent and 8 percent respectively, says the report.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that the GDP growth for the whole year of 2000 for
the People's Republic of China is 7.5 percent, based on first half
growth of 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia's growth in 2000 is forecast to rise to 4.7
percent from the original projection of 4.6 percent, while the
newly industrialized economies are expected to achieve growth of 7.
9 percent instead of 6.5 percent projected earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report lifts South Asia's GDP growth forecast to 6.5
percent in 2000 by 0.1 percentage point while the Central Asian
Republics' GDP is expected to grow 4.1 percent in the year as
against the 3 percent forecast earlier.

<HEADLINE> Assault on Rebels Weighs Down Manila Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in the Philippine
Stock Exchange ended lower Monday amid the ongoing military
assault against the bandit group, Abu Sayyaf, in the southern
island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, shed 10.72
points to close at 1,440.27. The broader all-shares index also
lost 1.71 points to 682.80.
</P>
<P>
Dealers exchanged 1.2 billion shares worth some 329.9 million U.
S. dollars on Monday against last Friday's 3.9 billion shares
worth some 13 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the military attacks against the Abu Sayyaf group
which started Saturday dampened further the already dropping
market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"It came out as a surprise to many. There is news block-out
which keep the people nervous. People want to know what has been
going on with the attack, the safety of the hostages and the
civilians, and further developments of the state in Mindanao,"
said Albert Chua, analyst at All Asia Asset Management.

<P>
The 486-kilometer railway runs from South Korean capital city
of Seoul to the Shinuiju, a far north city of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>

TOKYO -- Japan's three major insurers, Tokio Marine and Fire
Insurance Co., Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Nichido Fire
and Marine Insurance Co. announced Monday that they plan to form a
comprehensive tie-up with a view to integrating their operations
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The tie-up arrangement came as competition in Japan's insurance
sector intensified following the Japanese government's decision to
give insurers the freedom to compete by offering lower premiums
and innovative policies.
</P>
<P>
The three insurers will immediately create a committee to craft
business strategies for cashing in on the merits springing from
the formation of the new alliance.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Rages in Northern Sri Lanka Amid Elections Campaigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting raged in Sri
Lanka's northern Jaffna peninsula on Monday as elections
campaigning was in full swing, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched
counterattacks after government troops on Sunday had recaptured
the town of Chavakachcheri, the second largest one in the Jaffna
peninsula, Military Spokesman S. Karunaratne said.
</P>
<P>
He said government troops had recovered the bodies of 18 LTTE
rebels and another 50 rebels might have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said around 20 government soldiers had been
killed and some 200 wounded, 68 of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting began on Sunday as the island
country prepared for 11th general elections slated for October 10.
Election fever is gripping Jaffna as more than 10 political
parties have handed in their nominations to vie for the nine seats
for the electoral district.
</P>
<P>
Chavakachcheri, the main town between Elephant Pass and Jaffna
on the 53 kilometer main supply route, was captured by the LTTE
rebels in April this year shortly after the fall of the strategic
Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting a 17-year war against majority
Sinhalese dominated government in a bid to carve out a separate
state for minority Tamils in the country's north and east. More
than 60,000 people have been killed in the ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Prepares Emergency Medical Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine health authorities
have prepared emergency medical teams in the provinces of Cotabato
and Zamboanga to take care of civilians that may be affected by
ongoing police and military action against the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alberto Romualdez of the Department of Health said
Monday that these emergency teams will coordinate with the
National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) in undertaking these
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We are coordinating with the NDCC and we are organizing teams.
Once there are victims, we'll send people to the Cotabato and
Zamboanga Medical Centers and help out our integrated health
office in Sulu," Romualdez said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also said military health personnel are in charge of the
situation in Jolo, and that civilian health officials are giving
them full support.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada ordered last Saturday a police and military
strike on Abu Sayyaf lairs in Jolo, Sulu province to rescue l9
hostages still in the hands of the extremist group.
</P>
<P>
"I thick we'll be ready for any contingency. We're worried
about the possibility of displaced persons generated by the
renewed conflict," Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
The government has assured the public that the rescue
operations are confined to specific areas, although a news
blackout was imposed to prevent the telegraphing of government
moves.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said local health offices have sufficient medical
supplies to meet the needs of affected residents.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Burundian Refugees to Explain Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela, mediator in the Burundi crisis, next
month will visit all Burundian refugee camps in western Tanzania
to explain the peace accord signed in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha on August 28, newspapers here reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's top aid, leader of the facilitation team, Mark Bomani,
was quoted as saying here on Sunday that Mandela would be
accompanied by all signatories of the Arusha peace agreement to
camps in Tanzania's western Kagera and Kigoma regions that host
hundreds of thousands of Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The refugees would be told about what was discussed in all
negotiation meetings for Burundi peace for the last two years as
they are ignorant of the contents and implications of the peace
accord, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, they had been subjected to various
uncoordinated information inside the camps through the mass media
and a few individuals.
</P>
<P>
The delegates would also explain to refugees all resolutions so
far reached concerning the Arusha peace agreement and how it was
going to be effectively implemented, he said, adding that the
delegates would later visit Burundi for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The Burundians need not to worry about the agreement, said
Bomani, saying that it tries to meet the aspirations and concerns
of all the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
"We're aware that this document is not perfect. It is neither a
Bible nor a Koran, it can be modified by those who signed it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that arrangements to repatriate refugees would be
made soon to enable refugees willing to go back home do so without
any delay.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a voluntary exercise. No one will be forced to go
back to Burundi," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the monitoring committee to supervise the
implementation of the peace agreement would be formed soon. It
would comprise 12 members, including nine Burundi nationals and
three members from the United Nations, the Organization of African
Unity and the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
If implemented, the agreement would put in place a transitional
government in three to six months, create a new upper house of
parliament and split the country's army equally between Hutus and
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Civil war between the two ethnic groups began in 1993 and has
taken the lives of around 200,000 people, mostly civilians.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Lower in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo
Monday in a market worried about declines on Wall Street, rising
oil prices and the plummeting euro.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 152.12 points, or 0.94
percent to close at 16,061.16.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, slid 2.55 points or 0.17 percent to 1,481.04.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 490.64 million
shares from last Thursday's 573.14 million shares. The Tokyo
market was closed last Friday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday's decline on Wall Street helped press down high-
tech issues, while many communications issues were also lower.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers exceeded
losers 677 to 599 despite falls in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with 132
issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Kills Nine in Russia's Far East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed and
76 wounded in road accidents caused by a typhoon in Russia's Far
East territory of Maritime over the past weekend.
</P>
<P>
They are victims of a total of 55 road mishaps during the
typhoon raging in the area, including nine children, the Itar-Tass
news agency quoted local traffic police as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon also seriously damaged the local power supplying
system. Heavy rains inundated coal mines in Luchegorsk, and the
reduction of hydro electric station capacity led to electricity
cut-off throughout the Primorye region.
</P>
<P>
Storms and strong wind with a speed of 25 meters a second,
damaged power supplying in several other regions in the Maritime
territory, an official of the administration in the Pacific port-
city of Vladivostok said.
</P>
<P>
Overturned trees blocked traffic and broke electricity
transmission lines in Vladivostok. 60 people have been evacuated
from the settlement of Putsylovka in the Ussuriisk region after
the local river overflowed its banks and flooded the area, said
the territorial emergency center.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the rains have suspended and repair works began in
some key places. But specialists predicted new hard rains will hit
the territory again and cause more floods of rivers, said the
center.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Dutch wonder boy Pieter van
den Hoogenband upset Australian mega star Ian Thorpe to win a
thrilling Olympic men's 200m freestyle final here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband touched home first in one minute 43.35
seconds, tying his own world record set Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Denied a third gold medal, Thorpe took silver 24 hours after
Van den Hoogenband broke Thorpe's world record in the semis.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe finished in 1:45.83 and Massimiliano Rosolino of Italy
was third in 1:46.65.
</P>
<P>
Lenny Krayzelburg gave the United States its fourth gold in
three days of swimming, winning the 100m backstroke in an Olympic
record 53.72 seconds.
</P>
<P>
He broke the old mark of 53.86 set by American Jeff Rouse at
the 1992 Olympics, but was 0.12 seconds away from his own world
record set in the same pool last year.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Welsh of Australia took silver in 54.07, while Stev
Theloke of Germany won bronze in 54.82.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband fought with Thorpe stroke by stroke until
the 150m mark when the Dutchman began pulling away.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband jumped to fame last year by beating Olympic
champion Alexander Popov of Russia in the 50 and 100 freestyles at
the European championships.

Zhu said that friendship between China and Japan is the overall
consideration, and both countries should draw on history and
educate the younger generation about history so as to carry on the
friendship from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Tomiichi said the declaration he made on Japan's history of
aggression when he was in the office of prime minister is
something that should be done by the Japanese side. Bilateral
relations, important not only to people of both countries but also
to the peace and development of the whole region, have witnessed
sound development since 1972.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's visit in 1998 has greatly pushed
forward bilateral ties, he said, expressing the hope Premier Zhu's
upcoming visit to Japan would become a good opportunity for the
further advancement of Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
Tomiichi said the historical issue in Japan-China relations
should be emphasized, stressing that without reflecting on the
past, one can not get a clear view of the present and the future.
</P>
<P>
Citing a Chinese saying "past experience, if not forgotten, can
serve as a guide for the future", Tomiichi said Japan should
stress educating the younger generation about past history in a
bid to deepen mutual understanding and trust between the two
peoples.
</P>

BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
here today with former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi
in Zhongnanhai, site of China's central government.
</P>
<P>
Zhu greeted Tomiichi by describing him as an old friend of the
Chinese people and spoke highly of his contribution to bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Tomiichi is the first Japanese prime minister to
openly admit Japanese aggression and to apologize to the victims
of the countries concerned, adding that China highly appreciates
this.
</P>
<P>
The premier believes that the overall bilateral relations
remain relatively sound, and both sides decided to further
stimulate friendship by drawing on the history and facing up to
the future during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan in 1998.
However, he pointed out, attention should be paid to problems in
the process of developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he stressed, both countries should deepen mutual
understanding and trust so as to fend off troubles caused by
certain specific issues.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Uzi Landau, Knesset (parliament) member from the opposition
Likud party, demanded on Sunday that the United States recall its
ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk for his remarks on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Hebrew Union College Thursday evening, Indyk
said "there is no other choice than to share the holy city...it can
not be the exclusive preserve of one religion."
</P>
<P>
Indyk's remarks can only be interpreted as calling for a "
repartitioning of Jerusalem," Landau said, adding that the policy
of all U.S. governments has been to leave the question of Jerusalem
to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian Minister of International Cooperation Nabil
Shaath said on Sunday in Washington that United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan told him the world body is prepared to send
peacekeeping forces to deploy along a future border between Israel
and an independent Palestinian state after the signing of a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Shaath also said that U.S. officials are formulating an
assessment report to determine whether and how the parties can push
forward an accord.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Justice Minister Yossi Beilin on Sunday rejected a request
from the settler's representatives of the Jordan Rift Valley to
include a separate question on the future of the Valley and the
Northern Dead Sea region or to hold a separate referendum on this
topic in any peace treaty deal.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting here at Beilin's office, Beilin told them that
the referendum would ask only whether the public supports the
entire agreement or not.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Erez Checkpoint between Israel and Gaza Strip remained
closed to Palestinian trucks Sunday night in response to the clash
between Palestinians and Israeli troops at the Natzarim junction in
Gaza earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops also closed the Karni Crossing but reopened
it to Palestinian trucks early Sunday evening. During the clash, at
least seven Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets fired by the
Israeli troops, while one Israeli border policeman was hurt by
stone.

<HEADLINE> Iran Unearths Stone Relic With Cuneiform Inscription </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian archaeologists on
Sunday unearthed a stone relic inscribed in cuneiform on the
historical Hegmataneh hill of the western city of Hamedan, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The relic, uncovered after 11 years of excavation, is believed
to be part of the capital (crown) of an ancient pedestal, said
Mohammad Rahim Sarraf, head of the excavation team, adding that it
was the first such discovery in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The inscription provides proof of the existence of palaces
belonging to Achamenean kings who lived in Hegmataneh, one of the
most ancient cities known in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Achamenid dynasty ruled Persia (ancient Iran) during 553-330
B.C..
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists hope the inscription would help bring out the
identity of the ancient kings who laid the foundations of early
civilization in Hegmataneh, the report said.

LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has warned that the government would not condone people
occupying land illegally, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was back from a tour to Ndola, Copperbelt
Province on Sunday, has ordered the immediate removal of squatters
occupying and developing land illegally and warned of severe
consequences against the law breakers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lusaka Province Minister Sonny Mulenga has directed
police to arrest people putting up structures without title deeds
on the disputed land in suburban Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga also called on the squatters to use right channels to
obtain plots rather than violence, adding that the government had
a responsibility to issue land and that it would not abandon the
squatters.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that land grabbers in Chazanga area have been
fighting running battles with local villagers who were given the
land by Chieftainess Mungule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The squatters want to grab part of the vast tracts of land,
stating that they had no financial capacity to pay rentals to
their landlords in Chazanga.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Chzanga residents and villagers clashed in a fight
that left at least four villagers seriously beaten, including one
man unconscious.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday residents from the two areas clashed over the
disputed land when about 700 squatters stormed what is perceived
as customary land.

<HEADLINE> 15, 300 Kenyan Children Die of Vitamin A Deficiency Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 15, 300 Kenyan children
aged below six years die annually due to Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD)
, according to the country's first national survey on the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
Thousands more become blind for life due to lack of the vitamin
while others suffer chronic illnesses that impact negatively on
their long-term survival and productivity, the East African weekly
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report on the survey said that VAD is one of the leading
causes of childhood mortality in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-three percent of Kenyan children are marginally vitamin
A deficient, which, according to the World Health Organization's (
WHO) criteria, constitutes a grave national health problem," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, involving a total of 6,425 children, was conducted
in 14 districts spread over Kenya's eight provinces by researchers
from Moi University and the Kenya Medical Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that children aged between six to two years
are at the risk of suffering from VAD, probably due to weaning
before they are able to eat green vegetables, the leading source
of vitamin A in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
It also established that xerophthalimia, or damage to the eye
due to VAD, is more common in boys than girls.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, it is estimated that VAD affects 2.8 to
three million pre-school children worldwide critically, and up to
250 million others severely or moderately.
</P>
<P>
Researchers involved in the survey recommended that in Kenya,
there is a need to formulate a policy that addresses the problem.

TOKYO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's three major insurers,
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Asahi Mutual Life Insurance
Co. and Nichido Fire and Marine Insurance Co. announced Monday
that they plan to form a comprehensive tie-up with a view to
integrating their operations in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed today to form a new insurance business group that
will merge our life and nonlife businesses," the three firms said
in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
If formed, the three-way alliance would be Japan's largest
comprehensive insurance group, with combined assets of 19 trillion
yen (about 177.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tokio Marine and Nichido are currently Japan's biggest and
seventh-largest nonlife insurers, respectively, while Asahi is the
fifth-biggest life insurer.
</P>
<P>
The tie-up arrangement came as competition in Japan's insurance
sector intensified following the Japanese government's decision to
give insurers the freedom to compete by offering lower premiums
and innovative policies.
</P>
<P>
The three insurers will immediately create a committee to craft
business strategies for cashing in on the merits springing from
the formation of the new alliance, they said.
</P>
<P>
The group strategy committee, to be headed by the presidents of
the three insurers, will have a range of subcommittees to devise
details of new business strategies for their various insurance
business fields.
</P>
<P>
The three said they will cooperate to develop new insurance
policies by combining the advantages of life and nonlife insurance
policies, while cooperating to build up new sales channels on the
strength of information technology.
</P>
<P>
The three insurers will also cooperate to offer attractive
products related to so-called "third-sector" insurance products,
such as cancer and medical insurance policies, which do not fall
into the two major conventional categories of life and casualty
insurance sectors, they said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Teachers Continues Indefinite Strike  by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Classes in 23 thousand non-
government primary schools across the country could not be held
for the 17th consecutive day on Monday due to the continuing
indefinite work abstention program of the teachers of the
respective institutions.
</P>
<P>
Expressing dismay over the inaction of the government to end
the deadlock through negotiation, the leaders of the striking
teachers made it clear that they would continue their action
program till the realization of their demands. And such rigid
stand of the leaders has caused deep concern among the guardians
of over 0.8 million school-going students across the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 93,000 teachers of 23,000 registered and non-registered
primary schools across the country went on strike for an
indefinite period from September 2 demanding nationalization of
their respective institutions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in January this year, the non-government primary
school teachers staged a sit-in demonstration in the capital to
press home their "one-point demand" for nationalization of all non-
government primary school. But the government did not respond
positively.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' leaders made an appeal to the government on
August 23 to accept their demand by August 31. Otherwise, they
threatened to go for an indefinite strike from September 2.
</P>
<P>
As part of the movement to press home their demand, the
striking teachers will stage a sit-in demonstration around the
Prime Minister's Secretariat on September 25.
</P>
<P>
A high official of the Education Ministry Saturday termed the
strike illegal, saying that a section of teachers were out to
create disarray in the education sector under the cover of so-
called movement. The official said that the government is
determined not to bow down to any pressure by accepting the unjust
demands of the teachers.

<HEADLINE> Sanitation in Uganda's Schools Alarming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Less than 30 percent of
schools and institutions of higher learning in Uganda have got
access to clean and safe water, the New Vision daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sanitation and environment in most schools in the country
is in a sorry state which puts learners' lives in danger, the
newspaper quoted Head of the School Health Department in the
Ministry of Health Jeremiah Twatawa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Twatawa said that very few schools have got permanent supplies
of safe drinking water and as a result, school children end up
drinking from dirty and unsafe water sources near the schools.
</P>
<P>
Many school latrines are inadequate, inappropriate and
dangerous, which makes students' lives prone to diseases, he said,
adding that in some instances, the toilets are so open that
adolescents fear to use them.
</P>
<P>
Diseases like intestinal worms and other water borne diseases
are prevalent among school children because of this, said Twatwa.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Health Delivery System Restructuring underway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recommended structure provides for a new finance department
and will also see central and provincial hospitals become self-
governing institutions.
</P>
<P>
All the country's four central hospitals will now be headed by
chief executive officers reporting to a hospital management board.
Medical superintendents at provincial hospitals will also report
to advisory boards. The management or advisory boards report
directly to the health minister.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Herald on Sunday, Minister of Health
and Child Welfare Timothy Stamps said the idea to decentralize
management of health services seeks to involve local communities.
</P>
<P>
Although he would have liked to see the process accelerated,
Stamps admitted that a lot of money would be needed to get the
project moving forward.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "We have realized that we cannot run
everything from central government. We will not get a solution to
the health problems until all stakeholders are involved."
</P>
<P>
He said the restructuring exercise envisages a situation where
health committees at district level would also run outreach
activities.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 district hospitals would be involved in the
exercise, he said.

the men's C1 canoe-kayak gold medal here on Monday at the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"I was well prepared," said the Frenchman, who scored 231.87
points, and revealed on his feelings after having touched the gate
that "After touching it, I knew that I had to go on the attack."
</P>
<P>
On his opinion of the last section of the course, Estanguet
said that "I know it was really hard, but it was really hard for
everyone."
</P>
<P>
Estanguet said that "I wasn't thinking about a gold medal. I
was thinking about all the things that lead up to the Olympic
Games. There are lots of people in it, lots of great coaches.
I've got a good coach and also good parents."
</P>

Unfortunately, it was my first run which let me down. It is
disappointing to miss gold, but I feel good to have won a medal."
</P>
<P>
On the final couse, he said that "it was faster than the
qualifications course. The Olympics is a different type of feeling,
a different type of race."

He also hailed Estanguet of his victory, saying that "he had a
good first run, which he made the most of. If I had a better first

Uruguay Round results continue in a targeted fashion. In addition,
the efforts to get a new WTO Round going must be intensified," he

<HEADLINE> Asian Political Parties' Conference Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The First International
Conference of Asian Political Parties formally opened Monday in
Manila where leaders from about 40 political parties will discuss
political and economic cooperation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, chairman of the conference's organizing committee,
said at the opening ceremony that the vision of the two-day
conference is to create a culture of cooperation among Asia's
parties and hasten the region's economic and political integration.
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose is to begin a process of fraternal consultations --
to found a culture of cooperation among our parties -- and to
promote political cooperation in Asia over the first decades of
the 21st century," said De Venecia, former speaker of the
Philippine House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Citing the experience of the European Union, De Venecia said
Asia's political parties should look beyond the current regional
organizations "toward an Asian Parliament, an Asian monetary fund,
an Asian common market, and an Asian currency."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Asia's leaders "must raise strong political
will" to face the parties' "greatest challenges" which he
identified as completing the region's "agricultural and industrial
modernization, eradicating mass-poverty, controlling corruption,
and enabling our peoples to cope with the technological and
knowledge revolution."
</P>
<P>
In his remark, De Venecia also called for a new global
Christian-Muslim partnership and dialogue in the light of ethnic
and politico-religious conflicts in Asia and other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Let us look into the feasibility of a global Christian-Muslim
coalition at the level of political parties, to help resolve
ethnic and politico-religious conflicts which have now spilled
over into the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asia's senior leaders, including Prince Norodom Ranarridh from
Cambodia, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, former
South Korean President Kim Young Sam, and Speaker of the
Bangladesh Parliament Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, also made their
statements on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The political parties attending the conference are from
Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Iran,
Japan, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal,
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada is scheduled to meet the
delegates and deliver his address at a dinner-reception at the
Presidential Palace Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, some 170 delegates from the political parties will
discuss different topics in three simultaneous workshops while a
committee will finalize the draft of the joint Asian Declaration
which is scheduled to be signed Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Entire Bangladesh Except Barisal to be Under Railway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The entire Bangladesh except
the greater Barisal district, 277 kilometers south of Dhaka, has
been planned to be connected through railway network within the
next two years, according to the Bangladesh Observer Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Railway sources were quoted as saying that the
state owned railway was spending and also plans to spend a total
of 278 million U.S. dollars for the expansion of its network and
improvement of services aimed at restoring the past glory of
railway communication.
</P>
<P>
After years of gradual dwindling in the length of its track,
Bangladesh railways is now hopeful of not only reversing the trend,
but also adding substantial kilometers to its track length, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Following the independence, the total length of railway track
in the country in 1972 was 2,858 kilometers. The track length came
down to 2,706 kilometers in 1992-93, a situation which continue
till 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
However, the trend was reversed and during the past four years
47 kilometers have already been added and more are in progress.
</P>
<P>
The work on the two projects for "Jamuna Bridge rail
connection" at a cost of around 148 million dollars have already
begun. Construction of a 99 kilometers rail-route in the
northwestern part of the country at a cost of 95 million dollars
is in progress and will be completed in June next year. The
conversion of 245 kilometers track from Serajganj to Parbatipur,
also in the northwestern part of the country, at a cost of 50.7
million dollars which began in December 1999 will be completed in
March 2002 as per schedule.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Railways in recent years involved private sector
for improvement in the management of commercial activities of
mail and local trains. The steps have proved to be effective and
remunerative for the railways as more passengers now feel
encouraged to use railways.
</P>
<P>
The process of integrating private sector in railway
activities began in 1997 and presently 10 pairs of train run daily
under private supervision. Process is now almost completed for
operating commercial activities in another 31 pairs of trains.

SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Olympic debutante Crystl
Bustos is just one home run away from equalling the Olympic home
run record after spearheading the United States to a 3-0 win over
Cuba at the Olympic Games softball competition here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bustos smashed Cuba pitcher Laritza Espinosa for home runs over
center and right fields at her first two plate appearances to
bring her Olympic homer total to three after just two days of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
With another five preliminary games and finals to be played,
the short stop is widely tipped to smash the Olympic tournament
record of four set by Japan's Haruka Saito.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Bustos, veteran Sheila Douty also homered over the
left field fence for the Americans' only other score.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dominated play with big hitting but was uninspiring in
the field with three errors, including two wild throws to first
base by starting pitcher Danielle Henderson.
</P>
<P>
Olympic newcomers Cuba struggled with the bat with only two
players, Diamela Puente and Haydee Hernandez, mananing hits.
However, the Cubans played a strong defensive game to hold the
Americans to three runs.

SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China showed their amazing
depth in women's weightlifting as Yang Xia won the 53kg category

<HEADLINE> German Firms to Maintain Intensive Contracts with ASEAN Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 18 (Xinhua) -- German Economics and
Technology Minister Werner Muller said here Monday German firms
want to maintain intensive business contracts with all ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few German companies are already orienting themselves
to an ASEAN market of 500 million consumers and have positioned
themselves accordingly, he said at the opening of the two-day 8th
Asia-Pacific Convention of German Business here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Praising ASEAN as the most effective regional association in
the Asia-Pacific area, he however said ASEAN did not provide the
desire level of consistency during the recent financial crisis,
even though there was an advanced degree of economic integration
between the market-oriented ASEAN members in particular.
</P>
<P>
He held that the economic systems and economic policies of the
various ASEAN countries still diverge too greatly for a process of
economic integration to commerce.
</P>
<P>
A uniform market framework is needed, not just as a
precondition and basis for intensified ASEAN cooperation, the
German minister said, adding "Competition under globalized market
condition also makes this structural adjustment necessary."
</P>
<P>
"The need for structural change in some ASEAN countries is one
reason why there is still more potential for trade with Germany
and for German investment in these countries," he said, hoping the
process of market reforms would speed up.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN formed in 1967 now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan failed to let a 45
minute delay upset their concentration on Monday, grinding out a 3-
1 win against China to claim an early advantage in the Sydney
Olympic Games women's softball medal calculations.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China have both been earmarked as possible dangers to
the high ranking the United States and Australian teams, but it
was Japana who earned the medal accolades in a slow but deliberate
display.

China's Toa Hua scored the first run of the game, after Wang
Ying hit a hard ball to the left outfield.

<P>
Japan came back at the bottom of the second when Naito Emi hit

Naito Emi touched home base for a 2-1 lead.

China's Wang Ying had a chance in the bottom of the fifth to

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians, Kenyans Battle for Men's 10,000m in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Defending Olympic champion
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia is known as the "master" over 10,
000 meters and is undefeated at this event since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie holds the Olympic record of 27:07.34 set in
Atlanta and has also run 15 world records. At age of 27, he
should be at his running prime. The only doubt is whether he has
been able to regain full fitness after an injury early this year.
</P>
<P>
Paul Tergat of Kenya chose not to run the Kenyan Championships
at 10,000 meters, and was originally selected for the 5,000 meters.
However, after running the year's fastest time of 27:03.87 at
Brussels on August 25, he switched to this event.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan champion is John Korir, who, at age of 18, is still
a junior, and the third top Kenyan is Patrick Ivuti.
</P>
<P>
Two more Ethiopians will be in contention -- Assefa mezgebu,
the 1999 African Games 10,000m winner, who was third at Seville in
1999, and second in the 2000 World Cross Country Race, and Girma
Tula who was fourth in Seville.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mourhit of Belgium set a European record fo 26:52.30
last year, and although he has not contested a 10,000m this year,
will be a major threat if he runs this event.
</P>
<P>
Another to attract attention is Jose Rios of Spain who won the
Spanish title in August in 27:22.70.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania's Daina
Gudzineviciute scored 93 hits to get the women's shooting trap
title at the Olympic Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderful, it still is difficult to believe I won, but
it will come to me," said Gudzineviciute, who won the second gold
medal for Lithuania at the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good feeling. A lot of people have come to know (
Lithuania) through the basketball, now people connected to this
sport will now think of Lithuania."
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realise that if I missed the last shot I would have
an additional shot," said the Lithuanian woman, who beat Delphine
Racinet of France by one shit, "I wasn't counting else's misses.
The calculator in your mind is always working, the thing I was
thinking was I can't have any more misses."
</P>
<P>
On her opposition, she said "there have been many strong
shooters, they were all strong shooters."
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Lithuanian, I live in the capital, I am shooting for a
very long time, there were good times and there were bad times,
but shooting represents a major part of my life."
</P>
<P>
On shooting at the Sydney International Shooting Center, she
said that "I would probably say that this range is one of the more
difficult ones. For example in Italy, it is very different there
and you can't compare, you tend to get an optical illusion here."
</P>
<P>
Racinet finished second with 92 hits and China's Gao E took the
bronze medal with 90 hits.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Laos Agree to Boost Mekong River Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Laos have agreed
to jointly push forward tourism along the Mekong river, a move
that will benefit all countries along the river, a report from
Thai government said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At yesterday's meeting between Thai Minister of Prime Minister'
s Office Adisai Bhodaramik and Lao Tourism Authority chairman
Cheng Sayavong in Vientiane, the Lao capital, both sides held the
same opinion that the Mekong river, which runs from China through
Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam will become a
favorite destination for tourists interested in the region's
abundant historical sites, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study of extending the Mekong river tourism
routes from Thailand to Laos will soon be conducted by both sides
following the meeting, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-Lao cooperation in the Mekong tourism will help Laos
attract more foreign tourists, as people who travel in the region
will be able to extend their trips to Laos, it said.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors to Laos last year was recorded at 614,
278, up 24 percent from the year before. Thai visitors topped the
list by accounting for 57 percent of all the tourists, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Expands 5 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai economy grew about five
percent in the second quarter of this year, The Nation newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted as
saying that the National Economic and Social Development Board (
NESDB) had already handed him its economic report, but he would
not disclose the exact rate of economic growth until later Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of economic growth in the second quarter did not
change much from the first one, and the average rate of growth in
the first half of the year is not less than 5 percent," Supachai
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy expanded 5.2 percent year-on-year in the
first quarter. The NESDB had earlier forecast that the economy
would grow by 5 per cent this year.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that the higher price of oil would result in
lower economic growth in the third and fourth quarters. However,
the government will achieve its previous projection of a five-
percent growth this year because the negative effect of higher oil
prices would be offset by higher export growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports grew 17 percent in the first eight months of
this year. The commerce ministry has forecast that export growth
this year would exceed a previous projection of 12 percent and
rise to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Supachai expressed concern over the price of oil and the wide
interest rate spread, which has adversely affected consumption.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not intervene in the central bank's
interest rate policy, but we will ask the central bank why
commercial banks have brought down the saving rates, but have kept
higher lending rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such an interest rate policy will not boost the economy;
either the lending rates are brought down or the saving rates must
be brought up."
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the Thai commercial banks have maintained higher
lending rates of between eight and 8.75 percent while cutting the
saving rates to between 2.25 and 3.75 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the possibility of a cut in the oil tax, Supachai
said this would be the government's last option because even a one-
baht (2.4 U.S. cents) concession in the levy would result in a
revenue loss of 20 billion baht (487 million U.S. dollars).

JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said here Monday he has relieved General
Rusdihardjo of his post as National Police (POLRI) chief and
appointed Let. Gen. Bimantoro as care taker of the post.
</P>
<P>
"I have told Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri and
Commander of the Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI) Admiral Widodo AS
about this matter," the President told the press at the Merdeka
Palace.
</P>
<P>
But, Wahid did not say the reason for the replacement.
</P>
<P>
The President who was accompanied by Cabinet Secretary Marsilam
Simandjuntak said the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) decreed
recently that replacement of the national police chief should be
agreed upon by the House of Representatives (DPR). But the law on
the implementation of the decree has not yet been made and that
the deputy chief of POLRI should take care of the job.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wahid denied the rumors that he will replace TNI
chief Widodo in connection with the bomb blast occurred at the
Jakarta Stock Exchange last Wednesday in which 15 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan for that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Project to Protect Eroding Coastline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a 80
million U.S. dollars Coastal Resources Management Project to
protect its eroding coastline and instill sustainable management
practices, the official Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank would provide a concessional loan of
40 million dollars to the project while the government of the
Netherlands will contribute 12.76 million dollars as a grant, said
the paper, adding that the government of Sri Lanka will fund the
balance of the project.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will be completed by 2005, is considered
vital to the survival of much of Sri Lanka's coastal environment.
The western and southern coast alone is estimated to lose between
200,000 to 300,000 square meters of beach a year to storms and
high waves.
</P>
<P>
The coast is home to one third of the country's 19 million
population and the highly productive ecosystem is an important
base for the country's growth. The coastal zone accounts for
nearly 80 percent of fish production and 70 percent of industrial
output. The eroding coastline specially endangers economic
activity on the densely populated western and southwestern coast.
</P>
<P>
The project will construct shoreline protection works in the
most affected coastline in six districts along the northwestern,
western and southwestern coasts. It will also address other major
problems such as overfishing, pollution, uncontrolled exploitation
of lagoons and estuaries, coral reefs and mangrove swamps, grass
beds and other wetlands.

<P>
PAJU, SOUTH KOREA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung inaugurated the launching of project
reconnecting Seoul-Shinuiju railway at the Imjin-gak pavilion of
Paju city, close to the truce village of Panmunjom on Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The president said,"this is a new starting point for the
history of our people toward a new era of reconciliation,
cooperation and prosperity,"
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the 12-kilometer section linking the two
sides railways was decided by Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim
Jong Il in Pyongyang on June 15 in a historic South-North Joint
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The 486-kilometer railway runs from South Korean capital city
of Seoul to the Shinuiju, a far north city of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The 12-kilometer section linking South Korean city of Munsun
with Changdan just on the Military Demarcation Line will be
completed around September next year at a cost of 54.7 billion won
(some 48 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The DPRK will build the north side of the section from Kaesong
city to Changdan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the construction of a new highway linking Munsun and
Changdan also started Monday and is also expected to be concluded
next September with an investment of 100 billion won (some 88
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Relinking the inter-Korean railway system, which was severed
before the Korean War in early 1950s, is believed to be a concrete
step forward to full-scale economic cooperation between Seoul and
Pyongyang.

<HEADLINE> Yang Xia Confident of Winning Women's 53kg Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Yang Xia said she is
confident to beat the top rival Li Feng-Ying of Chinese Taipei to
win the women's 53kg category weightlifting gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Yang, from Hunan province, has psychological advantage over Li,
who was born in Hunan province as well.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 23, said, "Li has never beat me. I beleive I can win."
</P>
<P>
But Li could pose serious threat to the Asian Games champion
since her confidence has been boosted after winning the title in
last year's World Championship in the absence of Yang.
</P>
<P>
"The competition might be very tense but the final winner is
sure to be Yang, " said Wei Di, head of the Chinese weightlifting
team. "Yang will beat her by at least 2.5kg."

<HEADLINE> Jelic Outstanding as Croatia Upset China in Women's Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Croatia continued on its
winning way, upsetting the more fancied team from China in four
sets 25-23, 26-28, 25-20 and 25-15 in the women's volleyball
preliminaries of the Olympic Games on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The youthful Croatians had their opposition's measure and
continued to grow in confidence as the match progressed.
</P>
<P>
Croatian captain Barbara Jelic was unstoppable. Her powerful
hitting could not be matched by the Chinese as she blasted 40 kill
spikes and had three blocks.
</P>
<P>
Jelic was ably supported by Natasha Leto's spiking with 16
kills and Elana Cebukina's blocking. Another highlight was the
emergence of 17-year-old Biljana Gligorovic, showing maturity
beyond her years as she controlled the Croatian attack.
</P>
<P>
China continued to disappoint as the Olympic silver medallists
battled to overcome their inconsistencies. Captain Sun Yue and Wu
Yongmei lifted China to take the second, but this was small
consolation as the side withered under the pressure of the
Croatian game.
</P>
<P>
China will need to regroup quickly before their next match
against Brazil as another loss would be devastating to its
confidence. Croatia will play the United States in an eagerly
anticipated match.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Retake Northern Key Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
had recaptured the town of Chavakachcheri, the second largest one
in the northern Jaffna peninsula, from separatist rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the army chief was quoted
as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Army Commander Lt. General Lionel Balagalle told The Island
newspaper that the troops had been able to capture the town within
four hours of fierce fighting after the launch of the operation on
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation was a combined security forces operation
aimed at weakening the LTTE rebels and retaking areas lost to
rebels during March to May this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the LTTE rebels said in a statement Sunday night that
government troops had entered the outskirts of Chavakachcheri town
and heavy fighting was raging.
</P>
<P>
Chavakachcheri, the main town between Elephant Pass and Jaffna
on the 53 kilometer main supply route, was captured by the LTTE
rebels in April this year shortly after the fall of the strategic
Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting a 17-year war against majority
Sinhalese dominated government in a bid to carve out a separate
state for minority Tamils in the country's north and east. More
than 60,000 people have been killed in the ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Balagalle said the rebels had suffered heavy losses with four
soldiers being killed and 46 others injured. He said air and
artillery strikes including the use of Multi Barrel Rocket
Launchers had successfully destroyed the rebels' mortar positions.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the military was strengthening its position in
the peninsula and added that this month alone over 400 LTTE rebels
had been killed.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports to New Markets Grow Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports to the
markets considered new to the country, such as China, Mongolia,
Latin America and South Asia, are growing at a fast pace, the
Commerce Ministry said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report from the ministry said that in July, on a year-on-year
basis, exports to China and Mongolia increased by about 55 percent,
Latin America by 49.4 percent, followed by South Asia, which grew
by about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Without disclosing the figures of export value to those markets,
it said that "the growth of export value to these new markets have
been satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
To boost exports to the new markets, the commerce ministry have
also provided funds of about 46 million baht (1.1 million U.S.
dollars) to private export operators dealing with these markets,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The robust export growth, which increased 27 percent in the
first eight months this year, has become the main engine for the
country's economic recovery. To sustain the growth, Thailand is
exploring new markets around the world besides its traditional
markets such as North America, Europe, and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Children Closes with Important Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The week-long International
Conference on War-Affected Children drew to a close Sunday in
Winnipeg with a deal to free abducted African children and a 14-
point plan to safeguard the rights of children.
</P>
<P>
Through the mediation of Canada and Egypt, Sudan and Uganda
agreed to cooperate in repatriating an estimated 6,000 Ugandan
children abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel
force in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"We are very encouraged by the commitment of the Government of
Sudan to work to ensure the release and safe return of these
abducted children," said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"The undertaking by the Government of Uganda to provide
conditions conducive to the reconciliation, rehabilitation, return
and resettlement of members of the LRA is a key aspect in solving
this tragic situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced "the upcoming release of 16
abductees" as "an important step" for the entire process to free
the abducted children.
</P>
<P>
The deal is the latest development in the relations between
Sudan and Uganda, which have been for year accusing each other of
supporting rebel forces. International mediation has been
conducted on several occasions to help resolve disputes between
the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Canadian International Cooperation Minister Maria
Minna announced that the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) will invest at least 1 million Canadian dollars (about 672,
300 U.S. dollars) to help released children re-integrate into
their communities.
</P>
<P>
The conference, among others, adopted a 14-point plan calling
for "political, moral, economic and social leadership" to
safeguard the rights of children.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind, has attracted ministers,
representatives and experts from more than 130 countries. The
adopted documents will be presented to the United Nation's Special
Session on Children next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Olympic officials,

</P>
<P>
Samaranch's wife Maria Teresa Samaranch passed away Saturday in
Barcelona, Spain after a brave fighting with cancer. She was 67.
</P>
<P>
An overflow crowd of about 350 people packed St. Patrick's
Catholic Church in downtown Sydney for the special Mass in the
memory of Maria Teresa Samaranch, who passed away Saturday in
Barcelona, Spain, at the age of 67.
</P>
<P>
The solemn 30-minute service was held in the same church where
Samaranch attended Mass only a week before his wife's death. One
of the priests who co-celebrated the memorial wore vestments with
the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
Seated in the front row was Australian swimming icon Dawn
Fraser, whom Samaranch had invited as his personal guest and stand-
in "Olympic first lady" for Friday's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, attending his last Olympics as head of the IOC after
20 years in office, left Sydney the morning after the ceremony and
rushed home in a private jet to be at his wife's bedside. But she
died while Samaranch was still in the air, two hours before
landing in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
"She was a wonderful woman," Samaranch told reporters in
Barcelona. "I not only loved her, I admired her."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said his wife had been ill for several months and he
last spoke with her on September 3 before traveling to Sydney. He
said he was notified of her death by telephone during the flight
to Barcelona.
</P>

reiterated that he plans to return to Sydney, probably by the
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Lifters Allowed to Stay at Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Three male and one female
weightlifters from Romanian team have got a permission to stay at
the Sydney Olympic Games after payment of a 50,000 U.S. dollars
fine, team officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Romanian head coach Niku Vlad said:"We paid it (the fine)
because it was not fiar that the other athletes should go home."
</P>
<P>
The Romanians had been suspended under a International
Weightlifting Federation (IWF) rule which says that if three or
more lifters give positive results in a season, the national
association should be suspended from international competitions
for a year.
</P>
<P>
The country's National Olympic Committee has now paid the IWF
the fine to keep their four "clean" weightlifters in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
Vlad said a Romanian was due to take part in the weightlifting
events later on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had said the
weightlifting team should leave the Games because of the doping
offences and ruled out any chance of a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
But IOC director general Francois Carrard later said
eligibility was a matter for the international federations.
</P>
<P>
He was unaware of the IWF's decision to allow the Romanians
back in.
</P>
<P>
But he said: "We always follow the decision of the
international federation unless there is something extraordinary
to reconsider it."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Orders Soeharto's Guards to be Disarmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid has instructed security forces to disarm former
president Soeharto's bodyguards, local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the head of the intelligence agency, and later (
will ask) the Indonesian armed forces chief and the national
police chief to ensure all security guards at former president
Soeharto's home who are not members of the armed forces or the
police are disarmed," the Indonesian Observer daily quoted the
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the North Sumatra provincial capital of Medan on
Sunday, Wahid said firearm-carrying individuals could "pretend to
defend themselves, pretend to defend the government, but basically
undermine the government."
</P>
<P>
Wahid gave Soeharto's private guards one week to hand over
their firearms to the government.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't want to, we will look for them until we get them.
That is the only way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said his order was made in connection with
the recent bomb attacks and sectarian violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, a powerful explosion rocked the 34-story
Jakarta Stock Exchange building, leaving at least 15 people dead
and dozens of others injured. This is the fourth bomb blasts in
Jakarta in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wahid said that "drastic measures" against those
responsible for the incidents had to be taken to prevent similar
ones from taking place again.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said last Friday he had ordered police to arrest Soeharto
's Youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra over the bombing of the
Jakarta Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Following the president's order, Hutomo was questioned last
Saturday by the police but has not been arrested.

SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A traffic jam caused by an
accident delayed the start of the women's softball medal round
match between Japan and China at the Sydney Olympic Games on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese team was delayed for nearly an hour and the start
time was pushed back for nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
The game started 40 minutes late but the match between the
United States and Cuba, which followed the China-Japan game, was
expected to start as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
An accident on the M4 highway held up the bus carrying the
Japanese team on its way to the Blacktown Olympic Center. The
International Softball Federation granted the Japanese request for
extra time to warm up.
</P>
<P>
"They got there. We are trying to do everything we can," said
Liz Smylie of the SOCOG Sydney organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Smylie said 50,000 people were in the western region of the
Sydney area where the softball games are played. Part of the
problem, she said, was the lack of a reserved Olympic lane in the
area.

<HEADLINE> Australian Athlete Blocked from Olympic Village due to Forged Pass Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Several athletes have been
briefly blocked and double checked by security officials at the
entry to the Olympic Village because a computer check showed that
somebody had already entered on their pass, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if the cause might be
counterfeiting or confusion in the system of checks.
</P>
<P>
Among those stopped was champion Australian swimmer Grant
Hackett, a favorite in the 1,500-meter freestyle, according to
Michael Wenden, assistant chief of the Australian Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Olympic Committee said that Hackett, the 1500m
favourite, was brushed aside because other 'Grant Hacketts' had
already been granted access after showing security staff fake
accreditations bearing his name and photo.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that Grant Hackett was met at the entrance and
escorted to a security officer to double-check his pass and then
they said 'thank you very much for your cooperation', and made
sure that he wasn't inconvenienced in getting to a dining hall,"
said AOC assistant chef de mission Michael Wenden.
</P>
<P>
"And although there was a hiccup in the system, the extent of
it was very minor and I think it was remedied quite quickly. I
think there was a small glitch in their security system. That's
what I'm led to believe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liz Smylie, a spokeswoman for the Games organizing committee,
said there was no evidence anyone had actually entered the village
on a false pass.
</P>
<P>
"It involved a handful of athletes. To my knowledge no one has
gotten into the village," said. Smylie would not identify who was
involved nor would she say whether the cause was counterfeiting or
another reason.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- One day after their 119-72
loss to the United States Dream Team, China's 2.27-meter Yao Ming,
the tallest athletes in the Sydney Games, thought they would cut
the margin narrow if they were not full into fouls troubles so
early.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can be blocked in a basketball game," said Yao Ming,
who blocked off a driving shot by American Vins Cater, the 2000
NBA slam dunk title winner, with just two minutes into their
Sunday's group A match in the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"But the referees might never seen those NBA stars were blocked
like what we did to them in the beginning of the game, so they
were too sensitive to that." Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Walking Great Wall", Yao Ming and his teammates
Wang Zhizhi (2.15 meters) and Menk Bateer (2.11) form the tallest
front lineup in all the 12 men's basketball team in the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
Yao and Wang shocked the sluggish American NBA stars when they
helped China to lead 13-7 and 17-16 in Sunday's game but the
leading only stood for some five minutes when Wang Zhizhi picked
up his fourth personal fouls and Yao collected two, most of them
were called on their blocks.
</P>
<P>
The two young talents, with an average height of 2.20-meter,
whipped off four American shots in five minutes. "We were
surprised by those calls because we thought they were good and
clean blocks, the height of the rim can not be changed and we know
how to protect it under the baskets." the 20 year-old Yao said.
</P>
<P>
China were called for 14 fouls in the first half and 12 of them
were against the three big boys.  "The calls changed the things
and otherwise we could play a close game against those NBA stars,
at least in the first half." Wang Zhizhi said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if they can beat the American Olympic team formed by
12 NBA super-stars, the 23-year-old Wang Zhizhi said, "It would be
a work of ours and the next generation to catch up with the
Americans in basketball, but I'm so glad that we had these chances
to learn from them."
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi was picked up by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1999
NBA draft but He did not go since his army club need him for 2001
China National Games.

<HEADLINE> Psychological Problems Affect One Third of Children in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- One out of every three
children under school age in Tianjin suffer from psychological
problems, which result in abnormal behavior, according to a recent
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
The result showed that over 34.3 percent of the behavior
problems is the result of psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the municipal children's health
service, using 8,6786 samples from 30 kindergartens in the
municipality which neighbors Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that 31 percent of children between 2 and
4 years of age are found to have behavior problems. Some of the
behavior problems are: being over reserved, shy and timid,
exhibiting aggressive behavior such as bullying, fighting and
unruliness, badgered with hypochondria, feeling scared, worried
and self-contemptuous.
</P>
<P>
Among children between 5 and 6 years of age, 37.3 percent are
found to have abnormal psychological problems, 24 percent of them
are over active, absent-minded and fidgety.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xunian, an official with the health service, said that
because of being indulged by their parents, the only child in the
family has less opportunity to temper himself/herself and to
communicate with his/her peers. Moreover, most parents either do
not care or do not know how to deal with their children's
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the period between 2 and 3 years of age is
crucial for a child's intelligence, character, and social
adaptability.
</P>
<P>
"The psychological problems, if not treated timely and
effectively, will greatly damage children's health," said Liu.

<HEADLINE> More Evidence Found Proving Japan's Invasion During W.W.II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A map commemorating the
enthronement of the "emperor" of Manchuria State, a puppet state
supported by Japanese invaders in the 1930s, was discovered
recently in Shenyang, capital city of northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The map, 108.5 centimeters long and 79.5 centimeters wide, was
brown due to aging and a little broken along the edges. But
despite its condition words on it could still be clearly
identified and it carries 298-word "imperial edict" upon
enthronement of the "emperor." The editor was named Nobuharu
Kojima.
</P>
<P>
This is the first map ever found with words like "commemorative
map for enthronement." Japanese invaders propped up Aisingiorro
Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), in 1932 to
establish a so-called Manchuria State in the three Chinese
provinces in the northeast. The puppet state was used as the
headquarters by the Japanese to continue to invade China.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the puppet state was also verified by a
Japanese soldier whose diary was left in Harbin, capital of
Heilongjiang Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The diary written by Sueta Murakami, who wrote in detail how
Japanese troops forcibly occupied land in northeast China, stole
its resources and migrated Japanese people to China for further
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Murakami recorded his own experiences within less than two
months on 30 pages of the 140-page notebook.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yifeng, 74, found the diary in August, 1945 in an
abandoned barrack, once used by Japanese troops, which retreated
when the former Soviet Union army launched a large-scale military
attack against them.

<HEADLINE> Women's Weightlifting to Take center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Women's weightlifting will
take center stage on Monday, day three of Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
Asian female weightlifters have dominated women's weightlifting
in recent years with China, Chinese Taipei and India boasting
world champions in the seven contested weight divisions. Chinese
weightlifters hold 16 of the 21 women's world records.
</P>
<P>
The two weight classes to be contested Monday, the women's 53kg
and 58 kg class will be no exception.
</P>
<P>
Li Feng Ying of Chinese Taipei and Yang Xia of China are
expected to challenge for the gold medal in the 53kg class.
</P>
<P>
Li beat her rivals at the world championships in November,
breaking the world clean and jerk record along the way. Yang, a
silver medalist at those championships competing in a higher
weight category, will drop back a division in an attempt to win
gold.
</P>
<P>
Others to look out for include, Japan's Mari Nakaga and Indian
pair Sanamacha Chang and Winarni Slamet.
</P>
<P>
World clean and jerk record holder Ri Song Hui of DPR Korea is
favorite to take gold in the women's 58kg class. In the absence
of world champion Chen Yanqing of China, Ri Song Hui looks a class
above her rivals.
</P>
<P>
Due to China's amazing depth and the fact each team can only
select four athletes, there was always the potential that a gold
medal prospect would be left off the team.
</P>
<P>
However, the battle for bronze is wide open. Thailand's
khassarapom Suta, Canadian Maryse Turcotte, Mexican Soraya Jimenez
Mendivil and Poland's Aleksandra Klejnowska are genuine medal
hopefuls.

SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and the United States are
expected to continue their winning streak at the Sydney Olympics
at the baseball center Monday when they play Italy and South
Africa respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans are coming off a resounding 16-0 victory over South
Africa and will be determined to extend their 19-game winning
streak in Olympic baseball.
</P>
<P>
With every starting player collecting a hit Sunday, the Cubans
are on fire with the bat, and their pitching staff did not give up
a hit.
</P>
<P>
Italy will struggle for hits against Cuba, but are stronger
opposition than South Africa and will be more competitive. The
game should go the full nine innings, but Cuba should win easily.
</P>
<P>
The American team are on a high after their exciting 13 innings
victory over Japan Sunday. Mike Neill showcased the Americans
power with his game-breaking home run to lead his country to
victory.
</P>
<P>
South Africa shouwed they were out of their league with the 16-
0 loss to Cuba and can't expect any respite against the American
team. The South Africans will improve after their first Olympic
baseball experience, but it will not show against the Americans.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's first ever
Olympic swimming gold medalist Claudia Poll will begin the task of
becoming the first woman to win back-to-back 200m freestyle
Olympic gold medals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Poll took gold in Atlanta and is still the favorite to do so
again in Sydney despite the fact local hero Susie O'Neill has the
fastest time in the world so far this year. Poll's best for 2000
is 1:58.02, some 0.50 seconds behind 1:57.47 of O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
The women's 200m freestyle became an Olympic event at the 1968
Mexico Olympic Games and since then no swimmer has taken the event
at successive Games. Germany's Franziska van Almisick has
finished with two silver medals in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Poll has made no secret of the fact she wants to break van
Almsick's world record of 1:56.78 set at the 1994 Rome world
championships, where she originally failed to make the final but
gained a lane following the withdrawal of another German swimmer.
Poll's personal best is 1:57.48 swam at the 1997 Pan Pacific
championships.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- German shooting star Ralf
Schumann will attempt to win his third Olympic gold medal when he
competes in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol on September 21.
</P>
<P>
Schumann, who has dominated the men's rapid fire event since
1987, won the gold medal at the Atlanta and Barcelona Olympic
Games, and silver at the Seoul Games.
</P>
<P>
Known as "Mr RApid Fire", the 38-year-old Schumann holds att
current world and Olympic records for the event.
</P>
<P>
Leading to the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Schumann won all of
the three World Cup event he competed in. These wins in Sydney,
Milan and Munich made him favorite to take out the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to make a third medal in an Olympics there is
always a lot of pressure. In swimming and athletics it happens
sometimes but in shooting it is extremely rare," said Schumann. "
No matter how much work a person puts into the event once the top
eight qualifers make it to a final anything can happen."
</P>
<P>
Schumann said his main rivals are teammate Daniel Leonhard, who
has performed well in recent World Cups and Vladimir Vokhmyanin of
Kazakhstan who won bronze medals at the Atlanta and Barcelona
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The rapid fire requires an athlete to shoot at five targets in
eight, six and four seconds. It is a demanding sport and athletes
must be able to keep focused throughout the event and have quick
hand eye co-ordination.

<P>
ABU DHABI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates has
officially protested to Iraq for its media attack on a statement
made by the UAE delegation at the U.N. Millennium Summit in New
York more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Saif Saeed bin Sa'ed, under secretary of the Foreign Ministry,
Monday summoned Iraq's charge D'affaires Abdul Raziq Hamoudi to
informed him of the "resentment and concern" of the UAE at the "
audacious remarks made by the Iraqi media," the official news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some Iraqi newspapers have leveled charges against the UAE that
it did not mention the Iraqi issue in its statement released at the
Millennium Summit, and abused the head of the UAE delegation
personally.
</P>
<P>
"Such remarks will not serve relations between the two
countries, especially when the UAE has never ceased from calling to
lift the sanctions and alleviate the suffering of Iraqi people and
was the first to resume relations with Iraq," said Bin Sa'ed.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the Iraqi diplomat to ask his government to
refrain from this action which "runs in contradiction with the
simplest rules of bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
The squabble cast a shadow over their newly resumed relations
which had been cut since the 1991 Gulf War. The two Gulf Arab
neighbors have just reopened their embassies in each other's
capital.

There have been neither positive responses nor signals from the
Palestinian side and it is still uncertain whether the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks could be moved forward or the two sides
could strike a deal in a very short period of time, Barak said.

Their study will mainly focus on the euro, officially launched
on January 1, 1999 by the European Union (EU) as a counter-balance

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Puts Embargo on Products From Quarantine Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An embargo prohibiting
the movement of any agricultural produce from Camperdown area in
KwaZulu-Natal midlands of South Africa took effect Monday to
prevent spread of the foot and mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
The embargo affects agricultural produce from farms within a 10
kilometer radius of a pig farm, where the break-out occurred last
week, said Graham Linscott, a government official.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the move might spell out as an economic
disaster for farmers in the area. About 100 farms have been
rounded into the quarantine zone.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the event, South Africa's Agricultural Minister
Thoko Didiza urged farmers in the area to adhere to the strict
measures, despite the disastrous result.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that spread of the disease to other parts of the
country could result in a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
Foot and mouth disease is also an international trade
sensitive disease and failure to contain it to a small area could
result in many countries imposing bans on agricultural exports
from South Africa, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Veterinary experts were sent to the area to kill more than 600
pigs by Monday morning, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted experts as saying that the current
strain of disease might be coming from foreign countries like
Thailand, India or the Middle East where it was prevalent, because
the strain of disease had never occurred in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It had been established that the virus was present in kitchen
refuse, which is a major source of pigfood, bought from a ship
docking in the Durban harbor, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the South African government on Sunday ordered
port authorities at the country's major harbors not to allow any
kitchen refuse to enter the country.

established the performance capabilities of the next-generation
737 for potential service in China's developing Western region,
Boeing said.

Boeing quoted one of its flight test pilots, Leon Robert, as
saying that "the flights went very well." "These high-altitude
airports are surrounded by steep, mountainous terrain," Robert
said. "We've clearly shown that the next-generation 737 payload
capability can meet the anticipated demands as well as meet all
the CAAC regulatory requirements for operations at these airports.

Lhasa is located at 3,566 meters above sea level, and Bangda
which, at 4,328 meters above sea level, is the highest commercial
airport in the world. Boeing said that prior to the trip to China,
Robert flew the mission in an engineering flight simulator
equipped with the database and terrain visuals for the two
airports. This enabled the team to gather aerodynamic data to
predict how the airport would perform.
