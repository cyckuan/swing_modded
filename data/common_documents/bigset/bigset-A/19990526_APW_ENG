<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Charge Involving Fetus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A state appeals court Wednesday threw out  
the case against a woman accused of trying to drink her fetus to 
death, ruling that she could not be charged with attempted murder 
because a fetus is not a human being. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case closely watched by civil libertarians and people on  
both sides of the abortion debate, the 2nd District Court of 
Appeals ruled in favor of Deborah Zimmerman, whose daughter was 
born in 1996 with a blood-alcohol level of 0.199 percent, twice the 
level considered intoxicated under Wisconsin law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The term `human being' was not intended to refer to an unborn  
child and Deborah's prenatal conduct does not constitute attempted 
first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless 
injury,'' the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman was one week from her due date when she spent the  
day her daughter was born drinking at a bar, building a 
blood-alcohol level exceeding 0.30 percent at the time of birth. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hospital, Ms. Zimmerman allegedly told a nurse: ``I'm  
just going to go home and keep drinking and drink myself to death 
and I'm going to kill this thing because I don't want it anyways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors then said she had to undergo an emergency Caesarian  
because the baby's heart rate was weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman's baby was born limp and pallid. Ms. Zimmerman's  
lawyer, Sally Hoelzel, said the girl -- now 3 years old and living 
in foster care -- is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman has yet to stand trial. She took her case to the  
appeals court after a trial-level judge refused to dismiss the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman contended that her alcohol abuse during pregnancy  
was directed toward her own body and the fetus she carried -- not 
another human being. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities argued that Ms. Zimmerman should be prosecuted for  
attempted murder based on the state's ``born alive'' rule. The law 
says a person can be charged with murder if he or she harms a 
pregnant woman and her fetus is born alive and then dies. 
Prosecutors argued that the law should be extended to attempted 
murder if a fetus is born with injuries but survives. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruled Wednesday that that was not the  
Legislature's intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman has been in prison for violating her bail  
conditions in the case and is due for release in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman's attorneys and civil libertarians had argued that  
if the state succeeded, women would risk criminal charges if they 
did anything -- such as smoking or drinking -- that could harm a 
fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Heller, litigation director for the Center for  
Reproductive Law and Policy, which handled Ms. Zimmerman's defense, 
said there have been many rulings that a fetus is not a human 
being, including the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision 
legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, ruled that a viable  
fetus is a person under a statute punishing child abuse, he said. 
The court did not apply it to murder laws in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Lyons, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life,  
said the Wisconsin appeals court is ``behind the times'' because 
Wisconsin has passed laws to protect fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court had earlier passed the case along to the  
Wisconsin Supreme Court without ruling. But the case was sent back 
to the appeals court after the high court tied 3-3.

<HEADLINE> Blitz Looms for Healthy Margarines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --Two new margarines that can actually cut  
cholesterol and have no known side effects received a lukewarm 
response from the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The group recommends that consumers with moderate to high  
cholesterol use the margarines only in consultation with their 
doctor and along with a healthy diet. It said people with normal 
cholesterol levels would get no benefit from either Benecol, made 
by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, or Take Control, made by Lipton. Both spreads 
were approved this spring by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking a cautious conservative stance. We don''t want  
to be overzealous,'' said Robert Eckel, chairman of the 
association's nutrition committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A marketing fight between the two new cholesterol-lowering  
margarines starts today when Johnson &AMP; Johnson serves free bagels 
slathered with its spread Benecol to 200,000 morning commuters in 
10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's big giveaway was taking place in Chicago, San Francisco,  
Boston, Dallas, Atlanta, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Miami, Portland, 
Ore. and Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J also plans to leverage its experience selling drugs to  
doctors by having its 3,000 sales representatives pitch Benecol. In 
turn, J&AMP;J hopes the doctors will recommend it to patients with 
moderate to high cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	However, J&AMP;J has one big disadvantage in the marketing battle.  
The company, known most for selling baby powder, shampoo and 
Band-Aids, has little experience competing in the dairy food aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton's main business is marketing foods. It makes the popular  
margarine Promise, as well as other leading brands including Ragu 
pasta sauces and Wish-Bone salad dressings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton plans to kick off a national television advertising for  
Take Control in a few weeks, said spokesman David Blanchard. A 
celebrity, who Blanchard would not reveal, will be part of the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also plans to send information on Take Control to  
doctors via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But can consumers be convinced that the margarines are good for  
them? 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Vernon, president of J&AMP;J's McNeil Consumer Healthcare  
division, acknowledges the company will have to overcome skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no precedent for these two products as we have never  
seen a food that gives this significant a health benefit,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To help counter skeptics, J&AMP;J has recruited 100 people in each  
of three cities -- Cleveland, Charlotte and Portland -- to use 
Benecol for four weeks. They will have their cholesterol tested to 
measure the results. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, J&AMP;J will point doctors to a study published in the  
New England Journal of Medicine, which found patients using Benecol 
three times a day had their LDL or bad cholesterol reduced by as 
much as 14 percent. A separate study found Take Control cut bad 
cholesterol by 7 to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Eckel, of the AMA, is doubtful doctors will be  
enthusiastic about the products since they can already prescribe 
cholesterol-lowering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think doctors will doubt the value of a nutritional-related  
approach when they already have such powerful agents available,'' 
said Eckel. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckel said he doubts consumers will use enough of the spreads on  
a daily basis to get the significant cholesterol lowering results. 
Cholesterol-lowering drugs may be easier to use because patients 
only need to take them once a day, and such medicines typically can 
reduce cholesterol by more than 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton and J&AMP;J acknowledge that their spreads should be used in  
conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise program to help lower 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol's price, at $4.99 for a package of 21 servings. J&AMP;J  
recommends three servings a day. Take Control sells for $3.79 for a 
package of 16 servings or a 10 ounce tub. Lipton recommends two 
servings a day.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Air Plan Concerns US General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army's top general expressed uncertainty  
Wednesday over whether NATO's air campaign can succeed without 
ground forces -- a concern he said he made known in the weeks 
leading up to the bombing in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had adequate opportunity to make my views known and to raise  
all the issues I wanted to raise,'' Gen. Dennis Reimer said, 
referring to closed-door consultations among the Pentagon's top 
military and civilian officials leading up to NATO's decision in 
March to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Reimer, the Army chief of staff, said in a question-and-answer  
session with reporters that the air campaign has been ``highly 
effective'' so far. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``I had concerns about whether air power would do  
it by itself.'' He suggested that other members of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff also had harbored doubts but that some members ``felt that 
air (power) might do it'' alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Reimer's comments reflect a concern publicly expressed by many  
retired military officers that the NATO campaign would have been 
more effective had ground troops not been excluded from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing the Clinton administration's view, Defense Secretary  
William Cohen said Thursday that airstrikes were the appropriate 
choice for NATO and insisted the alliance would not compromise on 
its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The alliance decided to wage an air campaign to achieve our  
goals. It was the right decision then, and it is the right course 
of action now,'' Cohen told graduating midshipmen at the U.S. Naval 
Academy in Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``the face of  
evil,'' Cohen said NATO's strategy was sound -- ``one that would 
inflict serious and sustained damage on Milosevic's military 
machine while minimizing the risk to our pilots and to innocent 
civilians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic stands alone amidst the rubble and ruin of his  
failure,'' Cohen said. ``He is isolated from the world community. 
He has brought his economy to the brink of collapse, and he has 
consigned his troops to being hit harder with each passing day.'' 
Cohen made no allusion to how long the war might last. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told reporters  
that improved weather, combined with the recent arrival of more 
allied aircraft, means NATO can now sustain attacks against Serb 
targets in Kosovo 24 hours a day. That makes it harder for Serb 
troops to find sanctuary. ``And as he does move, it'll make it 
easier for us to find them and destroy them,'' Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reimer, who is due to retire next month, did not explicitly say  
he argued against the air-only approach approved by President 
Clinton. He stressed that the strategic decisions had to be made by 
consensus within NATO and that by March there was no alliance 
consensus to use a ground invasion force. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only option that was available to us at that point in  
time, to NATO, I think, was the airstrikes,'' Reimer said. ``At 
that point in time, people felt the airstrikes might be sufficient 
to do the job, and they still may be. It's a matter of how much 
time is required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Reimer's comments, Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon,  
said the general was expressing the unanimous view of the service 
chiefs that ``it was preferable to go ahead with an air campaign 
than to sit idly by'' as Serb military and police forces expelled 
ethnic Albanians from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Using ground troops was not an option because there was no NATO  
consensus for it -- then or now, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army's role in the Kosovo conflict so far has been limited  
to its much-publicized deployment of 24 Apache attack helicopters 
to neighboring Albania, where crews have trained for weeks but not 
seen combat. Reimer said he had expected the Apaches to have been 
used by now, but he believed they should remain in place in case 
they are needed either for combat or as part of a peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Reimer said the need for consensus within NATO meant the optimal  
military strategy could not be employed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view, in general terms, is that if you're going to use  
military force, using the total military force available to you is 
the right way to go,'' Reimer said. ``It works best if you have a 
good balance between'' air power and highly maneuverable ground 
forces, as the U.S. military trains to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine weeks into the bombing campaign, Reimer said it remains  
unclear whether Milosevic will give in and meet NATO's demands for 
removing Serb troops from Kosovo and allowing refugees to return 
under the protection of an international military force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know whether tomorrow he will,'' the four-star  
general said. ``The airstrikes have hurt him. I think it's hard not 
to make the case that when you get hit like that ... day and night, 
it makes you mad. ... I think it has been highly effective, the air 
campaign, in terms of not losing any airmen. Whether it actually 
will succeed in bringing him to his knees ... I just don't know 
yet, and that's the hard part about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reimer was asked his view of Britain's proposal for sending in a  
NATO ground force once Serb forces are battered into disarray, even 
without a peace agreement with Milosevic. The Clinton 
administration's position is that peacekeepers should enter Kosovo 
only if there is a peace deal or the Serb forces withdraw 
completely on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's obviously an option that ought to be, an option that  
could be looked at and assessed,'' Reimer said. ``I think it 
requires a great deal more analysis than maybe we've done at this 
particular point in time.''

<HEADLINE> Russia, Greece Want Bombing Stopped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Greece called anew for a pause in the  
relentless NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on Wednesday while Russia's 
senior mediator insisted the attacks be halted until there is a 
settlement in the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said a temporary  
suspension could promote diplomacy and eventual approval of a U.N. 
Security Council resolution on a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greece, being in the region and feeling the direct effects of  
what's going in the region, has put great emphasis in working on 
the diplomatic front and being helpful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Resisting, but also complimenting Greece for endorsing NATO's  
demands, including safe return of ethnic Albanian refugees, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the bombing would end 
only after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted them and 
started carrying out the demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Alluding to Greece's proposal, and other differences within the  
alliance, Albright said ``there are a variety of ideas'' among the 
diverse 19 NATO member nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer took up with  
Albright his government's strong objections to any consideration of 
sending NATO ground troops into the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But Albright said the allies remain determined that Milosevic  
meet NATO's demands for ending the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Russian mediator Viktor Chernomyrdin, the principal  
diplomatic channel to Belgrade, pleaded for an immediate end to 
NATO airstrikes, now in their third month, and said the escalation 
of attacks while negotiations were under way was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin met with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott  
and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari to explore an approach to 
Milosevic, who has resisted demands that he withdraw Serb troops 
and paramilitary units from Kosovo and accept NATO and other 
peacekeepers to protect refugees returning to their homes after a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is necessary to stop the airstrikes and negotiate, agree  
and at last come to a result,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. ``At least a temporary pause is 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as diplomacy escalated, so did the intensity of NATO's  
bombardment, and it could derail the diplomatic effort, the former 
prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	From his vacation quarters in Yulee, Fla., meanwhile, President  
Clinton telephoned Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy, who 
also is seeking a bombing pause. 
</P>
<P>
	They discussed ``various signs that the campaign is biting,''  
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. He told reporters he did 
not know whether Clinton tried to dissuade D'Alema or even talked 
to him about a bombing pause. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 19 NATO nations, Greece probably is the most skeptical  
that all-out bombing will bring Milosevic to his knees, reverse the 
Serb military offensive in Kosovo and clear the way for the return 
of ethnic Albanian refugees to the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	Papandreou, the Greek foreign minister, is promoting a 48-hour  
pause in the bombing to give Milosevic some calm to consider a 
response to NATO's demands. He has taken his search for a 
diplomatic solution to China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment among the Greek people is hugely against the NATO  
airstrikes, according to poll, so even the measured support the 
Athens government has given the Clinton administration is 
appreciated by American officials. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Greek forces do not participate in the attacks on  
Yugoslavia, Greek officials have denounced the Serbs' treatment of 
ethnic Albanian civilians. Except for Germany, Greece provides more 
aid per capita to refugees than any other European country. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Albright and other administration officials declined  
to verify reports that Milosevic faced indictment by an 
international war crimes tribunal or to say what impact that might 
have on the pursuit of a settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who has long advocated Milosevic's  
indictment, said it would be ``good news. It shows the war crimes 
tribunal means business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said ``there is an abundance of evidence of atrocities  
and mass murders'' in Kosovo that can be tied directly to 
Milosevic. ``Those crimes should not go unpunished,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Woman To Play on Male Soccer Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last year, Pete Petersen coached a team with players from 10  
countries covering four continents. So, he figures coaching a woman 
in a men's pro league can't be that much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll find out Friday when former U.S. national team forward  
Wendy Gebauer takes the field for his Raleigh Capital Express 
against the Boston Bulldogs in a second-division A-League match. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time a woman has played in a regular men's  
outdoor pro league game in the United States. A handful of women 
have played against men professionally indoors, including current 
U.S. national team midfielder Kristine Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional golfer Laura Davies made a 5-minute cameo  
appearance in 1997 for the Myrtle Beach SeaDawgs, a semi-pro team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Express, the United Soccer League -- which oversees the pro,  
semi-pro and amateur divisions below Major League Soccer -- and even 
Gebauer admit that Friday night's performance is little more than a 
marketing ploy, a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any unrealistic expectations, like I should be  
the one to win the game,'' said the 32-year-old Gebauer. ``It's 
just a sort of celebration of women's soccer with the World Cup 
coming here next month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen says he expects Gebauer, who played 26 times for the  
United States from 1987 to 1991, to start and play for about ``a 
half of a half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She could play more, but as the captain and regular forward for  
the Raleigh Wings, Gebauer is expected to play Wednesday night 
against the Brazilian women's national team in an exhibition match; 
Friday night's game and again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen realizes soccer has an obligation to promote, and  
considering his experience last season with the A-League's 
Jacksonville Cyclones, he's just going with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Nigeria and Ghana. My dad was a Presbyterian  
missionary,'' he said. ``Last year at Jacksonville, we had the 
United Nations. I've just come full circle, dealing with so many 
different people. It's just something we adapt to in soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having drawn about 300 fans a game last year, the Express, then  
called the Raleigh Flyers, was sold. This year they're attracting 
about 1,600 a game and expect to draw a capacity crowd of more than 
3,000 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we want to create some excitement,'' said Express  
general manager Dean Linke. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-7, 135 pounds, Gebauer has no illusions about muscling  
her way past a couple fullbacks and trying to score. She's played 
against men before, in pickup games and in scrimmages with the 
Wings against local club teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to adapt my game,'' she said. ``I'm not expecting to  
start dribbling and beat two or three defenders. I have to 
tactically read the game, which is my strength anyway, and combine 
it with my skill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen knows somebody must sit to give Gebauer the start.  
</P>
<P>
	``The guys haven't rebelled against it,'' he said. ``I haven't  
gotten any reaction really, except `Only in America.'''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Respond to China Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First it was Kosovo, then Littleton. Now, GOP  
presidential contenders are seizing on reports of Chinese espionage 
as a hot-button campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A round of potential Republican candidates pointed fingers at  
the Clinton administration Tuesday after a congressional panel 
reported that China had stolen classified information about every 
U.S. nuclear weapon for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Previous administrations must share in the blame, but this  
administration knew more and still chose not to take action,'' 
declared Elizabeth Dole. ``The Clinton-Gore administration needs to 
get a grip on the gravity of this crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., long a critic of President Clinton's  
China policy, said the report will prompt questions about why the 
administration did not do more to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it troubling that too little action was taken too late  
by this administration, resulting in the fact that the Chinese may 
have been able to build nuclear weapons comparable to ours,'' 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidates, who have touted remedies for  
school violence and criticized U.S. policy in Yugoslavia, quickly 
turned their attention to the sweeping three-volume report, which 
concluded it is ``exceptionally likely'' that Chinese spying 
continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is you had Kosovo, Littleton, and now you have China,  
which is quickly overcoming both of them,'' said McCain spokesman 
Howard Opinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush used the issue to offer his sharpest  
criticism yet of Clinton, saying the White House failed to take the 
reports seriously and was slow to react. ``I'd do something about 
it immediately,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledged that the problem has been going on for years,  
including the 12 years when his father was vice president and 
president. But he said he doesn't believe that gives Clinton an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that China has been stealing secrets during  
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton. But there is only one 
administration that has been given the news; only one 
administration knew, and that's the Clinton administration. The 
interesting question is, when did they know?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, who has made China policy a cornerstone of his  
campaign, accused the administration of failing in ``its most basic 
duty to protect our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for new American leadership, it is time for a new  
foreign policy, and it is time for new congressional hearings to 
investigate who is directly responsible -- politically and 
commercially -- for endangering America's national security,'' he 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said the administration had demonstrated  
``incompetence, ineptitude and insincerity on a scale never before 
witnessed in the history of U.S. defense,'' making a point to 
target not just Clinton but also Vice President Al Gore, who is 
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The espionage report sounds a clear warning, said Rep. John  
Kasich of Ohio. ``Only time will tell if we take heed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander has called for an independent, blue-ribbon  
commission to ``get to the bottom of the current China mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire is urging creation of a Senate  
select committee to investigate Chinese espionage. ``We will get to 
the bottom of this,'' he said. ``Nobody in this Senate worth his or 
her salt should have any objection to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also called for a congressional investigation into ``what  
went wrong and why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the balance of power is going to shift as a result of  
this,'' Bush said. ``I think it's going to accelerate China's 
emergence as a nuclear power. And the next president and presidents 
after that are going to have to deal with that.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Arrested Over Star Wars Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENOMONIE, Wis. (AP) -- Three men were arrested Wednesday for  
stealing a copy of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' 
from a theater last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men, one 25 and two 22, turned themselves in on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reel of film, which weighed more than 40 pounds, was taken  
off the projection system in the State Theater in Menomonie between 
the Friday and Saturday showings, theater owner Nick LeGros said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's value on the black market has been estimated to be  
more than $60,000. The theater has received a backup copy but 
LeGros said he lost about $4,000 by not having the movie Saturday 
</P>
<P>
	The film was not believed to have been copied.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our investigation revealed that they weren't in it for a  
profit motive,'' Police Chief Dennis Beety said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 5-foot length of the film was found crumpled and dirty in a  
field near the theater on Tuesday. The remainder of the film was 
recovered in three garbage bags, police said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Question Gov't Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. will question one  
of the government's final witnesses for its antitrust trial, a 
computer expert hired to cripple the Internet browser included 
within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton  
University, previously testified as one of the Justice Department's 
dozen witnesses. Microsoft expected to question him again under 
oath today at the federal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants Felten to take the stand again next month --  
during the trial's upcoming rebuttal phase -- to rebut earlier 
testimony from Microsoft executive James Allchin. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Monday after a 13-week break.  
</P>
<P>
	Felten's deposition was the first of three scheduled this week.  
The others will take place in North Carolina and California. 
Reporters are allowed to attend under an obscure 1913 law covering 
antitrust depositions, which are normally conducted in private. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, a senior vice president and a top Microsoft scientist,  
argued in court previously over the benefits of the company's 
decision to include its Web browser software within its dominant 
Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Felten, who studied the closely guarded technical blueprints  
for Windows in a court-ordered examination, believes there is no 
justification for the way Microsoft bundled its browser in Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally ``tied''  
consumer use of its browser to the use of Windows to undermine 
rival Netscape Communications Corp., whose Web software is 
Microsoft's biggest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten's testimony is important because Microsoft contends that  
Windows and its browser are so closely integrated to make it 
impossible to remove the Web software without crippling Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Felten showed the judge how he was able to modify some files  
to prevent Microsoft's Internet software from starting up in all 
but a few instances. Since Felten last testified, he's been 
improving his technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten's last deposition with Microsoft -- conducted in October  
without reporters in the room -- was painfully arduous, as reflected 
by 238 pages of recently released transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
	In one tedious exchange, Felten and Microsoft lawyer David  
Heiner argued whether ``Internet browser'' was technically 
synonymous with ``Web browser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when people use the term 'Internet browser,' they  
typically mean a Web browser, but that's not a term I myself like 
to use,'' said Felten. That provoked Heiner into showing him that 
the government itself called the software an ``Internet browser'' 
in its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Heiner pressed Felten whether he considers Windows also  
to be a type of Web browser -- which, on one level, is an argument 
over semantics -- the two argued until Justice Department lawyer 
Melvin Schwarz threatened to end the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are taxing my patience, and soon we will end the  
deposition if you can't move on,'' Schwarz said. ``I think you know 
exactly what his answer is. It's entirely argumentative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heiner didn't let up, and Schwarz accused him a few minutes  
later of harassing Felton. 
</P>
<P>
	``... And don't laugh, or we're out of here!'' Schwarz said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You are at risk of obstructing this deposition,'' Heiner  
answered a few minutes later. ``This is a very important deposition 
in this case, and it relates to matters as to which the Department 
of Justice has been obfuscating for nine months. We're going to 
need to spend some time on some of these questions.''

<HEADLINE> NASCAR To Open New Mechanics School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The governing body for stock car racing  
announced today it's expanding into the education business. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR is forming a partnership with Universal Technical  
Institute to build a school in the Charlotte area to train people 
to become automotive technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASCAR Technical Institute is to open in 2001 on a  
yet-to-be-determined site. Officials say the school should 
initially be able to accommodate 1,800 students. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR and UTI's long-term agreement calls for the establishment  
of multiple schools around the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Courses at NASCAR Technical Institute are to focus on training  
core skills needed to succeed as an automotive technician, with 
students also getting instruction on how to apply the information 
to a NASCAR-oriented environment. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR Tech should meet what Mike Helton, the sanctioning body's  
senior vice president, called a continuous need for qualified 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more supply you have, the bigger the pool is, the better  
off you are,'' Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being a partner in NASCAR Tech, UTI will offer  
six-week NASCAR electives to students at its six other campuses. 
The first class will be offered in spring 2000 at the UTI campus in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	FUND GROWS: There was an unusual contribution Wednesday to a  
fund set up by Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte for victims of a 
fatal spectator accident at the track earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Trab Crews, a driver in NASCAR's Goody's Dash Series, collected  
$750 during an open house held at his race team's shop in his 
hometown of Leoma, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $35,000 has been donated to the fund, set up after  
three spectators were killed and eight injured when hit by flying 
debris from a wreck at an Indy Racing League event on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the donations have come from other spectators who asked  
that their ticket refunds from the race be targeted for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we heard what had happened at Lowe's we felt we needed to  
do something, because when something like this happens it affects 
the entire community of racing,'' Crews said. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	FAVRE'S NEW VENTURE: Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre  
was on hand at the speedway Wednesday to announce his partnership 
with Winston Cup driver Dale Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are forming the Jarrett-Favre Driving Adventure, a  
business that will allow people to ride in or drive Winston Cup 
cars at North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Packages start at $75 for a three-lap passenger ride and go to  
$1,450 for four sessions as a driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture is to open in July.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BY THE NUMBERS: Bobby Labonte's Coca-Cola 600 pole-winning speed  
of 185.230 mph Wednesday night was an event record, surpassing the 
mark of 184.300 set by Jeff Gordon two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The track qualifying record is a 185.759, set by Ward Burton in  
October 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, winner of the previous five Coca-Cola 600 poles, was  
10th-fastest Wednesday with a 184.162. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon attributed his relatively slow speed to the fact that he  
was the fifth of 52 drivers to make qualifying runs in the 
early-evening session. The track generally produces higher speeds 
as dusk approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Charlotte you've got to draw a late number to qualify on  
the pole,'' Gordon said. ``This place gets faster as it gets darker 
and cools down.''

<HEADLINE> La. Candidate's Grandson Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASCADE LOCKS, Ore. (AP) -- Despite an impending runoff election  
that will decide whether he goes to Congress, former Louisiana Gov. 
Dave Treen says he will stay in Oregon until his missing grandson 
is found. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 people combed the steep, wooded trails and  
waterfalls in the Columbia Gorge on Tuesday, searching for 
20-year-old Jason Neville, who failed to return from a solo hike. 
The search was to resume this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen, 70, faces a runoff Saturday back in Louisiana against  
fellow Republican David Vitter to succeed former Rep. Bob 
Livingston. Treen canceled all campaign appearances Tuesday and 
flew to Oregon with his daughter Jennifer Neville, the missing 
hiker's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign is not on my mind at this point,'' Treen said  
Tuesday, standing near the trailhead where his grandson began his 
trip. ``There's nothing I would not do or give up to find Jason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treen and Vitter were the top two vote-getters in a May 1  
primary in which former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville, a student at Louisiana State University, had taken time  
off from college to work for AmeriCorps, the domestic equivalent of 
the Peace Corps, teaching poor children in Portland to read. 
</P>
<P>
	He set out alone Thursday evening on the Eagle Creek trail, one  
of Oregon's most popular hiking routes, near the river town of 
Cascade Locks, about 40 miles east of Portland. Officials said he 
wanted to be by himself in the wilderness when he turned 20 at 
midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst-case scenario is that he took a fall,'' said Stan  
Hinatsu, a Forest Service spokesman. ``The best-case scenario is 
that he's sitting on a trail somewhere, disoriented and not sure 
which way to go.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- O.J. Simpson was in no mood to skimp during a  
house-hunting excursion in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The former football star is scouting some of the area's finest  
real estate -- homes priced from $870,000 to $1.2 million, The Miami 
Herald reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson rejected a five-bedroom home because it didn't have  
enough baths to allow daughter Sydney, 13, and son Justin, 10, to 
have their own, the newspaper said. He also checked out a $995,000 
home in a gated community in the Coconut Grove neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted of murder in the 1994 slayings of former  
wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. Simpson 
was found liable in a civil trial and ordered to pay $33.5 million 
to the victims' families.

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raiser Huang To Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an arrangement kept quiet for months,  
Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang has been giving the Justice 
Department information about the bankrolling of the 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The department announced Tuesday that one of the central figures  
in the fund-raising scandal is prepared to plead guilty to 
conspiracy. In exchange for his cooperation, the Justice Department 
has agreed to seek a sentence of one year's probation for Huang, 
with a small fine and some community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said it has found no evidence that Huang engaged  
in economic espionage or other types of spying, an avenue explored 
by congressional investigators who thought he might be passing 
secrets to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, declined immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	An acquaintance of President Clinton for nearly 20 years, Huang  
was introduced to the then-Arkansas governor by James Riady of the 
billionaire business family from Indonesia for whom Huang worked. 
The Riadys have extensive business ties to China. 
</P>
<P>
	With a word from the president, Huang became the Democratic  
Party's chief fund-raiser among the Asian-American population in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats returned $2.8 million amid questions about the money's  
origin, including $1.6 million raised by Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang has been in the middle of some of the most controversial  
events surrounding the 1996 presidential election campaign, 
including a Buddhist temple fund-raising event attended by Vice 
President Al Gore, who said he was unaware it was to raise money. 
Buddhist monastics illegally funneled $65,000 to the Democratic 
Party through ``straw donors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans said Huang invoking his Fifth Amendment right  
against self-incrimination thwarted their efforts to determine what 
Clinton and his top aides knew about Huang's fund-raising 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	A legal source familiar with Huang's plea agreement said that he  
also has been cooperating with several independent counsels. 
</P>
<P>
	It was disclosed last year that he cooperated with Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr's probe of longtime Clinton friend Webster 
Hubbell, a former law partner of the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Another independent counsel is investigating allegations that  
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman engaged in influence peddling and 
solicited $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, an independent counsel is investigating whether  
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt lied to Congress about his role in 
rejecting a casino proposal from a group of Wisconsin Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Huang went to work at the Commerce Department in the  
Clinton administration, later becoming a party fund-raiser, he was 
the top U.S. executive of the Riadys' Lippo Group in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang will admit to defrauding the Federal Election Commission  
by causing Lippo employees to donate $7,500 that was reimbursed by 
the company's headquarters in Jakarta, Justice Department officials 
said. That money went to Los Angeles mayoral candidate Michael Woo 
and a committee raising funds for the California Democratic Party 
and Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
	A frequent White House visitor who met several times with  
Clinton, Huang becomes the third key figure to provide information 
to the campaign finance task force. The others are Yah Lin 
``Charlie'' Trie, a restaurateur in Little Rock, Ark., who entered 
a plea agreement last week, cutting off his trial on charges of 
obstructing the Senate's investigation of campaign finance abuses; 
and Taiwanese-American businessman Johnny Chung, sentenced to five 
years of probation in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE>  Queen Opens New Welsh Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARDIFF, Wales (AP) -- After nearly 600 years of union with  
England, Wales marked its first sniff of power Wednesday with the 
opening of a new assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the star attraction was Queen Elizabeth II, a symbol of the  
strong ties that still bind the principality to the rest of 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen -- accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, and her  
eldest son, Prince Charles, the prince of Wales -- was welcomed by 
thousands of people at each of the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds lined the streets shouting ``We want the queen,'' and  
small children shyly presented bouquets to the 73-year-old monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ceremony was short and simple, and the queen wore a  
bright pink dress suit instead of the robes and crown she wears to 
open the sessions of the House of Commons in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the eve of the millennium, this new assembly extends a  
bridge into the future,'' she told the 60-member assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a forum in which all the people of this ancient and  
noble land will in the years to come have both a resonant 
democratic voice and a clearer expression of Welsh society and 
culture,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local political leaders acknowledge that the 2.9 million Welsh  
are unconvinced of the benefits of Prime Minister Tony Blair's 
major constitutional shake up. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland has its first parliament in nearly 300 years and  
Northern Ireland a separate assembly under the 2-year-old Labor 
Party government's plan to dilute the political power of the 
British government, while preserving the union. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Wales, united with England since the 16th century and  
under the same monarch since the 1200s, the drive for autonomy 
never really caught on. 
</P>
<P>
	Only half the electorate voted in favor of the creation of an  
assembly in a September 1997 referendum, and fewer than half 
bothered to vote in May 6 elections to choose the members. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Scottish Parliament, the assembly has no powers to  
raise taxes or pass new laws. It will be responsible for 
distributing a $13 million grant from London and for making 
decisions that directly affect Wales. 
</P>

the queen arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people are at best agnostic about the value of the  
assembly,'' assembly leader Alun Michael said during the opening 
ceremony, conducted in Welsh and English. ``We must convince people 
by the way we conduct ourselves.''

billed as the biggest showing of Welsh talent ever; and a fireworks 
display.

<HEADLINE>  Queen Opens New Welsh Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARDIFF, Wales (AP) -- After nearly 600 years of union with  
England, Wales marked its first sniff of power Wednesday with the 
opening of a new assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the star attraction was Queen Elizabeth II, a symbol of the  
strong ties that still bind the principality to the rest of 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen -- accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, and her  
eldest son, Prince Charles, the prince of Wales -- was welcomed by 
thousands of people at each of the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds lined the streets shouting ``We want the queen,'' and  
small children shyly presented bouquets to the 73-year-old monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ceremony was short and simple, and the queen wore a  
bright pink dress suit instead of the robes and crown she wears to 
open the sessions of the House of Commons in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the eve of the millennium, this new assembly extends a  
bridge into the future,'' she told the 60-member assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a forum in which all the people of this ancient and  
noble land will in the years to come have both a resonant 
democratic voice and a clearer expression of Welsh society and 
culture,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local political leaders acknowledge that the 2.9 million Welsh  
are unconvinced of the benefits of Prime Minister Tony Blair's 
major constitutional shake up. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland has its first parliament in nearly 300 years and  
Northern Ireland a separate assembly under the 2-year-old Labor 
Party government's plan to dilute the political power of the 
British government, while preserving the union. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Wales, united with England since the 16th century and  
under the same monarch since the 1200s, the drive for autonomy 
never really caught on. 
</P>
<P>
	Only half the electorate voted in favor of the creation of an  
assembly in a September 1997 referendum, and fewer than half 
bothered to vote in May 6 elections to choose the members. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Scottish Parliament, the assembly has no powers to  
raise taxes or pass new laws. It will be responsible for 
distributing a $13 million grant from London and for making 
decisions that directly affect Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm not so excited about the assembly myself, but it is  
nice to see the queen in Cardiff,'' said Suzanne Payne, who waited 
with her 11-year-old daughter outside Llandaff Cathedral to watch 
the queen arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people are at best agnostic about the value of the  
assembly,'' assembly leader Alun Michael said during the opening 
ceremony, conducted in Welsh and English. ``We must convince people 
by the way we conduct ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles, speaking in Welsh, said Wales could now direct ``Welsh  
minds ... to Welsh matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The daylong celebrations were to conclude with an informal  
dinner, attended by the royals and Blair; a nighttime concert, 
billed as the biggest showing of Welsh talent ever; and a fireworks 
display.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Clinton Ratings Slipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public approval of President Clinton's job  
performance and of congressional Democrats has slipped from lofty 
levels reflected in surveys last winter, a poll released Wednesday 
suggests. Apprehension about the Kosovo conflict has risen. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's job approval in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll  
slipped from 60 percent earlier this month to 53 percent, the 
lowest rating he has had in that poll since August 1996. During the 
months of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment trial, his 
approval rating consistently stayed between 60 percent and 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the country would be better off if Republicans or  
Democrats controlled Congress, the public was split, with just over 
a third choosing Republicans and about the same number choosing 
Democrats. Democrats had a 41-30 edge in December's CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority, 57 percent, said they were very confident or  
somewhat confident in the president's ability to handle the Kosovo 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people who said they were very confident in his  
ability to handle the conflict slipped from 27 percent in late 
March to 17 percent in late May. And the number not at all 
confident in his ability to handle Kosovo grew from 13 percent to 
25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half said they oppose sending in ground troops if NATO  
airstrikes are not effective. In mid-April, a slim majority said 
they would favor sending in ground troops in that circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of five in the poll said they favored the United States  
and its NATO allies temporarily suspending the airstrikes and 
trying to resolve the conflict through negotiations. More than 70 
percent opposed stopping all military action and making no further 
efforts to help refugees return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,050 adults was taken Sunday and Monday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Base-Closing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today decisively rejected the  
Clinton administration's request to close more military bases as a 
cost-saving measure. It was the third year in a row Congress has 
blocked the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-to-40 Senate vote rejected a move by Sens. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., to authorize a new round of base 
closings in 2001 as part of an $288.8 billion defense spending bill 
for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be ashamed, or a little ashamed. Find me one  
military expert who says we don't have to close bases,'' said 
McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans continued to assert that President Clinton  
manipulated the last round of base closings for political purposes. 
But many Democrats opposed the proposal as well, including Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not seen the kind of savings that were promised,''  
said Sen. Barber Boxer, D-Calif. She said that in the last round, 
in 1995, ``California got hit so hard, I couldn't even begin to 
tell you. We still have bases sitting there that haven't been 
cleaned up and cannot be reused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing could not be worse'' for additional base closings,  
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. He said that, with 
the military already stetched thin by the conflict in Kosovo, it 
was no time to be closing down any military installations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the administration has argued that many of the bases  
are relics of the Cold War, and shutting them down could free up 
funds that could be used to modernize weapons and to meet other 
pressing Pentagon needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen contends that closing antiquated  
bases -- many of them Cold War relics -- could save the Pentagon 
nearly $4 billion a year that would be better spent on aircraft 
carriers, jet fighters and other crucial hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress has always been reluctant to close bases.  
Republicans contend that President Clinton meddled in the process 
to save jobs at bases in vote-rich California and Texas during his 
1996 re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposal for two new rounds of base  
closings -- one in 2001 and another in 2005 -- was rejected earlier 
this month by the Armed Services panel. McCain and Levin are 
seeking to win approval for just one round, in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., contended  
it was impossible to create a truly nonpartisan process for 
base-closings, particularly while Clinton remains in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a new president you want, there will be a new  
president,'' said McCain, a GOP 2000 presidential hopeful himself. 
He noted that, under his and Levin's proposal, an impartial 
commission for deciding which bases to close would not even be 
named until May 2001, well after the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate occurred as the Senate worked on a $288.8 billion  
defense spending bill for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Senate voted 52-47 to exonerate two American  
military commanders accused of dereliction of duty in the bombing 
of Pearl Harbor. That vote approved an effort by Sen. William Roth, 
R-Del., to restore the reputations of Adm. Husband Kimmel and Gen. 
Walter Short, the two senior commanders of U.S. military forces in 
the Pacific at the time of the December 1941 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would also give them posthumous promotions.  
</P>
<P>
	Roth said Kimmel and Short became the Pentagon's scapegoats for  
the surprise attack. ``They were held responsible for what happened 
in Pearl Harbor. And that is not fair. And that is not just,'' Roth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Warner, Navy secretary during the Nixon administration,  
strongly opposed the move, suggesting ``both commanders made errors 
in judgment'' and the reprimands should stand. 
</P>
<P>
	On base closings, the existing process calls for Congress to  
authorize a round of closings, then for the independent Base 
Realignment and Closure Commission to select the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans contend Clinton poisoned the process to save  
jobs at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif., and Kelly 
Air Force Base in San Antonio, both targets of a 1995 round. The 
administration denies doing anything illegal as it tried to find 
private-sector jobs for base workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three rounds -- in 1991, 1993 and 1995 -- closed 70 bases and  
depots, causing economic losses to local communities. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1059.

<HEADLINE> SEC Points Finger at Ex-IBM Worker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Targets of government probes of insider trading  
are increasingly the small-time trader hoping to score big on a hot 
illegal tip, a Securities and Exchange Commission official says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen a shift away from the Wall Street kingpins to Main  
Street America,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said as 
the government watchdog of the securities industry announced one of 
its biggest ever cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The case unveiled Wednesday differed from those of the late  
1980s and early 1990s, when top executives at Wall Street financial 
firms or publicly traded companies were accused of cashing in on 
secret information. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the tipper was a secretary for International Business  
Machines Corp., Lorraine K. Cassano, who told her husband, Robert, 
that the technology giant was about to acquire Lotus Development 
Corp. When the deal was announced, Lotus stock jumped nearly 90 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Before long, a circle of people ready to trade illegally in  
advance of the news had reached 25, including a teacher, a 
delicatessen owner and a doctor who was told of the tip when he 
went to the store for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours on June 2, 1995, the group of friends,  
acquaintances and colleagues had bought enough stock to earn a $1.3 
million profit, though the secretary and her husband only made 
$7,500, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Marcel Marcelino, district administrator of the Boston SEC  
office which handled the investigation, said the case was one of 
the largest ever in terms of number of people charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said IBM has since fired Mrs. Cassano, a North Salem,  
N.Y., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those charged in the case was a pizzeria owner, a bank  
vice president, a private school teacher, a grocery store owner, a 
lawyer, the president of a direct-mail marketing company, a doctor, 
an engineer and several stockbrokers. Of those charged, 13 live in 
Staten Island, N.Y., and six live in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In its court papers, the SEC asked the court to order the  
defendants to obey all securities laws, return any illegally 
obtained profits and be fined civil penalties up to three times 
their ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano's husband, Robert, pleaded guilty to  
insider trading on Jan. 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cassanos could not immediately be reached for comment on the  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the defendants tried to conceal their trades or the  
illicit nature of their trading activity by lying under oath about 
the reasons for their trades and falsely denying they knew the 
others in the group, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have pleaded guilty in the case thus far include  
lawyer Carmine DeSantis of Staten Island, salesman Michael Paul 
Green of Edison, N.J., computer technician P. Gerard Mazzone of 
Staten Island, delicatessen owner Peter G. Mazzone of Staten 
Island, computer technician Joseph Petrosino of Brooklyn, N.Y., and 
Dr. Gary Spierer of Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSantis pleaded to conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice,  
Green to obstruction of justice, both Mazzones to insider trading 
and perjury, Petrosino to perjury and Spierer to obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said both Cassanos as well as Green and Spierer have  
already settled the SEC civil charges, agreeing to obey securities 
laws and to pay back profits.

<HEADLINE> Ex-La. Gov.'s Grandson Found Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASCADE LOCKS, Ore. (AP) -- The missing grandson of former  
Louisiana Gov. Dave Treen was found in good shape Wednesday by a 
news helicopter that spotted him flashing metal camping pans as it 
passed over the rugged Columbia Gorge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the highest moments of my life -- better than  
being elected,'' said Treen, who left a tight congressional race 
Tuesday to join the search for his grandson, Jason Neville. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville, a novice hiker who set out alone last Thursday to  
celebrate his 20th birthday, got lost amid the honeycomb of trails 
through the steep ridges and cliffs along the Columbia River about 
40 miles east of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	When he didn't return Saturday to be picked up by his friends,  
they notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen's campaign manager in Louisiana, Jay Zainey, said he did  
not know whether Treen would return to New Orleans in time for a 
scheduled debate Thursday. Treen, 70, faces a runoff Saturday 
against fellow Republican David Vitter to succeed former Rep. Bob 
Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville flashed the camping pans above his head in the late  
morning sunshine to signal the KOIN-TV news helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	He was reunited with his family about four hours after being  
spotted on a steep, dusty clearing about four miles from the trail 
he set out on. 
</P>
<P>
	He was lifted out by a National Guard Blackhawk helicopter.  
Previous attempts by the news crew to rescue Neville were aborted 
because of rugged conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville, a student at Louisiana State University, lives in  
Portland and works for AmeriCorps, the domestic equivalent of the 
Peace Corps. He had taken time off from college to teach poor 
children in Portland to read.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Gov.'s Private Life in News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Gov. Kirk Fordice is staying out of sight  
these days, which is a good thing for him: Reporters keep pestering 
him with questions, questions, questions about why he bought an 
elegant house in the suburbs and didn't invite his wife of 44 years 
to live there. 
</P>
<P>
	The gossip mill is running full steam in country barbershops and  
on newspaper editorial pages. Fordice's aides haven't been this 
uptight since 1996 -- when the governor crashed a state-owned car 
after having lunch and holding hands with a woman while 
Mississippi's first lady was in France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent 52 years covering the state,'' said journalist Bill  
Minor. ``This has been the oddest thing I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice, a two-term Republican who has criticized President  
Clinton's marital infidelity and courted the religious right, has 
said his private life is just that. He has refused to talk about 
the crash or this latest embarrassment, which came to light in TV 
reports late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He canceled public appearances in the state and was noticeably  
quiet during this month's special session of the Mississippi 
Senate. He hasn't had a news conference in the past month. This 
week, he's in Europe on a trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
	His press secretary, Robbie Wilbur, denied Wednesday that the  
governor has altered his schedule to avoid questions about the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	As for first lady Pat Fordice, she has said little other than  
that she has never been to the governor's brick house with big 
columns on Golden Pond. The $230,000 house has lace curtains and a 
pair of rocking chairs on the porch. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say Fordice spends his weekends there, but they refuse  
to talk about other occupants. Fordice and the first lady both live 
in the official governor's mansion during the week. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Fordice announced that he and his wife were having  
marital troubles and hinted at a pending divorce. A day later, Mrs. 
Fordice issued a statement saying she would have to be forced out 
of the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Mrs. Fordice again said she did not want a divorce,  
even though she knew her husband's new home ``wasn't for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice, 65, leaves office in about six months because of term  
limits and has said he has no further political plans. 
</P>
<P>
	He got used to ducking controversy in 1996, when he got into a  
car accident after being seen having lunch with a woman near 
Memphis. A waiter recalled serving wine to the governor and his 
female companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Passers-by pulled Fordice from his car after it careened off  
Interstate 55, tumbled down a ravine and caught fire. Fordice was 
hospitalized for three weeks with a bruised heart and lung, 
fractured vertebrae, several broken ribs and a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice has said he does not remember why he was in Memphis that  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	His defenders draw a distinction between the governor and the  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice ``doesn't lie about it. He just doesn't talk about it.  
There's a big difference,'' said Bill Canon, a Republican state 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Wiseman, a political science professor at Mississippi  
State University, said Fordice's supporters don't want to know the 
whole story. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still has a tremendous amount of support out there. That  
kind of support, whether it's about Gov. Fordice or a favorite 
football coach, resents any further prying,'' Wiseman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several newspaper editorials have said the governor's private  
life should be kept out of the media. Even so, it's been the 
subject of letters like the one Mary Pearson wrote to The 
Clarion-Ledger in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not deserve a class lady like Pat Fordice,'' she  
wrote. ``He struts around like a rooster with a handful of Viagra. 
He does not realize that the day you are elected to public office, 
your private life ends.''

<HEADLINE>  Appleby To Defend Kemper Golf Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Stuart Appleby knows the galleries will be  
pulling for him at the Kemper Open -- the last tournament his wife 
saw him win before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my choice to be the sentimental favorite,'' he said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renay Appleby was crushed by a car last year while unloading  
luggage at a London train station after the British Open, six weeks 
after Kemper. 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby credits his wife's inspiration for subsequent victories  
at the Coolum Classic in Australia in December and the Houston Open 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to think there are people out there supporting me,  
maybe more than someone else,'' he said. ``That's their choice. I'd 
rather be someone who they like and they're all happy to see win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby will not be the only favorite when the field tees off  
Thursday at the tree-lined TPC at Avenel course. There is also Fred 
Funk, who was born in nearby Takoma Park and coached at the 
University of Maryland from 1982-88. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Kemper, Appleby and Funk walked together down the  
18th fairway in the final group. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first time Funk lost a tournament he led going into  
the final round. He shot a 77 to tie for third, missing by far his 
best chance to win one of the biggest events on his schedule.

<HEADLINE>  Appleby To Defend Kemper Golf Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Stuart Appleby knows the galleries will be  
pulling for him at the Kemper Open -- the last tournament his wife 
saw him win before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my choice to be the sentimental favorite,'' he said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renay Appleby was crushed by a car last year while unloading  
luggage at a London train station after the British Open, six weeks 
after Kemper. 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby credits his wife's inspiration for subsequent victories  
at the Coolum Classic in Australia in December and the Houston Open 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to think there are people out there supporting me,  
maybe more than someone else,'' he said. ``That's their choice. I'd 
rather be someone who they like and they're all happy to see win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby will not be the only favorite when the field tees off  
Thursday at the tree-lined TPC at Avenel course. There is also Fred 
Funk, who was born in nearby Takoma Park and coached at the 
University of Maryland from 1982-88. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Kemper, Appleby and Funk walked together down the  
18th fairway in the final group. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first time Funk lost a tournament he led going into  
the final round. He shot a 77 to tie for third, missing by far his 
best chance to win one of the biggest events on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I replayed for months what happened to me on Sunday,'' Funk  
said. ``I wanted this tournament too much. I put a lot of pressure 
on myself. Two days after that, I didn't sleep for three days. 
Since then, I have had trouble on weekends.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia May Delay Space Station Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Because of Russia's chronic money  
crunch, space shuttle Discovery's flight could end up being the 
only trip to the new international space station this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was set to blast off Thursday morning on a 10-day  
mission with more than 4,300 pounds of spare parts, cranes, tools, 
laptop computers and clothes to be used by the first permanent 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, an unmanned Russian rocket is scheduled to launch  
the next piece of the space station, a service module containing 
life-support systems. Then, NASA's space shuttle Atlantis is 
supposed to follow in December with more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, everything is on hold until the Russian component --  
already more than 1 1/2 years behind -- is in orbit. And many question 
whether the Russians can finish building and testing it by 
November, given the country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it does fly in November, maybe it shouldn't,'' said James  
Oberg, an independent consultant on Russian space affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Oberg pointed to problems with the Russian-built component that  
was launched last fall. Its batteries are not charging properly; 
Discovery's crew will replace 18 electrical meters to try to solve 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The failures that have occurred, the problems with the battery  
charge, are inexcusable,'' Oberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA and the Russian Space Agency already are debating what to  
do if something goes wrong and the service module, once launched, 
cannot dock with the two station pieces already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency mission would have to be launched, probably within  
three weeks, said Tommy Holloway, space station program manager. 
The big question is: Who would go? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a subject that we're working with the Russians today,  
and tomorrow, and probably the day after tomorrow,'' Holloway said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holloway's predecessor, Randy Brinkley, said before leaving NASA  
a month ago that he and others should have paid more attention to 
political and economic events in Russia and never allowed the 
Russians to supply a critical component so early in assembly. That 
way, he said, any Russian delays would not have disrupted 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the best of circumstances, NASA figures it will take five  
years -- and some 40 U.S. and Russian launches -- to complete the 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	On this mission, Discovery's seven astronauts will not only  
unload supplies, they will also fix broken U.S. and Russian 
equipment and install mufflers to reduce the noise caused by 
clattering Russian-made fans. Two of them will also take a 
spacewalk to attach one crane and parts of another to the outside 
of the station.

<HEADLINE> Miami Residents Ignore Stabbed Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A stabbed and bleeding woman staggered from door to  
door, pleading for help, but nobody responded to her screams and 
she collapsed dead in a driveway, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only imagine the fear and anxiety that she  
experienced, knowing that she was bleeding and dying and the 
frustration that she must have felt in trying to find someone to 
help her,'' police spokesman Lt. Bill Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portia Lee, a 30-year-old mother of six, twice climbed a fence  
as she sought help Monday night in Miami's Little Haiti 
neighborhood. A man who saw her running down a street finally 
called 911, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible people heard her and didn't want to help. Maybe  
they were scared or didn't want to get involved,'' said homicide 
Detective Confesor Gonzalez. ``With the technology they have these 
days, it's always a possibility that she would have lived. Maybe 
not. Still, it's a little sad that no one helped her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who stabbed Ms. Lee and why. No immediate arrests  
wre made. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police that a woman resembling Ms. Lee was  
involved in a violent confrontation 15 to 30 minutes before she was 
seen running down the street. A man was seen chasing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Thomas, who lives in the neighborhood, said she didn't  
hear Ms. Lee's cries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry, I feel sad,'' she said. ``I don't think people  
heard her and ignored it, not around here.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes To Extend Coach's Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Paul Maurice will be rewarded with at least  
a three-year contract extension after leading the Carolina 
Hurricanes' franchise to the NHL playoffs for the first time since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the multi-year contract will be finalized by general  
manager Jim Rutherford and Maurice within the next few weeks, team 
spokesman Chris Brown said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice, 32, is the youngest head coach in the NHL, but ranks  
third in tenure with the same club. At $300,000 a season, he is 
also one of the lowest paid coaches in the league. However, the new 
contract is expected to pay him around $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be any negotiations,'' said Maurice, who has no  
agent. ``I'll be more than happy to sign it. I've been here a long 
time and there are other considerations other than trying to get as 
much money as you possibly can. This is an opportunity to work with 
some great people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice, 128-143-45 in four seasons, likely would have been  
fired had the Hurricanes not made the playoffs for the first time 
since the early '90s, when the team played in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maurice and his coaching staff implemented a new trapping  
system in 1998-99 that allowed the team to capture the Southeast 
Division with a 34-30-18 record. The team was in first place for 
175 days out of the 192-day schedule and Carolina's 86 points was 
the second highest in the 20 years of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has always been some sort of potential for failure,''  
said Maurice, referring to the team's move to North Carolina and 
subsequent 160-mile round trip to Greensboro for home games for two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody said I was going to get fired all the time. That was  
the easy part. I've done a good job of blocking that out and 
learning how to handle it to the point that I don't think about it 
either way now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice has been a part of owner Peter Karmanos' Compuware  
hockey organization for 14 years, joining the then-Hartford Whalers 
as an assistant coach in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never met anybody who can put his finger on a problem as  
quick as he can, and he fixes it as quick as he can,'' Rutherford 
said of Maurice. ``He's not vocal about it, he doesn't rant and 
rave about it, he doesn't do it through the media, but he does it 
through the appropriate character players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford said Maurice was able to hold the team together  
through some serious injury problems, especially on defense late in 
the regular season and through a 4-2 series loss to Boston in the 
opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The three teams that went through the injuries we went  
through, they got buried. We didn't,'' Rutherford said. ``I think 
that is a real credit to him. He's earned the right to coach this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Maurice's failures this past season was a power-play unit  
that scored 11 percent of the time -- last in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't hold the power play failures against the coach. I  
can't do that,'' Rutherford said. ``It's a matter of we feel the 
players out there should have gotten it done.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit P.D. Has Squares To Spare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- There's plenty of TP for the P.D.  
</P>
<P>
	An alleged toilet paper shortage at Detroit police stations  
prompted a radio station to donate rolls on Wednesday, but city 
officials say there's no need. There are squares to spare. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're somebody in need at a particular time, and you're  
sitting there, it's an emergency to you, but we just have not been 
able to detect that there hasn't been toilet paper,'' said Greg 
Bowens, spokesman for Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council Member Key Everett said Tuesday the situation is an  
example of a supply problem throughout city departments caused by 
Detroit's new computer system. Bowens said that was news to him. 
</P>
<P>
	As word of the shortage spread Wednesday, officers in one  
precinct called a radio station in search of donations and received 
420 rolls. The precinct never called building maintenance first to 
request toilet paper, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Roslyn Beard said: ``I've been carrying my own since I was  
a little girl ... My mama taught me that.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Give $175B to Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans opened their pocketbooks wider in  
1998, donating nearly $17 billion more to charities than the 
previous year, according to a new report on charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy, low inflation, a growth in personal wealth and  
more sophisticated fund raising helped fuel the 10.7 percent 
increase and raise overall charitable giving to $174.52 billion, 
said Ann E. Kaplan, research director for the American Association 
of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
	When adjusted for inflation, the increase was 9 percent, she  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals donated the bulk of the money, giving $134.84  
billion in 1998, an increase of 9.7 percent. Foundations gave the 
next highest amount with $17.09 billion, up 22.9 percent; bequests 
accounted for $13.62 billion, a 7.8 percent increase, and 
corporations gave $8.97 billion, up 9.3 percent, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third year in a row charitable giving increased  
dramatically -- it rose 11.8 percent in 1996 and 13.7 percent in 
1997 -- with religious organizations and denominations continuing to 
get the biggest piece of the pie. They took in $76.06 billion, a 
4.6 percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the increase may seem small at a time when more people  
say they are attending religious services, Kaplan noted that those 
who give to religious charities are also giving more to other 
charities. ``They are not abandoning religious contributions,'' she 
said. ``If anything, they appear to be broadening their charitable 
horizons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics for the ``Giving USA 1998'' report come from  
deductions listed on tax returns as well as reports submitted by 
more than 3,000 charities. Figures will be adjusted when late 
filing taxes are due later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributions in four nonprofit areas rose more than 20 percent.  
Civil rights and public affairs groups had the biggest increase, 
jumping 29.5 percent to $10.86 billion. Wildlife and environmental 
organizations took in $5.25 billion, up 28.3 percent; human service 
organizations got $16.08 billion, up 27 percent; and health 
organizations, including hospitals and major disease-related 
organizations, received $16.89 billion, up 20.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving to education, mostly to university capital campaigns, was  
up 10.8 percent to $24.56 billion and contributions to 
international affairs rose 9.3 percent to $2.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifts to foundations rose from $14.56 billion in 1997 to $16.94  
billion in 1998 and Kaplan said they may rise even further when 
other tax data is analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	The only decline was in the arts and cultures category, which  
dropped slightly by 0.8 percent. Kaplan said small, community-based 
arts programs and large institutions reported getting increases of 
6 percent from 1997 to 1998 but mid-sized organizations have had 
trouble fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these groups have been around less than 10 years and  
don't have well organized fund-raising efforts,'' Kaplan said.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Akosua Busia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Spend just a few moments chatting with  
actress Akosua Busia, and it's enough to chase away the image of 
the tragic African torture victim she played this season on ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the message on her telephone answering machine is buoyant.  
</P>
<P>
	``Faith is not a jump in the dark, but a walk into the light,''  
says Busia's lilting voice, a combination of her native Ghana and 
the trio of countries (England, Switzerland and Mexico) where she 
was educated. 
</P>
<P>
	In conversation, she leans toward the wry. Asked if publicity  
about her royal roots is accurate, Busia replied: ``I'm a princess 
of a small island just on the outskirts of Scotland.'' OK, it's a 
joke, she admits. Her late father, Kofi Abrefa Busia, was an 
Ashanti chief and a prime minister of Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	If Busia is enjoying life, it's easy to see why.  
</P>
<P>
	Her first film was a cushy gig with Michael Caine. She gained  
the role of Nettie in ``The Color Purple'' not long after braving 
Hollywood. Her acting career was interrupted, but for a very good 
reason: to give more attention to her infant daughter, now 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Busia did manage to combine professional creativity with  
motherhood. She is working on the screenplay adaptation of her 
novel -- about a man's quest for love and belonging -- and is 
completing her second book. She also contributed to the screenplay 
for the film version of Toni Morrison's ``Beloved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Busia's appearance on ``ER'' marked her return to acting, just a  
bit shy of her self-imposed two-year moratorium. She was attracted 
by the script about a Nigerian husband and wife who were victims of 
political oppression. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to appear opposite the handsome Djimon Hounsou  
(``Amistad'') also was a draw, Busia admitted with a laugh. ``He's 
a wonderful man. A wonderful actor, too,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Does being a princess have cachet in America?  
</P>
<P>
	Busia: It means nothing. It doesn't even mean a good table at a  
restaurant. And I'm really upset about that (laughs). 
</P>
<P>
	2. How did you decide to become an actor?  
</P>
<P>
	Busia: I really got into acting by accident. My father was the  
first black man in history to go to University College, Oxford. All 
my brothers and sisters went there. I was visiting and heard they 
were doing 'Romeo and Juliet' in the playhouse at Oxford. I was 
doing it at the time for my O-level exam (equivalent to junior high 
school), and I auditioned for it because I thought it was a great 
play. They cast me as Juliet. I had a great time, and then I found 
out people got paid. I could not believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You left the Central School of Speech and Drama in London  
early to do your first film. What was it? 
</P>
<P>
	Busia: 'Ashanti.' Do not rush out and rent it. But I had a  
fabulous time making it. It was the most lavish film to date that 
I've done, so I got a horribly false impression of producers. It 
was with Michael Caine, who was wonderful, and was shot in Kenya 
and Israel. They shot for three months and I worked for nine days. 
Never to be repeated in the history of my career. 
</P>
<P>
	4. What brought you to the United States?  
</P>
<P>
	Busia: I came to America on a whim. I had done a miniseries in  
England and was offered another that was much the same. I said, 
'No, I'm going to America to make a Spielberg movie.' I'd like to 
say it was premonition, but that would be a lie. It was just a 
symbol of Americanism. ... Two months later, I got the role of 
Nettie in 'The Color Purple.' My English agent was saying, 'I can't 
believe it.' 
</P>
<P>
	5. What are you working on post-''ER''?  
</P>
<P>
	Busia: I am so late on my screenplay and novel I can't even  
describe how much I need to sit myself at a computer. My first 
novel was 'The Seasons of Beentoo Blackbird' -- 'beentoo' is a 
phrase used in Ghana for a person who's been around the world: been 
to Paris, been to London. 
</P>
<P>
	5 1/2. Do you consider yourself primarily an actress or a writer?  
</P>
<P>
	Busia: It took me a long time to say I was a writer. Calling  
oneself an actress is nothing, but calling oneself a writer ... 
After my first book came out and got comments and attention, my 
sister said, 'Finally, you can call yourself a writer.'

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chiquita Lawyer To Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former Chiquita attorney will stand trial on  
charges he gave the banana company's voice-mail codes to a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ann Marie Tracey cleared the way for the trial Tuesday  
when she refused a request by George Ventura to dismiss five of the 
10 felony charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, now an attorney in Salt Lake City, is accused of  
providing the secret codes that allowed a reporter for The 
Cincinnati Enquirer to gain access to the voice-mail system of the 
Cincinnati-based Chiquita Brands International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's attorneys had argued that five charges of intercepting  
or procuring another to intercept a wire communication did not 
match the crimes he is alleged to have committed. But the judge 
concluded that the law's definition of ``interception'' also would 
apply to illegally accessing a voice-mail system. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also faces five counts of unauthorized access to  
computer systems. He is scheduled for trial July 6, and could be 
sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ventura provided the codes to reporter Michael  
Gallagher, who quoted the voice mails in articles he wrote for the 
Enquirer last year about Chiquita's business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper later renounced the series, fired Gallagher and  
paid Chiquita more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher faces sentencing that could range from 2 1/2 years in  
prison to probation.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Pitcher on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays placed  
pitcher Rolando Arrojo on the 15-day disabled list today with right 
shoulder inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrojo has struggled, going 2-5 with an 7.31 ERA in nine starts.  
The 1998 American League rookie of the year runnerup reported 
weakness in his shoulder after his last start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had an MRI (Wednesday), which actually turned out to be  
very good. I think it looks more on the positive side that he'll 
come back in two weeks and pitch, ``Tampa Bay manager Larry 
Rothschild said prior to Wednesday night's game against Texas. 
``There is some inflammation, probably not that much out of the 
ordinary for a pitcher in the major leagues. We need to get it 
quieted down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrojo became the team's 13th player on the DL this year.  
</P>
<P>
	He will likely make at least one minor league rehab start before  
rejoining the team. He is eligible to come off the disabled list on 
June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Rekar will take Arrojo's spot in the rotation. The  
right-hander has made 11 appearances, including three starts, in 
posting a 3-1 record with a 4.76 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays recalled pitcher Mike Duvall from Triple-A Durham  
to fill Arrojo's roster spot. The left-hander appeared in nine 
games (0-0, 3.18 ERA) with Tampa Bay before being optioned to 
Durham on April 23.

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Campaign Finance Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defying the GOP leadership, five House  
Republicans on Wednesday threw their support behind a 
Democratic-led push to force campaign finance legislation to a vote 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to act on campaign finance reform now, not tomorrow,''  
Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., said at a news conference where he and 
others dismissed as inadequate Speaker Dennis Hastert's offer of 
floor action in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would ban ``soft money,'' the large, unregulated  
donations that the parties and some politicians seek to fund their 
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would limit so-called ``issue ads,'' which are governed  
more loosely than other commercials because they do not directly 
advocate a candidate's election or defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leadership aides expressed cautious confidence they  
could defeat the drive for accelerated vote on the measure. In an 
announcement that appeared designed to slow momentum for an 
accelerated vote, one committee announced plans for hearings on 
campaign finance proposals in early June. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a prerogative of the majority to establish a calendar for  
legislation, and a decision to side with Democrats on so 
fundamental an issue could have repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you put yourself on a leadership track,'' Shays  
said at one point when asked about possible retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him in signing were Reps. Mike Castle of Delaware, Greg  
Ganske of Iowa, Michael Forbes of New York and Connie Morella of 
Maryland. Their signatures brought to 201 the number of names on a 
parliamentary device -- known as a ``discharge petition'' -- that 
would force the measure to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes 218 signatures to succeed, and comments by other  
Republican supporters of campaign finance legislation underscored 
their reluctance to follow the lead set by Shays and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, said she had not decided  
whether to sign. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who has clashed with 
party leaders often on the issue, said, ``for now, I'm 
uncommitted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Shays and Ganske both made direct  
references to the impact of contributions on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganske said he had ``seen the power of soft money on influencing  
political decisions.'' Pressed for specifics, he said ``the way the 
HMO debate worked out last year,'' when the insurance industry 
successfully opposed Democratic-drafted legislation to strengthen 
the rights of patients in dealing with their HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays said, ``sadly, members of Congress are purchasing  
influence over their colleagues'' by creation of one particular 
type of political action committee and then ``accepting unlimited 
amounts of soft money'' for it. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a reference to leadership PACs, which are allowed to  
accept soft money donations, and then make donations to the 
campaigns of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans oppose the legislation, citing both  
constitutional and political grounds. They say restricting 
contributions is a violation of the free speech guarantee of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	They also express concern that without soft money donations,  
Republicans would be at a disadvantage compared with Democrats, who 
receive substantial support from labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the campaign legislation is virtually certain to pass  
the House once it comes to a vote. Shays and others want it passed 
as quickly as possible because a Republican-led filibuster is a 
strong possibility in the Senate. There is no date for the Senate 
to consider its version of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation was passed in the House last year, but only  
after a monumental struggle. Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to 
keep the issue from the floor, but ultimately capitulated when it 
became apparent that enough Republicans would join with Democrats 
and bring the measure to a vote over his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Roukema and Wamp helped arrange a meeting with Hastert recently  
at which members of the rank-and-file urged him to allow a debate 
and vote by July. 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after Shays and the others signed the petition, she  
said she wasn't ready to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conditions were very different when Gingrich was here,'' she  
said. ``There was no alternative and he was absolutely adamant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering unfolded in the House as two Oregon lawmakers,  
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Rep. Greg Walden, proposed 
legislation requiring candidates to appear in their TV attack ads 
or pay 35 percent more for future ads.

<HEADLINE> Different Plans for Fenway Emerge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- State House Speaker Thomas Finneran hosted a group  
of preservationists today who want to save Fenway Park, while 
baseball commissioner Bud Selig came to town and pushed for a new 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, speaking at a press conference before meeting with  
members of a Red Sox fan club, said renovation was not a practical 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renovation has not worked anywhere. It can't work,'' he said,  
adding that he liked the team's plan. ``They've done what you try 
to do in baseball. You preserve the history and tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The preservationists said Finneran gave them a sympathetic ear.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was open to seeing our plan and hearing more about it,''  
said Albert Rex, a member of the board of directors of Save Fenway 
Park! ``He left us with the sense that there would be a public 
dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finneran said he had no preference yet as to whether Fenway Park  
should be renovated or a new stadium built. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent is to be pro-active, not reactive,'' he said.  
``We're open and receptive to any fair proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Save Fenway Park! has an architect, Charles P. Hagenah, who has  
drawn up plans to renovate the existing facility by adding seats, 
luxury boxes and concession areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Save Fenway Park! representatives met with  
John Harrington, the team's chief executive officer. But Red Sox 
officials have said they don't think saving the park is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	Save Fenway Park! says its plan would increase the number of  
seats to 44,000, about the same as the new stadium proposed by the 
team. The preservationist group would also build 73 luxury suites, 
compared to 100 for the team's proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing park, opened in 1912, has just 33,000 seats. The  
team believes its new park will fit into the neighborhood and 
maintain the essence of the current park. It will also turn 
portions of the old field -- including the Green Monster left-field 
wall -- into a public park.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Neagle Out 4-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Surgery was ruled out Wednesday for Cincinnati  
Reds starter Denny Neagle, who's on the disabled list for the 
second time this season with weakness in the back of his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews examined Neagle in Birmingham, Ala., on  
Wednesday and concurred with seven other doctors that a 
strengthening program is needed, not an operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle will be out for four to six weeks as he rebuilds his  
shoulder, general manager Jim Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Andrews agreed completely with the other doctors'  
opinions,'' Bowden said. ``We hope that after the All-Star break 
he'll be ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle will remain in Birmingham for a couple of days to begin a  
strengthening program. He'll work on building up the muscles for 
two or three weeks and then resume throwing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got Neagle from Atlanta last November in a five-player  
deal that sent Bret Boone to the Braves. Neagle had won at least 16 
games in each of the past three seasons and was expected to become 
the Reds' top starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he pulled thigh muscles during the first full-squad  
workout and weakness was detected in the back of his left shoulder 
during routine testing. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on a strengthening program, opened the season on the  
disabled list and was activated April 21. He struggled in six 
starts with the Reds, going 0-3 with an 8.17 earned run average. 
Opponents hit .340 off him. 
</P>
<P>
	Magnetic resonance imaging tests found no problem with the  
shoulder other than the weakness.

<HEADLINE> Studies Suggest New AIDS Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two new studies found that years after powerful drugs have  
virtually eliminated the AIDS virus from the bloodstream and forced 
it into hiding in the body, it can continue to infect new cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding underscores just how difficult it may be to cure  
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have shown that the AIDS virus hides in certain  
places in the body, including certain immune cells and organs such 
as the brain, testicles and eyes that are not easily penetrated by 
drugs. But doctors hoped that continued use of AIDS drugs would 
keep the virus in a dormant state and eventually kill off all 
traces of the infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine show  
that HIV continues to infect new cells despite the use of AIDS 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	One study, led by Manohar Furtado of Northwestern University  
Medical School, also found that new cells were being infected 
almost as fast as the drugs were killing infected cells, suggesting 
that HIV will never completely disappear with current treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our results suggest that this reservoir represents a serious  
impediment to the long-term goal of eradication'' of the AIDS 
virus, Furtado and his colleagues concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Furtado's study involved five patients. The other study, led by  
Linqui Zhang at Rockefeller University's Aaron Diamond AIDS 
Research Center, looked at eight patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In both studies, the patients were undergoing standard  
multi-drug treatment, and tests had found no detectable levels of 
HIV in their blood for 20 months or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang's study found genetic markers showing the virus was  
continuing to reproduce in two patients, even as drugs killed off 
most of the older infected cells. The Associated Press reported 
some of his results last June, when they were presented at the 12th 
World AIDS Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies show that treatment tactics must change once  
multi-drug therapy has brought the disease under control, said Dr. 
Roger Pomerantz, an AIDS expert at Thomas Jefferson University in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors must focus on stopping the remaining low levels of viral  
reproduction, as well as flushing out and killing dormant HIV in 
immune cells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common hiding place for HIV appears to be in CD4+ T  
cells. The cells function as the immune system's memory and are 
found throughout the body. Previous studies have shown that they 
may hang on to the genetic blueprint of HIV in dormant form for 
years, so the body will recognize the infection and mount a defense 
if it appears again. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the studies suggest that some of these latent cells may  
be activated from time to time and replicate the virus even during 
intensive drug treatment. Infected cells in the brain, eyes and 
testes also may be responsible for some replication, Pomerantz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher doses of AIDS drugs might halt this low-level replication  
altogether, Pomerantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are also looking at ways to trigger the latent HIV  
in CD4+ T cells, luring the virus out of its hiding place so that 
AIDS drugs can then find it and kill it. 
</P>
<P>
	Still other researchers are looking at the possibility the  
patient's own immune system can be trained to keep the lingering 
infection under control.

<HEADLINE>  Appleby To Defend Kemper Golf Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Stuart Appleby knows the galleries will be  
pulling for him at the Kemper Open -- the last tournament his wife 
saw him win before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my choice to be the sentimental favorite,'' he said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renay Appleby was crushed by a car last year while unloading  
luggage at a London train station after the British Open, six weeks 
after Kemper. 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby credits his wife's inspiration for subsequent victories  
at the Coolum Classic in Australia in December and the Houston Open 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to think there are people out there supporting me,  
maybe more than someone else,'' he said. ``That's their choice. I'd 
rather be someone who they like and they're all happy to see win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby will not be the only favorite when the field tees off  
Thursday at the tree-lined TPC at Avenel course. There is also Fred 
Funk, who was born in nearby Takoma Park and coached at the 
University of Maryland from 1982-88. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Kemper, Appleby and Funk walked together down the  
18th fairway in the final group. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first time Funk lost a tournament he led going into  
the final round. He shot a 77 to tie for third, missing by far his 
best chance to win one of the biggest events on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I replayed for months what happened to me on Sunday,'' Funk  
said. ``I wanted this tournament too much. I put a lot of pressure 
on myself. Two days after that, I didn't sleep for three days. 
Since then, I have had trouble on weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funk has been playing better lately, tying for second last week  
at the Colonial, but he's been bothered this week by a recurring 
neck injury that would have him withdrawing from other tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to push it,'' Funk said. ``If I can swing  
at all, I'm going to play. If it were a normal tournament, I'd have 
probably pulled out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another golfer with a hot game, and local ties, is Olin Browne,  
a Washington native who won the Colonial for his second career 
title. He's dealing with his restless nights before the tournament 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I haven't had a decent night's  
sleep yet,'' said Browne, who is staying with his mother and having 
his brother caddy. ``I'm just going to try to let things flow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since it became host of the Kemper 12 years ago, the Avenel has  
developed into a challenging course that merits respect. 
</P>
<P>
	All the winners of last year's majors -- Vijay Singh, Lee Janzen  
and Mark O'Meara -- are in the field, as are seven of the top 15 on 
the PGA Tour money list.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 58.99 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as buyers  
cautiously returned to a turbulent market following the biggest 
losing streak since late March. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was dow  
was up 58.99 at 10,590.08. It had been up as much as 105 points in 
morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into today's session, the Dow had fallen four straight  
sessions, including a combined 298-point drop in the past two days, 
and is off 5 percent from its May 13 record of 11,107.19. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was oversold,'' said Tony Dwyer, chief equity  
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. ``It's ready for a bounce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators mostly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 10.66 at 1,295.06. The technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index was up 10.75 at 2,391.65 in a session that saw it 
repeatedly turn into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks have sustained the worst losses recently, as  
concerns about potentially higher interest rates draw investors 
away from the high-priced shares that have fed the market's massive 
gains. The Nasdaq index has tumbled 10 percent from its all-time 
record of 2,652.05, set April 26. A decline of 10 percent or more 
is viewed as a ``correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, several industry leaders continued to languish. Intel,  
which plans to unveil a new chip design later today, dipped 3/8 to 
52 1/2. Computer seller Dell fell 15/16 to 33 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market jitters and the move away from Internet stocks  
created a poor climate for the initial public sale of DLJ Direct, 
the online brokerage unit of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. Its 
shares were priced at 20 and rose to 26 1/8, a modest showing for a 
Web-related new issue. DLJ's debut mirrored the IPO Tuesday of 
barnesandnoble.com, which rose 27 percent in its first day of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sectors rebounded today. Drug stocks were higher, led by  
Bristol Myers Squibb, which gained 1 7/8 to 66 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking and financial stocks also rose. Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter rose 1 13/16 to 90 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 403.9 million 
shares at midday, well ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.34 at 620.68, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.18 at 779.02.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 171.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded from a four-day slump Wednesday  
as the banking and Internet shares that faltered earlier this week 
roared back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 171.07 points, a rise of  
1.6 percent, to close at 10,702.16. At one point late in the 
session, the Dow was up 190. 
</P>
<P>
	In a single, volatile session, the index of blue-chip stocks  
wiped out more than half its losses since Friday. Four straight 
losses had pushed the Dow 5 percent below its May 13 record of 
11,107.19. After Wednesday's rally, the Dow is 3.6 percent off the 
all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators rose, recovering early losses. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 gained 20.36 to 1,304.76, and the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index rose 46.28 to 2,427.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the market was ready for a bounce, as the U.S.  
economy remains strong and the outlook for corporate profits 
remains rosy, at least for the next quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conditions are quite good,'' said Tony Dwyer, chief equity  
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. ``IBM is solid, and the 
financials are very strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM contributed heavily to the Dow's gains, soaring 15 1/16, or  
by 6.8 percent, to 236 1/4. Big Blue drew attention as a 2-for-1 split 
took effect after the market closed Wednesday. Stock splits often 
prompt a rally, as investors expect the lower price to entice more 
buyers, but analysts were reluctant to pin IBM's gains solely on 
the split. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, market watchers said, IBM's stock was unfairly battered  
in recent sessions, as the entire technology sector faltered. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were hit hard as concerns about potentially  
higher interest rates drew investors away from the high-priced 
shares. Through Tuesday, the Nasdaq index had tumbled 10 percent 
from its all-time record of 2,652.05, set April 26, meeting the 
conventional definition of a market correction. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, several industry leaders continued to languish.  
Intel, which unveiled a new chip design, fell 1 3/16 to close at 51 
11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But many Internet-related shares resumed their dizzying gains.  
Yahoo rose 13 15/16 to 140 7/8, and America Online rose 5 5/16 to 120 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stocks were hurt by panic selling,'' Dwyer said. ``They  
were ready to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DLJ Direct, the online brokerage unit of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;  
Jenrette Inc., rose steadily in its initial public offering. The 
shares were priced at 20 and rose to 30, a far cry from the 
triple-digit gains of previous Internet IPOs but better than the 
Tuesday debut of barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The online bookseller had disappointed some traders with a  
modest 27 percent gain in its first day of trading. On Wednesday, 
however, barnesandnoble.com tacked on an additional 2 15/16 to 25 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking and financial stocks, which have been hit by concerns  
over interest rates and the Year 2000 computer bug, surged as old 
merger rumors hit the market. Merrill Lynch, often mentioned as a 
takeover target, soared 10 5/16 to 78 11/16. Chase Manhattan Bank, 
the rumored suitor, rose 1 9/16 to 75 3/8. Both companies denied the 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	A. Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney,  
said investors were merely revisiting the stocks that fed market 
gains earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stocks that have been hit pretty hard are rebounding,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benefitting from a steady gain in oil prices this week, most  
petroleum companies rose. Mobil, up 3 1/4 to 103 1/16, paced the 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's market took a measure of support from a Commerce  
Department report that factory orders for big-ticket manufactured 
goods fell an unexpectedly sharp 2.3 percent last month. The figure 
offered new evidence that the economy is not overheated and cooled 
inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet analysts were far from enthusiastic about the rally on Wall  
Street. Aside from IBM's outsized gains and strength from the 
financial companies, most Dow components were fairly flat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the healthiest of rallies,'' Acuff said, noting that  
declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE consolidated volume totaled 1.06 billion shares, compared  
to 992.98 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 7.50 to 624.84, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.82 to 782.66. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.96 to 435.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.1 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.2 
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Smoke Could Linger for a Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- School children were kept indoors,  
golfers struggled to breathe and asthma sufferers were urged to 
carry emergency inhalers as putrid smoke from a smoldering fire 
blanketed South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	And with no rain in the foreseeable future, forestry officials  
said Wednesday it could take at least a week to flood the 10,000 
acres of smoldering Everglades muck that was sending thick smoke 
into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Water managers on Wednesday began installing several pumps --  
each capable of spewing at least 25,000 gallons per minute -- to 
flood the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area, where a lightning 
strike ignited dry sawgrass on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 26,000 acres burned in the wilderness area before it was  
contained and eventually burned out this week. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about 10,000 acres of rich, organic peat-like soil  
continued to burn underground. Smoke filled the skies over coastal 
communities from Miami 150 miles north to Fort Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	The nasty air quality and invisible charred particles are a  
particular problem for people with chronic respiratory ailments. 
The American Lung Association of Southeast Florida urged people to 
stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Health Department hadn't issued any specific warnings  
Wednesday. But some schools were not taking a chance and kept 
children inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Alvarez, head golf pro at Villa Delray Golf Club in Delray  
Beach, said golfers have had a tough time breathing, even though 
there's been no decrease in the number of people signing up for tee 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're afraid of a typhoon or a hurricane, but not smoke,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, more than 13,400 acres had burned in northern  
Florida's Baker County, about 50 miles west of Jacksonville. That 
fire was not threatening any homes or structures on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Congress Probing Chinese Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two principal authors of a congressional  
report on Chinese espionage said today the Clinton administration 
should step up efforts to get U.S. allies to agree on tighter 
restrictions on technology exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the panel that  
investigated Chinese espionage, said tougher controls on technology 
exports are needed, but unilateral U.S. action would only prompt 
China to get the technology elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be the worst of all possible worlds,'' Cox told a  
House International Relations subcommittee, because China would 
still get the technology but U.S. businesses and workers would be 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report concluded there has been extensive theft of  
nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons labs by China over 20 years, but 
said China also has obtained valuable military information and 
technology from commercial purchases of high-powered computers and 
civilian satellite launching technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said the most important of 36 recommendations from the  
committee was for the United States to enlist its allies, including 
Japan and Europeans, to tighten technology export controls when 
trading with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the China espionage panel's  
ranking Democrat, agreed. The two briefed the International 
Relations subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific on the 700-page 
report made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report, chronicling 20 years of Chinese espionage, is  
expected to be used as a springboard for an array of legislative 
initiatives in Congress in the coming weeks, including a push for 
new export control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the International  
Relations Committee, said administration efforts to embrace China 
as a ``strategic partner'' were ``naive ... misguided ... and 
wishful thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must recognize the very different values held by the  
current Chinese government and account for them'' when considering 
trade and other matters, said Gilman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are pledging to pass legislation on everything from  
tightening restrictions on foreign scientists visiting national 
weapons labs, to giving the Energy Department freer rein to conduct 
polygraphs, to throwing more money into security efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, nine committees of Congress are engaged in various  
inquiries into Chinese spying or security lapses at the Energy 
Department's nuclear weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks said today the Cox committee found no evidence that any  
administration official changed his or her behavior because of 
Chinese campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the whole question of did anybody make a decision based on  
political pressure, we found noting of that sort,'' Dicks said on 
NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, also interviewed on NBC, said  
the committee report was balanced and statesmanlike and added: ``We 
are fixing the problem. ... We've taken some dramatic 
counterintelligence measures to beef up security at the labs. ... 
Right now I don't believe there is penetration'' of security. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are showing an eagerness to beef up the Energy  
Department's security and counterintelligence budgets. A Senate 
subcommittee approved an additional $53 million Tuesday for 
anti-espionage activities at the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Various measures to tighten security at U.S. weapons labs and to  
put new restrictions on technology exports to China are headed for 
congressional votes, some perhaps as early as this week as Congress 
considers defense spending bills in both chambers. The Senate also 
is expected to act soon on legislation that would bar some Chinese 
officials from traveling in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has a duty to find out what happened in the past,  
what's occurring now and what should be done to hold those involved 
responsible for their reckless and illegal actions,'' House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Tuesday in a statement responding to 
the Chinese espionage report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report concluded that China stole information on the  
United States' most advanced thermonuclear weapons over 20 years of 
espionage and that thefts ``almost certainly continue to the 
present.'' It also said the information stolen helped modernize 
China's nuclear program and that some U.S. weapon design technology 
may end up being incorporated in China's next generation of nuclear 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has a clear duty to get the bottom of the facts, find  
out what happened and what is still going on, and to demand 
accountability from those responsible,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., 
R-Okla.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Urge Attention to Euro Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Many of the 11 countries in  
Europe's new common currency pact aren't doing enough to comply 
with an accord aimed at ensuring the stability and growth of their 
economies, the Dutch Central Bank warned Wednesday in its annual 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact calls on countries in the ``euro zone'' -- Austria,  
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain -- to have budgets that are nearly 
balanced or have a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank didn't specify which countries are not in line  
with the targets. But other economic forecasts have said Germany, 
France and Italy are among the larger countries unlikely to meet 
the key requirement for monetary union: limiting their budget 
deficits to 2 percent of gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this already vulnerable budgetary environment, it is  
disappointing to note that, on the whole, countries are 
insufficiently complying with the pact,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said a more ambitious policy on deficit reduction would  
help offset cyclical downturns or other economic setbacks that 
could weaken the fledgling currency, which made its debut Jan. 1 on 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Netherlands, the Central Bank said it was unfortunate  
that the budget deficit is expected to rise to 1.7 percent of GDP 
after having dropped to 0.9 percent in both 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank called the Dutch government's target of a deficit of 1  
percent of GDP in 2002, based on an average economic growth rate of 
2.25 percent per year, ``insufficiently ambitious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands' three-party coalition government collapsed last  
week, and Central Bank President Nout Wellink warned that prolonged 
political instability could make it more difficult for the Dutch to 
comply with the stability pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The three leading Dutch political parties are currently involved  
in an effort to restore the coalition. If they fail, general 
elections are likely to be held in September or October.

<HEADLINE> Bush Miffed Over Parody Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's treatment of a Web  
site that parodies politics has backfired in a Texas-sized way. 
</P>
<P>
	Zack Exley, a 29-year-old Somerville, Mass., resident, grabbed  
the unused ``www.gwbush.com'' domain name several months ago and 
put up a site satirizing a Bush presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, considered the front-runner for the GOP nomination next  
year, filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission and 
denounced Exley as ``a garbage man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parody George W. Bush Web site has gotten 6,451,466 hits  
during the first 25 days of May, thanks in part to the story's 
front-page treatment by The New York Times online edition, Exley 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the real George W. Bush Web site has gotten about  
30,000 hits in May, according to Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes politicians don't know when to shut up,'' said  
Michael Goldman, a political consultant working with Democratic 
presidential contender Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush might have been wiser to emulate his father, George Bush,  
who has good-naturedly mimicked impressionist Dana Carvey's 
imitations of himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the younger Bush complained about the Web site during a  
news conference last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ought to be limits to freedom,'' he said. ``We're aware  
of the site, and this guy is just a garbage man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exley, an independent computer consultant, said he has since  
received hundreds of e-mails running 2-to-1 against what he 
characterized as Bush's assault of freedom of speech on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The parody Web site looks like the real ``www.georgewbush.com''  
Web site. Unlike Bush's site, however, the parody prominently 
displays Bush's ``limits to freedom'' quotation and describes him 
as an ``unsuccessful Texas businessman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said the George W. Bush Presidential Exploratory  
Committee was worried that people would misconstrue the parody Web 
site for the genuine article. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is not that people are viewing it, but that they're  
viewing it in the right context,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said she recently got a phone call from a reporter  
working for a major metropolitan newspaper asking for a comment on 
Bush's proposal to ``free all grown-ups from prison,'' a feature of 
the parody site. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst called the flap much ado about nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is still relatively insignificant,'' said  
University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato. He said most 
people get their information about politics from television, 
newspapers and magazines, and friends and families, in that order.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Study Needs Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Scientists will study some 22,000  
postmenopausal women to see if a drug used to prevent bone-thinning 
osteoporosis can prevent breast cancer without the severe side 
effects of other treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the number of breast cancer cases can be reduced  
using these drugs,'' Dr. Lawrence Wagman of the City of Hope Cancer 
Center said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Women with a high risk of breast cancer normally have two  
options: They can undergo a preventative mastectomy to remove 
breast tissue before cancer is found, or they can take tamoxifen, a 
federally-approved drug that can have serious side effects, 
including a higher risk of uterine cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers decided to study the potential benefits of the drug  
raloxifene after doctors prescribing it to prevent osteoporosis, a 
bone-thinning disease that frequently strikes postmenopausal women, 
noticed lower rates of breast cancer among those patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Patricia Ganz of UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center urged women  
with high risk factors to participate in the five-year study. 
Researchers are seeking healthy, postmenopausal women age 35 and 
over to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 medical centers in the United States and Canada  
will participate in the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, one of 
the largest breast cancer prevention studies ever undertaken. 
Raloxifene is marketed as Evista by Eli Lilly and Company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, by a research group called the National Surgical  
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project and supported by the National 
Cancer Institute, will attempt to determine which drug is best. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamoxifen, which is manufactured as Nolvadex by Wilmington,  
Del.-based Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, previously was the subject of a 
six-year study of 13,000 women with high risk for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found tamoxifen reduced breast cancer by 45 percent,  
but led to higher rates of uterine cancer, blood clots and stroke 
in a small number of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Merriam, 58, of Arleta participated in that study and  
wants to be part of the new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find something to help me,'' said Merriam, who's  
already had three pre-cancerous breast tumors removed. ``But I also 
have a daughter and three granddaughters and I hope to make things 
better for them.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Russia May Delay Space Station Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Because of Russia's chronic money  
crunch, space shuttle Discovery's flight could end up being the 
only trip to the new international space station this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was set to blast off Thursday morning on a 10-day  
mission with more than 4,300 pounds of spare parts, cranes, tools, 
laptop computers and clothes to be used by the first permanent 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, an unmanned Russian rocket is scheduled to launch  
the next piece of the space station, a service module containing 
life-support systems. Then, NASA's space shuttle Atlantis is 
supposed to follow in December with more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, everything is on hold until the Russian component --  
already more than 1 1/2 years behind -- is in orbit. And many question 
whether the Russians can finish building and testing it by 
November, given the country's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it does fly in November, maybe it shouldn't,'' said James  
Oberg, an independent consultant on Russian space affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Oberg pointed to problems with the Russian-built component that  
was launched last fall. Its batteries are not charging properly; 
Discovery's crew will replace 18 electrical meters to try to solve 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The failures that have occurred, the problems with the battery  
charge, are inexcusable,'' Oberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA and the Russian Space Agency already are debating what to  
do if something goes wrong and the service module, once launched, 
cannot dock with the two station pieces already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency mission would have to be launched, probably within  
three weeks, said Tommy Holloway, space station program manager. 
The big question is: Who would go? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a subject that we're working with the Russians today,  
and tomorrow, and probably the day after tomorrow,'' Holloway said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holloway's predecessor, Randy Brinkley, said before leaving NASA  
a month ago that he and others should have paid more attention to 
political and economic events in Russia and never allowed the 
Russians to supply a critical component so early in assembly. That 
way, he said, any Russian delays would not have disrupted 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the best of circumstances, NASA figures it will take five  
years -- and some 40 U.S. and Russian launches -- to complete the 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	On this mission, Discovery's seven astronauts will not only  
unload supplies, they will also fix broken U.S. and Russian 
equipment and install mufflers to reduce the noise caused by 
clattering Russian-made fans. Two of them will also take a 
spacewalk to attach one crane and parts of another to the outside 
of the station.

Western sunset. It could happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Assembly approved a measure Tuesday on a vote of 62-7  
that calls for commemorative license plates stamped with the 
likeness of the former president, actor and California governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of anyone who was more important to  
California,'' said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, a Republican. The 
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is in his district. 
</P>
<P>
	The design of the plate hasn't been worked out, but Strickland  
said he hoped it would feature Reagan in a cowboy hat, reminiscent 
of the Western movies that made him so popular. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure now goes to the state Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reagan plate would be California's first to honor an  
individual, said Bill Gengler of the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
The state already has 52 specialized and commemorative plates.

<HEADLINE> NC Student Charged After Bombs Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRMONT, N.C. (AP) -- A high school senior who allegedly  
threatened to blow up his school when he learned he was not going 
to graduate was arrested after two bombs were found in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Harold Bell, 18, a senior at Fairmont High School, was  
arrested Friday and remained in jail Wednesday on $25,000 bond, 
said Lt. Kenneth Sealey of the Robeson County Sheriff's Department. 
He is charged with possession of a weapon of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bell learned several weeks ago he was not going to graduate  
with his class because of excessive absences he told another 
student, ``If I do not graduate, then I will blow up the school,'' 
according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A student at the school found two notes signed by Bell on May 20  
that suggested he was going to kill himself. Police searched his 
home and learned he had assembled two bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's stepfather found the bombs and disposed of them, police  
said.

<HEADLINE> Fire Damages Oklahoma St. Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Fire damaged the Gallagher-Iba Arena on  
the Oklahoma State University campus today. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze began around 9:30 a.m. in a first floor electrical and  
mechanical room and spread to the second floor, where offices are 
located, Stillwater Fire Chief Larry Mullikin said. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze did not reach the arena floor and did not affect the  
building's structural integrity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had quite a bit of heavy smoke inside, but we were able to  
confine the fire,'' Mullikin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage occurred in the southwest corner of the arena, which  
is undergoing a $40 million expansion. Mullikin said the sprinkler 
system had been disconnected during the construction without 
notification to fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we charged the sprinkler system, it just flooded the  
basement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullikin did not have damage estimates and said the state fire  
marshal's office is investigating.

<HEADLINE>  NY Cop Pleads Guilty in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For three weeks, it was Officer Justin Volpe's  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of witnesses took turns implicating Volpe in the  
torture of a Haitian immigrant in a brutality case that shocked the 
city and shattered the ``blue wall of silence'' -- the solidarity 
that keeps police officers from testifying against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the burly, stone-faced officer bragged about the  
attack. Others said he waved a piece of a broom stick used to 
sodomize his prisoner. The names of the other four police officers 
at the defense table rarely came up. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the jury returns to Brooklyn federal court today, the  
lead defendant will be conspicuously absent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday -- with his mid-trial bid for a plea bargain rejected  
and chances of an acquittal obliterated -- Volpe pleaded guilty to 
violating the civil rights of the prisoner, Abner Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	``There came a point in time where the evidence became  
overwhelming,'' said Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's dramatic decision could land him in prison for the rest  
of his life. What it meant for his codefendants was much less 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney John Patten said he intended to ask for a  
mistrial. Volpe's departure creates ``a prejudice that adheres to 
everyone else at the defense table,'' said Patten, who represents 
Sgt. Michael Bellomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Other defense attorneys said it was more likely Judge Eugene  
Nickerson would resume the trial after briefly informing the 12 
jurors that Volpe had pleaded guilty -- and say no more. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, admitted ramming a stick into the handcuffed victim's  
rectum, pulling it out and putting it up to his face. He said he 
mistakenly believed Louima had punched him while police tried to 
quell a disturbance outside a nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson asked Volpe: ``You intended to humiliate him, did you?  
You thought you were mad at him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe relied: ``I was mad at the time, yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Without Volpe, the spotlight could shift to Officer Charles  
Schwarz, who is accused of holding down Louima, 32, during the 
assault in the bathroom of the stationhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Volpe, Schwarz and Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder  
also are charged with beating Louima in a patrol car en route to 
the 70th police precinct after his arrest on false charges he 
punched Volpe. Bellomo, their supervisor, is charged with covering 
up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima has identified Schwarz as the second bathroom assailant.  
Two police officers also testified that they saw the officer 
searching Louima at the front desk of the station hours before 
marching him in the general direction of the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	During Tuesday's hearing, Volpe said another officer was present  
during the attack in the bathroom. When pressed by the judge, he 
said the other officer did not hit Louima but ``saw what was going 
on and did nothing to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was understood from the circumstances that the police  
officer would do nothing to stop me or report it to anyone,'' Volpe 
said. Volpe did not name the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz has denied ever being in the bathroom.

<HEADLINE> 35M Saw 'Home Improvement' Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 35 million people watched the end  
of Tim Allen's ``Home Improvement'' on Tuesday night, making it the 
fourth most-viewed series finale of the 1990s behind ``Seinfeld,'' 
``Cheers'' and ``The Cosby Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It more than doubled the show's 15 million average viewership  
for the season, according to Nielsen Media Research, and caught ABC 
somewhat by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled,'' said ABC Entertainment President Jamie  
Tarses. ``It's a testament to the kind of fan base the show had 
over the course of its run, the allegiance they felt and the 
affection they had for this family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 90-minute feature, next-door neighbor Wilson revealed  
his face for the first time since the show began in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The show had a 21.2 rating and a 34 share, meaning a third of  
the television sets in use at the time were tuned in to ``Home 
Improvement.'' By comparison, the season's top-rated series, 
``ER,'' averaged 25 million viewers this year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Mad About You,'' which had its series finale on Monday  
night, drew 19.8 million viewers. Fox's ``Melrose Place'' had 10.4 
million viewers for its final show, also Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Senator Seeks Cigarette Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Dick Durbin on Tuesday urged federal  
officials to investigate whether high-nicotine, hand-rolled 
cigarettes imported from India should be allowed to be sold in 
health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert  
Pitofsky, the Illinois Democrat said selling the thin, flavored, 
unfiltered cigarettes called beedies or bidis ``alongside vitamins 
and alternative medicine products could be a form of deceptive 
advertising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With their shape like marijuana joints and inexpensive price -- a  
paper-wrapped bundle of 20 goes for about $2 -- the cigarettes are a 
growing fad among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	They are about half the size of a regular cigarette, filled with  
tobacco flakes, hand-rolled with a greenish-brown leaf, tapered at 
both ends and tied with a tiny, colored thread. They also are 
particularly potent, containing four to seven times the nicotine of 
regular American cigarettes but with no filter. Flavors such as 
strawberry, chocolate and vanilla help mask the harsher taste. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials and anti-smoking activists say many  
youngsters don't realize bidis are even more dangerous than regular 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC already is investigating reports that many bidis are  
often sold without required warning labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin also asked the Food and Drug Administration to include  
bidis on its list of tobacco products to check when sting 
operations are conducted to see if retailers are illegally selling 
to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a study by the San Francisco Anti-Smoking Project that  
bidis were sold to underage buyers without age identification twice 
as often as regular cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The health risks of bidis, unfortunately, are not widely  
known,'' Durbin wrote.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak NE Ridership Hits 8-Yr. High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak carried more than a million riders in  
the Northeast in April, the best performance for a single month in 
eight years, the national railroad said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak attributed the record-setting performance to a strong  
economy and ``mounting disaffection with the quality of air 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Bagley, president of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, said the  
company will have momentum when it launches high-speed service 
later this year between Boston and Washington. The ``Acela'' trains 
will be able to travel up to 150 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,073,564 riders was a 3.2 percent increase over April 1998.  
The fastest-growing lines in the Northeast were Empire in New York, 
Keystone in eastern Pennsylvania and Ethan Allen Express in 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the federal government, Amtrak must wean  
itself from federal operating subsidies by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exchange Moves To Stop Sell-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai government and stock exchange  
officials said Wednesday that they were working on measures to 
prevent the dumping of stocks after a sell-off prompted complaints 
of manipulation from dealers and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	A large programmed order launched just two minutes before the  
close on Tuesday forced the main Stock Exchange of Thailand index 
down 4 percent. The market closed at 451.05, a fall of 18.93 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics claimed the dumping was aimed at manipulating the index  
so that profits could be taken on index options overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Leeahtam said Wednesday he  
had been briefed on the sell-off by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and that the government was looking into ways to deal 
with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The sell-off caused three blue-chip Thai stocks -- Siam Cement,  
Siam City Cement and Siam Makro -- to fall by more than 30 percent, 
and several dealers said the drop was not warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is trying to manipulate the market,'' Marc Lavoie, an  
analyst at Asset Plus Securities, was quoted as saying by The 
Nation newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong, and there have been no  
changes over these stocks. Someone will be in trouble,'' he said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors was the  
overwhelming choice today as the NBA's rookie of the year, 
capturing the award with 113 of 118 votes in a panel of media 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento's Jason Williams received three votes and Boston's  
Paul Pierce got two. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was the fifth selection in the 1998 NBA draft and  
averaged 18.3 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.0 assists for the Raptors. 
He was the team's leading scorer, hitting 20 or more points 20 
times and 30 or more three times.

<P>
	An early entry player out of the University of North Carolina,  
Carter was drafted by Golden State and then swapped almost

<HEADLINE>  Perkins Will Retire, If He Has Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The old man has one more goal.  
</P>
<P>
	Sam Perkins, the oldest Indiana Pacer, has appeared in more  
playoff games without winning the championship than all but two 
players in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pacers beat the New York Knicks for the Eastern  
Conference title, he will be one series away from reaching his 
ultimate goal. And also four victories away from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running on empty now. I'm running on fumes,'' the 15-year  
veteran admitted after practice Wednesday. ``If we win this all, 
I'll never be back here again. What for?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 series against the Knicks begins Sunday in Market  
Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing as long as I can to obtain this ring and fell  
short a couple of times, so it makes sense (to retire),'' said 
Perkins, who will turn 38 next month. ``I wouldn't stay around just 
for the money. The money's good, don't get me wrong, but I would 
retire if we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins was in the Western Conference finals four times with  
Dallas, the Lakers and Seattle. The Sonics lost in the championship 
series to the Chicago Bulls in 1996, and Perkins left Seattle as a 
free agent after last season and signed a two-year contract with 
the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got Sam to help us to win some regular-season games, but we  
got him mostly for the playoffs,'' coach Larry Bird said. ``If he 
can come in and hit some shots that helps us along the way, it just 
makes our bench that much stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins played in 48 of the 50 games and averaged a career-low 5  
points. He is averaging 4.7 points through seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indiana's sweeps of Milwaukee and Philadelphia in the first  
two rounds, Perkins has appeared in 135 career playoff games. The 
only players who have been in more postseason games without winning 
the championship are Utah's John Stockton (156) and Karl Malone 
(146), and they could face Perkins and the Pacers by beating 
Portland and then San Antonio in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some of the younger players are looking to Perkins  
for advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hang out with him a lot,'' said rookie Al Harrington, who  
was drafted last year out of high school and is the youngest Pacer. 
``Look at his longevity. That's what it's all about. He's been 
playing all these years, and that's the one thing I always ask him, 
`What did you do to stay in shape, stay healthy, all this time?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York is the fifth time in seven years the  
Pacers have played the Knicks in the playoffs. Each team has won 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in situations like that,'' Perkins said. ``I've  
watched some series with them. I'm in the trenches with them, so 
even though it's new to me as far as the rivalry, it's still the 
same old hat as far as going out there and being competitive. I had 
some battles out in the West with some rival teams all the time.''

Dallas, the Lakers and Seattle. The Sonics lost in the championship 
series to the Chicago Bulls in 1996, and Perkins left Seattle as a 
free agent after last season and signed a two-year contract with 
the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got Sam to help us to win some regular-season games, but we  
got him mostly for the playoffs,'' coach Larry Bird said. ``If he 
can come in and hit some shots that helps us along the way, it just 
makes our bench that much stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins played in 48 of the 50 games and averaged a career-low 5  
points. He is averaging 4.7 points through seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indiana's sweeps of Milwaukee and Philadelphia in the first  
two rounds, Perkins has appeared in 135 career playoff games. The 
only players who have been in more postseason games without winning 
the championship are Utah's John Stockton (156) and Karl Malone 
(146), and they could face Perkins and the Pacers by beating 
Portland and then San Antonio in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some of the younger players are looking to Perkins  
for advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hang out with him a lot,'' said rookie Al Harrington, who  
was drafted last year out of high school and is the youngest Pacer. 
``Look at his longevity. That's what it's all about. He's been 
playing all these years, and that's the one thing I always ask him, 
`What did you do to stay in shape, stay healthy, all this time?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York is the fifth time in seven years the  
Pacers have played the Knicks in the playoffs. Each team has won 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in situations like that,'' Perkins said. ``I've  
watched some series with them. I'm in the trenches with them, so 
even though it's new to me as far as the rivalry, it's still the 
same old hat as far as going out there and being competitive. I had 
some battles out in the West with some rival teams all the time.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Torture Case Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The judge in the city's police torture case  
rejected motions for a mistrial Wednesday and told the jury that 
the trial would go on without the officer who pleaded guilty the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson explained to the jurors  
that Justin Volpe's plea of guilty to violating the civil rights of 
a Haitian immigrant shouldn't be used as evidence in determining 
the guilt or innocence of the remaining four officers charged in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes earlier, with the jury out of the courtroom, two defense  
attorneys had asked Nickerson to declare a mistrial. They said the 
jury, knowing that the lead defendant was guilty, would assume the 
worst of the remaining defendants. Nickerson rejected the argument 
without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, was the central figure in a case that has shocked the  
city and sparked demonstrations against police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	After being faced with damaging testimony against him from four  
fellow officers, Volpe admitted that he violated Abner Louima's 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe admitted ramming a stick into the handcuffed victim's  
rectum, pulling it out and putting it up to his face to humiliate 
him. He said he was angry because he believed, mistakenly, that 
Louima had punched him while police tried to quell a disturbance 
outside a nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, who was dismissed from the force Tuesday, is in federal  
custody awaiting sentencing, which has not been scheduled. He faces 
up to life in prison, although the judge can impose a lesser term. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the remaining defendants, Officer Charles Schwarz is accused  
of holding down Louima, 32, in the bathroom assault, which caused 
severe internal injuries. Schwarz, and Officers Thomas Wiese and 
Thomas Bruder also are charged with beating Louima in a patrol car 
en route to the police precinct after his arrest on false charges 
he punched Volpe; Sgt. Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, is 
charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, jurors heard testimony from laboratory experts who  
said DNA found in the bathroom was probably that of Louima. The 
prosecution, which has two remaining witnesses, was expected to 
rest its case on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Try To Protect Surpluses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans, trying to protect their  
party's flanks on a volatile social issue, pushed through 
legislation Wednesday that would put new obstacles in the way of 
spending government surpluses that come from Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers should have the confidence that the money they pay  
into Social Security and Medicare is used only for Social Security 
and Medicare, not bigger government or new spending,'' said House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP legislation passed 416 to 12. Most House Democrats voted  
for it, saying they believe it won't do much to help the nation's 
retirement system, but it couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this bill will probably not make things any worse, it  
won't make them any better,'' said Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	A stricter version of the legislation has been stalled in the  
Senate by Democrats' objections and faces a veto threat from the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's budget surplus, expected to be $80 billion to $110  
billion, will come entirely from Social Security taxes. Under 
current projections, income tax surpluses aren't anticipated until 
after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed legislation would forbid Congress and the  
president from including Social Security surpluses in their 
budgeting for other programs or for tax cuts. Instead, it would 
have to be used to pay down the government's debt to private 
bondholders -- something economists say could help promote economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate votes on the House floor would be required for most  
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers could tap the money to help prepare Social Security or  
Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, for a cash 
shortfall expected after baby boomers, now in middle age, retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Skepticism has been growing, however, that Congress can pass a  
full-scale overhaul of the retirement programs in the politically 
charged year and a half before the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP drive to formally wall off Social Security surpluses is,  
in part, a fallback plan to counter Democrats' accusations that 
Republicans want to spend money that could help shore up the 
nation's retirement system on tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls, including polling by the Republican  
National Committee, indicate that Americans, by a double-digit 
margin, consider Democrats more likely than Republicans to make the 
right decisions about Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, RNC polling found that legislation to  
safeguard Social Security surplus dollars offered some cover, 
commanding strong support, with 87 percent of Americans in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is unclear whether the GOP strategy can succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version of the legislation is opposed by Democrats  
there and by the Clinton administration. It would lower the 
government's statutory debt limit, something administration 
officials say could hinder borrowing flexibility the Treasury 
Department needs in times of economic trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	And already, the conflict in Yugoslavia, with its $9  
billion-and-growing price tag, suggests that lawmakers are sure to 
face necessary -- or at least tempting -- exceptions to any new 
spending restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Democrats are challenging Republicans to set aside  
even more money, from expected income tax surpluses, for Medicare. 
The Clinton administration wants about $700 billion over 15 years 
for Medicare -- close to the same amount Republicans have budgeted 
for tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Family: Wrestler Leery About Stunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Professional wrestler Owen Hart was  
leery about the flashy stunt he was supposed to perform to land 
inside the ring, but was convinced to do it anyway, his family 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put you into compromising positions where they let you  
know you have no choice,'' father Stu Hart said Tuesday of the pro 
wrestling circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Owen Hart, known as the Blue Blazer, died Sunday after plunging  
70 feet, hitting his head on the padded metal coupling that holds 
the ring's ropes together. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Tuesday the fall may have been caused when  
his elaborate, feathered costume caught on a quick-release cord as 
he was being lowered from the Kemper Arena rafters during a show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is believed at this point in time that the quick release  
was activated. Either it was snagged on his clothes or he pulled it 
too soon,'' police spokesman Floyd Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, 34, who wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation, had  
planned to descend 90 feet into the ring in a stunt he had done 
before and had practiced at the arena hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Hart may have lost his balance while preparing for  
his drop and somehow activated the release. Police plan to perform 
strength testing on the equipment he was wearing, Capt. Jerry 
Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had done the stunt before, and his widow, Martha Hart, told  
NBC's ``Today'' show on Tuesday that she was never comfortable with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This particular one we did discuss,'' Mrs. Hart said. ``I had  
told him that I didn't thin k he should do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of Hart's family members attacked the sport's  
increasing reliance on flashy, can-you-top-this stunts. 
</P>
<P>
	What once was a small-time regional show circuit has become  
dominated by two national organizations -- the WWF and World 
Championship Wrestling -- which rely on dangerous gimmicks for 
increased TV ratings and revenues, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a campaign to outdo each other,'' said his brother,  
Smith Hart, 50. ``There is no respect for the sport anymore. There 
used to be (wrestling) heroes for children. I don't see any 
heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All seven Hart boys followed their father, a former Olympic  
wrestler, into the sport as amateurs and professionals. Owen Hart 
was the youngest member of the prominent family. 
</P>
<P>
	WCW President Eric Bischoff said Tuesday that criticism of  
wrestling after the accident is a ``knee-jerk, uneducated reaction 
to a very tragic incident.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gets No Break From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton played a round of golf and  
went biking with the first lady Wednesday on a secluded plantation 
in northern Florida. But it wasn't all fun in the sun for the 
commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton received his daily security briefing on the Yugoslavia  
campaign, called the Italian prime minister and named Nobel 
laureate Elie Wiesel a special envoy to Macedonia to check up on 
refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will stay in touch, as you've already seen today,'' White  
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. ``But it's important from 
time to time to take a chance to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any president vacationing during a military conflict opens  
himself to questions about priorities. President Bush was 
criticized for taking two weeks off to golf and fish during the 
build up to the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told reporters as he headed to his summer home in  
Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1991 that ``what you don't want to do is 
appear to be held hostage in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's vacation site offered one advantage over the coast  
of Maine: there was little chance any media pictures would be taken 
of his leisurely pursuits on the densely wooded, 7,500 acre White 
Oak Plantation located 20 miles north of Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The vacation was planned long before release of a report on  
China's espionage was released Tuesday by a special committee led 
by Reps. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norman Dicks, D-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Nicholson, the Republican National Committee chairman,  
said through a spokesman that it was appropriate Clinton was 
vacationing at a nature preserve: ``He's joining the ostriches with 
his head in the sand the day after the Cox committee exposed the 
worst case of espionage in U.S. history under his watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has stressed that most of the spying detailed in  
the report occurred in the 1980s, when Republicans held the 
presidency, and Lockhart noted that Clinton spoke to the report in 
Texas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any worry on our part about the  
appearances here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived Tuesday at  
the private wildlife conservation area inhabited by giraffes, 
cheetahs and white rhinos. The Clintons were traveling without 
daughter Chelsea, who is still in school at Stanford University. 
The president's Labrador, Buddy, did make the journey. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak is located off an unmarked dirt road about 20 miles  
north of Jacksonville and sports a nine-hole golf course and a 
swimming pool, as well as 14 dwellings. The Clintons were staying 
at Roseland, a two-story, cedar paneled, five-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers it all, with the ability to get away from what  
they're normally faced with on a work day,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president brought a bagful of books to help pass the time,  
including ``Sudden Mischief'' by Robert Parker and Carl Hiassen's 
``Lucky You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alemma for  
about 30 minutes on Tuesday night about the NATO campaign against 
the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving his briefing Wednesday morning from a National  
Security Council staffer traveling with him, he called Wiesel, a 
Holocaust survivor and author, and asked him to travel to Macedonia 
on May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to get a sense of the conditions there and have a  
chance to talk to some of the refugees about the conditions on the 
ground,'' Lockhart said. Wiesel will report back directly to 
Clinton after his trip.

<HEADLINE> Bobby Labonte Wins Coca-Cola Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Bobby Labonte upstaged everyone in  
first-round qualifying for the Coca-Cola 600. Dale Earnhardt Jr. 
settled for upstaging The Intimidator. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte won the pole for NASCAR's longest race with a fast lap  
of 185.230 mph on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, trying to make the field for his well-publicized and  
much-anticipated first Winston Cup race, had a 184.407 in his only 
allotted lap around Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't never been that nervous in my life,'' said Earnhardt,  
whose lap guaranteed him the eighth starting spot in Sunday's 
43-car field. It also put him seven spots ahead of his father, 
seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 600 miles we're bound to run into each other sooner or  
later -- not literally, I hope,'' said Earnhardt, 24, who heightened 
expectations for his move up to NASCAR's top circuit by winning 
NASCAR's Busch Grand National title last year as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, third in the 1999 Winston Cup standings, won his third  
pole of the season and the 16th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good car for us and a good track for us,'' said  
Labonte, who got the first of his seven career victories at this 
race in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Stewart, trying to become just the second driver to compete  
in the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, 
failed to qualify Wednesday night, when the top 25 starting spots 
were set for the 600. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the 27th-fastest speed, and team officials said he  
probably would stand on that lap for Thursday's second round of 
time trials, when the remainder of the field was to be set. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a tactic probably would give Stewart a starting spot  
somewhere in the high 20s or low 30s for the 400-lap race. He will 
start 24th at Indianapolis, where he plans to run 500 miles before 
flying immediately to Charlotte for the early evening start of the 
600. 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti, who in 1994 became the only driver to pull off  
the daily driving double, qualified 22nd Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver known as Little E was the 40th of 52 competitors in  
the qualifying session. Taking the track to a loud chorus of cheers 
from the crowd of about 30,000, Earnhardt followed a slightly 
higher-than-preferred line through the first and second turns. From 
there on, however, he looked like a seasoned veteran as he made his 
way around the 1.5-mile, high-banked trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got back to the garage, there were high-fives all around  
from his crew, the same team that prepares and services what for 
the past 1 1/2 years has been the best car on the Grand National 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt wasn't sure what to expect when his team made the jump  
up to NASCAR's big leagues. Adding to the pressure was 
Anheuser-Busch's decision to sponsor his Winston Cup team to the 
tune of $10 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of pressure on us, and we're just trying to  
deliver,'' Earnhardt said. ``It's not easy, and it ain't going to 
be easy from here on out, but we're excited to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Earnhardt was being peppered with questions by a swarm of  
reporters, his father, who 24 years earlier made his Winston Cup 
debut at Charlotte, was out making his qualifying run for the 
latest version of NASCAR's longest race. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, 48, didn't fare nearly as well as his son. A lap of  
183.692 was the best he could do, putting him 15th on the starting 
grid and four rows behind his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a lot of fun with it,'' said the younger Earnhardt.  
``I'm sure he's going to have a lot of laughs watching me try to 
wheel that thing around here.''

<HEADLINE> Notting Hill: A London Neighborhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Hugh Grant strolls down Portobello Road, past  
stalls brimming with antique bric-a-brac, carts heaped high with 
glistening vegetables, and the gaily hued storefronts that line 
Notting Hill's most famous street. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the new movie ``Notting Hill'' may focus on the romance  
between the characters played by Grant, a stammering, witty 
bookstore owner, and Julia Roberts, a superstar actress. 
</P>
<P>
	But, at its heart, it also is a valentine to one of London's  
trendiest, most colorful neighborhoods, an alternatively stylish 
and rundown area chockablock with hip restaurants and funky shops, 
secret gardens and seriously grand homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention Trustafarians, the handy word coined to describe  
the aggressively style-conscious trust-fund youths who are steadily 
transforming the west London neighborhood from its Rastafarian 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Notting Hill is a hybrid that is home to such varied celebrities  
as actor Alan Rickman, designer Stella McCartney (Paul McCartney's 
daughter), Blur frontman Damon Alborn and media executive Elizabeth 
Murdoch (daughter of Rupert), while still maintaining a sizable 
minority population. 
</P>
<P>
	Not insignificantly, it also claims ``Notting Hill''  
screenwriter Richard Curtis among its residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notting Hill is an extraordinary mixture of cultures,'' says  
Curtis, whose own blue front door stands in for the entrance to the 
house where Grant's character lives. ``It is rich and poor and 
Portuguese and Jamaican and English, and it seemed like a proper 
place where two people from different worlds could actually meet 
and co-exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All true, even though few nonwhite faces can be spied in the  
movie, even as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	Notting Dale, as the neighborhood initially was called, was born  
in the late 19th century, when high-society architects were 
commissioned to build neoclassical mansions on the fringes of an 
industrial area best known for its brick fields. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years after World War II, many of those spacious houses  
were divided up into rental units for poor tenants, including large 
numbers of recent immigrants from the West Indies. And thus a 
multicultural neighborhood was created, mixed with the seeds sown 
by the original Irish and Jewish transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere are the neighborhood's Afro-Caribbean underpinnings  
better on display than each August during the Notting Hill 
Carnival, a raucous, good-natured affair spilling over with 
thumping reggae music, spontaneous street dancing and spectacular 
floats. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the best known of all of Notting Hill's attractions  
is the Portobello Market, which each Saturday draws thousands of 
tourists who brave the crowds to paw through table after table of 
antique -- and not-so-antique -- offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	On various days, the market showcases organic fruits and  
vegetables, flowers, secondhand clothes and CDs, and other 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Portobello Market, featured prominently in the  
movie, could be considered much like Notting Hill itself, which 
offers something for almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	The neighborhood is close to the vast green expanses of Holland  
Park, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, where tourists still trek 
to Princess Diana's former palace residence to leave flowers in her 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
	It contains a host of relatively cheap, ethnic restaurants,  
mixed with upscale establishments such as Leith's, established by 
British food pioneer Prue Leith, and Kensington Place, the 
showplace of star chef Rowley Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is home to artist Damien Hirst's restaurant, Pharmacy,  
whose facade is modeled after a real-life drugstore with enough 
verisimilitude that the pharmacists' association complained. (The 
inside is just as playful: The downstairs barstools are topped with 
giant plastic Tylenols.) 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond Portobello Road's antiques, Notting Hill is an ideal  
place to find unique presents -- for someone else, or just for 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	One of its main thoroughfares -- Westbourne Grove, or Westbourne  
Groove, as it is appropriately nicknamed -- offers a variety of 
quirky shops, ranging from Dinny Hall's designer jewelry, to the 
cool housewares and toiletries at Space, to the secondhand 
splendors at Vent, to the edible pleasures at Planet Organic. 
</P>
<P>
	Not too far away are the trio of specialty bookshops on Blenheim  
Crescent -- Books for Cooks (with its delightful, tiny restaurant 
tucked in the back), Garden Books and the Travel Bookshop, the 
latter the inspiration for the store owned by Grant in ``Notting 
Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the seemingly relentless gentrification of the neighborhood  
is slowly forcing out many small shopowners -- not to mention hordes 
of nonwealthy and nonwhite residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Holder, who works in charming, independent Elgin Books,  
has watched the steady changes over the 23 years she has lived in 
Notting Hill, which was a down-at-the-heels area when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	What she has seen makes her sad and angry.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel positively hostile to the fact that all the small  
businesses are being squeezed out,'' Holder says, lamenting that

	Residential prices are having the same effect: Three-bedroom  
houses now start at about $1 million, which is probably what the

just renting a one-bedroom apartment will set you back about $1,600 
a month.

the current prices. So the mix to the area -- that goes. It's all

<HEADLINE> Homeschooled Boy Wins Spelling Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- David Beihl became the first homeschooled  
student to win the National Geography Bee, attributing his success 
Wednesday to ``study and prayer'' -- and perhaps a little knowledge 
of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Beihl, 13, of Saluda, S.C., correctly answered that ``La Nina''  
is the Spanish name for the weather condition characterized by 
unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial region of the 
eastern Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had lots of time to study. My schedule is more flexible  
than some other schools,'' said Beihl, taught at home since 
kindergarten. He outlasted Jason Borschow, a 13-year-old 
eighth-grader at Saint John's School in Condado, just outside San 
Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Borschow answered ``El Nino,'' to the weather question in the  
championship round of the society's nationwide geography 
competition. However the language's male gender characterizes warm 
weather conditions, said moderator Alex Trebek, who usually serves 
as host of the television game show ``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be calm and not blurt the answer out. You have to  
take your time and consider all the possibilities,'' said Borschow, 
a third-time finalist who admits that in the end he did not follow 
his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Borschow and Beihl were returning participants to the  
annual competition. Borschow represented Puerto Rico last year and 
in 1997. Beihl represented South Carolina last year. 
</P>
<P>
	They were among the 10 to make Wednesday's finals in the 11th  
annual competition. The field was narrowed from 55 on Tuesday at 
the society's Washington headquarters. Each contestant represented 
fourth- to eighth-graders from each state, the District of 
Columbia, Department of Defense Schools and each of the five U.S. 
territories. More than 5 million students ages 10 to 15 competed in 
their schools and states earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Beihl received a $25,000 scholarship from the society and a  
seven-day trip to Sydney, Australia from this year's corporate 
sponsor, Bank One. 
</P>
<P>
	Borschow got a $15,000 scholarship for second place. Tanveer  
Ali, 13, an eighth-grader from Flint, Mich., won $10,000 for his 
third place finish. He attends Carman-Ainsworth Junior High School 
in Flint. 
</P>
<P>
	Beihl correctly answered all three championship round questions,  
while his opponent answered just two. Besides the La Nina question, 
Beihl also correctly named ``Dhaka'' as the capital city 65 miles 
northwest of the Jamuna River and ``Honduras'' as the only Central 
American country with direct access to the Pacific Ocean through 
the Gulf of Fonseca. Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always makes us sweat bullets,'' joked his father, Gary,  
39. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Beihl attributed homeschooling to the success of his son,  
who will remain in Washington for next week's Scripps Howard 
National Spelling Bee. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year-old New York girl educated at home won the spelling  
bee in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	David Beihl's brother Tom, 11, and sister Debbie, 9, are also  
taught at home by their mother Penny Beihl, 39, who has a master's 
degree in elementary and secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live way out in the country'' said Gary Beihl, who commutes  
an hour each way to his engineering job with Intel in Columbia, S.C 
. ``It makes us closer as a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final contest was close as many of the youngsters answered  
several questions before being eliminated. At one point, Trebeck 
joked that he would run out of questions before contestants. 
</P>
<P>
	The bee's youngest competitor Mallika Thampy, 10, of Maryland  
Heights, Mo., was not stumped until the 96th question: In 1998 
large pieces of the Larsen and Ronne Ice Shelves broke away from 
Antartica into what sea? Thampy's answer ``Atlantic Ocean'' was not 
specific enough; it was the Weddell Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	She and six other finalists from Wednesday's rounds received  
$500.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Clinton Ratings Slipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public approval of President Clinton's job  
performance and of congressional Democrats has slipped from lofty 
levels reflected in surveys last winter, a poll released Wednesday 
suggests. Apprehension about the Kosovo conflict has risen. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's job approval in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll  
slipped from 60 percent earlier this month to 53 percent, the 
lowest rating he has had in that poll since August 1996. During the 
months of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment trial, his 
approval rating consistently stayed between 60 percent and 70 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the country would be better off if Republicans or  
Democrats controlled Congress, the public was split, with just over 
a third choosing Republicans and about the same number choosing 
Democrats. Democrats had a 41-30 edge in December's CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority, 57 percent, said they were very confident or  
somewhat confident in the president's ability to handle the Kosovo 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people who said they were very confident in his  
ability to handle the conflict slipped from 27 percent in late 
March to 17 percent in late May. And the number not at all 
confident in his ability to handle Kosovo grew from 13 percent to 
25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half said they oppose sending in ground troops if NATO  
airstrikes are not effective. In mid-April, a slim majority said 
they would favor sending in ground troops in that circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of five in the poll said they favored the United States  
and its NATO allies temporarily suspending the airstrikes and 
trying to resolve the conflict through negotiations. More than 70 
percent opposed stopping all military action and making no further 
efforts to help refugees return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,050 adults was taken Sunday and Monday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- A week after the new Star Wars blockbuster  
opened in the United States, pirated copies have already hit store 
shelves in Hong Kong and Macau. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirated video CDs of ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace''  
are widely available in shopping malls for Hong Kong for $3.20 to 
$3.80, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday.

<HEADLINE> No Murder Charges for Florida Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- An elderly woman accused in her daughter's  
shooting will not face a murder charge following the victim's 
decision to be taken off life support, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Egan, who suffers from emphysema and is blind in one  
eye, already is charged with attempted murder for the shooting of 
Georgette Smith. Ms. Egan, 68, could have been charged with murder 
after her daughter died May 19 when her ventilator was removed at 
Ms. Smith's own request. 
</P>
<P>
	But State Attorney Lawson Lamar cited Ms. Egan's health and her  
closeness with her daughter for his decision not to pursue the 
higher charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan's ``deteriorating health and her relationship to the  
victim, do not ... provide an appropriate circumstance for me to 
exercise my discretion by charging murder in this case,'' Lamar 
said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Wesley, a lawyer for Ms. Egan, said Ms. Smith did not want  
her mother charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``This takes a burden off her,'' he said of his client. ``It  
shows dignity and respect for the wishes of Georgette Smith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan is accused of shooting her 42-year-old daughter in  
March after overhearing a discussion about putting her in a nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet that struck Ms. Smith in the neck tore through her  
spinal cord, leaving her unable to speak without effort, incapable 
of swallowing and unable to control her bladder. She was fed 
through a tube and ran a high risk of pneumonia, infections, ulcers 
and bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan supported her daughter's decision to be taken off life  
support, but her attorney fought it to avoid the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan didn't mean to shoot her daughter and didn't want to  
see her suffer, Wesley said. 
</P>
<P>
	She remains in jail with a trial date set for Aug. 9.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Decide Fate of Philly Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The parents of a 20-month-old boy who has  
been comatose for more than a year are fighting efforts to take him 
off life support. The father is charged with causing the toddler's 
irreparable brain injuries by violently shaking him. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delaware County judge was to decide today during a closed  
hearing whether to give legal custody of little Shirron Lewis of 
Chester to the county's Children and Youth Services. If he agrees, 
he will later have to decide whether to allow the county to remove 
the boy from life support, which doctors say will kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the humane thing to do,'' court-appointed lawyer  
Barbara Scarlata said. ``This is prolonging his death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father, Ronald Lewis, has been charged with attempted  
murder, but if Shirron dies the charges are likely to be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirron, then 5 months old, was rushed to the hospital in March  
1998. Prosecutors say Lewis shook him so violently that the baby is 
now in a persistent vegetative state -- blind, deaf and unable to 
swallow on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the boy does not have any conscious thoughts and  
reacts only to severe pain. They say he will not recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 43, who was watching little Shirron the night of the  
alleged assault, said he didn't cause the injuries and doesn't know 
how it happened, defense attorney Wayne Punshon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and Jackie Allen, Shirron's mother, say they don't want a  
court to decide what is best for their child. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis ``wants a say in the question of whether the child's life  
is terminated because he doesn't think that man should make the 
decision. It is solely God's (decision),'' Punshon said. He didn't 
know what religion Lewis practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who are engaged and were living together at the time  
of the incident, also have an infant.

	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The most seriously injured victim of last  
week's shootings at Heritage High School says she bears no ill will 
toward the boy who shot six of his schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>

released from Hughes Spalding Hospital in Atlanta on Tuesday. ``I 
don't like what he did, but I won't go hating him.''

	T.J. Solomon, also 15, was charged in Thursday's shooting. Ed  
Garland, the boy's lawyer, has said the defense does not contest 
that he was the shooter.

	Stephanie, who was shot in the abdomen, was the last of the  
victims to be released.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Want Void on Arena Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- One day after prospective team owner Mario  
Lemieux offered to buy out the Pittsburgh Penguins' Civic Arena 
lease, the team asked U.S. Bankruptcy Court today to void the arena 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease with SMG, the management company that also runs Three  
Rivers Stadium, costs the Penguins an NHL-high $6 million a year to 
play in the league's oldest arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The cumbersome contract, which resulted from past renegotiations  
between SMG and former Penguins owner Howard Baldwin, is viewed as 
one of the major impediments to keeping the bankrupt team in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the motion filed by the Penguins' lawyers with U.S.  
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz would allow any potential buyer 
-- most likely, Lemieux -- to negotiate a new lease to play in the 
38-year-old arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the judge and the NHL have identified the lease as the  
key to the case and the key to saving the Penguins for 
Pittsburgh,'' said Greg Cribbs, the Penguins' vice president and 
legal counsel. ``We believe this motion opens another door of 
opportunity to make the franchise economically viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's group offered Tuesday to buy out the remaining eight  
seasons on the lease for $15 million. SMG president Wes Westley 
said that the lease was not for sale, but that concessions were 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's group and SMG then met Wednesday to discuss the lease,  
with Lemieux offering to retain SMG as the arena manager even if 
the lease is bought out. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, whose revised reorganization plan was praised Tuesday  
by the NHL, said the current lease with SMG will not work. And the 
NHL has said that no potential buyer is interested in keeping the 
team in Pittsburgh under the current terms of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh, the team's TV rights holder,  
have filed their own reorganization plan in bankruptcy court. But 
the NHL has expressed concern about that plan because Fox is an 
investor in the New York Rangers, and league rules bar an entity 
from holding a financial stake in more than one team. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz has scheduled a June 24 confirmation hearing on  
Lemieux's plan. The NHL also has asked that its own plan, called a 
backup in case the Lemieux bid is rejected, be placed on the same 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's plan calls for an unidentified investor, believed  
to be NFL and NBA team owner Paul Allen, to pay $85 million to 
creditors. The investor then would move the team, presumably to 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL originally wanted the Penguins' situation settled by May  
31 so the team could begin selling tickets and the final schedule 
for the 1999-2000 season could be given to its clubs. The league 
has since backed off that deadline and now wants a resolution by 
June 27.

<HEADLINE> Cloned Sheep May Age Prematurely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dolly the cloned sheep is only 3, but her genes are already  
showing signs of wear and she may be susceptible to premature aging 
and disease -- all because she was copied from a 6-year-old animal, 
Scottish researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no direct evidence that Dolly will die prematurely. She  
is healthy and has delivered lambs in the past two years. But the 
DNA in her cells shows signs of wear typically found in an older 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Geneticists said the finding, published in Thursday's issue of  
the journal Nature, provides further evidence that cloning, at 
least for now, has its practical limits. And it adds to the ethical 
and medical concerns about the consequences of cloning humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only years from now, it would be a relevant question to ask if  
a cloned child would have a shorter life span even though it 
appears to be healthy and normal,'' said Marie DeBernadino, a 
biologist at the Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Dolly became the first large animal to be cloned from  
genetic material extracted from an adult cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists removed the DNA from a ewe's egg and inserted DNA  
from a cell taken from the ewe's udder. The bioengineered embryo 
was implanted in the ewe's womb, and Dolly developed as a clone. 
Her birth at the Roslin Institute in Scotland created an 
international sensation when it was announced in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, researchers at PPL Therapeutics, a biotechnology company  
associated with Roslin, have determined that the ``caps'' on 
Dolly's DNA that regulate a cell's life span are shorter than 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	All chromosomes are capped with tips known as telomeres that  
prevent a cell's genetic code from fraying. When the telomere 
finally wears down after repeated cell division, it signals the 
cell to self-destruct as part of the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, geneticists say Dolly could age faster and run a  
higher-than-usual risk of cancer, which occurs when cells fail to 
self-destruct and begin uncontrolled growth. Sheep normally live 
about 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recall when the news first came out, somebody said that  
Dolly was a sheep in lamb's clothing,'' said Jerry Shay, a 
molecular biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center in Dallas. ``I think that's an appropriate quote now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Alan Colman, research director for PPL Therapeutics,  
said that the link between telomere wear and aging is not 
well-established. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Dolly's breeders could have steered clear of the problem  
by starting with DNA from a younger sheep -- or even a sheep embryo. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers said the finding does not have serious  
implications for agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers, for example, might use cloned animals as genetic  
factories to reproduce desired traits in their herds. But they are 
likely to mate clones with uncloned animals because cloning is more 
expensive and less reliable than other breeding methods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the cloned animals would have a slightly shorter  
lifespan,'' said George Seidel, a livestock geneticist at Colorado 
State University. ``But their offspring would be normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colman said the only problem posed by telomere fraying could  
come if a clone were made from a clone, ``but we see no reason why 
sequential cloning would be necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sequential cloning would be like making a copy on a photocopying  
machine, and then putting the new copy into the machine and 
repeating the process. Eventually, the copies become illegible. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic tests are continuing on Dolly's offspring, including  
Bonnie, born in 1998, and a set of triplets born this year. Bonnie 
was conceived naturally and half of her DNA came from her father. 
She shows no significant telomere shortening.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today for a second  
consecutive day on selling by overseas investors, retreating from 
last week's seven month high. Japanese stocks turned mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.10 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.62  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 122.70 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 16.29  
points, or 0.10 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,230.52 
points. On Tuesday, the average shed 176.26 points, or 1.08 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell against the yen in Tokyo  
as U.S. funds cut overbought dollar positions, but buying from 
Japanese life insurers and trust banks at around 121.50 yen 
supported the downside, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar started the Asian day on a weak note after another  
big drop on Wall Street overnight prompted Japanese institutional 
investors and overseas funds to sell on fears that the fall might 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. funds have long dollar positions and they want to further  
unwind the long positions,' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of 
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank, referring to the funds 
overbought in the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar remained under selling pressure as domestic investors  
continued to lock in profits following recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, the dollar rose to a seven month high against the  
yen, climbing above 124 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has now shed a total of 1.94 yen in two days. The  
currency ranged between 121.60 yen and 122.46 yen in today's 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 129.36 yen, down  
from 130.35 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average edged higher with  
domestic institutional investors buying some blue chips, including 
Sony Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on  
the exchange's first section was down 5.36 points, or 0.41 percent, 
to 1,303.32 points. The TOPIX lost 8.83 points, or 0.67 percent, 
the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market lacks direction,'' said Yoshihiko Kuroichi, an  
analyst in the investment information department at Kankaku 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 452  
million shares, compared with Tuesday's turnover of 445.08 million 
shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 688 to 496, with 132 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.58  
points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 10,531.09 on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Perkins Will Retire, If He Has Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The old man has one more goal.  
</P>
<P>
	Sam Perkins, the oldest Indiana Pacer, has appeared in more  
playoff games without winning the championship than all but two 
players in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pacers beat the New York Knicks for the Eastern  
Conference title, he will be one series away from reaching his 
ultimate goal. And also four victories away from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running on empty now. I'm running on fumes,'' the 15-year  
veteran admitted after practice Wednesday. ``If we win this all, 
I'll never be back here again. What for?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 series against the Knicks begins Sunday in Market  
Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing as long as I can to obtain this ring and fell  
short a couple of times, so it makes sense (to retire),'' said 
Perkins, who will turn 38 next month. ``I wouldn't stay around just 
for the money. The money's good, don't get me wrong, but I would 
retire if we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins was in the Western Conference finals four times with  
Dallas, the Lakers and Seattle. The Sonics lost in the championship 
series to the Chicago Bulls in 1996, and Perkins left Seattle as a 
free agent after last season and signed a two-year contract with 
the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got Sam to help us to win some regular-season games, but we  
got him mostly for the playoffs,'' coach Larry Bird said. ``If he 
can come in and hit some shots that helps us along the way, it just 
makes our bench that much stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins played in 48 of the 50 games and averaged a career-low 5  
points. He is averaging 4.7 points through seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indiana's sweeps of Milwaukee and Philadelphia in the first  
two rounds, Perkins has appeared in 135 career playoff games. The 
only players who have been in more postseason games without winning 
the championship are Utah's John Stockton (156) and Karl Malone 
(146), and they could face Perkins and the Pacers by beating 
Portland and then San Antonio in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some of the younger players are looking to Perkins  
for advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hang out with him a lot,'' said rookie Al Harrington, who  
was drafted last year out of high school and is the youngest Pacer. 
``Look at his longevity. That's what it's all about. He's been 
playing all these years, and that's the one thing I always ask him, 
`What did you do to stay in shape, stay healthy, all this time?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York is the fifth time in seven years the  
Pacers have played the Knicks in the playoffs. Each team has won 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in situations like that,'' Perkins said. ``I've  
watched some series with them. I'm in the trenches with them, so 
even though it's new to me as far as the rivalry, it's still the 
same old hat as far as going out there and being competitive. I had 
some battles out in the West with some rival teams all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bad-Loan Ratio Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The bad-loan ratio of Philippine  
commercial banks rose in March to its highest level since the start 
of Asia's financial crisis, mainly because of slow credit growth, 
the central bank said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-performing loan ratio of the country's 53 commercial  
banks climbed to 13.18 percent of total loans in March from 12.87 
percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	March's bad-loan ratio was sharply higher than the year-earlier  
level of 7.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said banks must extend more loans for the  
non-performing loan ratio to go down. This has not occurred despite 
a steady decline in interest rates, in which the average yield of 
benchmark 91-day treasury bills has fallen to 9.843 percent, its 
lowest in over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Risk-adverse banks continue to be wary of lending to borrowers  
still vulnerable to the effects of Asia's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Total loans in March reached $38.9 billion. Of that, $5.1  
billion were non-performing.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate Calif. Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Three days after a distraught woman was  
reported missing along with her children, the bodies of a woman and 
two children were found submerged in a car that plunged into the 
Sacramento River. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers with the Yolo County Sheriff's Department found a smashed  
car containing the bodies Tuesday in the river that serves as a 
boundary between Sacramento and Yolo counties. 
</P>
<P>
	A 31-year-old woman from nearby Walnut Grove and two children  
had been missing for three days. Police did not release their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	A man told authorities that his wife was distraught and  
threatened to harm herself and her two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong possibility this was a suicide situation, but  
we don't know that yet,'' said Sheriff Ed Prieto. 
</P>
<P>
	The automobile, a Honda compact with a smashed roof and  
shattered rear window, was spotted Tuesday morning. Prieto said the 
bodies were those of an adult female, a boy about 2 years old and a 
girl about 5 or 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	His descriptions match those of the missing family.  
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the car swerved off the isolated road Sunday  
evening and dropped down a steep 60-foot-long embankment into the 
water in an area popular with fishermen and water skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness told the Highway Patrol that ``there was a little  
boy who seemed terrified in the right front seat,'' CHP Officer 
Kelly Baraga said. Others told authorities that the woman reached 
toward the rear seat just before the car entered the river. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no tire marks on the road indicating an attempt to  
stop the car, Prieto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities noted that the narrow stretch of highway was  
dangerous. Less than an hour before the three bodies were 
recovered, a car containing a man and woman plunged into the river 
about eight miles to the south. Both were rescued.

<HEADLINE> IRL and CART Hold Unification talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The big names may be coming back to the  
Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of bitter rivalry that threatened the future of  
open-wheel racing in the United States, CART and the IRL have begun 
face-to-face talks about bringing the two racing circuits together. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations came as teams prepared for this  
weekend's race at the Indy 500, which has lost its luster during 
the feud as the best-known drivers stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that there have been some very informal talks  
with Tony George,'' said Andrew Craig, president and CEO of 
Championship Auto Racing Teams. ``However, I am not prepared to 
comment on any of the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no comment -- but also no denial of the talks -- from  
George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president who started the 
war when he formed the Indy Racing League late in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The answering salvo from CART was to quit the Indianapolis 500,  
leaving George to stage the world's most famous auto race with 
virtually no stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences between the two circuits once seemed  
insurmountable, with totally different chassis and engine rules in 
place. But the last few weeks have brought hope that a settlement 
could be achieved as early as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his differences with George, who started the IRL as a  
low-cost, ovals-only alternative to CART, Craig says a merger would 
be in the best interests of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's CART's position that open-wheel racing would benefit  
greatly from having one series instead of two,'' Craig said. ``I 
think everyone in the industry would like to see it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the two circuits who spoke on condition of  
anonymity say NASCAR president Bill France Jr., the most powerful 
man in American racing, is brokering the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	France did not return phone calls, but his interest is not  
surprising. International Speedway Corp., which owns and operates 
NASCAR, recently bought Penske Motorsports, giving ISC 10 
racetracks, with at least three more planned in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC will need more than just its stock car and truck divisions  
to keep those tracks busy and prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
	The war between CART and the IRL was destructive, and the timing  
couldn't have been worse, with NASCAR's emergence as the hottest 
American sport of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	CART has been solid almost since its debut in 1979, but it  
attracts far fewer fans at tracks where NASCAR also races. Although 
the Indy 500 will race Sunday before another sellout crowd 
approaching 400,000, for the most part the IRL has not drawn well 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	When CART was the one major open-wheel entity in America, its TV  
ratings were adequate and building slowly. Since the split, neither 
side has drawn more than a bare audience, except for Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	And even the once mighty Memorial Day weekend classic has  
slipped from a high rating of 8.4 in 1995 to 5.5 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But -- perhaps in hopes of a peace treaty -- ABC and ESPN haven't  
given up on either series. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN already had a deal with CART through 2001 before ABC  
re-upped for Indy last week, extending its contract through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also means ABC and ESPN will show the rest of the  
IRL schedule each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Katz, the new president of ABC Sports and the catalyst in  
extending the current contract with George, says the biggest 
problem facing the open-wheel folks is building stars. 
</P>
<P>
	CART is perceived to have the big names, with Michael Andretti  
and Al Unser Jr. still its marquee drivers. But neither has won a 
championship in five years, and former Indy winners Mario Andretti, 
Bobby Rahal, Emerson Fittipaldi, Rick Mears, Al Unser Sr. and Danny 
Sullivan -- have retired in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the biggest stars stayed with CART, the IRL had a shaky  
foundation. Its one big-name driver, two-time Indy 500 winner Arie 
Luyendyk, will race Sunday for the final time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got to build stars,'' Katz said. ``You've got  
to have a reason to root for or even against people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsorships, which supply most of the money for race teams,  
also are a problem for open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	CART still has more than $400 million in sponsorship backing,  
but many of the long-term contracts will end in either 2000 or 
2001, with no guarantees they will be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL, which started from nothing in 1995, has built perhaps  
$50 million in sponsorship, but with minuscule TV ratings and 
little identity it continues to be a hard sell to corporate 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR, massively promoted and armed with high TV ratings,  
already has about $500 million annually in sponsorship money and 
continues to grow at a fast rate, drawing sponsors away from the 
open-wheel divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	PPG Industries, the longtime series sponsor for CART, is one of  
the few backers involved in both open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've managed to keep a foot in both camps, feeling that there  
was value on each side of the fence,'' said Mike Sack, PPG's 
director of motorsports. ``That's a difficult position to be in, 
not only from the standpoint of money, but also politically 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know one sponsor that doesn't think peace between the  
series is a good idea.''

<HEADLINE>  Manchester United Wins Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Two rapid-fire goals with the clock  
officially run out gave Manchester United the most prized title in 
European club soccer and a unique place in the sport's long 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	In an amazing finish, substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole  
Gunnar Solksjaer scored during injury time as United beat Bayern 
Munich 2-1 Wednesday for the Champions League title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it,'' United manager Alex Ferguson said.  
``That's football. You never give in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first top European championship for the storied Reds  
from England since 1968, and left them the first team from soccer's 
birthplace to win the league, FA Cup and continental champions 
titles in one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three other clubs -- Celtic Glasgow in 1967, Ajax Amsterdam  
in 1972 and PSV Eindhoven in 1988 -- have swept the triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Manchester also became the first nonchampion to win the  
Champions Cup. It finished second in the English Premier League to 
Arsenal last season but made the top-level European tournament this 
season when the field was expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern Munich, which also made the field through expansion  
before winning the Bundesliga this season, controlled most of the 
play after taking a 1-0 lead in the sixth minute on a free kick by 
Mario Basler. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sheringham and Solksjaer were inserted to shake things up,  
and they did just that, leaving Bayern players slumped and stunned 
on the field moments after Solksjaer's winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teddy and Ole Gunnar repaid my faith in them,'' Ferguson said.  
``It's fantastic. I'm so proud of my players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Manchester goals came after corner kicks by David Beckham.  
On the first, Sheringham picked up a Bayern clearance at the edge 
of the penalty area and twisted around to send the ball into the 
low corner. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second, Solksjaer pounced on a ball headed toward the  
Bayern goal and kicked it into the net from close range. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team played so well, we had to score some goals because of  
the pressure we had the whole game,'' Solksjaer said. ``Someone had 
to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30,000 United fans among the sellout crowd of 90,000  
at Barcelona's Camp Nou Stadium sang in joy long after the final 
whistle as Manchester players went around the field, displaying the 
coveted cup. 
</P>
<P>
	It was quiet a change from the way the game started. Things  
could not have gone more wrong for Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern striker Carsten Jancker was brought down just outside the  
United penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	From 17 yards out, Basler took the free kick, sending a swerving  
shot around the United wall and finding the blind side of 
goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, playing his final match before leaving 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Bayern players who stood at the edge of the United wall  
moved quickly away as the shot went past them. Schmeichel made no 
move to stop the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer, the star of the team that  
won three straight titles between 1974 and 1976, called it a 
``horrible defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Only seconds separated us from victory,'' he said. ``We  
controlled the last 20 minutes and we could have extended our lead. 
But Manchester deserved to win.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Confronting IBM Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. will get its final  
opportunity to confront a government witness before its trial 
resumes when it questions an IBM executive today who negotiated the 
computer maker's sales contracts for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges as part of its antitrust case that  
Microsoft bullied the nation's computer manufacturers, who must buy 
Windows at a reasonable wholesale price to survive in a highly 
competitive industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Norris, a former software director at IBM Corp., was to be  
questioned today at the federal courthouse in Raleigh, N.C. He 
negotiated important sales contracts for Windows in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris' deposition was the second of three scheduled this week.  
The government will depose a Microsoft witness, software executive 
Gordon Eubanks, on Friday in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters are allowed to attend the depositions under a 1913 law  
covering antitrust depositions, which are normally conducted in 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers contend that Microsoft, whose Windows  
software runs most of the world's personal computers, wields its 
prices to punish its enemies and reward its friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the exact price that Microsoft charges computer makers  
for Windows is one of the industry's most closely guarded secrets, 
previous testimony indicated that favored companies, such as Compaq 
Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., generally pay less than 
IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers indicate Norris will testify about threats  
Microsoft made over IBM's support of rival products, such as its 
own OS/2 operating system and Internet browser software from 
Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's OS/2 operating system was considered a potential rival to  
Windows until 1994, when its popularity waned. 
</P>
<P>
	When Norris negotiated his first IBM contract for Windows, a  
year later, Microsoft was aggressively pushing its own Internet 
browser over Netscape's, which was far more popular. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported that Microsoft told IBM at the time  
that if it continued to support those rival products then Microsoft 
wouldn't sell Windows for less than its retail price, a decision 
that would have devastated IBM's computer sales. The newspaper did 
not say where it got the information. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said the company licensed  
Windows to IBM ``at a competitive price, and IBM continued to ship 
a variety of competing software programs alongside the Windows 
operating system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM and the Justice Department declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Norris will be the government's second witness during the  
rebuttal phase of the trial, which resumes Tuesday after a 13-week 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers will use Norris to refute testimony from Microsoft  
executives, including Joachim Kempin, a senior vice president who 
negotiated contracts for the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the government named Norris as a witness, legal experts  
had questioned why the Justice Department had failed to persuade 
any computer maker to testify about Microsoft's influence.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices slipped Thursday morning as  
investors turned cautious amid corporate earnings announcements. 
The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 19.64 points,  
or 0.12 percent, to 16,210.88 at the end of the morning session. On 
Wednesday, the average gained 16.29 points, or 0.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.42 yen, up 0.32 yen from late in Tokyo on  
Wednesday and also above its late New York level of 122.17 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started moderately higher  
following a rise on Wall Street, but moved into negative territory 
by mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market lacks energy to test higher levels,'' said Kazunori  
Jinnai, deputy general manager of the equity department at Daiwa 
Securities SB Capital Markets. ``There is a lack of incentive to 
trade, and volume is low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contributing to the low volume and lack of movement was caution  
on the part of institutional investors amid earnings announcements, 
market players said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 171.07  
points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,702.16. The high-tech-heavy Nasdaq 
Composite Index jumped 1.9 percent to 2,427.17 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.20 points, or 0.01 percent, to 1,303.12. 
The TOPIX closed down 5.36 points, or 0.41 percent, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher against the yen as  
some Japanese institutional investors covered, short, or oversold 
dollar positions. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 128.09 yen, down  
from 129.36 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.4600 percent from 1.4150 percent late Wednesday, driving its 
price down to 99.47 yen from 99.86 yen.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Diabetes Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diabetics are getting a long-awaited new  
treatment that promises to help control their disease with less 
risk -- and a cheaper price tag -- than a popular but sometimes 
dangerous drug. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals said Avandia, approved for  
sale by the Food and Drug Administration, will reach pharmacy 
shelves within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have awaited Avandia as a possible alternative to the  
competing diabetes drug, Rezulin, which has destroyed some 
patients' livers. And now that Avandia is here, the question is 
whether the FDA will continue to allow the unfettered sale of 
Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	The two drugs have not been directly compared to see if they're  
equally effective, FDA endocrinology chief Dr. John Jenkins said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most drugs that treat Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes work by  
increasing insulin production or lowering blood sugar. Avandia and 
Rezulin, in contrast, are related chemicals that resensitize the 
body to insulin -- thus targeting the underlying cause of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, sold since 1997, has helped many people who failed  
other treatments, and an estimated 750,000 people use it. But it 
also can damage the liver: The FDA lists 43 Rezulin patients who 
suffered acute liver failure and warns that they may account for 
only 10 percent of Rezulin-related liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Avandia, in contrast, has not shown signs of liver damage in  
studies of over 4,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	No one can say for certain that Avandia will never damage  
diabetics' livers, the FDA warned Wednesday. If there is a rare 
side effect, it may appear only after hundreds of thousands of 
people try the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	So the FDA stressed that diabetics who try Avandia should have a  
liver test before beginning the new drug and every two months 
during the first year of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we know more, it's prudent to monitor your patients to  
be safe,'' the FDA's Jenkins cautioned. ``We don't know yet that 
(Avandia) doesn't have the side effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone with symptoms suggesting liver problems should contact a  
doctor for a liver test, the FDA warned. Symptoms include 
unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and 
dark urine or jaundice. If jaundice occurs, Avandia should be 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	With Avandia's approval, the question is Rezulin's future. The  
agency's scientific advisers said in March that Rezulin should 
remain on the market but be more tightly controlled so that only 
people who need it the most use it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand, though, that Rezulin has a place in  
the treatment of diabetes. ... We're trying to manage the risk,'' 
Jenkins said. ``I hope we're going to be ready to make some 
decisions on that very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline said it would sell Avandia for a cheaper price than  
its competitor, setting the wholesale price of Avandia's 
recommended starting dose at $2 a day. The published wholesale 
price of Rezulin is $2.48 to $3.95 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Avandia, known chemically as rosiglitazone, is only for Type 2  
diabetes, which afflicts about 14 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Avandia also can cause side effects, including mild to moderate  
swelling, an increase in blood cholesterol and anemia, but the FDA 
said the problems usually were not severe enough to require 
stopping the drug.

<HEADLINE> Florida To Flood Fire-Filled Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Mucky, smoke-billowing fires had  
authorities manning the pumps as they tried to bring an end to 
flames that scorched thousands of acres in south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	South Florida Water Management officials planned to install  
30-inch pumps today to flood the burning muck and douse the flames 
in the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven pumps, each capable of spewing at least 25,000 gallons per  
minute, will be arranged in a horseshoe to funnel water from canals 
and over levees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the muck that's putting out all the smoke. The muck fire  
will not go out unless it's flooded,'' said Sue Congelosi, a 
spokeswoman for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke from the fire cut visibility to zero over much of a  
30-mile stretch of U.S. 27. One person was killed and 20 others 
injured Tuesday when five tractor-trailers crashed into an 
overturned truck on the highway in southwestern Palm Beach County. 
</P>
<P>
	About 26,000 acres of flaming sawgrass, brush and muck in the  
management area sent heavy smoke into the skies for a fifth day. 
</P>
<P>
	Forestry rangers believe lightning ignited the fire Friday but  
it went unnoticed until Sunday when west winds blew the smoke 
toward the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke from the fire would likely linger for another day or two  
since rain was not expected until the latter part of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters working the massive blaze dropped ping pong balls  
filled with explosive chemicals from a helicopter to set a back 
fire that would help contain the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was contained by late Tuesday, said Bernadine Thomas,  
duty officer with the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Florida's Baker County, about 50 miles west of  
Jacksonville, firefighters battled a remote blaze that swelled to 
nearly 15,000 acres in the Osceola National Forest. The fire jumped 
across Florida Highway 2 and into the 400,000-acre Okefenokee swamp 
that extends into Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, 3,636 wildfires have scorched 274,969 acres.

<HEADLINE> Women Fill Navy Academy's Top Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The No. 1 graduate at the Naval Academy  
this year was a woman, as was No. 2, not to mention Nos. 4, 6, and 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the top 10 Naval Academy graduates were women, who made  
up only 15 percent of the Class of 1999 that graduated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it was the best showing yet for women at the academy,  
where class standing depends on more than just good grades. Academy 
officials also consider military competency and conduct (given 
about 25 percent weight) and athletic achievements (10 percent) to 
determine the order of merit. 
</P>
<P>
	Women may have tried harder ``to show we can succeed in the  
military,'' said Josephine Nguyen, who finished second in the class 
of 868 and will enter medical school at Stanford University in the 
fall with hopes of becoming a Navy flight surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The top graduate was Mary Godfrey of Dousman, Wis., who was a  
member of the gymnastics team and the glee club in addition to 
doing so well in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nguyen, 21, said her decision to enter the Naval Academy was  
influenced by her father, an officer in the South Vietnamese Navy 
before coming to the United States, and her 25-year-old sister, 
Minh-Tu, who also got her degree Wednesday and was commissioned as 
a Marine second lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We grew up with my father telling stories about his Navy  
career,'' Ms. Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also was motivated by a sense of duty to her adopted  
country: ``You should give something back to the country which has 
provided so much for your family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commencement address was delivered by Defense Secretary  
William Cohen, who offered a vigorous defense of U.S. involvement 
in Kosovo and Serbia, where he said a struggle is taking place 
``for the future shape of civilized society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has taken the  
world ``into the heart of darkness,'' and the United States ``could 
not bear witness to this murder and mayhem with indifference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO ``decided to wage an air campaign to achieve our goals. It  
was the right decision then, and it's the right course now,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gets No Break From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton played a round of golf and  
went biking with the first lady Wednesday on a secluded plantation 
in northern Florida. But it wasn't all fun in the sun for the 
commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton received his daily security briefing on the Yugoslavia  
campaign, called the Italian prime minister and named Nobel 
laureate Elie Wiesel a special envoy to Macedonia to check up on 
refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will stay in touch, as you've already seen today,'' White  
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. ``But it's important from 
time to time to take a chance to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any president vacationing during a military conflict opens  
himself to questions about priorities. President Bush was 
criticized for taking two weeks off to golf and fish during the 
build up to the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told reporters as he headed to his summer home in  
Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1991 that ``what you don't want to do is 
appear to be held hostage in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's vacation site offered one advantage over the coast  
of Maine: there was little chance any media pictures would be taken 
of his leisurely pursuits on the densely wooded, 7,500 acre White 
Oak Plantation located 20 miles north of Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The vacation was planned long before release of a report on  
China's espionage was released Tuesday by a special committee led 
by Reps. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norman Dicks, D-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Nicholson, the Republican National Committee chairman,  
said through a spokesman that it was appropriate Clinton was 
vacationing at a nature preserve: ``He's joining the ostriches with 
his head in the sand the day after the Cox committee exposed the 
worst case of espionage in U.S. history under his watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has stressed that most of the spying detailed in  
the report occurred in the 1980s, when Republicans held the 
presidency, and Lockhart noted that Clinton spoke to the report in 
Texas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any worry on our part about the  
appearances here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived Tuesday at  
the private wildlife conservation area inhabited by giraffes, 
cheetahs and white rhinos. The Clintons were traveling without 
daughter Chelsea, who is still in school at Stanford University. 
The president's Labrador, Buddy, did make the journey. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak is located off an unmarked dirt road about 20 miles  
north of Jacksonville and sports a nine-hole golf course and a 
swimming pool, as well as 14 dwellings. The Clintons were staying 
at Roseland, a two-story, cedar paneled, five-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers it all, with the ability to get away from what  
they're normally faced with on a work day,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president brought a bagful of books to help pass the time,  
including ``Sudden Mischief'' by Robert Parker and Carl Hiassen's 
``Lucky You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alemma for  
about 30 minutes on Tuesday night about the NATO campaign against 
the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving his briefing Wednesday morning from a National  
Security Council staffer traveling with him, he called Wiesel, a 
Holocaust survivor and author, and asked him to travel to Macedonia 
on May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to get a sense of the conditions there and have a  
chance to talk to some of the refugees about the conditions on the 
ground,'' Lockhart said. Wiesel will report back directly to 
Clinton after his trip.

<HEADLINE> Barnesandnoble.com IPO Lags Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com's much-anticipated initial  
public offering of stock received a subdued welcome on Wall Street 
Tuesday, the latest sign that the dot.com craze in the stock market 
may be waning. 
</P>
<P>
	Although shares of the online bookseller rose 27 percent above  
their offering price, they failed to triple or quadruple in value 
like many Internet peers have done in their first days of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com shares went public at $18 per share and  
closed at $22.93 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors just aren't going after Internet stocks like the  
used to,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ``The market is moving 
away from sex appeal and more towards substance, and we are really 
seeing that in the prices of Internet stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks, especially IPOs, have been the darling of Wall  
Street for the past year, with investors embracing just about any 
company with online operations or even online plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appetite for cyber-stocks appears to be weakening. In  
recent weeks, many of the biggest names on the Web -- including 
``stalwarts'' such as Amazon.com and eBay -- have seen their stocks 
slump, some falling as much as 50 percent from their peaks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Internet index, a collection of 40  
companies, fell nearly 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there's been a cool response to new Internet  
issues. Gail Bronson, an analyst with the newsletter IPO Monitor, 
estimates that of the 50 or so IPOs this year, most companies' 
stock are trading below their first-day highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Online toy retailer eToys, for instance, more than quadrupled in  
its first day of trading last Thursday, soaring from its offering 
price of $20 to close at $76.56 1/4 on the Nasdaq. But since then, it 
has fallen more than 30 percent from that peak. 
</P>
<P>
	And the relatively tepid demand for barnesandnoble.com shows  
that investors aren't as willing to throw their money into Internet 
IPOs as many clamored to do in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are putting more emphasis on the quality of the  
businesses that they are putting their money into,'' Belski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you buy Alcoa, you know they make aluminum. If you buy  
3M, you know they make Post-It notes and lots of other things,'' he 
said. ``Where as with the Internet, there are more questions about 
whether these businesses will make money and be successful in the 
longer term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many online companies, barnesandnoble.com is a  
fast-growing, but money-losing business. The company, in a filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it lost $20.2 
million in the first quarter, up from a loss of $9.5 million a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, however, rose to $32.3 million, an increase of 25 percent  
from the fourth quarter of 1998 and up 259 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But barnesandnoble.com still lags behind Amazon.com, which is  
quickly building itself into an online shopping hub with a broad 
array of books, music, video, gifts and auctions. Amazon's customer 
tally was 8 million at the end of the first quarter, compared with 
1.7 million at barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	With its offering of 25 million shares or 18 percent of the  
company, barnesandnoble.com raised $421.6 million, which it plans 
to use to expand its features, staff and services and pay for more 
marketing and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. and German media conglomerate  
Bertelsmann AG each own 41 percent of barnesandnoble.com, which 
currently sells books, magazines and software and a limited supply 
of music and video products. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts still believe the stock has potential because it is a  
well-known name and investors have long liked the 
online-bookselling concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will not be a stagnant operation,'' said David Menlow,  
president of IPO Financial Network in Millburn, N.J. ``I believe 
barnesandnoble.com will transmogrify into a very different site 
than it is currently and people will be surprised at what they 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a year that plans have been announced  
to sell shares of barnesandnoble.com. Last August, Barnes &AMP; Noble 
announced its intention to take its online operation public, but 
decided to postpone the offering after Bertelsmann purchased half 
the company.

<HEADLINE> Casino Could Be Set Up at O'Hare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- The millions of travelers who find  
themselves at O'Hare Airport with a couple of hours to kill may 
soon be able to fill them by playing blackjack or pouring coins 
into slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Legislature has approved casino gambling in Cook  
County, and the likely location is in Rosemont -- minutes from the 
world's second-busiest airport with 200,000 passengers a day. 
Atlanta Hartsfield Airport is the busiest. 
</P>
<P>
	No other major U.S. air hub has a casino so close, although at  
airports in Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., gamblers can start losing 
money at slot machines located right in the terminals. 
</P>

	``We have the opportunity to attract these visitors from across  
the nation who fly into O'Hare,'' said Peter Lombardi, the 
executive director of the Rosemont Convention Bureau. ``If they're 
delayed two or three hours, they can hop in a cab or the train and 
be here in a minute. Then they can get back on a plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Travelers coming through O'Hare or stopping in Chicago may even  
extend their vacations by hours or even a day to give them time to 
make a run to the casinos, said Barbara Cappaert, a gambling 
industry analyst with KDP Investment Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a unique situation,'' Ms. Cappaert said. ``I  
could see it as something like the Mall of America (near 
Minneapolis), that's 10 minutes from the airport and they have 
shuttles over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Rosemont casino is sure to attract hordes of Chicagoans  
because it would be closer than other Illinois casinos, and 
Rosemont is accessible by the city's elevated trains. Whether a 
casino near the airport will pull most of its money from travelers' 
wallets is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland Heights, Mo., is a suburb of 25,000 people about a  
10-minute drive from the St. Louis airport. Like Rosemont, it has a 
thriving hospitality industry, with 1 million visitors a year 
staying in its hotels, said City Administrator Mark Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, ``the casinos estimate perhaps 20 percent of their  
patrons come from outside of the immediate region,'' Levin said. 
``Most of the money comes from in and around the St. Louis metro 
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling critics disregard the notion that casinos attract  
tourists and help boost the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gambling really hasn't brought in tourism,'' said Steve Taylor  
of Casino Watch, an anti-gambling organization. ``All you're 
getting is local convenience gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, says he will probably sign the  
bill allowing casino gambling in Cook County. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten casinos have been licensed to operate in Illinois. Only one  
licenseholder would be eligible to take advantage of the 
Legislature's action -- the owners of a failed riverboat casino in 
East Dubuque, Ill. Rosemont officials are eager for their business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosemont casino would be allowed to stay permanently  
situated in a makeshift moat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Don Stephens has pledged to share gambling proceeds with  
neighboring communities, and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley 
endorses a Rosemont casino.

<HEADLINE> NY Democrat: First Lady Is Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Democratic Party county chairman says he knows  
the answer to the big question in New York politics: Will Hillary 
Rodham Clinton run? 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Gigante, Staten Island party chairman, said Tuesday that  
Mrs. Clinton has decided to run for the Senate from New York. 
Gigante said Mrs. Clinton told him so at a New York City 
fund-raiser Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mrs. Clinton's top adviser denied the first lady told  
Gigante any such thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gigante said he and his wife were making small talk with Mrs.  
Clinton when he brought up the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ended by saying, `Do you have any good news for Staten  
Island,' and she said, `Yes,''' Gigante reported. ```Does that mean 
that you're running?' And she said, `Yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the exchange, Mrs. Clinton's adviser Harold Ickes  
said that according to Mrs. Clinton, the first lady told Gigante 
that she is thinking it over and hasn't decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate seat is being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan. New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is among the 
Republicans thinking of entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is on vacation with President Clinton in Florida  
for the rest of the week. After she returns, advisers expect her to 
either rule out a Senate race or announce formation of an 
exploratory committee.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Won't Block Tyson's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson doesn't figure to waste any time  
getting back into the ring. And Nevada boxing officials apparently 
won't get in his way. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tyson out of jail once again, his advisers and handlers are  
looking for him to fight as early as Aug. 21, and possibly once 
more before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aug. 21 is certainly a date we're looking at,'' said Jay  
Larkin, who runs boxing for the Showtime network. ``Hopefully in 
the next couple of days, we'll have something concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top Nevada boxing official, meanwhile, said Tuesday that  
Tyson's no contest plea that landed him in a Maryland jail will not 
be held against him. Dr. James Nave, vice chairman of the Nevada 
Athletic Commission, said Tyson likely won't face additional 
questions from state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won a license in October after extensive hearings to  
replace the one taken from him for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
It does not expire until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is that he has a license,'' Nave said. ``I don't  
see the need for a hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers, caught off guard by his sudden release from  
jail Monday, were scrambling to make arrangements to get the 
fighter back in the ring as quickly as possible, possibly against 
Axel Schulz or Brian Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, whose last fight was a fifth round knockout of Francois  
Botha on Jan. 16, had his comeback interrupted when he was jailed 
in Maryland for assaulting two motorists following a traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 3 1/2 months of a year-long sentence before being  
released on parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agreed that while Mike Tyson was in jail, we wouldn't  
make any plans for his fights,'' Larkin said. ``Now, he's been out 
only 24 hours and we just haven't gotten to that point yet. But 
we're going to start right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the sense of urgency to get Tyson back into the ring  
is the fact that his advisers want him to fight twice this year. 
And, because prime pay-per-view dates in September and November are 
already blocked out because of two big fights, the options for 
fight dates are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad are expected to fight on  
pay-per-view on Sept. 18, while Holyfield and Lennox Lewis meet on 
Nov. 13 in their rematch on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Tyson with the option of fighting in August and  
again in December. An alternative, though, could be for Tyson's 
fight to be a network show and not a pay-per-view, something his 
handlers are also reportedly considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The thinking behind putting a Tyson fight on Showtime itself or  
even selling it to a major network is that it would be tough to 
sell Tyson again in a fight against someone similar to Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Tyson looked rusty and confused in the ring  
against Botha in what was his first fight in 19 months since the 
Holyfield biting incident. Plans before he was sent to jail were 
for him to fight at least four times this year, and there is 
concern about what kind of boxing shape and condition he will be 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, whose network has a contract with Tyson and televises  
his pay-per-view fights, said discussions about an opponent will 
likely wait until Tyson gets in a gym and has a few workouts so his 
trainers can see what he looks like. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson remains one of the biggest pay-per-view attractions,  
although the number of homes that bought his fight with Botha 
slipped to about 750,000 from more than 1 million for several of 
his other fights.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Urge Attention to Euro Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Many of the 11 countries in  
Europe's new common currency pact aren't doing enough to comply 
with an accord aimed at ensuring the stability and growth of their 
economies, the Dutch Central Bank warned Wednesday in its annual 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact calls on countries in the ``euro zone'' -- Austria,  
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain -- to have budgets that are nearly 
balanced or have a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank didn't specify which countries are not in line  
with the targets. But other economic forecasts have said Germany, 
France and Italy are among the larger countries unlikely to meet 
the key requirement for monetary union: limiting their budget 
deficits to 2 percent of gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this already vulnerable budgetary environment, it is  
disappointing to note that, on the whole, countries are 
insufficiently complying with the pact,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said a more ambitious policy on deficit reduction would  
help offset cyclical downturns or other economic setbacks that 
could weaken the fledgling currency, which made its debut Jan. 1 on 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Netherlands, the Central Bank said it was unfortunate  
that the budget deficit is expected to rise to 1.7 percent of GDP 
after having dropped to 0.9 percent in both 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank called the Dutch government's target of a deficit of 1  
percent of GDP in 2002, based on an average economic growth rate of 
2.25 percent per year, ``insufficiently ambitious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands' three-party coalition government collapsed last  
week, and Central Bank President Nout Wellink warned that prolonged 
political instability could make it more difficult for the Dutch to 
comply with the stability pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The three leading Dutch political parties are currently involved  
in an effort to restore the coalition. If they fail, general 
elections are likely to be held in September or October.

<HEADLINE> China Spy Furor May Be Overreaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The loss of U.S. nuclear secrets to China  
represents, at worst, a marginal threat to national security, 
according to arms control advocates and defense experts whose views 
have been largely drowned out in the furor over Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	China has yet to field a weapon a decade after it allegedly  
stole design information from U.S. nuclear weapons labs, they say. 
Some of the information Beijing's spies collected is now 
declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the world of nuclear strategy, a somewhat improved  
Chinese nuclear arsenal may actually add to superpower stability, 
these critics argue. They say if China has greater mobility and 
confidence in its weapons, it will have less worry of losing its 
arsenal to a first strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served two  
Republican presidents, cautioned Wednesday against overreacting to 
the espionage in a way that so demonizes China that it hurts U.S. 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	He told senators that even with stolen U.S. nuclear secrets it  
would take China 15 years to develop the capacity to manufacture 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about the deterioration in our relations with  
China,'' Kissinger told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Such assessments of Chinese espionage have been overshadowed  
partly because Democrats and Republicans alike are anxious to 
position themselves as concerned and responsive to the perceived 
threat -- though some Democrats have said predictions in this week's 
congressional report were written in a ``worst-case fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the alarmist rhetoric on Capitol Hill is the fact that  
Tuesday's report that started it all is filled with conditional 
phrases: China ``could'' or ``may'' take detrimental actions ``if 
the PRC decides to develop'' weapons it currently does not possess. 
</P>
<P>
	``The depiction of China as an impending nuclear nemesis just  
does not accord with the facts,'' said Robert Norris, a nuclear 
weapons expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an arms 
control and environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the report hinges on a prediction that China will soon  
test and field improved weapons based in part on secrets stolen 
from U.S. nuclear weapons labs. For example, China is developing a 
mobile DF-31 missile that the report says could be tested later 
this year and fielded in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 15-year-old weapons system already. It's never been  
tested,'' said Norris. ``It may be tested this year. I think five 
years ago I said the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who chaired the House committee  
that wrote the report, said nothing was blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not engage in opinion. We reported only facts, and that  
is why we could agree with one another,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	One fact not in dispute is that the U.S. arsenal is vastly  
superior to Beijing's. China now has 20 single-warhead ICBMs 
capable of reaching North America. The United States has about 
6,000 nuclear warheads that could reach China. 
</P>
<P>
	To field improved nuclear weapons with any confidence, China  
would have to conduct several explosive tests per weapon, said 
Daryl Kimble of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	But China has signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a pact  
about to be considered for ratification by the National Peoples 
Assembly. The treaty bans all nuclear testing, including 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Kimble is concerned about how Chinese weapons  
modernization might harm regional stability, particularly the 
prospect that an expanding and improving Chinese arsenal could 
accelerate plans in India to deploy nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent review panel established by the CIA also warned  
that Beijing may be more willing to sell more sophisticated weapons 
to such countries as Iran and Pakistan as its own arsenal improves. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the CIA damage estimate cautions that the agency could  
not tell how much of China's nuclear technology gains stemmed from 
stolen secrets rather than open scientific material. 
</P>
<P>
	And it added, ``To date, the aggressive Chinese collection  
effort has not resulted in any apparent modernization of their 
deployed strategic force or any new nuclear weapons deployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI, meanwhile, has told lawmakers it has no evidence that  
classified nuclear weapons ``legacy codes'' moved by an espionage 
suspect into an unsecured computer system were seen by any 
foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, said  
even if they were stolen, the codes -- numerical representations of 
nuclear explosions -- are of limited value. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the information China allegedly received through  
espionage has since been declassified. In 1985 a U.S. scientist 
provided China with data on inertial confinement fusion lasers, 
technology that can be used in nuclear simulations. The Energy 
Department declassified the technology in 1993.

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyes Estate Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Any chance for estate tax relief in this  
year's Republican tax bill must overcome the claim by opponents 
that it primarily benefits the rich, GOP lawmakers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, the argument we have to fight against is 'tax cuts  
for the wealthy,''' Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., told a coalition 
of media, business and public interest groups that met Tuesday to 
map out strategy for repealing or phasing out the tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, led by Seattle Times Publisher Frank Blethen, is  
running a series of print ads intending to show that the tax most 
hurts small business operators and farmers who are unable to pass 
on assets to their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said chances are good that estate  
tax relief will be included in a GOP tax bill, which lawmakers 
intend to put together in July. But she said the group's ads show 
the type of ``powerful arguments'' needed to counter opponents who 
say the greatest benefit would go to the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time for you to write those editorials and op-eds  
... to shift the debate away from tax relief for rich friends,'' 
said Dunn, lead sponsor of a measure to gradually phase out the 
estate tax over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Only estates above $650,000 are taxed, at between 37 percent and  
55 percent. The levy raised about $23.1 billion in 1998, or about 
1.4 percent of the $1.7 trillion in federal tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
	Blethen, the fourth generation of his family to run the Seattle  
Times, acknowledged that repealing the tax would benefit his 
children, but said it is important in this era of newspaper chains 
that some remain independent and locally owned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are one of the last metropolitan newspapers that is  
family-owned,'' said Blethen, whose family controls 51 percent of 
the Times. ``So many newspapers are now pushing for short-term 
quarterly profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Newspaper Association and the Newspaper Association  
of America also took part in the anti-estate tax coalition's 
strategy session. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, an estate tax repeal will compete for a limited  
amount of money with a myriad of other tax-relief proposals and 
President Clinton's spending priorities, lawmakers said. Clinton 
could veto a tax cut bill that is too large, and the administration 
does not favor eliminating the estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't get immediate repeal, look for a way that you can  
get to repeal,'' Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said. ``There will be 
another chance. There will be another president.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's former ambassador to the United  
States, Jesus Silva Herzog, says he is considering running for 
mayor of Mexico City next year for the governing party, newspapers 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am ready if the rules are reasonable; I am ready to risk

<P>
	The comments appear to end speculation that he might quit the

presidency as head of an opposition alliance.

	Mexico's most famous novelist, Carlos Fuentes, recently  
suggested such an alliance with Silva Herzog as its candidate and 
the politician has been holding meetings with opposition leaders in 
recent weeks. 
</P>

published Wednesday, vowed to achieve progress in education, combat 
crime and crack down on corruption. It offered few specifics for 
achieving such goals.

<P>
	``My job as president will be to investigate government  
corruption and put corrupt people in jail,'' said Buenos Aires 
Mayor Fernando de la Rua, the alliance's presidential nominee.

United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	May 21  
</P>
<P>
	Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, on NATO bombing in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Cracks in the NATO strategy for returning hundreds of thousands  
of ethnic Albanians to their homes in Kosovo appear wider than bomb 
craters in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	It is time to try a pause in bombing.  
</P>
<P>
	Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic has demanded a halt to bombing  
so that a diplomatic solution may be attempted. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, of course, wants Milosevic's head. The problem is, it has  
never had a workable military plan to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO doesn't have to abandon its objectives if it halts the  
bombing and gives diplomacy another chance. It can enter 
negotiations while making clear to Milosevic that if he doesn't 
accede to NATO-Russian peacekeeping protection for the Kosovars and 
show a willingness to compromise on other issues, the bombing will 
resume, redoubled. 

</P>
<P>
	May 21  
</P>
<P>
	The State, Columbia, S.C., on NATO leadership:  
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder outdid Bill Clinton ... in  
giving the upper hand to Slobodan Milosevic, doing his best to 
prevent NATO from even considering ground troops as an option, much 
less as a credible threat to the Serbian leader. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's statement reflects the sincere and profound postwar  
pacifism that has been axiomatic throughout German political 
culture since 1945. The past, and shame about the past, are very 
much alive in Germany today. ... 
</P>
<P>
	So German reluctance to go to war is laudable and is to be  
encouraged on a certain level. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But the chancellor's remarks underline the desperate need for  
strong leadership within the 19-nation alliance, leadership that 
can only come from a U.S. president. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 23  
</P>
<P>
	Quad-City Times, Davenport, Iowa, on welfare and states:  
</P>
<P>
	When the states began rewriting welfare laws a few years back,  
more than a dozen of them decided to impose limits on the amount of 
public assistance new residents could collect. 
</P>
<P>
	These limits restricted the new residents' welfare checks,  
typically for about a year, to the amount they had collected in 
their previous state. Those who supported such restrictions claimed 
it would discourage border-hopping welfare recipients from choosing 
their state of residence based on the amount of welfare they could 
collect. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It also assumes, since the restrictions apply to all new  
residents, that every welfare recipient, without exception, moves 
to another state for no other reason than to reap the financial 
benefits of a more generous public-assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, the Supreme Court ruled ... that new-resident  
restrictions on welfare payments are illegal -- and each of the 15 
states that have such laws must now set them aside. That's as it 
should be. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 21  
</P>
<P>
	Marin Independent Journal, Marin County, Calif., on metal  
detectors: 
</P>
<P>
	Is it any wonder if many of us become schizoid about life in  
these Violent States of America? 
</P>
<P>
	On the one hand, police reports to the FBI reassure us that  
violent crimes have declined for the seventh year in a row. On the 
other, it's enormously unsettling when the news flashes remind us 
that yet another suburban high school has been terrorized by the 
crackle of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	The spray of bullets at Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga.,  
injured six schoolmates, one month to the day after the Littleton, 
Colo., massacre that left 12 pupils and a teacher dead. 
</P>
<P>
	It's debatable the extent to which counseling, disciplinary  
crackdowns and finger-pointing at root social causes can curtail 
this kind of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	What can be done, in the short run? The sooner our local  
authorities think seriously about installing metal-detectors and 
imposing rigid security ... the sooner our schoolchildren can be 
safer and more of us can begin to be unshackled from our fears. ... 
</P>
<P>
	As unthinkable as weapons interceptors and police presence at  
our schools can be to most of us, they should no longer be 
unthinkable to all of us who insist that our schoolchildren and 
their educators must be safe.

	The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette, on the death penalty:  
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1985, a Chicago woman was raped and stabbed to death.  
Ronald Jones confessed -- but later said police beat the confession 
out of him. Nonetheless, he was sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Now DNA tests have proven that semen in the woman's body didn't  
come from Jones, and he has been set free. He's the 12th Illinois 
death-row inmate to be cleared in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Think of that: 12 Illinois men were waiting to be killed, but  
new evidence showed they were innocent. All those right-wing, 
``pro-death'' legislators who are eager to execute prisoners should 
think earnestly about this record. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Amnesty International issued another report last week  
saying that racism pervades America's death penalty system. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 500 prisoners executed since 1977, four-fifths were accused  
of murdering whites, even though the number of white and black 
murder victims are virtually equal. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the Amnesty report, the Nebraska legislature  
voted to halt executions in that state for two years while a 
fairness study is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraska action is heartening. We hope more states consider  
joining in the effort to end the barbaric practice of killing 
people.

	The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La., on federal judge's legacy:  
</P>
<P>
	Few men have done more to change society for the better in their  
own time than Judge John Minor Wisdom, who died last week at 93. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom obviously grappled with many other difficult issues  
during his long service on the bench, but civil rights decisions 
form the legacy for which he most will be remembered. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts in the cause of civil rights could not have borne  
fruit were it not for Wisdom and others like him. They tore down 
statutory barriers that gave the weight of law to a tradition and 
culture of racial division and oppression. Their courage gave 
racial justice a foothold and an opportunity to grow in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer of racial hatred has not been fully excised in any  
part of our nation -- North, South, East or West. But that 
malignancy is in remission today, in no small part because of 
Wisdom and others who shared his courage and his dedication to the 
notion of equal justice for all. ...

<P>
	The Florida Times-Union, Jacksonville, on presidential pay  
raise: 
</P>
<P>
	A House subcommittee was quite generous when it approved  
legislation that would give the next president a $200,000-a-year 
pay raise. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This is being proposed as a cost-of-living adjustment;  
presidential pay has not gone up in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But maybe that's because presidents don't have a lot of  
expenses. Taxpayers provide the first family's room and board ... 
and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Surely the $200,000 salary and $50,000 annual expense account  
are more than adequate to cover miscellaneous expenses and pocket 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	The average American, who pays the bill, certainly gets by with  
less. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there is more to a job than the salary. Benefits and perks  
are compensation, too. So is power -- and no other job has more of 
that than the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is true the job entails a huge responsibility, the  
person in it does not always exercise responsibility commensurate 
with the salary. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it should be like any other job. If applications become  
too few, raise the amount of compensation.

</P>
<P>
	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on emergency spending:  
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators have agreed on a $15 billion  
emergency spending bill. Unfortunately, this isn't good news for 
the budget as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that emergency bills are exempt from normal  
budget measures and this one nearly doubled in size once it was in 
Congress' hands. A number of lawmakers' special projects got added 
on in the process. And, despite a last-minute show of resolution by 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, neither Hastert nor his counterpart, 
Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, appears to have the clout to 
stop members from running away with the non-emergency spending 
bills. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Only $1.6 billion of this emergency bill is paid for with such  
offsets, mostly from food stamps, but even that is not really a 
sacrifice. Thanks to the booming economy, the food stamp fund has a 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the bill is $1 billion in hurricane relief for Central  
America and $556 million for farm relief, measures that were 
supposed to have passed last year but got caught up in political 
bickering. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the bill is $11.8 billion for the war in Yugoslavia,  
twice what President Clinton asked for, but that amount, too, is 
deceptive. It includes a military pay raise and money for more 
equipment that should have received the normal budget scrutiny. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The money to pay for all of this will come from the Social  
Security surplus. Later this year Congress will take up the real 
spending measures. Keep your hand on your wallet.

<P>
	La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The war is not over yet and, what's even worse, nobody knows  
when it's going to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	While Serbia's industry and infrastructures have been destroyed,  
and even the military has suffered serious damage, there are no 
signs that (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic will accept the 
conditions outlined by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	The West wonders whether or not to send ground troops. The  
matter is made even more crucial and urgent by the upcoming summer, 
quickly followed by the fall, which in the Balkans is very much 
like winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees being kept  
in Macedonian and Albanian camps in the cold is intolerable. There 
is also a risk of destabilization in Albania and Macedonia, which 
is the ultimate goal of Serbia's ``ethnic strategy.'' ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 25  
</P>
<P>
	Le Temps, Geneva, Switzerland, on NATO bombing of Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	... NATO, which at the end of March expected the Belgrade  
government would swiftly give in to its demands, is looking ahead 
anxiously to winter before summer has even begun. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The results of 60 days of `sorties' is, objectively speaking,  
disastrous, and the generals can no longer hide their fears under 
statistical optimism. ... 
</P>
<P>
	So NATO is getting ready for a change of strategy, or at least  
to give Serbian authorities the impression that it's changing. ... 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt the United States is prepared to go all the way.  
</P>
<P>
	The superpower couldn't countenance a semi-failure, which would  
amount to a defeat, in a conflict that is so decisive for the 
alliance it leads. 

</P>
<P>
	May 25  
</P>
<P>
	Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, Germany, on NATO and Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	NATO must explain what it's doing. When the war against Serbia  
began exactly two months ago it explained to the Serbs and the 
world that it was a war against the regime and not against the 
people. But when it now systematically destroys infrastructure 
systems, when because of that electricity is cut and there is a 
water shortage, then it has distanced itself fairly far from its 
postulating. It is not striking the center of power, these are not 
strikes at the power machinery -- it is a strike against the people. 
</P>
<P>
	The goals of NATO in this war are as before valid and justified.  
The government of Slobodan Milosevic delivers daily to NATO the 
legitimacy: through murder and massive expulsions. Alone on 
Pentecost (Whitsun) weekend thousands of Albanians were again 
forced over the borders. NATO not only has the justification, it 
has the duty to intercede for these people. But it also bears the 
responsibility not to let the goals and the methods of the war to 
drift apart. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 23  
</P>
<P>
	The Nation, Bangkok, on Western double standards in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	For many Africans, the flood of refugees forced to flee Kosovo  
is not so much a humanitarian crisis as an example of Western 
double standards. The number of white Kosovars now receiving aid in 
camps along Yugoslavia's borders -- 700,000 -- is roughly the same 
number of blacks who were killed in a few short, bloody months in 
Rwanda in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The atrocities being committed in places like Sierra Leone,  
where children are being hunted down and mutilated in most horrific 
fashion, are as appalling as any in Kosovo. So why no relief, no 
air lifts, no air strikes and only the occasional expressions of 
outrage? The sad truth is that the Kosovo action is not hypocrisy. 
The West, like the rest of the world, reacts when its interests are 
imperiled. Africa's curse is neither a matter of politics nor 
economics to the rest of the world. ...

	Haaretz, Tel Aviv, on Israeli educational system:  
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's promise to change the face of  
the nation cannot be realized without making far-reaching changes 
in the educational system. 
</P>
<P>
	Public concern is largely focused on the expansion of the  
ultra-Orthodox educational systems, which are raising -- with 
government funds -- a generation that turns its back on the 
fundamental values of Israeli society. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks ... educate their students entirely by Jewish law,  
promoting theocracy and nurturing disdain for the rule of law in 
the state that nourishes them. 
</P>
<P>
	A central core of improved curricula must be the common ground  
for all teaching institutions in the country. It can no longer be 
acceptable for the schools of the ultra-Orthodox to refuse to give 
instruction in entire branches of knowledge and to ban the hiring 
of nonreligious teachers. 

</P>
<P>
	May 25  
</P>
<P>
	The Jordan Times, Amman, on new Israeli government:  
</P>
<P>
	As Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak proceeds to put the  
final touches on his negotiating plan with the key Israeli 
political parties that could be invited to join his government, it 
appears that whether he is going for a left-of-center coalition or 
a right-of-center one, he has to include Likud, the second-largest 
party after his own Labor in the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
	If he decides on a core coalition of Labor-Likud then he has to  
select, either Meretz for a choice of a left-leaning government or 
Shas for a rightist one. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shas is for peace with the Arabs, the choice of Meretz  
will send a stronger signal to the Palestinians and Arabs that 
Barak means to move full speed on the peace front, despite the fact 
that the record of the Likud on the peace process is a cause of 
concern for many. ... 

</P>
<P>
	May 22  
</P>
<P>
	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Indonesia's general election:  
</P>
<P>
	The general election epitomizes a shift from the dictatorship  
for the sake of economic development to democratic rule, and from 
power politics to genuine party politics. 
</P>
<P>
	At such a juncture, suspicion resurfaced over the fortunes  
amassed by members of the Suharto family. No doubt the people will 
more vociferously demand the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no political leader has called for extreme nationalism,  
it is worrisome that there has been a flurry of clashes among 
overly enthusiastic campaign workers. In addition, religious and 
ethnic conflicts are flaring in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	If violent incidents and vote buying take place on a massive  
scale, trust in general election will be lost, increasing the 
likelihood of political chaos and more serious economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	If a step is taken toward a democratic society and progress is  
made for unity among diversity, it will be very fitting for the 
future of the country.

	The Irish Times, Dublin, on Hillary Rodham Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	What to do after a spell in the White House? It is a problem  
which has troubled recent former U.S. presidents. ... 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, on the other hand, at only 54, will be way  
ahead of retirement age when he steps down. ... He had hinted that 
he and Hillary might find suitable postings in academia but that 
was before Judge Starr put him through the wringer. Now, he will 
need to make serious money to pay his legal debts so his options 
are more limited. But the options open to Mrs. Clinton have widened 
and she is said to be ``seriously interested'' in running for the 
U.S. Senate from the state of New York. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The wonder is that Mrs. Clinton wants it. She has never  
disguised her disdain for Washington and the Congress. Now, she 
seems prepared not just to remain on in Washington but to work in 
the Congress. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But it would be a high profile position guaranteeing her much  
publicity were she to use it as Robert Kennedy did, making the 
camera lights shine into dark places of neglect. Mrs Clinton may be 
taking the long view. Could not the first woman senator from New 
York, should she prove successful, become eight years later the 
first woman candidate for the Oval Office?

<P>
	Le Monde, Paris, on Cannes film festival:  
</P>
<P>
	The awards ceremony at the 52nd annual Cannes film festival -- as  
beautiful as the winning films were -- without a doubt dealt a blow 
to a broader view of cinema. And there was plenty of opportunity to 
express that view with this year's selection. As with other older 
arts, cinema suffers from a tension that separates the boldest 
works on an artistic level, from more conformist mass production. 
</P>
<P>
	Films by Pedro Almodovar, Raoul Ruiz, Takeshi Kitano and David  
Lynch showed that it is still possible to marry creative ambition -- 
without concessions -- and a desire to share it with a large public 
happy to see a film. With systematic provocativeness, the jury on 
the contrary chose to take the side of only the most radical 
(films). 
</P>
<P>
	Art cinema finds itself very much alone, and so does the Cannes  
festival.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved Computer  
Associates International Inc.'s $3.5 billion purchase of smaller 
software rival, Platinum technology International, inc., Tuesday 
after Computer Associates agreed to sell six Platinum products and 
related assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the divestiture of the Platinum mainframe systems  
management software products, the government said, Computer 
Associates' dominance in a number of already concentrated software 
markets would have been significantly increased. 
</P>
<P>
	When the original deal was announced at the end of March, the  
cash offer by Computer Associates, one of the largest makers of 
business software, was worth more than three times Platinum's 
market value, based on its stock price of $9.87 1/2 a share at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer Associates is the world's largest independent vendor of  
computer software for IBM and IBM-compatible mainframe computers 
and is the dominant competitor in a number of mainframe systems 
management software markets for IBM's OS-390 and VSE operating 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum, a major competitor in mainframe systems management  
products, is one of the few substantial competitors to Computer 
Associates in several of these markets, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software from the two companies is crucial to the efficient  
operation of mainframe computers used by universities, industries 
and governments for critical functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that the companies and universities that use  
mainframe software receive the full benefits of competition in 
these markets in terms of price, service and product development,'' 
said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	The department filed suit in U.S. District Court here to block  
the original deal and at the same time filed a proposed settlement 
which, if approved by the court, would resolve that lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for a trustee to sell to a buyer approved by  
the department six Platinum products and related assets in these 
markets: tape management, job scheduling and rerun, and change 
management software for the OS-390 operating system; job scheduling 
and rerun and automated operations for the VSE operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Computer Associates agreed to go ahead with  
Platinum's previously announced sale of its family of job 
accounting and capacity planning products. 
</P>
<P>
	Headquartered in Islandia, N.Y., Computer Associates had 1998  
revenues of more than $4.7 billion. Platinum, a 12-year-old company 
based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., had 1998 revenue of more than $968 
million.

<HEADLINE>  Portland Shrugs Off Loss to Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- After beating the Utah Jazz in Games 2, 3  
and 4, the Portland Trail Blazers said they expected the two-time 
conference champions to play Game 5 with emotion and determination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz did, and the Blazers didn't answer.  
</P>
<P>
	Utah took a big lead in the first quarter and never relinquished  
it, closing the series gap to 3-2 with a 88-71 win Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone thought Utah wasn't going to come out the way they  
did, they're crazy,'' said Jim Jackson, who was held to six points 
on 2-of-5 shooting. ``They've been to the finals the last two 
years. They weren't going to lay down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to beat a Utah team one time, two times, three  
times, let alone four,'' Jackson said. ``I think Game 6 is a 
defining moment for this team. We'll see how we handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Game 1, when the Jazz beat the Blazers 93-83 in the  
Delta Center, have Portland players focused their frustrations at 
the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might have gotten a little emotional,'' said Portland point  
guard Damon Stoudamire, referring to coach Mike Dunleavy's ejection 
for angrily protesting a call and hounding the referees to midcourt 
before being held back by coaches and players. That followed a foul 
on Brian Grant for swinging his elbows and a technical foul on 
Grant for ``taunting'' by faking a pass at Karl Malone's head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took us out of our game,'' Stoudamire said. ``They played  
harder. They wanted it more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the series, Utah was able to shoot 50  
percent from the field. The Blazers held the normally 
steady-shooting Jazz to 38, 38 and 41 percent the last three games. 
The Jazz were second in the league in shooting this season at 46.5 
percent and had led the league in that category for four seasons 
prior to this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a drastically different team tonight, but that had a  
lot to do with the way they played,'' Greg Anthony said. ``Karl 
Malone made some shots, Bryon Russell had a good game. We give them 
credit. They had a lot more easy shots tonight. And we didn't meet 
their energy level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 will have the same type of do-or-die quality from both  
teams, Stoudamire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand it's going to be a tough game,'' said  
Stoudamire, whose only other playoff experience was last year when 
the Blazers were ousted in the opening round. ``Their backs are 
against the wall. But some would say our backs are against the 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said winning the series has crucial implications for the  
Portland franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team (Utah) was picked by everyone to beat us,'' he said.  
``In order for us to take that next step, to go to the next level 
in this league, we've got to win, and we need to take care of it on 
Thursday.''

times, let alone four,'' Jackson said. ``I think Game 6 is a 
defining moment for this team. We'll see how we handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Game 1, when the Jazz beat the Blazers 93-83 in the  
Delta Center, have Portland players focused their frustrations at 
the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might have gotten a little emotional,'' said Portland point  
guard Damon Stoudamire, referring to coach Mike Dunleavy's ejection 
for angrily protesting a call and hounding the referees to midcourt 
before being held back by coaches and players. That followed a foul 
on Brian Grant for swinging his elbows and a technical foul on 
Grant for ``taunting'' by faking a pass at Karl Malone's head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took us out of our game,'' Stoudamire said. ``They played  
harder. They wanted it more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the series, Utah was able to shoot 50  
percent from the field. The Blazers held the normally 
steady-shooting Jazz to 38, 38 and 41 percent the last three games. 
The Jazz were second in the league in shooting this season at 46.5 
percent and had led the league in that category for four seasons 
prior to this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a drastically different team tonight, but that had a  
lot to do with the way they played,'' Greg Anthony said. ``Karl 
Malone made some shots, Bryon Russell had a good game. We give them 
credit. They had a lot more easy shots tonight. And we didn't meet 
their energy level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 will have the same type of do-or-die quality from both  
teams, Stoudamire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand it's going to be a tough game,'' said  
Stoudamire, whose only other playoff experience was last year when 
the Blazers were ousted in the opening round. ``Their backs are 
against the wall. But some would say our backs are against the 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said winning the series has crucial implications for the  
Portland franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team (Utah) was picked by everyone to beat us,'' he said.  
``In order for us to take that next step, to go to the next level 
in this league, we've got to win, and we need to take care of it on 
Thursday.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Campaign Finance Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defying the GOP leadership, five House  
Republicans on Wednesday threw their support behind a 
Democratic-led push to force campaign finance legislation to a vote 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to act on campaign finance reform now, not tomorrow,''  
Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., said at a news conference where he and 
others dismissed as inadequate Speaker Dennis Hastert's offer of 
floor action in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would ban ``soft money,'' the large, unregulated  
donations that the parties and some politicians seek to fund their 
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would limit so-called ``issue ads,'' which are governed  
more loosely than other commercials because they do not directly 
advocate a candidate's election or defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leadership aides expressed cautious confidence they  
could defeat the drive for accelerated vote on the measure. In an 
announcement that appeared designed to slow momentum for an 
accelerated vote, one committee announced plans for hearings on 
campaign finance proposals in early June. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a prerogative of the majority to establish a calendar for  
legislation, and a decision to side with Democrats on so 
fundamental an issue could have repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you put yourself on a leadership track,'' Shays  
said at one point when asked about possible retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him in signing were Reps. Mike Castle of Delaware, Greg  
Ganske of Iowa, Michael Forbes of New York and Connie Morella of 
Maryland. Their signatures brought to 201 the number of names on a 
parliamentary device -- known as a ``discharge petition'' -- that 
would force the measure to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes 218 signatures to succeed, and comments by other  
Republican supporters of campaign finance legislation underscored 
their reluctance to follow the lead set by Shays and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, said she had not decided  
whether to sign. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who has clashed with 
party leaders often on the issue, said, ``for now, I'm 
uncommitted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Shays and Ganske both made direct  
references to the impact of contributions on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganske said he had ``seen the power of soft money on influencing  
political decisions.'' Pressed for specifics, he said ``the way the 
HMO debate worked out last year,'' when the insurance industry 
successfully opposed Democratic-drafted legislation to strengthen 
the rights of patients in dealing with their HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays said, ``sadly, members of Congress are purchasing  
influence over their colleagues'' by creation of one particular 
type of political action committee and then ``accepting unlimited 
amounts of soft money'' for it. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a reference to leadership PACs, which are allowed to  
accept soft money donations, and then make donations to the 
campaigns of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans oppose the legislation, citing both  
constitutional and political grounds. They say restricting 
contributions is a violation of the free speech guarantee of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	They also express concern that without soft money donations,  
Republicans would be at a disadvantage compared with Democrats, who 
receive substantial support from labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the campaign legislation is virtually certain to pass  
the House once it comes to a vote. Shays and others want it passed 
as quickly as possible because a Republican-led filibuster is a 
strong possibility in the Senate. There is no date for the Senate 
to consider its version of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation was passed in the House last year, but only  
after a monumental struggle. Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to 
keep the issue from the floor, but ultimately capitulated when it 
became apparent that enough Republicans would join with Democrats 
and bring the measure to a vote over his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Roukema and Wamp helped arrange a meeting with Hastert recently  
at which members of the rank-and-file urged him to allow a debate 
and vote by July. 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after Shays and the others signed the petition, she  
said she wasn't ready to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conditions were very different when Gingrich was here,'' she  
said. ``There was no alternative and he was absolutely adamant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering unfolded in the House as two Oregon lawmakers,  
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Rep. Greg Walden, proposed 
legislation requiring candidates to appear in their TV attack ads 
or pay 35 percent more for future ads.

<HEADLINE> Outline of Truck-Safety Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key provisions to cut the number of truck-related deaths in half  
over the next decade, from about 5,000 to about 2,500 annually, as 
announced by the Clinton administration on Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
	--Shut down ``unfit'' motor carriers. A provision in the highway  
bill enacted last year allows commercial vehicle inspectors to shut 
down truck and bus operators for a single instance of misconduct, 
instead of having to show a pattern of misconduct. The federal 
Office of Motor Carriers, which regulates trucks and buses, will 
issue an interim rule this summer to implement that policy, with a 
final rule taking effect thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase penalties for violations. Until now, serious  
violations of commercial vehicle laws could be punished with a fine 
of up to $1,000 per violation, with an overall cap of $10,000. 
Record-keeping violations, such as falsifying log books, could be 
punished with a fine of up to $500 per instance, with an overall 
cap of $2,500. Based on a memo issued in April by the Office of 
Motor Carriers, serious offenses can now be punished with a fine of 
up to $10,000 per instance, with no overall cap. Record-keeping 
infractions can now be punished with fines of up to $5,000 per 
violation, again with no overall cap. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase inspections. The Office of Motor Carriers has about  
260 safety inspectors in the field. On average, they each completed 
about 24 ``compliance reviews'' at truck and bus companies in 1997. 
They will now be required to conduct at least 48 reviews per year.

<HEADLINE> Essence Awards Honor Kirk Franklin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kirk Franklin, one of the honorees at this  
year's Essence Awards, wasn't expecting a big fuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly thought it was something that they were going to  
give me in a pre-show or something,'' the popular gospel 
entertainer said. ``I didn't think that I was going to be part of 
the big deal, because usually the gospel music stuff is always in 
the pre-shows or stuff. Like at the Grammys, the gospel awards are 
done way before the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin, 28, along with Lauryn Hill, Chris Rock and others,  
were honored by Essence magazine at the 12th annual awards show on 
April 30. The show will air June 2 on Fox television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Essence Awards honor individuals who have made exceptional  
contributions to the community. Franklin, whose funk beats are 
infused with a religious message, was cited for raising funds to 
help rebuild churches and synagogues destroyed or damaged in bias 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a shining example of the opportunities that life  
offers us all to transform ourselves,'' said Susan Taylor, the 
magazine's editor-in-chief. ``We honored him for his message of 
hope and love that he brings to young people and people of all 
ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin's life began under troubled circumstances. He was born  
to a teen-age mother who left him to be raised by a religious aunt. 
But the young Franklin didn't always practice what he was taught. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly think it's because of all of the things we are told  
that we can't do,'' said Franklin, who is now married and the 
father of three children. ``When you are told all the things that 
you can't do, it's making you want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of resisting the religious message, he came to  
embrace it. ``Church Boy,'' published last year, is the title of 
his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I strayed away as a teen-ager, that stuff is still  
in you, and the circumstances of life, they can have a way of 
waking you up, have a way of saying, 'OK, Lord, I hear you 
calling,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's a friend dying or whether there are some near  
death experiences of your own, you know, stuff like that will cause 
you to really want to relook at your whole life and your 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin's work performing for his local choir, The Family, led  
to a record contract. The group sold more than one million copies 
of its debut album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lean on Me,'' his inspirational collaboration with U2's Bono,  
R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige and Crystal Lewis, was nominated for three 
Grammys, including song of the year. His album, ``The Nu Nation 
Project,'' won a Grammy for best contemporary soul gospel album. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Franklin has been criticized by those who think his music is  
too secular. Those criticisms intensified when his protege group 
God's Property was catapulted to crossover success with the 
dancelike hit ``Stomp'' in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people first said things, it was kind of frustrating, but  
man, you don't think about that kind of stuff anymore because you 
have so many people to reach, and you realize that there is always 
going to be some kind of persecution when you're doing stuff for 
the Lord,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with the business of gospel music has been frustrating  
for Franklin, who said some of his personal relationships have 
suffered under the strain of his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of this business is not built on the rules of  
friendships. This business destroys friendships,'' he said. ``If I 
could do the music without the business, I'd be a very happy man. 
But that's almost like wanting watermelon, but you don't want the 
seeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin refuses to get caught up in the pursuit of money, a hit  
record or fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never want my motive to go into the studio and write a hit,  
but to be able to hear from the Lord, to be able to do a song that 
will reach people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, the word 'gospel' is to send good news. Gospel is the  
good news of Jesus Christ, and if it's not that, it's just good 
music.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Points Finger at Ex-IBM Worker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An IBM secretary who knew of the company's plans  
to take over Lotus Development Corp. tipped off her husband, 
leading 25 people to pocket more than $1.3 million from insider 
trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged today. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the illegal trades -- many by novices to the  
securities markets who did not even have accounts when they 
received the tip -- were touched off when Lorraine K. Cassano told 
her husband about the Lotus acquisition, which occurred in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the SEC  
said Mrs. Cassano told her husband, Robert M. Cassano, a paging 
communications company salesman, who then told two friends who 
agreed to purchase stock for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two friends told others and soon the insider information  
had spread through a wide network of family members, friends and 
stock brokers, the SEC said in the civil action. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a rash of illegal insider trading among the 25  
individuals occurred during a 6 1/2 period on June 2, 1995, the SEC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, International Business Machines Corp.  
announced its takeover offer for Lotus and the value of Lotus 
common stock leaped from $32.50 per share to more than $61 per 
share, an increase of nearly 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cassano, a secretary in the Volumes and Revenue Department  
of the Software Group at IBM in Somers, N.Y., at the time of the 
insider trades, was suspended when IBM learned of the 
investigation. The North Salem, N.Y., resident was later fired, the 
SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those charged in the case was a pizzeria owner, a bank  
vice president, a private school teacher, a grocery store owner, a 
lawyer, the president of a direct-mail marketing company, a doctor, 
an engineer and several stockbrokers. Of those charged, 13 live in 
Staten Island, N.Y., and six live in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano first learned of the pending Lotus  
deal when she was asked to copy documents in late April or early 
May 1995. On May 5, 1995, her supervisor told her that IBM would be 
taking over Lotus, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 31, 1995, Mrs. Cassano learned that the board of  
directors had authorized the company to make an offer for Lotus and 
that it would be announced on June 5, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cassano then violated strict policies at IBM forbidding  
employees from disclosing nonpublic information, especially about 
the Lotus deal, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its court papers, the SEC asked the court to order the  
defendants to obey all securities laws, return any illegally 
obtained profits and be fined civil penalties up to three times 
their ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano's husband, Robert, pleaded guilty to  
insider trading on Jan. 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cassanos could not immediately be reached for comment on the  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the defendants tried to conceal their trades or the  
illicit nature of their trading activity by lying under oath about 
the reasons for their trades and falsely denying they knew the 
others in the group, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have pleaded guilty in the case thus far include  
lawyer Carmine DeSantis of Staten Island, salesman Michael Paul 
Green of Edison, N.J., computer technician P. Gerard Mazzone of 
Staten Island, delicatessen owner Peter G. Mazzone of Staten 
Island, computer technician Joseph Petrosino of Brooklyn, N.Y., and 
Dr. Gary Spierer of Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSantis pleaded to conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice,  
Green to obstruction of justice, both Mazzones to insider trading 
and perjury, Petrosino to perjury and Spierer to obstruction of 
justice.

<HEADLINE> The Exile's Life: Bobbie Ann Mason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYFIELD, Ky. (AP) -- The world has closed in on the Mason family  
farm. The dirt road that once ran along front is now a noisy 
highway. The cornfield across the way has been replaced by a 
towering feed mill, which crowds the reflection on the farm's pond. 
</P>
<P>
	These are the roots of author Bobbie Ann Mason, or what's left  
of them. Strangers rent the house she grew up in and other 
strangers work the fields. On this gray afternoon, even the soil 
looks foreign, more fertile for weeds than for the soy beans 
usually grown here. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mason and this land, it's been a long, complicated  
relationship. As a young woman, she left for the North, and the 
open, rootless life of the city. That's where writers were made, 
she believed. That's where she'd free herself from the South's 
narrow, fated ways. 
</P>
<P>
	But the longer she was gone, the more home spoke to her. She has  
written three novels and dozens of short stories, virtually all set 
in Kentucky and many taking on the same issues and feelings she 
dealt with personally: the differences between generations, the gap 
between those who left and those who stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, in a way, she has returned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have these opposing images in my mind,'' the 59-year-old  
Mason says over the buzz of a car hurrying by. ``I'm walking down 
Park Avenue, but I'm also thinking back to my earlier self, the cow 
pastures. All the juxtapositions are jarring; that's the exile 
mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mason lives about a hundred miles from here, on a 100-acre farm  
where the land is used for walking, not tilling. She comes to 
Mayfield often, especially to see her mother, who has suffered a 
few mini-strokes over the past couple of years. Her father died in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of such acclaimed works of fiction as the novels ``In  
Country'' and ``The Feather Crowns'' and the short story 
``Shiloh,'' Mason has been reticent about herself -- until now. She 
has written a memoir, ``Clear Springs,'' in which she looks back 
both on her own life and the lives of her ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clear Springs'' isn't so much a confession as a meditation on  
the modern spirit, the difference between what she wanted, and was 
allowed to have, and what her ancestors settled for. It's a book, 
for more reasons than one, that her mother would not have written. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not especially interested in my efforts to make some  
kind of coherent pattern out of everything,'' Mason said. ``She's 
been a farmer all her life. She has the kind of wisdom that 
transcends these feeble efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Turn right on the highway and you'll find Clear Springs, the  
tiny town where the author's ancestors lived and are buried. Turn 
left and drive just up the road and you'll find the assisted living 
facility where Mason's mother, 79-year-old Christy Mason, moved in 
early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even leaning on a walker, the elder Mason looks as durable as  
the earth she used to work. She is a solidly built woman with a 
playful smile and shining blue eyes, a contrast to her soft-spoken, 
slightly built daughter, who kneels at her side. 
</P>
<P>
	``She always wanted to write, but I thought that would pass,''  
Christy Mason says, as the author shakes her head and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She always had a book, always had a pencil. She was always  
writing down things. She'd walk along and see things and write them 
down. And she couldn't stand anybody not using their time: `Oh, 
mama, make 'em do something. They're just wasting their time.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As in a work of fiction, one of the characters took over Mason's  
memoir: her mother. Christy Mason is the heroine of her daughter's 
story, a ``remarkable'' woman who gave up the life she could have 
had to let her daughter live it instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that she had this exuberant spirit that the Masons  
tried to beat out of her and she never got much opportunity to 
follow that exuberant nature,'' the author said. 
</P>
<P>
	A journalist when she was young, Mason investigated her mother's  
life. She discovered that her grandfather was just 16 and five 
years younger than her grandmother when they married. Her 
grandfather ran away before Christy was born and four years later 
her grandmother died in childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother would get so weary with me because I would always  
have my notebook and always ask her questions,'' the author said. 
``She always told me everything she could and I finally decided I 
had gone as far as I could with it. I didn't bother her anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like her father, Christianna Lee married young; she was not  
quite 17 when, in 1936, she ran off with 20-year-old Wilburn Mason. 
They were so worried his family wouldn't approve that they drove to 
Tennessee, wedded quickly and snuck back to his house after his 
parents had gone to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Masons were rooted and conservative and the Lees came from  
a different social class,'' Bobbie Ann Mason said. ``They didn't 
have as much property and status to protect. The Lees were not 
known to be as thrifty and dependable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By nature ``sassy and full of fire,'' Christy Mason lived with  
her in-laws as a newlywed, feeling confined by their quiet 
lifestyle. She pulled weeds and gathered peas and corn. She worked 
for a while in a men's suit factory. At times, she wondered if she 
should have married. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1960s, with two of her four kids still in the house,  
her father-in-law died and the family moved back in with her 
mother-in-law. Not until 1981, when her mother-in-law died, did 
Christy and Wilburn Mason get to spend a night in their house 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Possibility'' is a favorite word of the author's and it's how  
she defines the difference between her life and her mother's. The 
author had choices; her mother didn't. Mason wonders if the reason 
she turned out so differently is because she was born 20 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think of yourself as independent,'' she said. ``You read  
books and go traveling. But those things weren't there in my 
mother's time and they weren't possible. You wonder if you'd have 
the same energies if you lived then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbie Ann Mason, the eldest child, was born in 1940. The farm  
filled her senses, but stories turned her head. She read the 
Bobbsey Twins and was shocked that they went on vacations and never 
did chores. She read and re-read ``Little Women'' and dreamed of 
being Jo, the sister who writes and writes and eventually leaves 
for New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me,'' Mason recalled in her memoir, ``it was and still is a  
fundamental question. Why work? Does everybody have to sweep? Could 
I get out of it somehow?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She seemed to have been born in the wrong part of the world. She  
didn't want to cook and she hated country music. She listened to 
rock 'n' roll, read philosophy and questioned the existence of God. 
``Give up these strange ideas of yours,'' one teacher told her. 
``Your field is mathematics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike her parents, Mason attended college, majoring in English  
at the University of Kentucky. In 1962, she moved to New York. She 
imagined herself as Holly Golightly, to the point of showing up for 
a job interview in a large black Panama-straw hat, like the one 
Audrey Hepburn wore in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were happy, funny memories. Mason wrote for a fan  
magazine, where Robert Vaughn, Robert Goulet and other celebrities 
would stop by for interviews. Ann-Margret, dressed in a 
``smashing'' Kelly-green outfit, complimented Mason's ``sweet 
little accent.'' The teen idol Fabian surprised his interviewer by 
talking about literature, from ``Franny and Zooey'' to Thucydides' 
``The History of the Peloponnesian Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to be a Southerner in Manhattan in the 1960s was like  
showing up at a poetry reading in a debutante's dress. Her demeanor 
was too soft, her accent too strong. From boyfriends to teachers to 
colleagues, Northerners couldn't stop lecturing her on how she 
should talk and how she should think. 
</P>
<P>
	``I questioned my intelligence, my sanity, my identity,'' Mason  
wrote. ``I believed wholeheartedly in my own inferiority, and 
people treated me accordingly, like a wadded-up dishrag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like a good bohemian, Mason listened to jazz, painted her radio  
bright orange and wore beads, bell-bottoms and sandals. She wrote 
``experimental'' fiction and endured graduate-level English 
studies, where the goal was to say obscure things and say them in a 
Northern accent. 
</P>
<P>
	But only by getting this far from herself did she get an idea of  
who she was, and what she was called to write. She wasn't meant to 
live in the city and she wasn't meant to tell stories about city 
life. Her literary sources, she discovered, were back home. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could I have failed to recognize them? They have claimed  
me all along,'' she wrote. ``And my mother was my chief 
inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From ``In Country'' to ``The Feather Crowns,'' Mason tells  
stories of spirited country women. At the end of the novel ``Spence 
+ Lila,'' based on her parents, she describes Lila's face as 
``dancing like pond water in the rain, all unsettled and stirring 
with aroused possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mason herself waited until her late 20s to marry. While a  
graduate student at the University of Connecticut, she met Roger 
Rawlings, a fellow English major and a Northerner who didn't talk 
down to her. They were married in 1969, moved to rural Pennsylvania 
in the early 1970s and then to Kentucky in the early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in her home state, the idea was to return, but not relapse.  
She has no children and there is no talk of her mother moving in. 
Their fates are close, but not identical. Because, the qualities 
Mason admires in her mother are part of the reason she doesn't want 
to live like her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was such a wonderful mother and so maternal, and yet we  
saw her sacrifice and slaving and suffering and that didn't give me 
a good image of having children and neither did the culture in 
general,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw women being trapped by that. My mother had compensated  
for the loss of her mother by being this wonderful mother. So I at 
least felt fulfilled and didn't have to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Mason said with a sigh, ``times have changed.''

<HEADLINE> Details of Poll on Clinton, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results on a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday  
about President Clinton, Congress and Kosovo. When results don't 
total 100 percent, the remainder didn't know or refused to answer. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you approve or disapprove of the way Bill Clinton is  
handling his job as president? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve, 53 percent; disapprove, 42 percent. This is his lowest  
rating in this poll since August 1996; it has been above 60 percent 
for months. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you think the country would be better off if the Republicans  
controlled Congress, or if the Democrats controlled Congress? 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, 36 percent, Democrats, 37 percent; neither, 14  
percent; same, 4 percent. In mid-December, Democrats were preferred 
to lead Congress over Republicans by 41 percent to 30 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	--How confident are you in President Clinton's ability to handle  
the situation in Kosovo -- very confident, somewhat confident, not 
too confident, or not at all confident? 
</P>
<P>
	Very confident, 17 percent; somewhat confident, 40 percent; not  
too confident, 17 percent; not at all confident, 25 percent. The 
number who are very confident in Clinton's ability on Kosovo 
dropped from 27 percent in late March to 17 percent now and the 
number not at all confident increased from 13 percent to 25 
percent. 

</P>
<P>
	--If the current NATO air and missile strikes are not effective  
in achieving the United States' objectives in Kosovo, would you 
favor or oppose President Clinton sending U.S. ground troops into 
the region along with troops from other NATO countries? 
</P>
<P>
	Favor, 40 percent; oppose, 57 percent. In mid-April, 52 percent  
favored sending in ground troops if airstrikes didn't work and 45 
percent opposed that step. 

</P>
<P>
	--Would you approve or disapprove if the U.S. and NATO were to  
temporarily suspend the airstrikes and attempt to resolve the 
matter through negotiations and other means? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve, 82 percent; disapprove, 15 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,050 adults was taken Sunday and Monday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Form of Fatal Insomnia Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers have discovered a brain-wasting disease that begins  
with severe insomnia and ends in hallucinations and death. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease, sporadic fatal insomnia, is caused by the same type  
of deformed proteins, known as prions, that cause mad cow disease 
and its human variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, according to two 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known treatment or cure. It is not clear what causes  
the disease, but scientists know it is not inherited. And unlike 
one type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it is not believed to come 
from infected meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, scientists suspect it is caused by a spontaneous  
mutation in a single brain or nerve cell. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, they have identified only six cases of the disease, but  
there could be others that were misdiagnosed as other 
mind-destroying illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Prions are proteins with Jekyll-and-Hyde personalities that  
cluster in the brain. When their molecules are folded into the 
correct shape, prions are benign, though no one knows their 
function. 
</P>
<P>
	Folded the wrong way, prions induce other proteins to mimic  
them. The misfolded prions then accumulate in parts of the brain, 
causing the tissue to break down and become full of holes, like a 
sponge. 
</P>
<P>
	Different prion diseases attack different parts of the brain,  
causing characteristic types of dementia and death. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are infectious, like mad cow disease in cattle and scrapie  
in sheep and goats. In humans, prion diseases are either inherited, 
caught from eating contaminated meat, or spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have previously identified an inherited prion  
disorder whose main symptom is sleeplessness, called fatal familial 
insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case outlined in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, a 44-year-old patient had all the symptoms of the 
inherited disease, including prions with the same ``signature,'' 
but did not have the inherited mutation. The case was reported by 
Dr. James Mastrianni, a neurologist at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The spontaneous, or sporadic, versions of the prion diseases are  
rare, but more common than their inherited counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prions are still controversial. Some researchers believe it is  
impossible for proteins to replicate and cause disease, since they 
do not contain genetic material. These researchers believe the 
diseases are instead caused by as-yet-undiscovered viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the new studies add to evidence the infection is caused  
by the abnormal shape of the prions, not another agent, Drs. 
Pierluigi Gambetti and Piero Parchi of Case Western Reserve 
University said in an accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambetti and Parchi have described five similar cases of  
non-inherited fatal insomnia in a study scheduled to appear in the 
journal Neurology.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for End to NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia called for an immediate halt to NATO  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia today, warning that the growing 
number of alliance attacks could wreck any chance of a political 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's special envoy on Kosovo also said that Yugoslavia may  
be willing to accept peacekeeping troops from NATO nations which 
are not taking part in the airstrikes as part of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Chernomyrdin said he would press for at least a temporary  
and immediate halt to the airstrikes as he began talks today with 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President 
Martti Ahtisaari. He warned that NATO's steady escalation of the 
attacks could wreck the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result of the upcoming negotiations on Wednesday should be  
a stop to missile and bomb strikes on Yugoslavia,'' he told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	There appeared to be little chance that NATO would halt the  
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, who is due to fly to Belgrade on Thursday, said  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is willing to accept various 
elements of a peace deal. Milosevic agrees that NATO nations not 
taking part in the air attacks, such as Greece and Portugal, could 
be part of an international force in Kosovo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow wants to find a political solution, although it has made  
little progress to date, despite frequently raising international 
hopes of success. The West hopes that Russia can play a major role 
as an intermediary and persuade Belgrade to back down. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly opposes NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, but  
has been urging Yugoslavia to curb its policies in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says it won't accept any limitations on the force it wants  
to put into Kosovo. It also continues to insist on a complete 
Yugoslav military pullout despite Russian calls for a limited Serb 
military presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said today that all Serb forces must pull out of Kosovo.  
He said a token force might be allowed later. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Secretary (of State Madeleine) Albright and others have  
said, once there have been complete withdrawals the international 
community might consider permitting the return of some official 
Yugoslav personnel to perform very carefully and supervised 
functions within Kosovo,'' he said before meeting Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said Kosovo should remain part of Yugoslavia, but he did  
not appear optimistic for a quick breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking it one step at a time, dealing with a tough  
issue. But we've got our sleeves rolled up. I think we're working 
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov was to fly to Sweden today for a meeting with U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on efforts to mediate the crisis. 
Ivanov will then visit China for similar talks.

<HEADLINE> ProXeed Claims To Aid in Fertility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nonprescription fertility aid? A company  
claims to found a dietary supplement that may improve a man's sperm 
quality, citing European studies that have some fertility 
specialists cautiously intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	But the same doctors who plan to experiment with the product,  
called proXeed, warn that there's no proof yet that it works -- and 
are urging Americans to see a doctor before trying it on their own. 
There are many causes of male infertility, occasionally 
life-threatening ones, that proXeed can't help but that regular 
medicine can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious and excited to see how it works, but I'd not at  
this point tell patients it's going to work,'' said Dr. Larry 
Lipshultz, a Baylor College of Medicine urologist and president of 
the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	But ProXeed isn't thought to cause side effects, so ``the only  
thing you have to lose is the $100 a month you're going to spend'' 
trying it, added Lipshultz, who is giving it to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Other options such as in vitro fertilization can cost thousands.  
</P>
<P>
	Up to 40 percent of conception difficulties are believed caused,  
at least partly, by poor sperm. That means 2.5 million American 
couples potentially could try proXeed, said Sigma-Tau Consumer 
Products, which begins marketing the citrus-flavored drink mix 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ProXeed contains two types of L-carnitine, a compound naturally  
present in the body important for cellular metabolism. People 
absorb L-carnitine mostly from red meat and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists know L-carnitine is highly concentrated in  
sperm-related tissues. The theory: Perhaps men with low sperm 
counts or poor sperm quality -- such as sperm that don't swim well -- 
lack L-carnitine. Small European studies suggest taking specific 
amounts of L-carnitine and a metabolite, acetylcarnitine, for three 
to six months gave subfertile men more normal sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't create super fertility.  
</P>
<P>
	``ProXeed's not a miracle drug. It does one thing: It optimizes  
sperm quality, and it does that very well,'' said Brad Stewart of 
Sigma-Tau, an Italian-based company that also sells prescription 
drug versions of L-carnitine, including one sold in the United 
States to treat a rare metabolic disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The European research is promising, but ``it's not all that  
firm, in all honesty,'' cautioned Dr. Jon Pryor of the University 
of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	He will perform the first U.S. study this summer, giving up to  
80 men at his clinic and Brown University either proXeed or a dummy 
pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are reassured about trying proXeed because the Food and  
Drug Administration says the prescription L-carnitine that treats 
metabolic disease has proved safe. 
</P>
<P>
	But L-carnitine also is sold as a dietary supplement, and  
dietary supplements are largely unregulated. The FDA cracks down 
only on dangerous ones, or those claiming to treat disease like a 
drug. FDA officials could not say if ``optimizing sperm quality'' 
would cross that line. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers, however, can buy supplements without consulting a  
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't do that, Pryor urged infertile men. Much male infertility  
is caused by something treatable such as a hormone imbalance that 
proXeed won't affect, and a few men even may have testicular cancer 
or another serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigma-Tau promised to pass that message to customers, and says  
it is working closely with fertility specialists ``to develop the 
science'' behind proXeed. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not seek FDA approval as a fertility drug rather than  
sell it as a supplement? It would take about $100 million more 
research -- and wouldn't prevent unregulated competitors sold in 
health food stores from claiming to work as well, said Stewart, who 
will sell proXeed on the Internet and by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Other L-carnitine supplements are sold mostly for weight loss,  
something Sigma-Tau's testing shows doesn't work, he said.

<HEADLINE> Questions Arise in Amtrak Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- In her final act, Julia Toledo tried to  
snatch her son out of the way of an oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
	But as she raced across the tracks to reach him, her three other  
sons trailed after her, and the whole family was struck from behind 
by the locomotive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Toledo, 46, and sons Pedro, 3; Angel, 6; and Carlos, 12,  
were killed, authorities said. Her 10-year-old son, Jose, was in 
critical condition today at Bridgeport Hospital. Authorities 
originally said it was the 6-year-old had survived, but after the 
coroner's office identified the remains they corrected that today 
to say it was Angel's brother Jose who was alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had been walking along the train tracks at 2:20 a.m.  
Tuesday when they were hit by an Amtrak train moving at 71 mph. At 
the scene, rescue workers found backpacks, books, report cards and 
a Bible strewn among body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious they weren't going for a joy ride. This was a  
family in distress,'' said Fairfield First Selectman Ken Flatto. 
</P>
<P>
	The family, natives of Ecuador, had lived in a Bridgeport  
apartment a few doors away from Julia's sister, Maria, and brother, 
Carlos. But last week they moved into the YMCA Families In 
Transition shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	The sister said in today's Hartford Courant that she had  
persuaded her sister to move from Ecuador 1 1/2 years ago. She said 
they were not citizens, but were in this country legally. The dead 
woman had worked as a janitor at Fairfield University. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Toledo had told a shelter case worker that the burden of  
child care and a demanding job had become too intense, the Courant 
reported. She told the case worker she had quit her job and needed 
a place for her and the boys to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The three older boys attended Luis Munoz Marin elementary  
school. Timileida Martorony, 11, a fifth-grader at the school, said 
the boys walked to school together. She said she was in the same 
class with Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nice. He liked to draw,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened as the family crossed a trestle over a  
two-lane street. The engineer reported seeing a child on the right 
side of the tracks at about 2:20 a.m. A split second later, he saw 
a woman and three other children on the left side of the tracks, 
said James O'Donnell, police chief for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman crossed the tracks in front of the oncoming train to  
reach the lone child on the right, and the other children followed, 
O'Donnell said. Apparently, in the confusion the boy on the right 
moved toward his mother at the same time, and all were struck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her last act was an attempt to save her other child,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Gambardella of the state Department of Transportation  
said it would have taken more than a mile for the engineer to stop 
the train. 
</P>
<P>
	``His only option would have been to blow the whistle, put the  
train into emergency (braking) and pray,'' Gambardella said. The 
train's recorder shows the engineer did indeed sound the horn and 
apply the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was headed by two electric locomotives, which are much  
quieter than diesel models, Gambardella said. The welded track in 
the area also reduces train noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you can't hear these trains at all until they're  
right on top of you, and by then, of course, it's too late,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ronald Gross, a trauma surgeon at Bridgeport Hospital, said  
the accident scene was horrific. The front of the train was 
splattered with blood, and lying amid the shattered bodies were a 
small tennis shoe and Sesame Street figurines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries on the train, which carried about 185  
passengers.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today for a second  
consecutive day on selling by overseas investors, retreating from 
last week's seven month high. Japanese stocks turned mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.10 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.62  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 122.70 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 16.29  
points, or 0.10 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,230.52 
points. On Tuesday, the average shed 176.26 points, or 1.08 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell against the yen in Tokyo  
as U.S. funds cut overbought dollar positions, but buying from 
Japanese life insurers and trust banks at around 121.50 yen 
supported the downside, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar started the Asian day on a weak note after another  
big drop on Wall Street overnight prompted Japanese institutional 
investors and overseas funds to sell on fears that the fall might 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. funds have long dollar positions and they want to further  
unwind the long positions,' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of 
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank, referring to the funds 
overbought in the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar remained under selling pressure as domestic investors  
continued to lock in profits following recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, the dollar rose to a seven month high against the  
yen, climbing above 124 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has now shed a total of 1.94 yen in two days. The  
currency ranged between 121.60 yen and 122.46 yen in today's 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 129.36 yen, down  
from 130.35 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average edged higher with  
domestic institutional investors buying some blue chips, including 
Sony Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on  
the exchange's first section was down 5.36 points, or 0.41 percent, 
to 1,303.32 points. The TOPIX lost 8.83 points, or 0.67 percent, 
the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market lacks direction,'' said Yoshihiko Kuroichi, an  
analyst in the investment information department at Kankaku 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 452  
million shares, compared with Tuesday's turnover of 445.08 million 
shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 688 to 496, with 132 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.58  
points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 10,531.09 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank shares in Tokyo were mixed after the nation's major lenders  
announced record losses this week. The 15 largest banks said they 
spent 10 trillion yen ($82 billion) over the last year writing off 
failed loans from the speculative 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.4300 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.3550 
percent, driving its price down to 99.73 yen from 100.39 yen.

	The transaction, which includes cash, stock and assumed debt,  
will make Allen's Charter Communications the fourth-largest cable 
television operator in the nation with 5.5 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was the latest in a yearlong buying spree that has  
vaulted the multibillionaire into the top ranks of the U.S. cable 
industry, which is undergoing a massive makeover as companies move 
toward offering phone, Internet and interactive video services over 
cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen had been advocating just such a system for years, and has  
been busy amassing an array of holdings in high-tech and 
entertainment firms as part of his ``Wired World'' strategy. His 
entry into the cable TV business a year ago was seen as a strong 
endorsement of that technology as a carrier of entertainment and 
interactive services. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's other holdings include an Internet portal site called  
Go2Net, which offers personal finance and commerce features, and 
High Speed Access Corp., which provides high-speed Internet access 
over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charter has a competitive edge in the access and availability  
of these new interactive services,'' said cable analyst Aryeh 
Bourkoff of CIBC World Markets. ``Given that Paul Allen has been a 
savvy investor in other properties, Charter customers are likely to 
benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen also owns two professional sports teams, football's  
Seattle Seahawks and basketball's Portland Trail Blazers, a 
strategy employed successfully by Cablevision of New York, which 
owns interests in the NBA's New York Knicks and the NHL's New York 
Rangers. Allen also has a stake in the DreamWorks SKG movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen began his cable campaign a year ago with the $2.8 billion  
purchase of Marcus Cable Co., which was then the nation's largest 
privately held cable operator. His second major purchase came last 
July with the $4.5 billion deal for the St. Louis-based Charter, 
which has become the vehicle for his other cable buys. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who often shies away from publicity, has considered a  
public offering of stock in his cable ventures but has so far kept 
them private. Thanks to his large holdings of Microsoft stock, 
Allen has a massive war chest of $22 billion, estimates Forbes 
magazine, making him the third-wealthiest American after Bill Gates 
and Warren Buffett. 
</P>
<P>
	For Falcon, the deal with Charter gives the company the  
financial backing and technological expertise to upgrade its cable 
lines, which are concentrated in California, the Pacific Northwest 
and the Southeast. The privately held Falcon is based in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-four percent of Falcon is controlled by founder Marc B.  
Nathanson, who will become vice chairman of Charter. The other 46 
percent of Falcon is owned by AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP; Internet Services, 
which has approved the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, with its blockbuster acquisitions of TCI and MediaOne, is  
now the nation's leading cable company, followed by Time Warner, 
Comcast, and now Charter. AT&AMP;T is also hoping to provide various 
telecom services over cable TV lines including local phone service 
and high-speed Internet access.

<HEADLINE> Group Says Ratings Spark Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Television programming is more violent and  
vulgar today than before the networks in 1997 adopted voluntary 
ratings, a conservative parents' group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings system, which was intended to help parents choose  
suitable shows for their children, has prompted some in the 
industry to push the envelope even further, said L. Brent Bozell 
III, chairman of the Parents Television Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plainly put, television is the raunchiest it has ever been in  
spite of, or perhaps because of, the unintended consequences of the 
ratings system and those who abuse it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The council studied two weeks of November sweeps programming for  
each of the past three years on NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, WB and UPN. 
Sexual content, foul language and violent content grew by nearly 31 
percent over that time, Bozell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters have contended just the opposite, cited a  
network-funded UCLA study from 1998 showing that networks had 
tempered the amount and nature of violence on their programs over 
the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., fired another salvo  
at the entertainment industry, saying the content of a TV station's 
programming should help determine whether its federal license is 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time we look directly at programming content,''  
Lieberman said at a Capitol Hill news conference that included 
Bozell. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lieberman and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., lauded steps taken  
in Washington since two students rampaged through a Colorado High 
School, killing 12 classmates and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownback sponsored provisions in the juvenile justice bill the  
Senate passed last week authorizing the Federal Trade Commission 
and the Justice Department to investigate whether Hollywood is 
marketing violent shows and games to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the public interest to know whether entertainment  
companies are making a killing off our kids,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision encourages TV networks, cable companies and  
the movie, music and video game industries to enter into a 
voluntary code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleading with the networks, please do that,'' Brownback  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brownback's spokesman said later the senator rejects as too  
heavyhanded Lieberman's idea that the Federal Communications 
Commission renew or yank TV station licenses based on programming 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	Bozell and the lawmakers said there are signs the entertainment  
industry is getting the message. They pointed to CBS's decision 
last week to leave off its schedule a pilot series about a mob war 
in New York City because of concerns about its violence.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Down; Corn Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, spring wheat and soybean futures were pressured by  
forecasts for warm, dry weather over the next week that should 
speed the pace of farmer plantings and put producers in a good 
position for another year of bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	But corn found buying support on reports of new export sales to  
Asia, which continues to reinforce ideas that demand for the U.S. 
commodity remains relatively strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.47 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn was unchanged at $2.14 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 cent to 
$1.20 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans fell 4 1/4 cents to $4.55 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .97 cent to 63.67 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .73 cent to 75.30 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .40 cent to 54 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 1.10 
cents to 54.47 cents a pound.

	Milosevic May Be Indicted  
</P>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The U.N. court's chief prosecutor,  
Louise Arbour, has called a news conference for tomorrow but will 
not comment on a CNN report that a war crimes indictment against 
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic is imminent. However, a 
diplomatic source at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, told 
The Associated Press today that an indictment appeared to have been 
in the works for several weeks. Meanwhile, the Yugoslav war crimes 
tribunal today urged the gathering of proof of wrongdoing in Kosovo 
before the evidence can be destroyed.

	Dolly the Sheep May Age Prematurely  
</P>
<P>
	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Dolly the cloned sheep may be  
susceptible to premature aging and disease because her genes were 
copied from a 6-year old sheep, Scottish scientists say. Dolly is a 
healthy 3-year-old sheep, but the DNA in her cells shows telltale 
signs of wear that are more typical of an older animal. Geneticists 
said the finding, published in Thursday's issue of the journal 
Nature, provides further evidence that cloning has its limits and 
that researchers cannot endlessly manufacture copies of animals 
without the original genetic blueprint wearing out. In 1996, Dolly 
became the first large animal to be cloned from genetic material 
extracted from an adult cell.

John McCain, R-Ariz., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., to authorize a new 
round of base closings in 2001 as part of an $288.8 billion defense 
spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1. ``The timing 
could not be worse'' for additional base closings, said Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. He said that, with the military 
already stetched thin by the conflict in Kosovo, it was no time to 
be closing down any military installations.

set up a camp with a blue tarp and tent and tended to a nearby

popular hiking routes, about 40 miles east of Portland. He had been

Board said overreactions caused severe pitching during two 
incidents in 1996 and 1997, seriously injuring four passengers and 
a flight attendant. Boeing has warned of the potential problem in 
flight crew operating manuals. But the safety board wants the FAA

<HEADLINE> Effort To Rush Gun Bill Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt  
Wednesday to force a vote on new gun restrictions this week, saying 
the House needs to consider changes to the proposals passed by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the National Rifle Association, the father of a girl  
murdered at Columbine High School and the mother of a Virginia boy 
executed a decade ago by a classmate with an AK-47 were scheduled 
to testify Thursday before a House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings are part of what Republicans say will be a  
cautious deliberation over mandatory background checks for all gun 
show transactions and other new restrictions passed last week by 
the Senate in the wake of school shootings in Colorado and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Judiciary Committee, in a 19-13 vote, rejected ranking  
Democrat John Conyers' effort to rush the Senate's proposals to the 
House floor this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Henry Hyde said the panel will hold to its plan to  
consider how the Senate bill would affect constitutional rights and 
send a bill to the floor in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a Second Amendment, there is a fundamental right that  
we're dealing with and therefore we should move expeditiously but 
not in a stampede,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said. ``We're going to do this 
and we're going to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the correct action would be to quickly place new  
restrictions on gun purchases. ``This is not a rush but a response 
to the crisis at hand,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, cracks continued to appear in Republicans ranks a day  
after House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Hyde voiced support for the 
concept of the Senate bill's restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said he had problems with many  
details in the Senate bill. Four students were killed in a March 
24, 1998 shooting spree at a Jonesboro, Ark., school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Senate's approach last week is what the  
American people expected of a deliberative body,'' Hutchinson told 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are expected to use a Thursday hearing before the  
crime subcommittee of Hyde's panel to grill Clinton administration 
officials on their enforcement of current gun laws and the White 
House's proposed firearms restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also had scheduled testimony from Wayne LaPierre of  
the National Rifle Association and from Darrell Scott, the father 
of murdered Columbine student Rachel Joy Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, planned to call as a witness Adam  
Deutchman, a Denver trauma surgeon who treated some of the victims 
of the Littleton, Colo., shootings, aides said.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Pulls Teledesic Engineers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Motorola Inc. has reduced its participation in  
Teledesic LLC's $9 billion project to create a satellite network 
for high-speed data transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola pulled many of its 600 engineers assigned to Teledesic  
and told several subcontractors to hold off on work relating to the 
project, The Wall Street Journal reported today. However, neither 
company said Motorola had dropped out of the project altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Teledesic is a planned network of 288 satellites that will  
transfer data to fixed locations, such as remote offices or cities 
with poor telecommunications infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola said the engineers were reassigned to projects that are  
likely to bring more immediate benefits than Teledesic, which is 
scheduled to begin service in 2003, according to the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations for a final contract to design and construct the  
Teledesic project, which also is backed by Microsoft Corp.'s Bill 
Gates and cellular telephone pioneer Craig McCaw, are already about 
six months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Teledesic, based in Kirkland, Wash., said the engineers left so  
that Motorola could concentrate resources on its Iridium 
satellite-communications project. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Teledesic network, the planned Iridium system is for  
voice and low transmission-rate data communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola created the 66-satellite Iridium  
project and owns 18 percent of Iridium LLC. Since going commercial 
in November, Iridium -- which cost $5 billion and 10 years to get 
off the ground -- has proven to be a disappointment and faces a 
shortfall in expected revenues.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Warns Euro Docs About Trovan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. warned European doctors Wednesday  
that patients taking its popular antibiotic Trovan have suffered 
rare but dangerous cases of liver damage. U.S. officials also are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the  
reports of liver damage were serious, and the agency is meeting 
with Pfizer to evaluate the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February 1998, 140 cases of serious liver damage have been  
reported among Trovan users, Pfizer said. Most users recovered 
after they stopped taking the antibiotic. But eight patients either 
died or required a liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union officials called the risk rare, saying 2.5  
million prescriptions have been written for Trovan worldwide, most 
for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the damage is potentially severe, European officials  
warned patients to stop taking the antibiotic if they experience 
symptoms suggesting hypersensitivity to Trovan -- such as a skin 
rash or hives -- or such liver symptoms as fatigue, yellowing of the 
skin or eyes, stomach pain with nausea or vomiting, or dark urine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Pfizer is discussing the liver damage  
cases with the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe they are serious and the labeling information  
should be upgraded,'' said FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. label for Trovan advises doctors to periodically  
monitor patients' livers because some people experienced abnormal 
liver tests, an early warning sign of damage, during studies of 
Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan, known chemically as trovafloxacin, treats a range of  
infections, from pneumonia and sinusitis to surgical infections and 
gonorrhea. It also is used to prevent infections in people about to 
undergo colorectal surgery or hysterectomy.

<HEADLINE> Trial Ordered in Kuralt Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A trial must be held on whether the  
longtime secret companion of Charles Kuralt is entitled to the late 
television correspondent's Montana fishing retreat, the state 
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court overturned a judge's decision that the property  
belonged to Kuralt's widow instead of the woman he shared a secret 
life with for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 4-1 ruling, the court said a trial must be held to  
determine whether a letter written by Kuralt shortly before he died 
two years ago was meant to give the property to Patricia Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shannon, a divorced mother of three, met Kuralt in Reno,  
Nev., in 1968, and they began a secret relationship that lasted 
until his death July 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He paid her money and financed her children's schooling. They  
vacationed together and shared a cabin near Twin Bridges, on the 
Big Hole River. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Kuralt gave her a home in Ireland. Four years later, a  
handwritten will by Kuralt gave Ms. Shannon all his Montana 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	But a 1994 will revoked that decision and gave all the holdings  
to Suzanna, his wife of 35 years, and his children. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1997, Kuralt gave Ms. Shannon a cabin and 20 acres, but  
he did not change his 1994 will dealing with the remaining Montana 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shannon sued his estate, saying the letter he wrote while  
hospitalized for the last time indicated he wanted her to have the 
holdings -- 90 acres, a refurbished schoolhouse and other buildings 
on the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The widow of the broadcaster known for his ``On the Road''  
series argued that the letter merely showed her husband planned to 
have a lawyer draw up the papers so that Ms. Shannon could inherit 
the property. That never happened and the letter was not a legal 
will, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Goetz of Bozeman, attorney for Ms. Shannon, said he was  
pleased by the high court's decision that evidence of the 
``long-standing relationship of the parties and their almost 
family-like situation'' can be used in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``That bodes pretty well for our case,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Todd Hillier, the Bozeman lawyer for Mrs. Kuralt, declined to  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Questions Gov't. Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer expert who will be one of the final  
witnesses in the Microsoft trial revealed today how he has improved 
his method of disabling the Internet browser in Windows, touching 
on a central claim in the government's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton  
University, said some changes to his controversial technique were 
prompted by comments from Microsoft witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten previously testified as one of the Justice Department's  
dozen witnesses. Microsoft questioned him again under oath 
Wednesday in a deposition at the federal courthouse here. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants Felten to take the stand again next month --  
during the trial's rebuttal phase -- to rebut earlier testimony from 
Microsoft executive James Allchin. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Tuesday after a 13-week break.  
</P>
<P>
	Felten's testimony is important because Microsoft contends that  
Windows and its browser are so closely integrated to make it 
impossible to remove the Web software without crippling Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally ``tied'' Windows  
and its browser to undermine Netscape Communications Corp., whose 
Web software is Microsoft's biggest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft feared that Netscape's browser threatened in some ways  
to mature into a rival software platform that could minimize the 
importance of Windows, Microsoft's most lucrative franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	In his trial testimony, Felten showed the judge how he was able  
to modify some files to prevent Microsoft's Internet software from 
starting in all but a few instances. Since Felten last testified, 
he's been improving his technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, for example, complained that Felten's tinkering  
disabled a popular feature in Windows 98 that allows consumers to 
install off the Internet incremental updates and improvements to 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten disclosed Wednesday that he has created his own version  
of this ``Windows Update'' feature. He also changed some error 
messages that Microsoft complained might be confusing when 
encountered on a computer that the company derisively said had been 
``Feltenized.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Auto Production Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hit by slumping domestic sales and weak demand  
abroad, Japan's automobile production fell 6.5 percent in April 
from a year earlier, an industry association said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of cars, trucks and buses totaled 711,787 vehicles  
last month, compared with 761,402 produced in April of last year, 
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said in its monthly 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The association estimated that Japan's vehicle exports dropped  
11 percent in April from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The production decline in April followed a 3.8 percent rise in  
March after output declined four straight months because of 
sluggish sales due to a recession at home and weak demand in Asian 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Output at Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, was  
down 8.3 percent in April to 234,612 vehicles, the association 
said. Production at Nissan Motor Co. fell 8.3 percent to 86,580. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other major automakers, Honda Motor Co. production dropped  
7.5 percent to 88,478 vehicles, while Mazda Motor Corp.'s fell 9.8 
percent to 53,635. 
</P>
<P>
	Output at Mitsubishi Motors Corp. slipped 1.0 percent to 60,527  
vehicles. Production at Suzuki Motor Corp. rose 2.7 percent to 
79,411, while Isuzu Motors Ltd. output dropped 12.7 percent to 
11,524.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Vetoes Execution Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Gov. Mike Johanns on Wednesday vetoed a  
measure that would have made Nebraska the first state to enact a 
moratorium on executions. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said the moratorium would be poor public policy, and  
death row inmates would use it as a basis for unnecessary appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death penalty is the law of Nebraska,'' he said. ``We have  
an obligation to enforce that law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would have put a two-year moratorium on executions  
while a study was done to see if the death penalty is applied 
fairly. Death sentences could have been issued during the 
moratorium, but no executions would have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said he received more than 250 letters, e-mails and  
calls on the matter, including a call from Pope John Paul II's 
representative in Washington D.C., urging him to sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns, a first-term Republican who supports capital  
punishment, said he did not let politics or religion play a role in 
his decision. The GOP platform supports the death penalty while the 
Catholic Church opposes capital punishment. Johanns is a devout 
Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears unlikely that lawmakers have enough votes to override  
the veto. The measure passed Nebraska's one-house Legislature last 
week on a 27-21 vote. Thirty votes are needed for an override. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium was proposed by Omaha Sen. Kermit Brashear, a  
conservative death penalty supporter and former Republican 
candidate for governor. He presented the measure as an amendment to 
a fellow senator's measure to abolish the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor chose to disregard the considered judgment of a  
majority of state senators ...,'' Brashear said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men have been put to death since Nebraska resumed  
executions in 1994 after a 35-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have considered moratoriums but have not adopted  
legislation, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a 
Washington-based group critical of how capital punishment is 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials stopped executions for a year after a fire  
started during a 1997 electrocution. The Illinois House recently 
passed a resolution urging the governor to impose a six-month 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association and the National Conference of  
Catholic Bishops have called for such moratoriums.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Strawberry Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry pleaded no contest to drug  
and solicitation charges today and awaited word on whether he would 
ever play baseball again. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder was sentenced to 18 months of  
probation and must be tested for drugs twice a week during that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he will not go to jail, Strawberry's latest legal  
entanglement leaves his baseball future unclear. He is on leave 
from the Yankees and faces possible suspension as a multiple 
offender of baseball's drug aftercare program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that Darryl Strawberry's legal proceeding has been  
resolved, I will promptly review all of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this matter in order to determine what action is 
appropriate under baseball's drug policy,'' baseball commissioner 
Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would consult with medical advisers from baseball and  
the players' union who evaluated Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said the team will not  
comment on Strawberry's status until major league baseball rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is about Darryl as a person,'' manager Joe Torre  
said at Yankee Stadium. ``In my four years here, he has been 
nothing but a model citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. ordered the eight-time  
All-Star to stay out of bars and asked police and prosecutors to 
supply Strawberry with a map of Tampa ``hot spots'' to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really isn't about baseball,'' the judge said. ``It isn't  
about your job, but about you. ... This is about what's in your 
heart and what's in your mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you stop producing, nobody will care about you,'' he  
added. ``If this is the picture of life after baseball, it's not 
pretty. This is only an opportunity. I hope you make the best of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without being asked, Strawberry replied: ``I will.''  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, accompanied by his wife, Charisse, and lawyer Joseph  
Ficarrotta, apologized outside Hillsborough County Courthouse. He 
spoke from a handwritten statement before driving off in a white 
van. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest April 14, the 37-year-old Strawberry  
was in Tampa working out at the Yankees' minor league complex in 
hopes of making a comeback from colon cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recovery has not been easy,'' he said. ``I am, however,  
committed to it and now that I have finished chemotherapy and feel 
healthy, I'm looking forward to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was charged with possession of 0.3 grams of cocaine  
and offering an undercover female police officer $50 for sex. The 
cocaine found wrapped in a $20 bill inside his wallet had an 
estimated street value of about $20. 
</P>
<P>
	He told police the cocaine did not belong to him and that he was  
joking with the officer and never intended to have sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Strawberry also must undergo more drug treatment,  
perform 100 hours of community service and pay $456 in court fees. 
If he successfully completes probation, his criminal record will be 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Espinosa told Strawberry the only difference between his case  
and many others he handles is that it involved a famous person. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all made mistakes. They've all got the same problem.  
They've all got an excuse,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry at first declined to address the court, then  
expressed remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd just like to say I'm truly sorry,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither Strawberry nor his lawyer answered questions outside  
court. Ficarrotta said Strawberry pleaded no contest ``to get this 
matter behind us and to go forward with his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors insisted Strawberry did not get special treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is his first criminal drug offense,'' assistant state  
attorney Pam Bondi said. ``That's why he was placed on probation 
with intensive drug treatment and community service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the arrest, Strawberry was placed on administrative  
leave that barred him from training or playing for the Yankees or 
any of their farm teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for 60 days in 1995 after testing positive for  
cocaine. The previous year, he spent four weeks in a rehab clinic 
for a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he also was ordered to repay $350,000 in back taxes and  
sentenced to six months of home confinement, except for games. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to baseball from his suspension four years ago,  
Strawberry has been tested regularly for drugs. He has spent 15 
years in the majors and had his best season in seven years in 1998, 
hitting .247 with 24 home runs and 57 RBIs in 101 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all make mistakes,'' Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte said  
Wednesday. ``He's a professional athlete, so his tend to get 
magnified more. We're just pulling for him as a person.''

<HEADLINE> More Weapons Lab Security Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a House report on Chinese  
espionage, members of Congress pledged Wednesday to push proposals 
increasing security at U.S. weapons laboratories and tightening 
controls on technology exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the defense bill was expected to be used to  
advance plans to increase monitoring of Chinese rocket launches and 
to beef up security and background checks at the Energy 
Department's nuclear weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., alluding to the  
reports of Chinese espionage, said that while ``I don't think we 
should rush to judgment ... we should understand the full 
ramifications of what happened here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott proposed a package of proposals he would like to see  
included in the $288.8 billion defense spending bill for fiscal 
2000 that the Senate was debating on Wednesday. It would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Require the president to notify Congress about investigations  
of satellite-technology transfers and give the CIA more power to 
review technology export licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Put the FBI in charge of background checks for DOE weapons  
laboratory workers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require the Defense Department to strengthen its program  
monitoring Chinese civilian rocket launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said he would propose a bipartisan  
commission that would conduct a government-wide review of all 
counterintelligence activities. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal under consideration would require that a new senior  
official at the Energy Department oversee all department research 
labs and report directly to Congress. The labs traditionally have 
had widespread independence. The Clinton administration has 
signaled it would oppose such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, in the meantime, could move as early as Thursday to  
consolidate counterintelligence activities at the Energy Department 
under a single office, reporting directly to the energy secretary. 
It would codify actions already taken by the department. ``We need 
a counterintelligence program that works,'' said Rep. John Spratt, 
D-S.C., who plans to offer the provision as part of a defense bill 
to be considered by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., appearing on PBS'  
``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' said that despite the uproar over 
Chinese espionage, the United States must maintain commercial ties 
with China. ``We need to be engaged with China. China has become a 
huge trade partner with the United States. If we disengage, we can 
go backward in that whole relationship,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the two principal authors of the 871-page House  
select committee report on China's 20-year campaign to steal 
America's nuclear secrets made the rounds of Capitol Hill with 
briefings before both Senate and House committees. The report was 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	China has obtained secret information ``about every single  
(nuclear) weapon in the U.S. arsenal,'' Rep. Christopher Cox, 
R-Calif., said in briefing lawmakers. But he said Congress might be 
able to forestall China from being able to convert the U.S. warhead 
design information into deployable weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is,'' added Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., who  
joined Cox in the briefings, ``can (China) take what they have 
stolen ... and produce an actual weapon? We've got to watch this to 
see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before the House International Relations subcommittee  
on Asia and the Pacific, the two lawmakers urged Congress to 
tighten controls on the sale of high-power computers and satellite 
technology to China. Both steps could aid China in using stolen 
U.S. weapon design material to create a new generation of nuclear 
missiles, Cox and Dicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrictions on technology sales to China must come in  
conjunction with America's allies, including Europe and Japan, Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States to impose restrictions unilaterally  
``would be the worst of all possible worlds'' because China still 
would get the technology elsewhere, yet U.S. businesses and workers 
would be harmed, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to citing extensive theft of nuclear secrets from  
weapons labs, dating back to the 1970s, Cox concluded China has 
gained considerable military knowledge from three failed launches 
in China of U.S. satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Information provided by the U.S. satellite manufacturers in  
trying to correct the satellite launch problems provided China with 
valuable information that improved the reliability of China's 
military rockets, according to the report by Cox's committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said Congress should act to expand U.S. civilian satellite  
launch capabilities, so private companies would not seek out the 
Chinese for launches.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Hiker Killed by Bear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A man on a day hike in a rural area was  
killed when a bear bit his head, Alaska State Troopers said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Cates, 53, was found Wednesday morning on a horse trail  
in a heavily wooded area of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge near 
his hometown of Soldotna. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack happened about six miles off a busy road. The area is  
about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	His only visible wound was a single bite to the head, said Bruce  
Bartley, a spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife 
Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal wildlife officials were looking for the bear  
involved in the attack. If the bear is judged to pose a continuing 
threat to humans it may be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber rifle and two spent shell  
casings were found near the body, along with traces of blood that 
suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if  
there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cates' death is the first fatal bear mauling in Alaska since  
Feb. 8, 1998, when Audelio Luis Cortes, 40, was killed while 
working on a seismic crew in the Swanson River oil field near 
Kenai. Cortes also died from a single head bite.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Man Accused of Abusing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- A man has been arrested for allegedly  
beating and starving his disabled wife for 17 years, hiding her 
from the world on a decrepit sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Matthew David, 59, was arrested Tuesday on assault  
charges and jailed on $150,000 bail. He could get up to 10 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, police were called to the couple's sailboat by a social  
worker who was trying to determine whether David was fraudulently 
collecting his wife's disability checks. She has multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Linda David, 50, wearing filthy, vomit-stained  
clothes in a room covered with dog feces, according to court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	She was almost blind and barely able to speak. Her face was  
badly scarred, and her arms had been broken and had healed without 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to some of the officers who were involved at the  
time,'' olice spokesman Elliot Woodall said Tuesday, ``and they 
said that it was among the worst conditions they'd ever seen a 
human living in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. David, who is now recovering in a nursing home, said: ``No  
way I could get off (the boat) to get help. That was home. I never 
had anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said David wasn't arrested for 2 1/2 more years because  
of the difficulty in building a case. He had kept his wife so 
well-hidden that neighbors thought she did not really exist, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	David said any injuries his wife suffered came when she fell out  
of a truck.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Employee Behind O'Hairs' Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Authorities said for the first time Wednesday  
that missing atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair and two of her 
adult children were dead, accusing a former employee of 
orchestrating their murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations against David Waters and three others came in a  
36-page affidavit filed in court by the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair, whose 1963 Supreme Court case led to the ban on  
organized prayer in public schools, vanished from San Antonio with 
her son, Jon Garth Murray, and granddaughter Robin Murray, and 
$500,000 in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Waters, who is jailed in Austin on weapons  
charges, allegedly orchestrated the plot to steal at least $600,000 
from Ms. O'Hair's United Secularists of America. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also hated Ms. O'Hair, authorities said, fantasizing  
about ``seeing Madalyn suffer, and snipping off her toes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The document names Waters; Gary Karr, imprisoned in Detroit;  
Danny Fry, who was killed shortly after the O'Hairs vanished; and 
Gerald Lee Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit, used to obtain a search warrant of Waters'  
apartment, was unsealed on the eve of his scheduled court 
appearance on the weapons charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, told the San Antonio Express-News  
that he hadn't seen the document. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters has not been charged with the O'Hair murders.  
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit, however, said Waters was responsible for the  
death of Fry, whose headless, handless body was dumped in Dallas 
County on Oct. 2, 1995, two days after the O'Hairs vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters, who worked for Ms. O'Hair in 1993 and 1994, ``was open  
about his dislike of the O'Hairs and made comments about harming 
Madalyn,'' the document said, citing an informant. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have theorized the O'Hairs' remains were buried in  
barrels, but two searches of a ranch near San Antonio recently 
failed to find either barrels or bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a second confidential informant, Karr has talked  
about Waters committing four murders in Texas, following a card 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the card game, Waters drove four people involved in the  
card game back home. Waters killed them, took the jewelry, (rings 
and Rolexes) off the bodies, and buried them in a field in Texas 
near a subdivision,'' the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters used a van rented by Karr to transport the bodies, and  
Karr told the informant that one of the persons killed was a woman 
named O'Hair, her daughter and son and another man, the affidavit 
said.

<HEADLINE> White Cops Sue for Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Eight white officers have filed a federal  
discrimination lawsuit against the Boston Police Department, saying 
it illegally schemed to promote black people. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers -- seven men and a woman -- say they were unfairly  
passed over for promotion while three black officers who received 
the same exam score got the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers allege the police department and state human  
resources officials targeted the cluster of three black officers 
for promotion as a way to maintain an internal quota for black 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They identified three black officers and decided they needed  
them to reach their goal, and excluded other officers by doing 
this,'' said lawyer Michael McLaughlin, who successfully challenged 
the race-based admissions policies of Boston's prestigious public 
exam schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Friday, alleges the department altered an  
original plan to promote 30 officers who took a sergeant's exam in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven officers scoring in the 90s and high 80s -- all  
white except for one --were chosen. The department then tried to 
skip down the list to select three black officers who had scored 
84, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
	When the state Civil Service Commission advised that practice  
was illegal, the department promoted six extra white officers who 
had scored 85 so that the three black officers scoring 84 could be 
chosen. No whites who scored 84 were promoted, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's legal advisor, Mary Jo Harris, said there was  
no manipulation, just a clearly stated goal to maintain minority 
representation in all levels of the force. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the department has the right to select candidates on  
the basis of race, language skills or other specialized training 
from a pool of same-scoring applicants.

<HEADLINE> Minority Enrollment at UC Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- University of California officials are  
expecting a slight increase in the number of underrepresented 
minorities enrolling this fall, the second year without affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the gains would be made among Hispanic students, who  
will make up 9.1 percent of overall enrollment, compared to 8.9 
percent last year. The figures released Tuesday reflect the number 
of admitted students who have indicated they plan to accept their 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of black students expected to enroll was virtually  
unchanged, from 751 to 755. Hispanic expected enrollment was rising 
from 3,190 last fall to 3,391, an increase of 6 percent. American 
Indians, also considered an underrepresented minority, showed a 
decrease in expected enrollment, from 200 to 148, a drop of 26 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, underrepresented minorities make up 15.4 percent of the  
27,800 students who plan to attend this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the proportion of Asian Americans has  
increased to 37.7 percent, up from 35.2 percent last year. White 
students also increased to 37.7 percent, 3.7 percent higher than 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	University of California regents voted in 1995 to abolish  
race-based admissions. The changes went into effect for 
undergraduates last fall, leading to sharp decreases in black and 
Hispanic admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and Hispanic admissions rebounded this year, an increase  
credited to strong recruitment and a more comprehensive application 
review. Admissions of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians fell 
only 27 students short of the total for fall 1997, the last year of 
affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	Although overall numbers were up, the percentage of  
underrepresented minorities accepting offers of admission dipped 
slightly, from 57 percent last year to just under 56 percent this 
year.

<HEADLINE> House Work on Spending Bills Slowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative discontent with Republican  
leaders over spending legislation is slowing House debate over an 
agriculture bill, creating new uncertainty about how Congress will 
complete its spending work this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are less chaotic in the Senate, where subcommittees  
approved a $21.2 billion bill Tuesday covering energy and water 
programs, plus a $48.9 billion measure for transportation. But GOP 
leaders there are unsure how must-pass spending bills can be 
approved that, under budget limits, are supposed to be $24 billion 
below this year's levels for domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly nine hours Tuesday, the House debated a $61 billion  
measure financing farm and food programs for next fiscal year. 
Lawmakers barely made any headway. It was the first spending bill 
for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, to reach the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason for the glacial pace: a parade of amendments by  
conservatives, who claimed the measure put lawmakers on a path 
toward breaking spending limits imposed by the budget that Congress 
approved just last month. Exceeding those limits would mean 
spending part of the Social Security surplus, which Republicans 
have pledged not to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of living up to our responsibility to secure a  
future for our children,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader 
of the dissident group. ``And quite frankly, I'm not sure this body 
is up to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, participants said  
conservatives want GOP leaders to explain quickly what their 
strategy is for approving all 13 spending bills for federal 
agencies for fiscal 2000 without letting President Clinton win 
billions of extra dollars for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, many lawmakers and aides say there is no such  
strategy. Even so, many of them privately concede that negotiations 
with the White House that result in additional spending are all but 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find out how to do all this stuff, and we  
can't do it on their time frame,'' said House Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas, asked in a brief interview what conservatives 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Of six amendments the conservatives offered, only one was  
approved, cutting the Agriculture Department's chief information 
officer's budget by $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted 24-3 to  
divide $536 billion among its 13 spending bills. The only opponents 
were three Democrats: Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Dianne 
Feinstein of California and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Like an outline approved last week by the House Appropriations  
Committee, the Senate plan would leave bills covering education, 
environment and other domestic programs $24 billion below this 
year's levels and more than $30 billion below what Clinton 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin bridging that gap, the Senate panel voted by voice to  
take $3.1 billion approved in earlier bills for defense programs 
and use it for domestic spending bills instead. Decisions on 
dividing that money will be made later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go step by step by step across each little  
puddle,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska. But Stevens conceded his panel remained billions 
of dollars short of what it would need for its spending bills this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending restrictions in Congress' budget mirror spending  
reductions promised in the 1997 budget-balancing deal between 
Clinton and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy and water bill would spend $100 million less in the  
next fiscal year than this year and $400 million less than Clinton 
wanted. The transportation measure would spend $1.6 billion more 
than this year, but that's $1.3 billion less than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, the nation's passenger railroad, would get $571 million,  
$38 million less than this year. Construction on Army Corps of 
Engineers water projects would get $1.1 billion, a cut of $318 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The transportation measure also imposes new requirements on how  
airlines treat passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require an airline that knows a flight's arrival  
will be delayed to notify passengers before they board the plane. 
Airlines advertising bargain fares would have to specify the number 
of seats available at that rate. And passengers who don't use a 
portion of a ticket could not be penalized.

<HEADLINE> Va. Town Riddled by Police Bullets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Police who were practicing at the wrong  
shooting range peppered a suburban neighborhood with submachine gun 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 homes and three vehicles were hit by the gunfire  
from nearly a mile away, according to authorities. No one was 
injured in the incident Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	One errant bullet narrowly missed a father and his 8-month-old  
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	A weapons instructor for the District of Columbia police  
department took up to a dozen officers from several jurisdictions 
to the district-operated firing range on the grounds of the Lorton 
Correctional Complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The instructor mistakenly allowed the officers to fire  
submachine guns on a range meant for shotguns. Up to 15 of the 9 mm 
bullets whizzed into a nearby neighborhood, where they lodged in 
walls and cars or bounced off siding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our preliminary investigation indicates officers were using a  
weapon on a range they shouldn't have been on, and firing from a 
position they shouldn't have been firing from,'' said Terrance W. 
Gainer, Washington's executive assistant police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainer said the instructor -- identified as Henry Rorie, 49 --  
improperly led the officers to the shotgun range when he discovered 
their scheduled range was already in use. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainer said the instructor used ``poor judgment'' and the  
officers ``violated even the minimum safety standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rorie, a 20-year police veteran, could not be reached today for  
comment. Police declined to let reporters speak to Rorie today, 
saying the matter is still under investigation. Rorie has an 
unlisted home telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori Hatton said one bullet crashed through her dining room  
window, narrowly missing her husband, an off-duty police officer 
who was holding one of their 8-month-old twin girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have killed somebody,'' she said. ``I just feel  
unsafe in my own house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey has suspended all  
training at the range.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Lynette Woodard, the all-time collegiate  
scoring leader and first woman to play for the Harlem 
Globetrotters, said today she will retire from professional

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sound Helps Mandy Barnett Find Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT JULIET, Tenn. (AP) -- At 23, Mandy Barnett has the resume  
and seen-it-all demeanor of a singer twice her age. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been lauded as a precocious child star, molded to be the  
``new Wynonna,'' and dismissed as nothing more than a Patsy Cline 
imitator. At 19, she was labeled a has-been. 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest incarnation is more appealing: a singer earmarked for  
greatness by Seymour Stein, the record executive who discovered 
Madonna and The Pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein had been following her career since stumbling into a show  
she did in Austin, Texas, a decade ago. He was impressed enough to 
sign her for his revived Sire Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett welcomed the opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really have much of a choice but to do this,'' Barnett  
joked of her singing career. ``Because I'm sorry as hell at 
everything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's voice is at times a ringer for Cline, who died in  
1963. Earlier in her career, she tried to sound different to avoid 
comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	On her first album for Sire, ``I've Got a Right to Cry,'' she  
transcends the similarities by embracing them. She even hired Owen 
Bradley, Cline's former producer, and he surrounded her with 
strings and vocal choruses that bring to mind the sound that 
Bradley is credited with helping start and Cline used so 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to work with (Bradley) because of Patsy,''  
Barnett said. ``I wanted to work with Owen because he was a 
wonderful producer and he would be able to really make me sound the 
way I should sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett and Bradley had completed four songs before Bradley's  
death in January 1998 at 82. She finished the album with Bradley's 
brother, Jerry, and nephew Bobby Bradley. They worked from Owen 
Bradley's notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly five years after starring in the ``Always ... Patsy  
Cline'' stage musical, Barnett sounds like a singer in the Patsy 
Cline tradition, not a copycat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I have my own distinctive sound,'' she said,  
emphasizing the word ``distinctive.'' Then, with a touch of 
irritation in her voice, she added: ``Some people can't see past 
the Patsy thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Cline, Barnett cites the records of Patti Page, Loretta  
Lynn, Connie Francis, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Sara Vaughan, Brenda 
Lee, Jim Reeves and Linda Ronstadt as influences. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett began as the pint-sized ``town singer'' in Crossville,  
Tenn., about 100 miles east of Nashville. She sang at churches and 
political gatherings starting when she was 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody died, I'd sing at their funeral,'' she said. ``If  
they got married, I'd sing at their wedding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 10, she was hired to sing at Dollywood, Dolly Parton's East  
Tennessee theme park. The Grand Ole Opry put her on stage when she 
was 13. The next year, she was signed to Capitol Records but, after 
four years and no releases, she was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later she landed the lead in ``Always ... Patsy  
Cline'' at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The next two years the search for a style stopped. Her job was  
to sound like Cline. She sang ``Crazy'' and ``I Fall to Pieces'' 
hundreds of times. A cast recording was released, and the show gave 
her enough career momentum to land a recording deal with Asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1995 solo album, ``Mandy Barnett,'' featured songs by Willie  
Nelson, Jim Lauderdale and Kelly Willis. But the album failed to 
remove Barnett from Cline's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weird thing about that record was, it was (recorded) right  
in the middle of doing all this Patsy Cline,'' Barnett said. ``I 
think I sounded more like her than I do now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then 13-year-old LeAnn Rimes became an instant star in 1996 with  
``Blue.'' The song was a Cline ringer. 
</P>
<P>
	At 19, Barnett felt she had been passed by.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard,'' she said. ``I just got depressed.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stein, a Nashville outsider, came to her rescue. He signed her  
to Sire in the spring of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was encouraged to make whatever kind of record she  
wanted, said Andy McLenon, who runs the Nashville office of Sire. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett wanted to work with Bradley, and Stein agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Chet Atkins are credited with coming up with a sound  
to reach older listeners when rock 'n' roll had captured the youth 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	It played down rustic banjos and fiddles in favor of string  
sections and elaborate vocal choruses, keeping just enough steel 
guitar in the mix so people would know they were listening to 
country music. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a sound Barnett grew up loving.  
</P>
<P>
	``This sound is something I wanted to do on my last record and  
wasn't allowed to,'' Barnett said. ``I was singing this style of 
songs when I was a little girl. ... I just didn't know all those 
years that to find yourself, really all you've got to do is sing 
what you like. I thought it was a lot more complicated than that.''

<HEADLINE> Suit To Be Filed in Columbine Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A lawyer for relatives of a student slain in the  
Columbine massacre said Wednesday he plans to file a $250 million 
lawsuit against the parents of student gunmen Dylan Klebold and 
Eric Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger, who is best known for representing Dr. Jack  
Kevorkian, said he will file the lawsuit Thursday in Denver on 
behalf of Isaiah Shoels' parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice demands a full accounting of everyone who  
significantly contributed to this massacre,'' Fieger said in a 
statement. ``Klebold and Harris could not have developed and 
executed their violence without the negligence of the parents and 
possibly others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger was en route to Denver on Wednesday and was unavailable  
for additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney representing Wayne and Katherine Harris, Eric's  
parents, did not return a telephone message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Simon, a spokeswoman for the law firm that represents  
Thomas and Susan Klebold, Dylan's parents, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Shoels' parents, Vonda and Michael Shoels, said  
they would be unavailable for comment until a news conference 
scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, scattered gunfire and bombs inside  
Columbine High School on April 20, killing a dozen classmates and a 
teacher and injuring 23 students before they committed suicide.

<HEADLINE>  India Fires on Kashmir Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Raising the stakes between the two new  
nuclear powers, Indian aircraft fired on separatist guerrillas in 
Kashmir province Wednesday and Pakistan threatened retaliation. It 
was the first use of air power in years in the long-running 
conflict over the Himalayan border region. 
</P>
<P>
	India said it had blasted at Pakistani soldiers and guerrillas  
entrenched in rugged, snowcapped mountains in the Indian-held part 
of Kashmir. Pakistan, however, denied that its troops were involved 
and said India's aircraft had bombed Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian aircraft began attacking rebel positions in the  
17,000-foot peaks at dawn. Later, warplanes and helicopters were 
still roaring over Dras, a village a mile from the Line of Control 
that divides Kashmir between the two nations, and the faint thud of 
bombs could be heard across the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan called the airstrikes a grave escalation of tensions.  
``Pakistan armed forces reserve the right to respond,'' military 
spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	American and British ambassadors in New Delhi met Indian Defense  
Minister George Fernandes and urged restraint by both sides. U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on all parties to stop the 
fighting, spokesman Manoel de Almeida y Silva said at U.N. 
headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major confrontation between the two neighbors  
since they conducted nuclear tests a year ago and declared 
themselves nuclear powers. India and Pakistan have fought three 
wars, two of them over Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchange fire along their disputed  
frontier almost every day. Indian soldiers also frequently open 
fire to thwart Pakistan-based guerrillas trying to cross into 
Indian-held areas to fight for independence for Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Indian satellite photos showed that about 600  
guerrillas had pushed nearly four miles into India's territory, 
taking advantage of the melting snow to occupy posts Indian 
soldiers had vacated at the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani, who is in charge of  
internal security, said ``the intruders this time comprise 
Pakistani army regulars as well as mercenaries and this operation 
will be smashed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advani rejected the Pakistani charge that Indian aircraft had  
bombed Pakistan, saying the strikes were ``well inside'' 
Indian-controlled parts of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it was concerned at the number and tenacity  
of the infiltrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the start of operations and they will continue until  
our defense forces reoccupy our territories. Any escalation of this 
conflict will be entirely the responsibility of Pakistan,'' the 
Defense Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's Foreign Ministry told reporters that the directors  
general of Indian and Pakistani military operations would hold 
talks ``in an attempt to defuse the situation.'' But Pakistan's 
army said the two directors general spoke on Tuesday and India did 
not warn Pakistan of the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani military spokesman Quereshi said that in the last 17  
days India had moved jet fighters, helicopter gunships and an 
estimated 12,000 soldiers into the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan knew  
nothing about the infiltrators. ``No one knows where they come from 
and who they are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	India says they are Afghan mercenaries and Pakistani soldiers.  
Intelligence agencies said they have anti-aircraft missiles, radar, 
snowmobiles and sophisticated communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, a Muslim insurrection broke out in Kashmir.  
Guerrillas fighting for independence of Kashmir have been fighting 
with Indian security forces and more than 15,000 people have been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir is the only Muslim-dominated region in largely Hindu  
India. Pakistan, an Islamic republic, says Kashmiris should have 
the right to self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the State Department said the latest fighting  
``underlines the pressing need for India and Pakistan to resolve 
their differences.''

	U.S. officials said Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee  
and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif have discussed 
developments by telephone.

	``We are encouraging them to keep in touch,'' the State  
Department statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dras, 100 miles northeast of state capital, Srinagar, Indian  
army officers said the target of Wednesday's attack was about 70 
infiltrators who had entrenched themselves on the slopes of the 
mountains, looking down at Indian army convoys 2,700 feet below. 
Their command of the heights handicapped Indian soldiers trying to 
evict them, officers told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Army officers in the area said the infiltrators must have taken  
months to occupy the posts. They said Indian forces could take 
three to six months to evict them.

<P>
	The exchange of mortar and heavy artillery fire between the  
infiltrators and the army in the Kargil and Dras regions has left 
at least 160 people dead over the past two weeks, army Brig. Mohan 
Bhandari said. Thousands of residents of the region have fled to 
safe villages along the Suru River. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, India successfully tested a naval version of its  
surface-to-air missile Trishul on Wednesday, domestic news agencies 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea-skimming Trishul was test-fired from a military base  
near the southern Indian port city of Cochin, Press Trust of India 
reported. The Trishul is one of five missiles being developed by

<HEADLINE>  India Fires on Kashmir Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Raising the stakes between the two new  
nuclear powers, Indian aircraft fired on separatist guerrillas in 
Kashmir province Wednesday and Pakistan threatened retaliation. It 
was the first use of air power in years in the long-running 
conflict over the Himalayan border region. 
</P>
<P>
	India said it had blasted at Pakistani soldiers and guerrillas  
entrenched in rugged, snowcapped mountains in the Indian-held part 
of Kashmir. Pakistan, however, denied that its troops were involved 
and said India's aircraft had bombed Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian aircraft began attacking rebel positions in the  
17,000-foot peaks at dawn. Later, warplanes and helicopters were 
still roaring over Dras, a village a mile from the Line of Control 
that divides Kashmir between the two nations, and the faint thud of 
bombs could be heard across the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan called the airstrikes a grave escalation of tensions.  
``Pakistan armed forces reserve the right to respond,'' military 
spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	American and British ambassadors in New Delhi met Indian Defense  
Minister George Fernandes and urged restraint by both sides. U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on all parties to stop the 
fighting, spokesman Manoel de Almeida y Silva said at U.N. 
headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major confrontation between the two neighbors  
since they conducted nuclear tests a year ago and declared 
themselves nuclear powers. India and Pakistan have fought three 
wars, two of them over Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchange fire along their disputed  
frontier almost every day. Indian soldiers also frequently open 
fire to thwart Pakistan-based guerrillas trying to cross into 
Indian-held areas to fight for independence for Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Indian satellite photos showed that about 600  
guerrillas had pushed nearly four miles into India's territory, 
taking advantage of the melting snow to occupy posts Indian 
soldiers had vacated at the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani, who is in charge of  
internal security, said ``the intruders this time comprise 
Pakistani army regulars as well as mercenaries and this operation 
will be smashed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advani rejected the Pakistani charge that Indian aircraft had  
bombed Pakistan, saying the strikes were ``well inside'' 
Indian-controlled parts of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it was concerned at the number and tenacity  
of the infiltrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the start of operations and they will continue until  
our defense forces reoccupy our territories. Any escalation of this 
conflict will be entirely the responsibility of Pakistan,'' the 
Defense Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's Foreign Ministry told reporters that the directors  
general of Indian and Pakistani military operations would hold 
talks ``in an attempt to defuse the situation.'' But Pakistan's 
army said the two directors general spoke on Tuesday and India did 
not warn Pakistan of the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>

estimated 12,000 soldiers into the area.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Are Secluded on Fla. Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- His dog Buddy scampering nearby, President  
Clinton strode up to greet a few people awaiting his arrival at the 
White Oak Plantation. Then he disappeared onto the grounds for a 
secluded vacation far from Washington's glare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived in Florida's backwoods late Tuesday with few  
plans beyond rest and relaxation -- except maybe playing golf on 
White Oak's nine-hole course or catching a glimpse of a rare white 
rhino that is nesting with a cub near the cottage where he is 
staying with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a better (golf) game than the rhino,'' joked  
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Clintons rose early and went biking together on White  
Oak's grounds, Lockhart said. Clinton also made calls to Italian 
Premier Massimo D'Alema and Nobel Peace laureate Elie Weisel, then 
went out for a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point during his break, Clinton can pore over a fat  
binder of information on Medicare, or select from a stack of books 
he brought with him: ``Lexus to the Olive Tree,'' by New York Times 
reporter Tom Friedman; ``Lucky You,'' by Miami Herald columnist 
Carl Hiaasen; ``The Pivotal Strategy,'' a tome about the developing 
world by Robert Chase, Emily Hill and Paul Kennedy; and ``A 
Reasonable Faith,'' the latest book by the Rev. Tony Campolo, one 
of Clinton's spiritual advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the Clintons needed this vacation, five months  
into a year in which Clinton was acquitted in an impeachment trial 
and the first lady is entertaining thoughts of launching a campaign 
for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
D-N.Y. They are vacationing without daughter Chelsea, who still has 
classes at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes at the right time,'' Lockhart said. ``They've both  
been going nonstop since the beginning of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were spending the vacation in seclusion at White  
Oak, a 7,500-acre conservation area inhabited by giraffes, cheetah 
and other rare animals. As soon as Clinton turned in for the night, 
reporters traveling with him were told he would not venture off the 
grounds today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton had already arrived by the time Clinton flew in  
from Edinburg, Texas, where he spent the day with Vice President Al 
Gore at Gore's annual empowerment zone conference. 
</P>
<P>
	On the way in to White Oak, Clinton -- still in his business suit  
-- halted his bronze Suburban to greet a dozen local residents in 
shorts and T-shirts waiting in front of a small house. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned to leave and discovered an important member of his  
party was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, where's Buddy?'' Clinton asked. Buddy was off meeting a  
bulldog that was among the well-wishers. Buddy pursued the bulldog 
briefly, but scampered back to Clinton's side when the president 
called him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons planned to stay in Yulee until late Sunday so they  
can participate in a conference at White Oak by the Democratic 
Leadership Council and its think tank, the Progressive Policy 
Institute. Conference participants are due to begin arriving 
Friday, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak is located off an unmarked dirt road about 20 miles  
north of Jacksonville. The Clintons were staying at Roseland, a 
two-story, cedar-paneled, five-bedroom house.

<HEADLINE> Vigil Held After Conn. Train Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Outside Bridgeport Hospital a cluster of  
Ecuadoreans prayed for the little boy the train spared. 
</P>
<P>
	They also prayed for his mother and three brothers who didn't  
survive their walk down the tracks in the dead of night. 
</P>
<P>
	And they tried to answer the biggest question -- what had driven  
a mother to such despair that she packed up her family and marched 
them down the railroad tracks? 
</P>
<P>
	The impromptu vigil wasn't held by relatives, but by fellow  
immigrants, drawn to the hospital when they heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are from our country,'' explained Washington Paredes of  
Stamford, who emigrated to the United States 20 years ago. ``We 
came to show support and to pray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the hospital, 10-year-old son, Jose Francisco Urgiles lay  
swaddled in tubes and bandages, his left leg severed, his head 
seriously injured, unconscious. Authorities had first identified 
the survivor as Jose's 6-year-old brother, Angel, but corrected the 
identification today, saying Angel was one of the three dead boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose remained in critical condition today.  
</P>
<P>
	``The real determination of his survival is going to be his  
brain injury,'' said trauma surgeon Dr. Nabil Atweh. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose should have been at school today, at the Luis Munoz Marin  
elementary school in the heart of Bridgeport's East Side, one of 
the poorest sections of the city. Schoolchildren said he walked 
there every day with his brothers. On Tuesday, his fellow pupils 
were sent home with notes telling their parents about the school's 
great loss. 
</P>
<P>
	He should have been safe in bed Monday night, not trudging over  
a train trestle in Fairfield, an affluent neighboring town, where 
every morning hundreds of commuters barrel into trains for work in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He shouldn't have been in the path of the Twilight Shoreliner as  
it hurtled from Boston to Newport News, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	No one seems to know where the family was heading, or what they  
were fleeing. Police were trying to locate Jose's father in 
Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day for everyone,'' said Maria Valle, an East Side  
community leader who works with immigrant children in the schools 
after-hours program. ``And all we can do is pray and wonder why.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Questions Gov't. Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer expert who will be one of the final  
witnesses in the Microsoft trial revealed Wednesday how he has 
improved his method of disabling the Internet browser in Windows, 
touching on a central claim in the government's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton  
University, said some changes to his controversial technique were 
prompted by comments from Microsoft witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten previously testified as one of the Justice Department's  
dozen witnesses. Microsoft questioned him again under oath 
Wednesday in a deposition at the federal courthouse here. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants Felten to take the stand again next month --  
during the trial's rebuttal phase -- to rebut earlier testimony from 
Microsoft executive James Allchin. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Monday after a 13-week break.  
</P>
<P>
	Felten's testimony is important because Microsoft contends that  
Windows and its browser are so closely integrated to make it 
impossible to remove the Web software without crippling Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally ``tied'' Windows  
and its browser to undermine Netscape Communications Corp., whose 
Web software is Microsoft's biggest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft feared that Netscape's browser threatened in some ways  
to mature into a rival software platform that could minimize the 
importance of Windows, Microsoft's most lucrative franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	In his trial testimony, Felten showed the judge how he was able  
to modify some files to prevent Microsoft's Internet software from 
starting in all but a few instances. Since Felten last testified, 
he's been improving his technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, for example, complained that Felten's tinkering  
disabled a popular feature in Windows 98 that allows consumers to 
install off the Internet incremental updates and improvements to 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten disclosed Wednesday that he has created his own version  
of this ``Windows Update'' feature. He also changed some error 
messages that Microsoft complained might be confusing when 
encountered on a computer that the company derisively said had been 
``Feltenized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Felten played down what Microsoft described as the problems with  
his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a bug, there's a bug,'' Felten said. ``I'm sure it  
can be fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Felten called his work a ``proof of concept,'' arguing that any  
imperfection pointed out by Microsoft ``doesn't invalidate the 
concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Felten's deposition was the first of three scheduled this week.  
The others will take place in North Carolina and California. 
Reporters are allowed to attend under an obscure 1913 law covering 
antitrust depositions, which are normally conducted in private.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Man Charged With Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- A white man accused of running his car onto  
a sidewalk to hit two black teen-agers on bikes was charged 
Wednesday with hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	James G. Langenbach, 27, intentionally swerved his car and sped  
toward the 14-year-old boys as they rode their bicycles, police 
allege. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys has been released from the hospital. The other  
was in satisfactory condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach originally faced two counts of intentionally causing  
great bodily harm to a child while armed with a dangerous weapon, 
and two counts of leaving the scene of an injury accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were upgraded Wednesday to two counts each of attempted  
murder while armed with a dangerous weapon, causing great bodily 
harm to a child with a dangerous weapon, and leaving the scene of 
an injury accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges also include the hate crime provision, which can  
add up to 5 years in prison and $5,000 in fines to each charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Robert Jambois would not comment Wednesday on why the  
he sought the hate crime charges in addition to the original 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges in a case are always based on the facts of the  
case,'' Jambois said. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach has a history of run-ins with police and has been  
treated for psychiatric problems, records show. He had been placed 
on probation for ramming his car into a van carrying five black men 
eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach remained jail in lieu of $200,000 cash bond. Public  
defender Dennis Egre, Langenbach's attorney, said Wednesday he 
could not comment on a pending case. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Langenbach faces 120 years in prison on the  
attempted murder charges, 60 years on the assault charges and 16 
years on the flight charges.

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Jonatha Brooke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Singer-songwriter Jonatha Brooke is no  
stranger to loss. 
</P>
<P>
	During three months in 1997, the 35-year-old former dancer  
mourned her father's death and divorced her husband. She left her 
native Boston and headed to Los Angeles for a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when she was certain it couldn't get any worse, it did.  
</P>
<P>
	MCA Records, Inc., which had released Brooke's critically  
acclaimed second solo album, ``Ten Cent Wings,'' dropped her in 
February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really struggling at first,'' she recalled, sipping  
herbal tea in her dressing room before a show at the Fillmore. 
``How could this happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was midway through a nationwide tour and ``Ten Cent Wings''  
was just beginning to tease the charts when her label asked for a 
``compromise.'' MCA offered half the budget for her next studio 
album. She thought the timing unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	``That implies that this record is already over,'' Brooke said.  
``Why would I want to be involved with you if you want to skimp on 
the next record?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The label had promised to release two singles and make a video.  
Now, all bets were off. Brooke asked for a six-month contract 
extension to give the record time to gain momentum. Little did she 
know that MCA was about to get swallowed up by the corporate merger 
that created the Universal Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never heard back from them,'' she said. ``That was a Friday;  
the following Monday everyone at the label was told I was 
dropped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned, Brooke used her week off to regroup.  
</P>
<P>
	``I so believed in 'Ten Cent Wings' and I was devastated that it  
wouldn't be heard,'' she said. ``The thing that really pulled me 
out was that nothing had changed. ... I was still selling out 
theaters, still getting beautiful audiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So she headed back out on the road, bringing along a multitrack  
digital recorder for her last few shows. Those concerts ended up 
becoming the basis for her third solo album, ``Jonatha Brooke 
Live.'' It includes songs from the Story, the duo Brooke formed 
with college pal Jennifer Kimball during the early 1990s, as well 
as material from ``Wings'' and ``Plumb,'' her first solo release. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending about $30,000 -- her life savings -- Brooke released the  
live album on her Web site in December. She sold more than 2,000 
copies during the first two weeks, autographing and shipping the 
CDs herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Now available in stores, ``Live'' has sold more than 30,000  
copies, nearly earning back Brooke's savings. Just three months 
ago, she says, Brooke hired a business manager and stopped writing 
checks to the band and paying all the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke admits she's unusually well off for an artist who created  
a label to promote herself. She can afford to travel with a 
four-piece band and ``people already know who I am and I do have an 
audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by that confidence, Brooke and her manager, Patrick  
Rains, struck a deal with Koch Distribution, a Port Washington, 
N.Y.-based outfit that also handles fellow indie folkie Ani 
DiFranco. That got ``Live'' to record stores and radio stations; 
they've already shipped more copies than MCA did for ``Wings,'' 
Rains said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like DiFranco, Brooke said her career is flourishing without a  
major label and sees no reason to seek out a new contract. She and 
Rains do lament Brooke's lack of mainstream airplay -- something 
smaller, independent labels often find almost impossible to secure. 
Even DiFranco, who has a massive following and more than a dozen 
albums to her credit, has enjoyed only limited airplay on a single 
from her 1998 album, ``Little Plastic Castle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to sell hundreds of thousands of records  
you're going to have to embrace the structure somehow,'' admits 
Andy Allen, president of the New York-based Alternative 
Distribution Alliance, a Koch competitor. More than 75 percent of 
the music sold is produced by a major label, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, ``(Brooke's) alignment with Koch is something  
you'll see a lot of,'' Allen said. And to be successful out on 
one's own, the artist must ``have to have a real understanding of 
how to reach your fan base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be Brooke's greatest strength. The connection with her  
audience at a recent performance at the Fillmore was palpable. 
</P>
<P>
	She packed the house, capturing the thirtysomething audience  
with an accessible, on-stage manner as she interspersed ballet 
stretches with snips of chatty dialogue. She's an understated, but 
incredibly creative acoustic guitarist, backed by a drummer, 
guitarist, bassist and the keyboard-playing, backup vocalist Ingrid 
Graudins, who seemed to have a loyal following all her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke's father was a journalist, her mother a poet, and their  
daughter obviously inherited a writing gene. Her lyrics are 
introspective, but not whiny; sentimental, not schmaltzy. And 
Brooke strips down to the core of her emotions -- inviting, 
welcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	During a haunting rendition of the traditional Scottish ballad,  
``In the Gloaming,'' the audience held its collective breath, 
allowing Brooke and Graudins to cast their spell. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke says her fans are ``exquisite music listeners'' who  
``want to be challenged by what they listen to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, it was such a gift to be cut loose when I  
was,'' she says. ``I think I'm going exactly where I want to go. I 
just feel better and better about what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few months after Brooke was dropped, MCA pared down  
substantially after the merger and left a lot of artists stranded, 
wondering what to do, she said. Performers who had had deals with 
Geffen, MCA, Island, Mercury and others found themselves shopping 
for a new label. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboy Junkies, an alternative-folk band with more than a  
decade of experience, had just released its second album for Geffen 
as merger panic began to build in June. The band hired its own 
promoters and publicists and, like Brooke, launched an extensive 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffamoose, a jazz-influenced rock band, didn't quite have the  
grassroots support to fall back on, but its 1997 major label debut 
got decent sales and the band felt reasonably secure in its 
relationship with Interscope. But after a few months back in the 
studio, the ax fell. Huffamoose is now looking at other labels or 
self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Advice? Brooke believes artists can achieve more success when  
they build their popularity ``organically,'' from a solid base of 
steady touring. She looks to Shawn Colvin -- who won Grammys for 
song of the year and record of the year in 1998 after more than 20 
years in the business -- as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just worked and worked and worked,'' Brooke said. ``I  
admire her stamina and conviction. She's a great example of how if 
you're not able to tour, then your career will be short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really love performing. It's still a joy. The schlepping  
part is less because I'm not lugging my guitar through the 
airport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's warmth, maturity and experience come through in her  
steady gaze as she sits cross-legged on a sofa. She runs a hand 
through her super-short, reddish-blond hair and is thankful to be 
asked how she's doing after her tumultuous year. 
</P>
<P>
	She has accumulated a lifetime of lyrics, but is ``definitely on  
solid ground,'' she answers with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	And that should make a great launching pad.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox May Get Others' Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox' plans to obtain 24 parcels of  
land in an effort to build a bigger, new version of Fenway Park has 
raised questions about the rules by which the city can take land 
away from one private property owner and give it to another. 
</P>
<P>
	Legally, attorneys who specialize in eminent domain, or  
governmental land taking, say the Red Sox and the city are likely 
to win in any court challenge from landowners. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Red Sox move ahead with their plan, the city would take  
24 properties, valued at an estimated $65 million, and offer 
landowners fair prices for the properties. The team would then 
reimburse the city. 
</P>
<P>
	If there are legal challenges, the government may have to prove  
that the area around the park is in need of a makeover. If a 
government classifies an area as being in bad shape, it often has a 
greater ability to confiscate one property owner's land in that 
area and sell it to another. 
</P>
<P>
	But that could be difficult in the Fenway area, which has a  
thriving commercial district and lots of university students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blight is when there's no land value,'' Tom Piper, a scientist  
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Urban 
Studies and Planning, told The Wall Street Journal's New England 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
	He said while the team's plans might improve the area, what  
exists there now hardly qualifies as a neighborhood in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fenway is a very urban, mixed-use development where people can  
live, work and play,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Vaccine Study Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers have found that college students  
living on campus are about three times more likely to contract 
meningitis infections than classmates who live off campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis released Tuesday in The Journal of the American  
Medical Association was performed by researchers at Johns Hopkins 
University School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings prompted the American College Health Association to  
renew its 1997 recommendation that all college students consider 
getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease, which can cause 
meningitis or an overwhelming and often fatal blood infection 
called meningococcemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meningococcal disease afflicts 125 to 175 college students  
annually and kills 15 to 20 of them, according to public health 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the risk among college students generally is about one in  
100,000 yearly, and in college students living on campus about 3 in 
100,000 yearly, according to the new study, led by Dr. Lee H. 
Harrison, now of the University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The low risk and the hope of an upcoming vaccine that will cover  
more strains of bacteria have led the American Academy of 
Pediatrics and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to refrain 
from recommending routine immunization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some parents will ask for or insist upon the vaccine in the  
setting, and that's OK, but the risk is not high enough to 
recommend routinely,'' said Dr. Neal A. Halsey, chairman of the 
committee on infectious diseases for the pediatrics group. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Turner of the American College Health Association said  
the increasing number of outbreaks points to the wisdom of routine 
vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1980 to 1993, there were 21 U.S. outbreaks of meningococcal  
disease, three of which occurred in colleges, his group says. From 
1994 to 1996, there were 51 outbreaks, six of which occurred in 
colleges, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many risks that we as parents worry about when  
kids go off to school,'' Turner said. ``This is one of those rare 
risks we can virtually eliminate with a vaccine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Melanie Benn headed off to college in 1995, she looked  
forward to living in northern California and to enjoying her 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months, she was back home in San Diego, a quadruple  
amputee, having barely survived meningococcal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	She almost certainly could have avoided it if she had been  
immunized, and she wants other people to know. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something you can prevent,'' Benn said. ``I don't know  
how to get people to realize that. Usually it takes a tragedy to 
get people to realize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benn had spent a semester at Humboldt State University in  
Arcata, Calif., and had lived in a dormitory. Researchers say dorms 
probably contribute to spreading meningococcal bacteria the same 
way that crowding recruits into barracks does -- a fact the military 
discovered during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Indy Champ in Big Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A fan crept up to the table, bashfully  
asking if he could have his picture taken alongside Eddie Cheever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want a picture of me because I'm Eddie Cheever?'' the  
driver asked. ``Or do you want a picture of me because I'm the 
winner of the Indianapolis 500?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Because you're the winner,'' the man admitted, sheepishly.  
</P>
<P>
	From journeyman to defending champion, Cheever was very much in  
demand Wednesday afternoon as thousands of fans converged on 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway for ``Community Day,'' taking advantage 
of a chance to mingle with the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the longest lines queued up at Cheever's garage,  
stretching around the building while he signed pictures, hats, 
shirts, bricks, helmets and ticket stubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life changes after you win the 500,'' said Glenn Barton, who  
collected Cheever's autograph with his two young sons. ``He's a 
historical figure now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever and the other 32 starters will make their final tune-up  
for the race on Thursday in a two-hour practice known as 
``Carburetion Day,'' the only time between the end of qualifying 
and the race they're allowed on the 2.5-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Cheever refused to concede that the title of  
Indy 500 champion has lost its luster in recent years, despite all 
evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the 4-year-old war between the Indy Racing League and its  
more established rival Championship Auto Racing Teams has divided 
the open-wheel competition as NASCAR is booming in popularity. But 
Cheever's aching right hand told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at this line,'' he said, unable to see the end of the  
autograph seekers. ``I've been signing stuff nonstop since I got to 
Indy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's also noticed that fans who used to call him ``Eddie'' now  
refer to him as ``Mr. Cheever.'' He admonishes them that nothing 
has changed, even though he now has an impressive new line on his 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, though, things have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	In his younger days, Cheever was perceived as aloof and maybe a  
bit arrogant, the product of racing in the tunnel-vision world of 
Formula One from 1978-89. Now, at 41, he's a kinder, gentler man 
going through life at 220 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot more patience than I used to have,'' said  
Cheever, who will start Sunday's race from the inside of the sixth 
row. ``I guess I found something I like, which is racing on ovals. 
It's ridiculous, too. My whole background is in road racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, from the devilish look in his hazel eyes, he's enjoyed  
the fruits of his Indy triumph, though he's a bit short of 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, I'm a 41-year-old bachelor who's the Indy 500  
champion,'' Cheever said, grinning. ``That's all I'm going to say 
on that subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more material benefits are harder to uncover, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Cheever's face didn't adorn a box of Wheaties after his Indy  
victory, nor did he land a big-time sponsorship for his self-owned 
team. In fact, the obscure potato chip company that backed him a 
year ago pulled most of its money. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Cheevermobile is supported by Children's Beverage  
Group, a little-known Texas company that makes packaging for kids' 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Barnes, president of a California marketing firm that  
works with a number of former 500 champions, said it's difficult to 
sell open-wheel racing to corporate America as long as there's a 
split between the IRL and CART, 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie is a terrific spokesperson,'' Barnes said. ``I think  
he's capitalized as much as possible under the circumstances. 
Obviously, there's not as much focus on the Indy 500 as there used 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Cheever doesn't sound all that excited about talks  
to end the IRL-CART feud. Like a seasoned PR man, he quickly 
espouses the IRL's mantra of keeping costs under control, promoting 
competition and focusing on American-based oval racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``To even consider backing down from that philosophy so the IRL  
could incorporate another series would be a serious mistake,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Cheever has his eyes on other goals. He is trying to  
start his own NASCAR Winston Cup team, saying there's a 70-percent 
chance he'll be racing with the good ol' boys next year. He 
chuckled at the thought of a life going full circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come from the most elite racing circuit in the world,''  
he said. ``In Formula One, we used to helicopter to and from the 
circuits. This is a total change in my approach to racing. I think 
it's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About that time, a man and his young son approached Cheever for  
an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the guy who won the race last year,'' the father told  
his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever seized the moment. ``I'm the man who's going to win the  
race this year.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Charges India With Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian air force jets and helicopters fired  
on suspected guerrillas in the disputed Kashmir province today, 
marking the most serious escalation of fighting in the region since 
India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan charged that Indian aircraft bombed its territory in  
the raids today and an army spokesman said the country is ready for 
``all eventualities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is a very grave escalation and Pakistan armed  
forces reserves the right to respond,'' said Brigadier Rashid 
Quereshi, a military spokesman told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	India said the attacks occurred solely on its own territory and  
that they were aimed at what it called Afghan mercenaries supported 
by Pakistani forces. The forces had moved into the 
Indian-controlled Himalayan region earlier this month and posed a 
threat to Indian supply lines in the Himalayan state, Indian 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the start of operations and they will continue until  
our defense forces reoccupy our territories. Any escalation of this 
conflict will be entirely the responsibility of Pakistan,'' the 
Defense Ministry said in a statement in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said that Pakistan knew  
nothing about the infiltrators. ``No one knows where they come from 
and who they are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quereshi said the army rejected Indian claims. He said the  
Pakistan army suspects India wants to occupy Pakistan territory in 
that area. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over  
Kashmir, which is divided between them by a U.N-monitored 
cease-fire line. More than 15,000 people have been killed in 
fighting between rebels and security forces in Indian-held Kashmir 
in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan and India, which were partitioned when they gained  
independence from Britain in 1947, tested nuclear weapons in May 
1998, prompting fears of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries claim all of Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of  
sending militants across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pakistani army spokesman said the Indian allegations that  
elite troops were aiding militants was ``complete rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Maj. Gen. Joginder Jaswant Singh told reporters in New  
Delhi that the infiltrators have taken up positions four miles 
inside India in the Dras, Batalik, Kaksar and Mashkok mountains of 
northern Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Intelligence reports, backed by photos taken by Indian  
satellites, showed at least 600 infiltrators, Singh said. The 
reports also said they have anti-aircraft missiles, radar, 
snowmobiles and sophisticated communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The air force joined the operation because the infiltrators had  
occupied positions at altitudes of up to 16,000 feet, said Air 
Commodore Subash Bhojwani, director of offensive operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dras, 100 miles from the state capital of Srinagar, Indian  
army officers said the target of today's attack was some 70 
infiltrators who had entrenched themselves on the slopes of the 
snowcapped hills, looking down at Indian army convoys, 2,700 feet 
below. 
</P>
<P>
	Their command of the heights handicapped Indian soldiers trying  
to evict them, officers told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Army officers in the area said the infiltrators must have taken  
months to occupy the posts. They said Indian forces could take 
three to six months to clear them. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks were carried out within Indian-occupied regions,  
Indian Brig. Mohan Bhandari said. Troops were expected to take over 
the intruders' positions once they retreat, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange of mortar and heavy artillery fire in the Kargil  
and Dras regions has left at least 160 people dead, Bhandari said. 
Thousands of residents of the region have fled to safe villages 
along the Suru River. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came a day after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee  
said all steps -- including airstrikes -- would be taken to push back 
the infiltrators. Vajpayee said he warned his Pakistani 
counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, to withdraw the intruders in a telephone 
conversation Monday.

<HEADLINE> La. Candidate's Grandson Is Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASCADE LOCKS, Ore. (AP) -- The missing grandson of former  
Louisiana Gov. Dave Treen was found in good condition today by a 
news helicopter flying over the rugged Columbia Gorge area where he 
had been lost since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Neville, 20, frantically waved metal pans to a KOIN-TV  
news helicopter. He appeared to have set up a camp with a blue tarp 
and tent and tended to a nearby fire. Neville was seen drinking 
from a canteen, wearing a white T-shirt and khaki pants. 
</P>
<P>
	At the base camp, Treen was hugging his daughter, Jennifer  
Neville, the missing hiker's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's him!'' Mrs. Neville screamed through tears as she  
watched the live TV pictures. ``If it's not it's his twin, baggy 
pants and all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so thankful to God,'' she said. ``It's the greatest  
day of my life.'' Through tears, Treen added, ``It's probably the 
most emotional moment of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was spotted in an area where searchers had not been looking,  
on the southeast side of Wahtum Lake, about six miles from the 
Eagle Creek trailhead above the snowline. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour after Neville was spotted, KOIN reported that its  
helicopter had landed and picked him up. But rescue officials said 
later that the effort was aborted because of the rugged conditions 
and plans were to bring in a National Guard helicopter to bring 
Neville out later this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen, 70, was elected Louisiana's governor in 1979 -- the  
state's first GOP governor since Reconstruction -- and was defeated 
in a bid for re-election in 1983 by Democrat Edwin W. Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Treen, who served in Congress from 1973 until he became  
governor, is trying to return to the House, running for the seat 
vacated by Rep. Bob Livingston. He faces a runoff Saturday against 
fellow Republican David Vitter. Treen had canceled all campaign 
appearances Tuesday and flew to Oregon with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign is not on my mind at this point,'' Treen had said  
Tuesday. ``There's nothing I would not do or give up to find 
Jason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treen and Vitter were the top two vote-getters in a May 1  
primary in which former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville, a student at Louisiana State University, had taken time  
off from college to work for AmeriCorps, the domestic equivalent of 
the Peace Corps, teaching poor children in Portland to read. 
</P>
<P>
	He set out alone Thursday evening on the Eagle Creek trail, one  
of Oregon's most popular hiking routes, near the river town of 
Cascade Locks, about 40 miles east of Portland. Officials said he 
wanted to be by himself in the wilderness when he turned 20 at 
midnight Friday. He was due back on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	KOIN-TV helicopter pilot Warren Petrie said he was attracted to  
the area by the light reflecting off the pans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just great news to be in right place at the right time,''  
Petrie said in his live report. ``You can see the smile on his 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, Treen campaign manager Jay Zainey said volunteers  
and staffers at headquarters cheered, hugged and wept with joy when 
they learned Neville was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``God almighty, it was like we just won the campaign. More  
important than that,'' he said. ``We're still on the high.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Jews Return to Traditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) --The governing body of Reform Judaism, the  
biggest and most liberal major branch of American Jewry, on 
Wednesday endorsed a return to traditional practices such as 
wearing yarmulkes, keeping kosher and praying in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Reform rabbis said the 324-68 vote by the Central  
Conference of American Rabbis confirms what they have seen in 
synagogues: a yearning for a return to some of the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our generation, we do not know our history,'' said Rabbi  
Deborah Zecher of Great Barrington, Mass. ``This brings us back to 
our history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The platform is not an enforceable set of commands. It is a set  
of guidelines only. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as though they pass it at noon and people are going  
to go running to their kosher butcher,'' said Rabbi Lawrence 
Goldmark, president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California. 
But he added: ``We've put down on paper what we stand for. I'm 
tired of the stereotype that reform Jews are negative Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Conference of American Rabbis has 1.5 million  
members, but the total number of Reform Jews is difficult to 
estimate because many aren't associated with a synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform's founding platform, the product of a meeting in  
Pittsburgh in 1885, rejected many Jewish traditions as ``entirely 
foreign to our present mental and spiritual state'' and a hindrance 
``to modern spiritual elevation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many traditions observed by Conservative and Orthodox Jews --  
such as studying Hebrew, following Jewish dietary law and wearing 
prayer shawls and skullcaps -- are shunned by Reform Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis Rivkin, professor emeritus of Jewish history at Reform's  
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, said that a trend toward more 
traditional practices has become more noticeable among younger 
rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a kind of security that (tradition) brings when the  
external world is in an insecure state, and when Jews are 
threatened by the assimilation process and the high rate of 
intermarriage,'' Rivkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rabbis worked until late Tuesday heatedly debating the set  
of principles, then postponed their vote to allow for more 
discussion Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompting much of the debate was a section on intermarriage.  
Some participants were concerned that the section could be 
interpreted as condoning intermarriage, when their intent was 
instead to welcome non-Jews who are willing to convert. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi David Aaron of Hebrew Union College, an opponent of the  
platform, said it was ``pop culture theology'' made up of strings 
of jargon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Aaron Peller, who was not a voting member but a guest and  
adviser from Panama City, Panama, said the point of drafting new 
principles was to open a dialogue and take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us cover our heads, some don't,'' Peller said.  
``That's exactly what I think Reform is all about -- individual 
autonomy.''

<HEADLINE> Espionage Vote Expected in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is moving quickly on legislation to  
beef up security at nuclear weapons labs and to impose new 
restrictions on technology exports in the aftermath of a House 
report on alleged Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate was expected in both the House and Senate today on a raft  
of measures prompted by Tuesday's report by a special bipartisan 
House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let that kind of technology slip out again,'' said  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Both houses are expected to attempt to attach amendments related  
to the China inquiry to bills authorizing $288.8 billion in defense 
spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The legislation, 
in different forms, is before both chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders worked late into the night Wednesday to try to  
come up with a set of proposals that would win wide bipartisan 
support. They were expected to continue the search for common 
ground today. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
have urged that the evidence of spying by China should not stand in 
the way of continued cooperation with Beijing on trade, weapons 
nonproliferation and other issues of mutual interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should rush to judgment,'' Lott said. ``We  
should understand the full ramifications of what happened here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Lott is asking the Senate to approve legislation  
designed to tighten export controls in trade with China to prevent 
more weapons technology from falling into Beijing's hands. He also 
is proposing strengthening security and background checks at the 
Energy Department's nuclear weapons labs, and requiring the 
Pentagon to intensify its monitoring of China missile launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Moves were expected in both chambers to create an Energy  
Department position of senior director for counterintelligence to 
oversee sensitive programs and technology security. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson set up such an office on his  
own, but Congress could institutionalize the post and make its 
holder subject to Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Both houses are expected to vote on measures to institute more  
congressional oversight over high-technology exports, particularly 
to China, and to require the administration to report extensively 
when violations of export controls are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., meanwhile, said he would propose a  
bipartisan commission that would conduct a government-wide review 
of all counterintelligence activities. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal under consideration would require that a new senior  
official at Energy Department oversee all department research labs 
and report directly to Congress. The labs traditionally have had 
widespread independence. The Clinton administration has signaled it 
would oppose such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	China has obtained secret information ``about every single  
(nuclear) weapon in the U.S. arsenal,'' Rep. Christopher Cox, 
R-Calif., said Wednesday in briefing lawmakers. But he said 
Congress might still be able to forestall China from being able to 
convert the U.S. warhead design information into deployable 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox is chairman of the House select committee that produced a  
report detailing what members called China's 20-year campaign to 
steal America's nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the committee's senior  
Democrat, are urging Congress to tighten controls on the sale of 
high-power computers and satellite technology to China. Such 
equipment could aid China in using stolen U.S. weapon design 
material to create a new generation of nuclear missiles, they told 
the House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a counterintelligence program that works,'' said Rep.  
John Spratt, D-S.C., appearing on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim 
Lehrer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, the House speaker, appearing on the same show, said,  
``We need to be engaged with China.... If we disengage, we can go 
backward,'' said Hastert.

<HEADLINE> End to Gun Hunting Lessons Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Rifles and shotguns are regularly brought to  
schools across Wisconsin for courses to train thousands of young 
hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least one district has reconsidered the gun safety  
program after activists questioned the wisdom of bringing weapons 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's find another place for it so we don't send mixed  
messages to our students about weapons,'' said Andrea Utrie, a 
teacher in Beaver Dam about 60 miles northwest of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing reaction to the recent school shootings in Colorado and  
Georgia, Superintendent Richard Fitzpatrick decided to cancel the 
daytime hunter's education classes in Beaver Dam. 
</P>
<P>
	Utrie also wants the nighttime courses canceled -- classes that  
have been offered for 40 years -- and the school board is reviewing 
the request, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	But gun enthusiasts say educators are going too far. Better to  
teach gun safety, they say, especially in a setting congenial to 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
	James E. Fendry, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement,  
which has ties to the National Rifle Association, says talk of 
gun-free schools is an ``overreaction based upon total ignorance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every state except Alaska mandates that hunters receive an  
education certificate before they can buy a hunting license, said 
Dave Knotts, executive director of the International Hunter 
Education Association headquartered in Wellington, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 700,000 people, mostly youths, graduate from the classes  
annually, and many are taught in schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Natural Resources, said 839 hunter's  
safety classes were offered across Wisconsin last year and that 
265, or about one-third, were taught in schools for children ages 
12 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't need the guns to teach the course, but it is  
kind of like trying to teach driver's ed without walking out to the 
car,'' Knotts said.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii-Born Sumo Star Now Yokozuna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Musashimaru is anything but your average sumo  
wrestler. For one thing, he's bigger than just about everybody else 
in the ring. He's also better. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Hawaii-born giant took the formal oath of a yokozuna,  
or grand champion. Only one other foreign-born wrestler has ever 
held the rank, the hallowed summit of the ancient sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was marked with all the pomp and tradition of sumo.  
Reporters and TV crews crowded into the training ``stable'' to 
which Musashimaru belongs to watch the wrestler take his formal 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
	Musashimaru, like all sumo wrestlers, wore his hair in a greased  
down topknot, but he also wore purple leis around his neck during 
the celebration after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I humbly accept,'' the 473-pound Musashimaru said as he  
recited his vows in halting Japanese. ``I will do my utmost not to 
tarnish the yokozuna name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rank of yokozuna holds a very special meaning to the  
Japanese. Because sumo's history is intertwined with Japan's native 
Shinto religion, it carries with it an aura of authority and 
respect that other athletic honors cannot equal. 
</P>
<P>
	And the question of who should hold the rank is never taken  
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns over the rise of foreign-born wrestlers like  
Musashimaru and fellow Hawaiians Akebono -- who became yokozuna in 
1993 -- and Konishiki, who nearly reached yokozuna the year before, 
became a national issue in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans felt foreigners shouldn't be allowed to hold the post,  
while others accused the sport of discrimination. Most of the 
debate has since died down. 
</P>
<P>
	Akebono has proven himself a solid champion, and Konishiki has  
retired from the ring to become a popular TV personality. All three 
have taken Japanese citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Musashimaru, who is 28, tread cautiously around the issue  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A wrestler is a wrestler,'' he said, refusing to answer other  
questions about his background. He did, however, urge Hawaiian 
youngsters to follow his example and pursue sumo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only problem I had is that I couldn't speak the  
language,'' he said, still not completely fluent. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he sheepishly acknowledged he had, out of nervousness,  
left out the phrase ``in body and soul'' from his vow. When 
questions were asked in Japanese, Musashimaru often cocked his head 
with a smirk, unsure of his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumo tournaments are held six times each year. The goal of the  
sport is simple. Wrestlers, clad only in loincloths, clash in the 
middle of a dirt ring; whoever gets pushed down or pushed out 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
	Musashimaru, who stands 6 foot-3 inches tall, sealed his  
promotion by winning two consecutive tournament titles. He has won 
more bouts than he has lost in 52 consecutive 15-day tournaments -- 
a sumo record. 
</P>
<P>
	His promotion comes at a crucial time for officials. The sport  
has been in desperate need of a reliable yokozuna -- two of the 
three other yokozuna sat out the most recent tournament with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two yokozuna have also been plagued by scandals  
surrounding their family, alleged tax evasion and reports of 
marital troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese fans, meanwhile, had no problems welcoming Musashimaru  
as a new yokozuna. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a great sense of humor. And he's so friendly,'' said  
Mitsuo Ogiwara, a 55-year-old bakery worker. ``I'm overjoyed.''

<HEADLINE> Philly May Get DisneyQuest Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co.'s plans to open a  
high-tech entertainment center in Philadelphia drew a step closer 
to reality with the creation of a joint venture to develop the 
downtown site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goldenberg Group Inc. said Tuesday it would team up with the  
Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT-Rubin) to develop 
the $150 million Pavilion at Market East. 
</P>
<P>
	The block-long project, scheduled to open in the summer of 2000,  
will include the five-story DisneyQuest amusement park, as well as 
a 20-screen movie theater, health club and about 400,000 square 
feet of additional retail space. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Goldenberg, president of the Goldenberg Group of Blue  
Bell, said PREIT-Rubin offers an excellent supply of capital as 
well as experienced leasing staff who could attract retailers. The 
developer has said he hopes to bring in another high-end department 
store, an F.A.O. Schwarz toy store and a Benetton sports cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Goldenberg/PREIT joint venture creates terrific synergies,  
and I am very excited about them joining with us on this project,'' 
Goldenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Edward G. Rendell on Tuesday lauded the joint venture as a  
step forward in advancing the city's efforts to market itself as a 
vacation spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``PREIT-Rubin is not only one of the best developers in the  
Delaware Valley, it is one of the best developers anywhere in 
America,'' Rendell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination of the Goldenberg Group's aggressive,  
ground-up development experience and PREIT-Rubin's long history of 
achievement and extensive leasing capabilities make this a terrific 
combination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney announced plans in December to open DisneyQuest, which  
will allow visitors to play interactive fantasy-adventure games 
just a few blocks from the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. 
Officials said they hope the center will attract about one million 
visitors a year by recreating the Disney experience with computer 
animation. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is expected to offer $25 million in tax breaks, improve  
sidewalks and lighting, and renovate the closest subway station. 
Disney will spend about $90 million on the attractions.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Julia Roberts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As a movie star, Julia Roberts is worth $20  
million a film at last count. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's very different from playing a star, Roberts explains  
over a double soy cappuccino, a delicacy that seems to be a 
necessary component of, well, being a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you share an occupation with someone doesn't mean  
you're the same person,'' says Roberts, as she tries to distance 
herself from Anna Scott, the actress who sets Hugh Grant's and the 
world's hearts aflutter in ``Notting Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Richard Curtis' screenplay for the romantic comedy is  
being viewed as a follow-up to his box-office hit ``Four Weddings 
and a Funeral,'' the earlier Grant movie offered nothing to compare 
with Roberts' star wattage, either on or off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Notting Hill,'' Anna Scott's face enlivens posters and  
billboards, though it takes a chance encounter with the aw-shucks 
west London bookseller William (played by Grant) to bring the 
paparazzi swooping down upon her. 
</P>
<P>
	During one crucial dinner scene with William's friends, Anna  
ponders the time in her career when -- or so the script envisions it 
-- ``my looks will go. They'll find out I can't act, and I'll become 
a sad, middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was 
famous for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly Roberts' own worries, right?  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't have those concerns at all,'' she says, chatting  
amiably in an interview at the Dorchester Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, Anna and I are different people,'' Roberts continues,  
displaying little sign of the jet lag she says she is feeling. 
``Anna is still unsure of her own self-worth, whether it be as an 
actor or just as a person on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to just reconcile the differences between us,'' she  
says. ``Anna is a lot more fragile than I am, and what is written 
(about her) concerns her a lot more than it concerns me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, much has been written about Roberts in the 13 years  
since the small-town girl from Smyrna, Ga., became an actress, 
hitting an early peak with ``Pretty Woman'' at age 22 and fast 
eclipsing her older brother, actor Eric Roberts (``Runaway Train,'' 
``It's My Party''), in the fame game. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the coverage has detailed her recalcitrance toward the  
media, which avidly chronicled Roberts' numerous celebrity 
boyfriends -- from Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric to 
singer-actor Lyle Lovett, to whom she was briefly married. 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, Roberts admits to not having a date for  
the imminent London premiere of ``Notting Hill,'' since current 
boyfriend Benjamin Bratt is in Los Angeles making a film with 
Rupert Everett, Roberts' erstwhile co-star (``My Best Friend's 
Wedding'') and friend. 
</P>
<P>
	(That very premiere made English headlines for -- gasp! horror! --  
the actress' refusal to shave her armpits.) 
</P>
<P>
	Now 31, after weathering a rough patch in her career, Roberts  
speaks with the self-possession of a still-young veteran and the 
savvy of someone fully expecting to stay the course. 
</P>
<P>
	She shortly begins work on her next film, Steven Soderbergh's  
``Erin Brockovitch,'' for which she is reportedly is being paid $20 
million -- the sort of Hollywood paycheck traditionally reserved for 
the guys. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in leather pants, her hair darker and straighter than it  
has often appeared, Roberts makes a ready and agreeable 
conversationalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the risk of exhibiting hubris, I think I have evolved  
beyond the sense that one's worth is based on a stranger's 
evaluation,'' she says. ``I'm really sure of who I am and why I do 
the things that I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it seems to be true that Roberts tends to do her best  
work when she smiles -- that radiant visage in the ``Notting Hill'' 
ads is no accident -- and stumbles when she frowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a skill. It's not a gift,'' Roberts says of that  
star-making grin. ``If you want to appreciate somebody for it, then 
appreciate my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If people support me ... they must support my desire to be a  
good actor, and in order to be a good actor, it is my obligation 
... to try different things,'' she says. ``If I did the same thing 
all the time, how quickly would people get bored? They'd be like, 
`She's smiling again. Oh God, that smile.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With 1996's ``Mary Reilly,'' for example, ``people were saying,  
`She's so dour,''' recalls Roberts. ``But what on Earth does Mary 
Reilly have to smile about, getting up at 4 a.m. and spit-shining 
shoes? Should I be singing a little song? It was as if people were 
criticizing me within the piece itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I do a movie is the same as it was 10 years ago,''  
she continues. ``I like it or I don't, period. I respond on some 
level, which is all my own for reasons I could not begin to 
articulate, and that's why I do it, regardless of what seems to be 
a public demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the box-office pressure to smile, ``I do recognize it,''  
Roberts says with a, um, smile. ``Part of my obligation is to at 
least recognize it. That doesn't mean it has to dictate my moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Notting Hill'' isn't Roberts' only movie this summer. She also  
has the title role opposite her ``Pretty Woman'' co-star, Richard 
Gere, in ``Runaway Bride,'' in which she plays a woman she 
cheerfully calls ``a psychotic. I just loved her. She's a freak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts expresses amazement that all the ``Pretty Woman''  
principals -- director Garry Marshall included -- could ``finally 
find something, because Richard and I never agree on any script. We 
spent 10 years never agreeing on anything, and I knew Richard liked 
this and it just seemed too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That intervening decade, of course, saw Roberts become a star.  
</P>
<P>
	As a result, more rests on her career choices now than in the  
days of ``Pretty Woman'' or the earlier ``Steel Magnolias,'' both 
of which brought her Academy Award nominations. (``Notting Hill'' 
goes one better, making Anna Scott an Oscar-winner.) 
</P>
<P>
	Does Roberts agree with some of the premises posed by ``Notting  
Hill,'' starting with the idea that fame is a trap? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is an essence of truth to it, but I don't feel  
trapped and I don't feel like anybody but me has the power,'' she 
says. ``I feel liberated and inspired and empowered by my life and 
the choices that I make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving on to more important matters, what about the film's  
proposition that a mere mortal has an amorous chance with a 
Hollywood superstar? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to 75 people, and they're all saying this could  
never happen. Where's your sense of adventure? Your sense of 
self?'' she asks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not actor-Julia,'' she adds excitedly. ``I'm Julia. If  
you're with the right person and you have that amazing well of 
communication and support and love, then anything is 
understandable.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Points Finger at Ex-IBM Worker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of the largest insider trading cases in  
history started, simply enough, when an IBM secretary gave her 
husband a tip on an upcoming deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours on that June 2, 1995 day, more than two dozen  
people had bought stock, betting that IBM was about to acquire 
Lotus Development Corp., the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the deal was announced three days later, the loose-knit  
group of friends, acquaintances and colleagues had gained $1.3 
million, though the secretary and her husband only made $7,500, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Marcel Marcelino, district administrator of the Boston SEC  
office which handled the investigation, said the case was one of 
the largest ever in terms of number of people charged. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said the case exposed a  
trend in which people with less knowledge of the securities 
industry were increasingly trying to act illegally on tips about 
information that is required by law to be kept a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen a shift away from the Wall Street kingpins to main  
street America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many cases we've brought over the past couple of years, the  
amounts are much smaller and the people are not Wall Streeters. 
They are neighbors, cousins, friends, business or personal 
acquaintances,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan  
against 25 people, began when Lorraine K. Cassano told her husband, 
Robert, about the Lotus acquisition, the SEC said. He told two 
friends, including one man whose brother owned a delicatessen. 
</P>
<P>
	The delicatessen owner then allegedly told some of his best  
customers, including a doctor who stopped for lunch, the SEC said. 
Others learned in similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	The securities purchases paid off when International Business  
Machines Corp. announced its takeover offer for Lotus. The value of 
Lotus common stock leaped from $32.50 per share to more than $61 
per share, an increase of nearly 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cassano, a secretary in the Volumes and Revenue Department  
of the Software Group at IBM in Somers, N.Y., at the time of the 
insider trades, was suspended when IBM learned of the 
investigation. The North Salem, N.Y., resident was later fired, the 
SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those charged in the case was a pizzeria owner, a bank  
vice president, a private school teacher, a grocery store owner, a 
lawyer, the president of a direct-mail marketing company, a doctor, 
an engineer and several stockbrokers. Of those charged, 13 live in 
Staten Island, N.Y., and six live in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano first learned of the pending Lotus  
deal when she was asked to copy documents in late April or early 
May 1995. On May 5, 1995, her supervisor told her that IBM would be 
taking over Lotus, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 31, 1995, Mrs. Cassano learned that the board of  
directors had authorized the company to make an offer for Lotus and 
that it would be announced on June 5, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cassano then violated strict policies at IBM forbidding  
employees from disclosing nonpublic information, especially about 
the Lotus deal, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its court papers, the SEC asked the court to order the  
defendants to obey all securities laws, return any illegally 
obtained profits and be fined civil penalties up to three times 
their ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano's husband, Robert, pleaded guilty to  
insider trading on Jan. 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cassanos could not immediately be reached for comment on the  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the defendants tried to conceal their trades or the  
illicit nature of their trading activity by lying under oath about 
the reasons for their trades and falsely denying they knew the 
others in the group, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have pleaded guilty in the case thus far include  
lawyer Carmine DeSantis of Staten Island, salesman Michael Paul 
Green of Edison, N.J., computer technician P. Gerard Mazzone of 
Staten Island, delicatessen owner Peter G. Mazzone of Staten 
Island, computer technician Joseph Petrosino of Brooklyn, N.Y., and 
Dr. Gary Spierer of Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSantis pleaded to conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice,  
Green to obstruction of justice, both Mazzones to insider trading 
and perjury, Petrosino to perjury and Spierer to obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said both Cassanos as well as Green and Spierer have  
already settled the SEC civil charges, agreeing to obey securities 
laws and to pay back profits.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Say Don't Count Utah Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs know from experience  
never to discount the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	So as the Spurs watch from afar, insisting they have no  
preference in the Utah-Portland Western Conference semifinal 
series, their tales of the resiliency of the Jazz suggest the Spurs 
believe that series is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I see Portland ... I won't think anything but Utah,''  
said Spurs forward Sean Elliott. ``They're not dead yet. They're 
just not. They've been through it too many times to count them 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, after sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers 4-0, are  
awaiting an opponent in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz defeated the Trail Blazers on Tuesday, but Portland  
still leads the best-of-7 series 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The next game is Thursday in Portland.  
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio held its first full practice Wednesday since ousting  
the Lakers three days earlier. The 2 1/2-hour session at a local 
college centered on improving the Spurs' game, not combating the 
still unknown opponent, said coach Gregg Popovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just prepare as well as we can to make sure we're doing our  
things correctly, doing them as best as possible,'' he said. ``Then 
when we find out who we're going to play, we can prepare on the 
court for that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, talk quickly turned to Utah and Portland.  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs players said they watched Tuesday night's game with  
interest as well as empathy for the pounding the Trail Blazers 
suffered at the hands of Karl Malone and the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Grant of the Blazers was bloodied by an elbow from Malone  
in the first quarter, one of several confrontations in the wild, 
physical game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He let that take him out of his game,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie  
said of Grant. ``That's Utah, man. Utah, that's how they beat you. 
They get into your head. And Portland, a young team, they're sort 
of rattled a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longer the Utah-Portland series goes, the more the Spurs get  
to rest, which is fine with Elie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be cheering for Utah,'' Elie said. ``We're  
hoping those guys just keep slugging it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But like other Spurs players, Elie doesn't care which team San  
Antonio plays next. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the home court,'' he said. ``They've got to come to  
our place. I think either team is going to be difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Spurs have homecourt advantage throughout the  
playoffs. The Western Conference finals are scheduled to start 
either Saturday or Monday, depending on when the Portland-Utah 
series ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Utah has played so well in elimination games, some Spurs  
believe the Jazz -- San Antonio's longtime nemesis -- might be 
heading here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a lot to go into an elimination game and continue to  
battle. They have a lot of guts. That's why they've been to the 
finals two years in a row,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz are 6-1 in their last seven playoff elimination games.  
</P>
<P>
	Utah has ousted the Spurs from the postseason the last two times  
San Antonio has made the playoffs. The Jazz beat the Spurs 4-2 in 
the semifinals in 1996 and 4-1 in the semifinals two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson, knocked unconscious and hospitalized with a  
concussion last season after Malone elbowed him, chuckled but 
wouldn't say which team he'd prefer to face this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aaaggghhh, aaaggghhh,'' Robinson said, walking off, holding  
his arms out and shaking his head. ``Whoever.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Fire Their Pitching Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Unhappy with how their high-priced pitching  
staff is producing, the Los Angeles Dodgers fired pitching coach 
Charlie Hough today and replaced him with Claude Osteen. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came a day after a 3-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds left  
the Dodgers at 22-22 with seven losses in their last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitching staff has been a major reason for the slow start,  
compiling a 4.47 earned run average that's only sixth-best in the 
National League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very surprised,'' closer Jeff Shaw said. ``The unfortunate  
thing is that we haven't been pitching very well and he has to take 
the fall for us. To me, it just looks like a shakeup. I'm sad to 
see him go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the addition of ace Kevin Brown, who signed a  
seven-year, $105 million contract last December, the team ERA has 
gone up by two-thirds of a run from last season, when it was 3.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is 5-3 with a 2.39 ERA following his loss Tuesday night in  
Cincinnati. Brown struck out a career-high 12, but Dodger defensive 
lapses let in two unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Davey Johnson held an extended meeting with his coaching  
staff before Wednesday's game, then called a team meeting to 
explain the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Johnson was subdued and the strain showed in his  
face. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest day I've had in this game -- I'm including the  
days when I was (fired),'' Johnson called it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was close to Hough, 51, hired as pitching coach last  
June after serving in the same capacity with San Bernardino of the 
California League for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson told his players that everyone has to share the blame  
for the slow start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the guys it wasn't just the pitching. It's a  
shortcoming of everybody in this room, myself included,'' Johnson 
said. ``I lost a friend. I feel like a lost a family member, and 
everybody in this room is going to have to start doing what they're 
capable of doing so it doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hough was offered another position in the organization.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said the thing that hurt the worst is he felt we were going  
to win here and he wanted to be part of it,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteen, 59, has been the pitching coach at Albuquerque of the  
Pacific Coast League for the last three seasons. He has 13 years of 
experience as a pitching coach in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Claude is a former Dodger pitcher and an experienced pitching  
coach with a proven major league track record,'' Dodgers general 
manager Kevin Malone said in a news release. ``He is familiar with 
many of our pitchers since he has been in the Dodger organization 
for eight of the last 11 years as a pitching coach in the minor 
leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers also announced that Glenn Hoffman and Rick Dempsey  
will switch assignments -- Hoffman will now coach third base, and 
Dempsey will assume the bullpen coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman managed the Dodgers for the final 88 games last year. He  
was reassigned following the season, and Johnson was later hired as 
manager.

<HEADLINE> 49er Rape Case Testimony Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A woman accusing San Francisco 49ers  
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller of rape told a hospital technician 
that she passed out in a bed during a party and awoke to find him 
on top of her, a lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Deborah Caldwell-Bono read portions of the  
hospital report during a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller was visiting Virginia Tech, his alma mater, on  
March 3 when he and the woman, a senior, went with a group of 
people to two bars near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldwell-Bono, while going over evidence favorable to her client  
that was obtained from prosecutors, said one of the woman's 
sorority sisters told an investigator that the accuser was drinking 
with Druckenmiller and bought him a shot of liquor. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of six to eight people piled into a car after the bars  
closed and went to a house party, Caldwell-Bono said. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to her statement at the hospital, she does not  
remember anything after getting into the car,'' Caldwell-Bono told 
Judge Ray Grubbs. ``She remembers waking up and he (Druckenmiller) 
was on top of her. She did not tell him to stop. She let him 
finish. She did not say help and when they finished she started to 
cry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to reports written by investigators, the woman didn't  
tell her roommate when she got home that she had been raped and 
didn't go to the hospital until late in the morning, Caldwell-Bono 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Peggy Frank declined to  
comment on the evidence outlined by the defense attorney and 
revealed no evidence considered unfavorable to Druckenmiller, who 
is set for trial July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldwell-Bono accused prosecutors of withholding evidence  
supporting Druckenmiller's contention that the woman pursued him 
and wanted to have sex with him. Frank said the defense attorneys 
have all the information they're entitled to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Grubbs said he was frustrated by the bickering between  
attorneys, adjourned and asked them to reschedule the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Expanding With Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With cars and trucks driving off dealer lots at a  
fast clip, automakers have decided now is the time to build new 
factories and expand old ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with excess capacity at factories that make passenger cars,  
demand is so great for their highly profitable sport utility 
vehicles and pickup trucks that carmakers are willing to risk 
adding plants to cash in on the good times. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say they doubt the risks are too great. They say that  
even if the industry hits a slump, it will not be forced into plant 
shutdowns and layoffs like the wholesale cuts of the early 1980s 
that decimated the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, most of the expansion is aimed at achieving production  
efficiencies as well as capitalizing on the booming market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a fair amount of overcapacity in cars right now,''  
said Robert Duronio, manager of product analysis for AutoPacific 
Inc. ``Right now, everyone is looking for more capacity to make 
light trucks and SUVs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the automakers' plans:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday announced plans to convert a  
car-production line at a plant outside Kansas City, Mo., to make a 
new top-of-the line pickup truck, the Lincoln Blackwood. 
</P>
<P>
	-- DaimlerChrysler AG on Tuesday said it plans a $435 million  
modernization and expansion program at its plant in Fenton, Mo., 
where the popular Dodge Ram Quad Cab pickup is produced. 
</P>
<P>
	-- General Motors Corp. has said it is considering three new  
factories in Michigan and Ohio -- the first new GM plant 
construction in North America in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Honda Motor Co. has said it will build a new $400 million  
plant in Lincoln, Ala. The plant will employ about 1,700 workers 
and produce 120,000 vehicles a year, either sport utility vehicles 
or minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Toyota Motor Co. is ramping up production at its new $1.2  
billion Indiana pickup truck plant, where jobs are expected to grow 
to 2,300 in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	These plans come as total sales in the United States are up 9  
percent over 1998. Analysts said those sales, especially the 
booming demand for trucks, is driving the new construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have is a situation where truck plants are operating  
with a lot of overtime, running six days a week with three shifts a 
day,'' said Greg Salchow, an analyst with Roney &AMP; Co. ``Contrast 
that with plants that produce passenger cars, and some of these are 
not even at normal capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of GM's proposed plants, most other factory  
projects involve adding capacity to build trucks, minivans or sport 
utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cliff Swenson, an analyst with Monthly Autocast said U.S. auto  
factories had far less unused capacity than others around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson said even if GM adds new factories, it has made  
production cuts elsewhere, so overcapacity would not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost-cutting is another reason automakers have built or added  
onto factories. GM says it loses money on nearly all of the small 
cars it sells, and has high hopes for techniques to reduce labor 
costs in new factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Ford have spoken against building new factories,  
choosing instead to convert assembly lines that produced 
slow-selling cars into truck assemblers. Toyota and Honda gain by 
having plants in the United States, free from the shifting tides of 
import economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Wall Street brokerage firms recently downgraded their  
ratings on GM and Ford, citing the Federal Reserve Board's policy 
shift that leans towards raising interest rates if the economy 
shows signs of overheating. Current low interest rates have made 
auto loans more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Salchow, the analyst at Roney, said he's not worried that  
the heady pace of sales is about to run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about a sales slowdown are ``more a matter of hedging  
than any real evidence that the market is slowing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson at Monthly Autocast said the surprising demand for their  
most profitable products was forcing automakers to adjust their mix 
of cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is how much do you have to realign your  
production to meet changing consumer demand,'' he said. ``That's 
one of the things they're struggling with.''

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday To Race in Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Silverbulletday will try to foil Charismatic's  
Triple Crown bid in the Belmont Stakes and become the first filly 
to win the race in 132 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's in the Belmont,'' trainer Bob Baffert said by telephone  
Wednesday from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a pure athlete, and athletes sometimes do things they  
are not supposed to do,'' owner Mike Pegram said of the decision to 
have Silverbulletday make her debut against colts in the testing 
1 1/2-mile Belmont on June 5. ``We have absolutely nothing to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, winner of 11 of 12 starts and unbeaten in five  
races this year, will be only the 21st filly to start in the 
Belmont. The only winner was Ruthless, in the first Belmont in 
1867. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said the decision to run Silverbulletday was made after  
she worked six furlongs in 1:10 4-5 Tuesday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She cooled out great after a good, hard work,'' Baffert said.  
``She was playing and bucking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said Silverbulletday will be flown from Kentucky to New  
York on June 2, the day entries are taken for the Belmont. Jerry 
Bailey will ride her for the second time in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, bidding to become the 12th Triple Crown champion  
and first since Affirmed in 1978, also is scheduled to be flown on 
Wednesday from Churchill Downs to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday also was entered in the Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness, but was entered into filly stakes held the day before 
either of those races. She won the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs 
and the Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he second-guessed himself about not running  
Silverbulletday in the Derby or Preakness, Pegram said, ``Not one 
bit. But if I didn't run her in the Belmont, I would be 
second-guessing myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Silverbulletday in the race, owners of the last  
unsuccessful Triple Crown challengers will be represented in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram owns Real Quiet, second to Victory Gallop in last year's  
Belmont. Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of 
Silver Charm, second to Touch Gold in 1997. Menifee is co-owned by 
Arthur Hancock III, co-owner of Sunday Silence, second to Easy Goer 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, 3-year-olds considered set for the Belmont,  
besides Charismatic and Silverbulletday, are Adonis, Best of Luck, 
Lemon Drop Kid, Menifee, Pineoff, Port Bayou, Prime Directive, 
Stephen Got Even and Vison and Verse. 
</P>
<P>
	Listed as possible are Lead Em Home, Patience Game, The Groom is  
Red and Walk That Walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont Stakes is limited to 16 starters. The most in a  
field for one of 14 unsuccessful Triple Crown bids was 13 in 1971 
when Canonero II finished fourth. The biggest field for one of the 
successful Triple Crown bids was seven, three times.

<HEADLINE> NATO Launches Extensive Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Blasts reverberated throughout  
dozens of Yugoslav cities Wednesday during a record number of NATO 
attack flights, which zeroed in once more on President Slobodan 
Milosevic's villa and hit army barracks and command posts. 
</P>
<P>
	In a later round of bombing, planes roared over Belgrade shortly  
before midnight Wednesday and heavy anti-aircraft fire resounded in 
the capital soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media reported that two children and one other person were  
killed and several injured in the region of Ralja, 18 miles south 
of Belgrade, when a missile struck residential buildings. The 
report couldn't be independently confirmed. Strikes were also 
reported near Obrenovac, about 18 miles southwest of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Two powerful explosions were heard in Belgrade's southern  
district of Rakovica, and thick, black smoke was seen rising from 
an engine factory. The state-run Tanjug news agency said NATO 
struck a munitions site in the city but the missiles did not 
explode. NATO said it was targeting that building when it hit the 
Chinese embassy on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In attacks early Thursday, Serb media reported strikes near  
Belgrade's Batajnica military airport, an industrial zone in Nis, a 
communication tower near of Novi Sad, and a hill near Belgrade 
where an underground military complex is believed to be located. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run Serbian television, meanwhile, went off the air  
Wednesday, briefly in Serbia but permanently on the satellite link. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, allied jets bombarded Kosovo's capital,  
Pristina, its surroundings and Novi Sad, Serb media reported. 
Sustained NATO strikes also were reported in central and southern 
Yugoslavia as well as an area north of the port of Bar in 
Montenegro, the pro-Western republic that along with Serbia makes 
up Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO reported early Wednesday that it had flown 650 sorties in  
the previous 24 hours, including a record 284 attack flights, 
hitting artillery, tanks and mortars in Kosovo. It said all 
aircraft returned safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets also included television and radio relay stations in  
Belgrade and several other cities. A wide range of army barracks, 
ammunition storage sites, command posts and petroleum storage sites 
also were hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance jets also focused again on Milosevic's villa just west  
of Belgrade, which NATO says contains a command and control bunker. 
It is believed to be Milosevic's main hideout, but his whereabouts 
were unknown at the time of the attack. It was the fourth time NATO 
has targeted the villa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb-run media center in Pristina said two children were  
killed and one seriously hurt Wednesday morning when a NATO missile 
hit the village of Radoste near Orahovac, 40 miles southwest of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug said a woman and a child were wounded when three missiles  
hit their home in the village of Gazivode, in northern Kosovo. 
Tanjug also said three people were injured when a missile hit the 
courtyard of a private home in a suburb of Novi Pazar, about 100 
miles south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb media also reported attacks on the cities of Uzice, where  
an airfield has been targeted repeatedly; Izbica, also near Novi 
Pazar; and Mount Tara, 85 miles southwest of Belgrade. The Beta 
news agency said two missiles slammed into and damaged apartment 
buildings in the outskirts of Zajecar, 115 miles southeast of the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Albania at the Morini border crossing, several  
mortar rounds exploded and automatic weapons and tank fire was 
heard, as Serbian forces clashed with guerrillas of the Kosovo 
Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors from the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe reported Serb shelling of three Albanian 
villages near the border and said a man and a young woman were 
killed when a mortar shell hit a house in the village of Sahani. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 840,000 people -- mostly ethnic Albanians -- have fled  
Kosovo. Before the NATO air campaign began March 24, Kosovo had a 
population of 2 million of whom 90 percent were ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the NATO bombings, Milosevic has so far rejected the key  
element of a U.S.-backed peace plan for Kosovo -- the deployment of 
NATO-led troops to secure the safe return of hundreds of thousands 
of ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled his crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials maintain that they are not planning a ground  
invasion, but NATO's top policymaking body, the North Atlantic 
Council, approved a plan Tuesday to enlarge a proposed Kosovo 
peacekeeping force to 50,000, from the 28,000 originally planned. 
The force is intended to head into Kosovo once Serbian troops 
leave, and NATO officials contend it needs to be in place quickly 
to be ready if Milosevic bends.

<HEADLINE> Drama of Family Separation Haunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``We are not the sisters you left,'' one of the  
characters in ``Goodnight Children Everywhere'' tells her younger 
brother when they are reunited in their shabby South London flat 
after nearly six years apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Things change -- with unexpected complications -- as three women  
and their baby brother try to sort out their lives at the end of 
World War II. Theatergoers will be rooting for them to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nelson's play, now at off-Broadway's Playwrights  
Horizons, is a haunting, humane family drama of separation, loss 
and renewal. It is told in a clear, almost crisp manner that does 
everything possible to underline the ambiguity of its finely drawn 
characters. Shades of gray have never seemed so fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, author of such plays as ``Two Shakespearean Actors'' and  
``Some Americans Abroad,'' also directs -- with a careful, loving 
hand. You can tell he cares about these people, despite their 
flaws. 
</P>
<P>
	Brother Peter, age 17, has just returned from Alberta, Canada,  
where he was sent to escape the bombs falling on London. During the 
war, his parents died -- mum killed in a bombing raid, dad as a 
soldier in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Peter is home, shyly remeeting his siblings -- with varying  
degrees of success. Oldest sister Betty is everyone's surrogate 
mother, the dutiful daughter who sacrificed all for the other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Middle sister Ann is married and pregnant, wed to the much-older  
and philandering Mike, a doctor who favors a quick drink now and 
then -- mostly now. She also has an aggressive attachment to Peter, 
an obsession that gets them both into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Vi is the family flirt, a funny and fresh would-be actress,  
played with quirky charm by Heather Goldenhersh. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Stafford, in the pivotal role of young Peter, captures the  
boy's gawkiness and confusion with a naturalness that is 
astonishing. Stafford works well with Kali Rocha, who plays the 
unhappy Ann. Rocha finds the sadness in the woman, trapped in an 
unsatisfying marriage and facing motherhood with considerable 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Weigert completes the trio of sisters, nicely balancing  
the oldest sibling's resentfulness with the woman's genuine love 
for her sisters and brother. Jon De Vries nails Mike's 
uncomfortable personality, a man whose surface amiability makes his 
marital deceits all the more disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	There are fine cameos by John Rothman as Betty's pompous suitor  
and Amy Whitehouse as the man's mousy daughter, a girl on the prowl 
for a beau. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of Nelson's play lies in his telling portraits of  
these seven people. We care how they react, to the most ordinary -- 
and extraordinary -- situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The title ``Goodnight Children Everywhere'' comes from one of  
those syrupy songs of patriotism, sung by Vera Lynn on the radio, 
to buck up morale during the war. It projects a sense of safe haven 
and support, something that the young adults in Nelson's play find 
very elusive indeed.

<HEADLINE> Orange Juice Up in Dry Florida  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Orange juice futures jumped nearly 6 percent Wednesday on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York amid increasing concern that 
dry weather in Florida will sharply reduce the size of the next 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures also rose sharply, while gold  
futures continued their retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice prices have risen sharply in  
the past week as Florida's rainy season got off to a delayed start 
and provided far less moisture than is necessary for flowering 
orange trees. If dryness persists, the oranges could be smaller, 
reducing yields. 
</P>
<P>
	That comes after the U.S. Agriculture Department reported the  
recently completed harvest came in at 188 million boxes weighing 90 
pounds each. The figure is 23 percent below the year-earlier record 
crop of 244 million boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also were watching developments in the report of  
sightings last week of a new breed of fruit fly, which also could 
do damage to the Florida crop, which is by far the nation's 
largest. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, futures prices remain nearly 15 percent lower than a year  
ago this time since inventories currently are ample and Brazil, the 
world's largest grower, is expected to produce another large crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen concentrated orange juice for July delivery finished up  
4.70 cents at 91.90 cents a pound, boosting prices to their highest 
since late February. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures also rose sharply on the New York Board of Trade  
as speculators continued to bet Brazil cannot go another winter 
without a crop-damaging frost. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, has seen cooler  
than normal temperatures ahead of its winter but has so far escaped 
sustained freezing weather required to affect young coffee trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil produces mainly robusta beans, which are not certified  
for delivery against New York futures contracts. But many roasters 
mix those beans with high-quality arabica beans for gourmet blends, 
and record production last year left the world flush with supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee rose 5.55 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $1.25 a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures posted new 20-year lows on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange in continued bearish sentiment tied to the Bank of 
England's planned sale of more than half its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices went into a tailspin in early May and have yet to  
recover after the U.K.. announced plans to sell 415 metric tons of 
715 metric tons it holds as monetary reserves. The sale, which 
begins in July, has led to fears other European countries will 
release some or all of their reserves as they seek better-returning 
investments such as Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund and Switzerland also are said to  
be considering selling part of their reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	June gold fell $2.10 to $270.80 an ounce.

<HEADLINE>  Bill Russell Honored at Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain went one-on-one  
again Wednesday night, 30 years after they last battled on an NBA 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Their confrontation was verbal and good-natured, and again  
Russell came out on top as many of the NBA's greatest players 
turned out to honor the Hall of Fame center who led the Boston 
Celtics to 11 championships in 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is greedy,'' Chamberlain said with a smile before the  
carefully orchestrated show, which lasted nearly three hours. ``He 
has 11 rings and 10 fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And two ceremonies at which his uniform number 6 was retired.  
</P>
<P>
	The first came on March 12, 1972, in an empty Boston Garden  
before a game that afternoon. His number was raised to the rafters 
with just a few people participating, the way he wanted it done. 
</P>
<P>
	The second came Wednesday night in a show, emceed by Bill Cosby  
with thousands of paying spectators at the FleetCenter. And plenty 
of other basketball legends -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Bob 
Cousy, Julius Erving, Oscar Robertson, John Havlicek -- were in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell and Celtics vice chairman Red Auerbach re-raised the  
banner bearing Russell's number. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Russell told the audience, ``I am terribly, terribly  
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things that I did with my team were what I thought I  
should do and the life that I led is the life that I thought I 
should lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football great Jim Brown also was there.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is a person of great character,'' Brown said of Russell.  
``If you can't stand the brutal truth, don't talk to Bill 
Russell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Russell's 11 titles, seven came against Chamberlain-led  
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an integral part of my career,'' said Russell, 65. ``He  
made me better and I made him better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they made the game of basketball better.  
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said the tribute to Russell is overdue now that  
Michael Jordan has left the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really haven't appreciated him. Maybe this time it's  
appropriate,'' he said. ``Because of the extraordinary dominance of 
Michael Jordan, people have gotten pretty myopic about what 
happened in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven championships in a row. That says it all.''  
</P>
<P>
	NBA commissioner David Stern said, though, ``we've always had a  
good historical perspective on Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll step out on a limb and say in a couple of 100 years, no  
one is going to win 11 championships in 13 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said he didn't want his number retired in 1972, but  
Auerbach, his former coach, insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said he agreed to do it again Wednesday so he could be  
linked publicly with teammates whose numbers also hang on banners 
from the FleetCenter rafters and to raise money for the National 
Mentoring Partnership, a group that arranges for adults to guide 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	A proud, private man, Russell -- Boston's first black sports star  
-- lived in the largely white Boston suburb of Reading, where his 
house was vandalized. He was perceived by many as aloof and didn't 
sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had any problem with the fans,'' Russell said  
Wednesday. But how did he feel about others in the Boston area? 
</P>
<P>
	``The opposite of love is not hate,'' he said. ``The opposite of  
love is indifference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players at Wednesday night's ceremony hid their  
admiration for Russell, a defensive wizard who averaged only 15.1 
points per game -- to go with 22.5 rebounds -- but measured his 
success in victories and titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admired Bill when I was in high school,'' Abdul-Jabbar said.  
``I could not have had the career that I had if it had not been for 
people like Bill who showed us how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to be the first guy to play above the rim,'' said  
Erving, who spent a lot of time up there. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell retired after the 1968-69 season. In his last game,  
Chamberlain outscored him 18-6 and outrebounded him 27-21. But the 
Celtics won that seventh game of the NBA Finals 108-106, giving 
Russell his final championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the best things that happened to me was Wilt coming  
into the league,'' Russell said. ``I realized if I didn't improve, 
I'd be embarrassed every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on Wednesday night, they were together again as Russell  
finally had his number retired in front of thousands of cheering 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful testament to the fact that legends don't  
die,'' said Dave Cowens, who replaced Russell as Boston's center. 
``They come back.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Chief Testifies on Collections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax collections by the IRS won't be  
jeopardized by broad new taxpayer rights, but they will be hurt if 
Congress fails to provide the agency with enough money to do its 
job, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti says. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Internal Revenue Service employees has dropped  
13.7 percent since 1993, making it harder to keep up enforcement 
actions while implementing a 1998 reform law emphasizing taxpayer 
service first, Rossotti told a congressional panel Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Rossotti noted that the number of returns with over  
$100,000 in income has risen 56 percent over the past five years, 
while the number of those returns subjected to audits is down 21 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The path that the IRS has taken cannot continue,'' he said.  
``Doing business the same way while the economy grows and resources 
decline will eventually undermine the whole tax system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that only about 2 percent of the $1.7 trillion in  
taxes collected this year come from enforcement actions, making it 
imperative to stress improvement in service for the 98 percent of 
taxpayers who comply willingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we have a choice to make between effective tax  
collection and fair treatment of taxpayers,'' Rossotti said. ``We 
do have to effectively target our enforcement where it's really 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti's comment came at a joint House-Senate panel composed  
of members of seven committees with jurisdiction over the IRS and 
tax law. The 1998 law requires such a session each year to get an 
overall look at the agency's performance and needs. 
</P>
<P>
	After 18 months on the job, Rossotti has broad support among  
Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill as he tries to convert an 
entrenched bureaucracy into one more responsive to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that the task of modernizing the IRS is not an  
easy one and may take some time,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several lawmakers questioned the drop in enforcement  
actions in the first half of 1999. Garnishments of wages and levies 
on bank accounts, for example, are down to 458,000, from 1.8 
million during the same time period two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said the causes were threefold: gradual budget  
reductions that have shrunk the IRS staff, requirements that 
collections agents perform other duties such as answering taxpayer 
calls and worker fears of mandatory firing under new laws -- known 
by workers as the ``10 deadly sins'' -- covering willful misconduct 
and mistreatment of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are issues that have certainly caused confusion and  
anxiety in our work force,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intensive training continues to ease those fears and it will  
take time for employees to become accustomed to the new 
service-oriented IRS, he added. But Congress must support spending 
on technology, new business practices and management. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is putting much of its stock in electronic tax filing  
programs, but on Tuesday acknowledged a glitch in one of them. The 
company contracted to handle credit card payments made errors in 
13,700 transactions on April 15, mistakenly applying the payment to 
1999 taxes instead of the 1998 return. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said anyone who received an IRS notice for tax due  
after paying with a credit card that day should do nothing. The 
company, U.S. Audiotex, will contact taxpayers about the correction 
being made and no penalties will be assessed.

<HEADLINE> The Almost Perfect Game Is Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Call it imperfect perfection, a perfect game  
that wasn't, and it was ended by a home run that wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 26, 1959, or 40 years ago today, Harvey Haddix of the  
Pittsburgh Pirates pitched the best game in major league history -- 
and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was so brilliant that no one has come close to matching  
it, yet Haddix wound up with only a loss. He didn't even get a 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, Haddix saw the game stripped from  
baseball's official list of no-hitters not long before he died in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	His former Pirates teammates who remember that overcast night in  
Milwaukee's County Stadium don't care. They knew what they watched. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the greatest game ever pitched,'' second baseman Bill  
Mazeroski said. ``It was a pleasure to play in that game. It was a 
masterpiece. We knew all along what was going on. Believe me, when 
you play in a game, you know if it's a no-hitter or not, and that 
was something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve innings. Thirty-six Braves batters. No hits. No walks. No  
errors. Not even many great plays to preserve what still is the 
longest single-game stretch of perfection ever in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, Haddix didn't realize he was perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander knew he had a no-hitter, but because he was  
concentrating on the job at hand while sucking between innings on 
lozenges to combat a sore throat and cold, he thought he walked a 
batter. He hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The perfect game finally ended in the 13th inning when third  
baseman Don Hoak, the Pirates' emotional sparkplug, threw away 
light-hitting Felix Mantilla's ground ball for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	The perfect game was over. The no-hitter lived on. But not for  
long. 
</P>
<P>
	As storm clouds hovered over the stadium and lightning crackled  
in the distance of a late spring Wisconsin night, Eddie Mathews 
bunted Mantilla to second base. The Braves, still without a hit, 
were within 180 feet of winning a game in which the Pirates had 12 
hits, but never got a runner across home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Aaron was up next. To set up a possible double play,  
Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh ordered him intentionally walked so 
Haddix could face Joe Adcock. They weren't strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, Haddix, then of the St. Louis Cardinals, was set to  
start the All-Star game for the National League. But in the final 
game before the break, Adcock, who died earlier this month, lined a 
ball off Haddix's knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never the same pitcher after that,'' Haddix said.  
</P>
<P>
	Haddix had thrown his slider away from Adcock successfully all  
night, but Adcock was looking for it. Just as the wind that had 
whipped across the stadium all night calmed momentarily, Adcock 
drove the ball over the chain link fence in center field for a 
three-run homer. Or at least what the crowd of 19,194 thought was a 
three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, thinking Adcock's drive had bounced over the wall for a  
ground-rule double, cut across the diamond and Adcock passed him on 
the basepaths and was ruled out. Adcock's hit was officially listed 
as a double. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until a day later that the National League office  
ruled the final score wasn't 3-0 or, as it was initially listed 
that night as 2-0, but 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run ball was never recovered. A fan jumped out of the  
stands, grabbed the ball and took off, never to be seen again. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Haddix didn't know whether to laugh or cry. So,  
fittingly for a person of relatively small stature (5-foot-9, 155 
pounds) and calm demeanor, he did neither. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know that nobody else had ever pitched a game like  
that,'' he said in 1989. ``I knew something was up, because there 
were a lot of reporters there and that was unusual, because teams 
weren't covered then like they are now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haddix was behind in the count to only one batter until the  
fateful 13th inning, left fielder Bob Skinner recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a `perfect' perfect game,'' Skinner said. ``Harvey had  
unbelievable control. It was just phenomenal. It was as good as you 
could pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haddix didn't benefit financially from the greatest game ever  
pitch. He wasn't given even a token raise -- this was an era when 
clubs and players routinely fought over $1,000 raises -- and he 
turned down the Ed Sullivan Show's offer of $500 for an appearance 
because the Pirates were traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is a happy ending to the story. A year later,  
Haddix won twice in the World Series as the Pirates beat the 
supposedly unbeatable New York Yankees, including the Game 7 
decided by Bill Mazeroski's home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, Haddix recalled the World Series, not his imperfect

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters Say Best Is To Come </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Both are winning. And the Williams sisters say the  
best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Primed for a long-anticipated title in a major tournament,  
fifth-seeded Venus beat Natasha Zvereva of Belarus, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 
Wednesday, while her little sister, 10th-seeded Serena, downed 
Mariana Diaz Oliva of Argentina, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus took 1 hour, 22 minutes -- seven minutes longer than Serena  
-- as both reached the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters are in great form, capturing five titles and losing  
just nine matches between them this year. And while their rapid 
rise toward the top hasn't included any Grand Slam triumphs, they 
plan to change that at Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my ninth Grand Slam,'' Venus said. ``Now it's time for  
me to make a move. I'm ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena is equally upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a mater of time before I reach the top spot or reach  
my goals,'' the 17-year-old said. ``I plan on doing well here. But 
I'm taking one match at a time because in the past, I would look 
too far ahead in the draw and not do too well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the two-week tournament progresses, the sisters said, look  
for their games to rise, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm playing that well right now,'' Serena said.  
``It's not 100 percent, it is maybe 90 percent, but getting better 
every day. I made a lot of mistakes today and my serve was really 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But my dad says in order to be a champion you have to win even  
on your bad days,'' she added. ``I was able to come through today. 
I was stronger mentally. I never doubted I was going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena said she is still fighting back from the injury that  
forced her to pull out of the recent German Open, one of the few 
down points in a big year for the Williams'. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus is 27-4. After winning the Lipton championships, she  
crossed the Atlantic and began dominating the European clay-court 
season with back-to-back triumphs at the German and Italian opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Hamburg, I played perfect tennis. In Rome, I didn't play so  
well. Here, OK,'' Venus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena, 23-5 this year, also won successive events, at the Gaz  
de France in Paris and then in Indian Wells, before losing in the 
final of the Lipton to her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Zvereva, a finalist here 11 years ago, Venus was only  
briefly threatened when she was taken to a tiebreaker in the first 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go into tiebreakers, I just feel that I am going to  
win,'' the 18-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrapped up the on her first match point with a blistering  
forehand that, though it arrived just yards from Zvereva, was too 
hot to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love red clay,'' Venus said. ``I adapt my game. When I am on  
clay I rally and wait for my opportunity. When I am on grass, I 
come in and attack.''

<HEADLINE> Parents of Shaken Baby Seek Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- Child welfare officials are seeking to gain  
custody of a 20-month-old comatose boy so he can be removed from 
life support and allow to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's father is accused of shaking him so violently that he  
is blind, deaf and unable to swallow on his own. Doctors say 
Shirron Lewis has no chance of recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	The child's parents are fighting to keep him alive, citing  
religious reasons. If the boy dies, prosecutors said the father, 
Ronald Lewis, is likely to be charged with first-degree murder. 
Lewis already has been charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts say it is only the second such case in the  
country. A hearing on a similar case in Nebraska is scheduled for 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Social workers and medical experts testified Wednesday about  
Shirron's extensive injuries during a hearing to determine whether 
the county could take custody from the parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Joseph F. Battle said Wednesday he would take the custody  
issue under advisement. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle on Tuesday denied a petition from court-appointed child  
advocate Barbara Scarlata that would have taken the boy off life 
support. The judge said the county's Children and Youth Service 
must be granted custody first before the issue of life support can 
be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scarlata, who also works for the Children and Youth Service,  
said Wednesday that she planned to press ahead for Shirron to be 
removed from life support. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people, including hospital workers and social workers,  
testified at Wednesday's closed hearing, and Shirron's physicians 
testified via videotape, said court spokesman Tom Musi. 
</P>
<P>
	The content of the testimony was not released and attorneys and  
county officials involved refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirron, who was born premature, arrived at the hospital in  
March 1998. Prosecutors said the baby was in the care of a 
baby-sitter but contend Lewis caused the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 43, said he didn't cause the injuries and doesn't know  
how they happened, defense attorney Wayne Punshon said. Lewis, who 
attended Wednesday's hearing, is being held at Delaware County 
prison awaiting a hearing on his criminal charges Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirron's mother, Jackie Allen, 32, attended Wednesday hearing,  
but made no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and Ms. Allen said they believe only God can end a  
person's life and do not want a court to decide what is best for 
their child. The couple are engaged and lived together at the time 
of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Candidates in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The presidential election may not be until next  
year, but Texas this week is a focal point for a campaign that 
already appears to be in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was in the state Tuesday, accompanied to the  
Rio Grande Valley by the man he hopes will succeed him, Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton headed off to vacation in Florida, Gore remained  
for a planned education forum and fund-raising event today in 
Dallas and another one later in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, former  
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, was in El Paso and Houston, 
tapping backers Tuesday for money to help his so far low-key effort 
to overtake Gore's built-in White House incumbency advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might be spinning their wheels if the focus were on the  
general election, but with respect to winning their party's 
nomination, Texas is a key state,'' said Dave Rohde, a political 
science professor at Michigan State University. ``And although 
George W. Bush is the favorite to be the Republican nominee, at 
this point, that's far from certain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan, who  
specializes in presidential campaigns, said it's logical for Gore 
and Bradley to visit Texas because of Bush's notoriety as the 
Republican front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state is crawling with national reporters,'' he noted.  
``This is the political story of the day. To go where the lights 
are makes political sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor, making sure he was heard during the  
Democratic invasion, sounded more like a presidential candidate 
than ever as he used the release of a congressional report about 
the theft of nuclear secrets by China to rip into the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next president and presidents after that are going to have  
to deal with that,'' said Bush, who officially has formed only an 
exploratory committee to pursue the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley acknowledged Tuesday knowing little about the Texas  
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know that much about George W. Bush, quite  
frankly,'' he said. ``I believe in playing one game at a time and 
this game is the primary election. When I have the nomination, then 
we'll focus on whoever is the Republican nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was quick to point out, however, what he believed were his  
contrasts with Gore, positioning himself as a government outsider, 
despite an 18-year career in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've had a more varied life experience than the vice  
president,'' he said. ``I've gotten up a lot of mornings, in fact 
for many years of my life, and gone to work and never thought of 
the federal government. I was just like millions of other Americans 
going to work every day. I think he's had experiences primarily 
based in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also insisted that during his Senate years, he took risky  
stands on volatile issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the risk of leadership,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been more cautious,'' Bradley said of Gore.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Gore were in Edinburg for an annual conference on  
empowerment zones -- economically depressed communities targeted 
with tax incentives, job training, low-interest loans and community 
grants for revitalization. The Rio Grande Valley empowerment zone, 
established in 1994, has been called one of the country's most 
successful, and Clinton urged people to push their congressmen to 
continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore continued that theme at other stops later in the day.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is certainly a labor of love to have the opportunity to  
work with you on community empowerment,'' he told about 400 people 
at an outdoor appearance at McAllen's South Texas Community 
College.

<HEADLINE> Women Fill Navy Academy's Top Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The No. 1 graduate at the Naval Academy  
this year was a woman, as was No. 2, not to mention Nos. 4, 6, and 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the top 10 Naval Academy graduates were women, who made  
up only 15 percent of the Class of 1999 that graduated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it was the best showing yet for women at the academy,  
where class standing depends on more than just good grades. Academy 
officials also consider military competency and conduct (given 
about 25 percent weight) and athletic achievements (10 percent) to 
determine the order of merit. 
</P>
<P>
	Women may have tried harder ``to show we can succeed in the  
military,'' said Josephine Nguyen, who finished second in the class 
of 868 and will enter medical school at Stanford University in the 
fall with hopes of becoming a Navy flight surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The top graduate was Mary Godfrey of Dousman, Wis., who was a  
member of the gymnastics team and the glee club in addition to 
doing so well in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nguyen, 21, said her decision to enter the Naval Academy was  
influenced by her father, an officer in the South Vietnamese Navy 
before coming to the United States, and her 25-year-old sister, 
Minh-Tu, who also got her degree Wednesday and was commissioned as 
a Marine second lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We grew up with my father telling stories about his Navy  
career,'' Ms. Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also was motivated by a sense of duty to her adopted  
country: ``You should give something back to the country which has 
provided so much for your family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commencement address was delivered by Defense Secretary  
William Cohen, who offered a vigorous defense of U.S. involvement 
in Kosovo and Serbia, where he said a struggle is taking place 
``for the future shape of civilized society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has taken the  
world ``into the heart of darkness,'' and the United States ``could 
not bear witness to this murder and mayhem with indifference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO ``decided to wage an air campaign to achieve our goals. It  
was the right decision then, and it's the right course now,'' he 
said.

	Milosevic Indictment Is Expected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- According to U.S. officials, the U.N. tribunal  
that prosecutes war crimes will announce as early as tomorrow the 
indictment of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic for atrocities. 
The indictment has been handed down in The Hague, Netherlands, one 
official declared. Another said: ``The decision has been made.'' 
The U.N. court's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, promised ``an 
important announcement'' tomorrow.

	UN Says Kosovo Is 'Calamitous'  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Wrapping up an 11-day mission to  
Yugoslavia, a U.N. fact-finding team called the situation in Kosovo 
``calamitous'' and said the humanitarian needs are ``immense.'' It 
was the first group of international observers allowed to visit 
Kosovo since the large-scale exodus of ethnic Albanians began two 
months ago. About 840,000 have fled or been driven out by Serb 
forces.

barracks and command posts. Jets bombarded Kosovo's capital, 
Pristina, its surroundings and the northern city of Novi Sad, Serb

	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton played a round of golf and  
went biking with the first lady today on a secluded plantation in 
northern Florida. Clinton also received his daily security briefing 
on the Yugoslavia campaign, called the Italian prime minister and 
named Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel a special envoy to Macedonia to 
check up on refugees from Kosovo. ``He will stay in touch, as 
you've already seen today,'' White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. ``But it's important from time to time to take a

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring Pentagon pleas, the Senate voted  
60-40 today to block a round of cost-saving military base closings 
proposed for 2001. The Clinton administration argued the closures 
were needed to free up funds to help modernize a military stretched 
even thinner by the conflict in the Balkans. Republicans said they 
mistrusted the process, renewing allegations that Clinton meddled 
in 1995 to save jobs at bases in vote-rich California and Texas. 
And Democratic support for another round was mixed, with Minority 
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., among the opponents.

<HEADLINE> Analyst Urges Enforcing Truck Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former congressman who studied truck and bus  
safety said Wednesday that gains can be made with better law 
enforcement, improved data collection and attention from top 
transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Norman Mineta, a California Democrat who once headed  
the House Transportation Committee, offered the suggestions as he 
concluded a 90-day review of the Department of Transportation and 
the federal Office of Motor Carriers, which oversees the safety of 
large commercial vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The review came in response to complaints the motor carrier  
office is too soft on the trucking industry and at a time when a 
string of fatal bus accidents has raised concerns about safety. A 
Mother's Day crash in New Orleans killed 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuation of such fatality and injury trends is  
unacceptable, and therefore there has rightfully been a growing 
concern and resurgent call for increased attention to this issue,'' 
Mineta told House Transportation's ground transportation 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	His eight recommendations:  
</P>
<P>
	--Increased surveillance, compliance and enforcement activities,  
including increased inspections by state and federal law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increased truck inspections at the border with Mexico before  
Jan. 1, when the North American Free Trade Agreement will allow 
Mexican trucks to travel freely into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--New motor carrier regulations, as well as a streamlining of the  
rule-making process. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improved safety data and information systems, especially  
pertaining to crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	--New motor carrier safety entry requirements, because studies  
show that carriers with less than three years' experience have 
higher crash and lower safety compliance rates. 
</P>
<P>
	--New license training and testing programs, including a  
commercial drivers learner's permit and apprentice driving program. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increased truck and bus crash-avoidance initiatives, including  
using devices to avoid collisions with passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Greater attention by management to motor carrier issues,  
including adding ``motor carrier'' into the name of the Federal 
Highway Administration and hiring two top executives to oversee 
motor carrier safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway Administrator Ken Wykle, who also attended Wednesday's  
hearing, said he supported the recommendations and Mineta's 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Wykle and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater  
announced a series of steps aimed at cutting the number of 
truck-related highway deaths in half over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the year for which the most current statistics are  
available, 5,355 people were killed in accidents involving trucks. 
In many cases, the accidents were caused not by truck drivers, but 
by motorists who cut in front of them, slammed into them or stopped 
in front of them.

<HEADLINE> San Diego Gets Super Bowl in 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Super Bowl is on its way back to San Diego.  
</P>
<P>
	NFL team owners today picked San Diego to host the 2003 game.  
The only other contender was South Florida, where this year's Super 
Bowl was held. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego replaces San Francisco, which was awarded the game but  
will not have a new stadium ready by 2003. Atlanta hosts the game 
in 2000 followed by Tampa, 2001 and New Orleans, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are once again on the Super Bowl circuit,'' said Mayor  
Susan Golding, who traveled to Atlanta with a delegation from San 
Diego to make a pitch to NFL team owners. ``The success of our last 
Super Bowl shows that San Diego is the ideal host.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego hosted the game in 1988 and 1998.  
PricewaterhouseCoopers, a New York-based consulting firm, was hired 
by the NFL to study the game's economic impact on the host city 
after the 1998 Super Bowl. The firm estimated that up to $295 
million was pumped into San Diego's regional economy. The 2003 
Super Bowl is expected to yield similar returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our analysis shows people who attend the Super Bowl spend  
generously on food, beverages, lodging, transport, retail 
merchandise associated with the game and much more,'' said Robert 
Canton, a member of the firm's financial advisory services 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	James Wiesler, president and chief executive officer of the  
Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, said last year's World 
Series and the 1996 Republican National Convention shows San Diego 
is a growing destination for large national events. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the NFL team owners marks the second time the  
group has taken the Super Bowl away from San Francisco. The city 
was supposed to have hosted the 1999 championship, but approval was 
contingent upon an estimated $26 million in renovations to 3Com 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of pumping the money into upgrades, however, the 49ers  
pushed for a new stadium. In June 1997, voters approved a $525 
million measure for a new stadium and mall next to 3Com Park.

<HEADLINE> Essence Awards Honor Kirk Franklin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kirk Franklin, one of the honorees at this  
year's Essence Awards, wasn't expecting a big fuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly thought it was something that they were going to  
give me in a pre-show or something,'' the popular gospel 
entertainer said. ``I didn't think that I was going to be part of 
the big deal, because usually the gospel music stuff is always in 
the pre-shows or stuff. Like at the Grammys, the gospel awards are 
done way before the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin, 28, along with Lauryn Hill, Chris Rock and others,  
were honored by Essence magazine at the 12th annual awards show on 
April 30. The show will air June 2 on Fox television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Essence Awards honor individuals who have made exceptional  
contributions to the community. Franklin, whose funk beats are 
infused with a religious message, was cited for raising funds to 
help rebuild churches and synagogues destroyed or damaged in bias 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a shining example of the opportunities that life  
offers us all to transform ourselves,'' said Susan Taylor, the 
magazine's editor-in-chief. ``We honored him for his message of 
hope and love that he brings to young people and people of all 
ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin's life began under troubled circumstances. He was born  
to a teen-age mother who left him to be raised by a religious aunt. 
But the young Franklin didn't always practice what he was taught. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly think it's because of all of the things we are told  
that we can't do,'' said Franklin, who is now married and the 
father of three children. ``When you are told all the things that 
you can't do, it's making you want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of resisting the religious message, he came to  
embrace it. ``Church Boy,'' published last year, is the title of 
his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I strayed away as a teen-ager, that stuff is still  
in you, and the circumstances of life, they can have a way of 
waking you up, have a way of saying, 'OK, Lord, I hear you 
calling,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's a friend dying or whether there are some near  
death experiences of your own, you know, stuff like that will cause 
you to really want to relook at your whole life and your 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin's work performing for his local choir, The Family, led  
to a record contract. The group sold more than one million copies 
of its debut album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lean on Me,'' his inspirational collaboration with U2's Bono,  
R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige and Crystal Lewis, was nominated for three 
Grammys, including song of the year. His album, ``The Nu Nation 
Project,'' won a Grammy for best contemporary soul gospel album. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Franklin has been criticized by those who think his music is  
too secular. Those criticisms intensified when his protege group 
God's Property was catapulted to crossover success with the 
dancelike hit ``Stomp'' in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people first said things, it was kind of frustrating, but  
man, you don't think about that kind of stuff anymore because you 
have so many people to reach, and you realize that there is always 
going to be some kind of persecution when you're doing stuff for 
the Lord,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with the business of gospel music has been frustrating  
for Franklin, who said some of his personal relationships have 
suffered under the strain of his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of this business is not built on the rules of  
friendships. This business destroys friendships,'' he said. ``If I 
could do the music without the business, I'd be a very happy man. 
But that's almost like wanting watermelon, but you don't want the 
seeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin refuses to get caught up in the pursuit of money, a hit  
record or fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never want my motive to go into the studio and write a hit,  
but to be able to hear from the Lord, to be able to do a song that 
will reach people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, the word 'gospel' is to send good news. Gospel is the  
good news of Jesus Christ, and if it's not that, it's just good 
music.''

<HEADLINE> Mo., Ky. Execute Convicted Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man who bludgeoned a woman to death after  
she refused to pay him $30 to wash her car was executed early today 
by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessie Lee Wise, who was convicted of killing 49-year-old  
Geraldine McDonald with a pipe wrench in 1988, died shortly before 
1 a.m. at Potosi Correctional Center. 
</P>
<P>
	As Wise prepared to die, a man who murdered his adoptive parents  
and said he preferred death to the slow torture of life in prison 
was executed in Kentucky on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Lee Harper Jr., was the first person in the state to be  
executed by injection, a method he chose over the electric chair at 
Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper was sentenced to death for murdering his parents, Alice  
and Edward Lee Harper Sr., who had adopted him as an infant. After 
entering his parents' home on Feb. 19, 1982, he shot them both with 
a .38-caliber handgun while they were in bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, 50, saved his last statement for his 27-year-old son.  
``I love you and I'll be waiting for you on the other side. I'll be 
waiting for you, boy,'' Harper said. ``That's all I have to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, Wise's last words were for his spiritual advisor,  
the Rev. Carole Mehl. A prison spokesman said his last words were 
directed to Mehl: ``Carole, I love you very much. Remember me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Wise approached Mrs. McDonald on Aug. 27, 1988,  
and asked to wash and wax her car. He said he would need $30 in 
advance. When she refused, Wise grabbed a pipe wrench, followed 
Mrs. McDonald into her home, and struck her several times in the 
back of the head, killing her. 
</P>
<P>
	He stole Mrs. McDonald's money, jewelry and credit cards,  
trading some of the jewelry for cocaine and pawning the rest. In a 
confession to police, Wise said he was desperate for money. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise had been released from prison four years earlier after  
serving 13 years of a life sentence for shooting and killing Ralph 
Gianino Jr. during a $26 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to bother a third family,'' said Ralph Gianino  
III, the slain man's son. The death penalty wasn't an option when 
Wise was sentenced in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Thrill Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASTORIA, Ore. (AP) -- A judge has sentenced a man to two  
consecutive life prison terms for his role in beachfront thrill 
killings that police say were inspired by repeated viewings of the 
film ``In Cold Blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley Price, 24, will be eligible for parole in 30 years for  
his part in the 1997 slayings of a couple watching the sunrise in 
Seaside. Gabriella Goza, 26, and Frank Nimz Jr., 36, were shot in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say it was a random killing, inspired by the movie  
version of Truman Capote's book ``In Cold Blood,'' about the 1959 
slayings of four members of a Kansas farm family. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who was sentenced Wednesday, had claimed that admitted  
triggerman Jesse McAllister was the one who had an intense desire 
to kill someone just to see what it felt like. 
</P>
<P>
	Price said he attempted to talk his friend out of it, but didn't  
really take the fantasy seriously until it got out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended Price bought the gun used in the attack  
and knew full well of McAllister's intention as they walked on 
Seaside beach the morning of July 14, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who fled with McAllister to Mexico and was arrested a  
year after the slayings, escaped the death penalty because of a 
deal with Mexican authorities for his return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	McAllister, 21, who was stopped as he crossed into Texas from  
Mexico, confessed to being the triggerman and is serving two 
consecutive life terms in prison.

<HEADLINE> CNN Titans in Unusual On-Air Tiff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tensions between CNN President Rick Kaplan and  
``Moneyline'' host Lou Dobbs surfaced in an unusual on-air tiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs appeared angry last Thursday when he was ordered to cut  
off his financial news program to return to live coverage of 
President Clinton speaking at a news conference in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton,''  
Dobbs said on the air before the shift. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, a Kaplan deputy issued a memo stating that CNN's  
executive producers have authority to break into the ``Moneyline'' 
broadcast for breaking news or live coverage. A second memo on 
Monday noted that the CNN producer should consult with 
``Moneyline'' executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs, who is also president of the financial network CNNfn, and  
Kaplan did not want to talk about what happened, spokeswomen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show runs from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Eastern time on  
weekdays.

<HEADLINE> Quayle: Bush Backers Making Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle accused establishment Republicans  
on Wednesday of putting polls over principles and making a 
``colossal mistake'' by stampeding to presidential contender George 
W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this thing is just a rush to judgment,'' said the  
former vice president who trails far behind front-runner Bush in 
his bid for the White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Quayle also proposed  
a missile defense system for U.S. allies in Asia to serve as a 
``clear warning'' against potential Chinese aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	And he accused the Clinton administration of ignoring evidence  
of Chinese espionage in the United States, though acknowledging 
that spying took place during his White House stay. Quayle, who 
served under Bush's father from 1989-93, said the administration 
didn't know about the espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had we known, we would have done something about it,'' Quayle  
said. ``Our first response would not have been to sweep it under 
the rug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush, a second-term governor of Texas, also has  
criticized Clinton by saying ``only one administration knew'' of 
the espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the FBI has been investigating espionage at nuclear  
labs since the early 1980s. The most prominent case dating from the 
Reagan administration, the one involving former Los Alamos 
scientist Wen Ho Lee did not come to light until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is hoping to emerge from early primary fights as the  
leading conservative candidate, but he is having trouble raising 
money. He also must overcome doubts about his ability to win a 
general election after being the butt of jokes during the Bush 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor announced Wednesday that more than half of  
the 222 Republican House members have endorsed him. Supporter Henry 
Bonilla, a GOP lawmaker from Texas, called the development a ``kick 
in the gut'' to Bush rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Quayle shrugged it off, saying party leaders are so eager to  
win that they're rallying behind a candidate they know relatively 
little about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it shows that there is a genuine nervousness in the  
Republican Party and they're trying to go with polls rather than 
ideas -- and that is a colossal mistake. It may feel comfortable 
today, but down deep if you think you're going to win this on what 
public opinion polls say 18 months out, I beg to differ,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you show nervousness like that,'' he said, ``you are in  
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker replied, ``People know a lot about  
Governor Bush. They know he has made education his top priority. 
They know he has cut taxes. They know he cut welfare. And they know 
he has been able to unite people and build a consensus on 
conservative principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said Bush's endorsements could backfire.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he's going to run a status-quo, establishment kind of  
campaign, I think he's going to be in for a rude awakening, because 
Republican voters are looking for action, looking for commitment, 
looking for bold ideas,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments may signal a new route of attack against Bush: link  
him to Congress, which is considered weak and wavering by many GOP 
primary voters. Other GOP campaigns could soon follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will make his first campaign trip next month, a  
high-profile journey to Iowa and New Hampshire that rivals hope 
will expose political weaknesses. Lamar Alexander, who is competing 
against Bush for moderate voters, recently called Bush ``completely 
untested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle accused congressional Republicans of forsaking  
conservative principles to avoid confrontations that might hurt 
them in the polls. ``Congress must focus on tax cuts, choice in 
education ... a missile defense system, not busting the spending 
caps,'' Quayle said. ``This is our agenda and it's barely being 
talked about on the Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in an address to conservative leaders, Quayle received  
several rounds of applause when he railed against the 
establishment. ``If you want to win, wake up, folks!'' he said. 
``The establishment does not win elections when they campaign for 
the Republican Party. Conservatives win elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that Bush recently said global warming was a problem.  
``I'm not so sure it will be a popular position in the Republican 
Party to be on the side of (Vice President) Al Gore on 
environmental issues.'' Gore, the Democratic presidential 
front-runner, has warned that rising temperatures threaten the 
world's environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who in the past said he ``wasn't sure of the science'' on  
global warming, said in a statement released Wednesday that there 
is disagreement on the cause and impact of global warming but ``the 
issue should be taken seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On China, he said Congress should postpone debate on extending  
most-favored-nation status to Beijing until the United States sorts 
through the espionage fallout. And he said Beijing is not ready to 
enter the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kids' Charity Execs Stole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Authorities are looking into allegations  
that executives of the worldwide charity Feed the Children took 
home boxes of food, clothing and household goods that had been 
donated to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	After a four-month investigation, WTVF-TV broadcast video of  
charity executives, their assistants and their relatives using 
dollies to wheel boxes -- several at a time -- from a warehouse to 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	After being tipped by the station, Tennessee Bureau of  
Investigation agents on Monday raided a Nashville office of the 
charity and the homes of six administrative employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The agents carried out boxes and bags of brand-name clothing --  
some with tags still on -- shoes, videos, blankets and food they 
suspect were donated for the needy. One box had ``Merry Christmas 
to me'' written on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Feed the Children's executive director, Steve Highfill, was one  
of the employees shown on the video. He told WTVF he saw nothing 
wrong with allowing administrative staff to take donated items. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're taking stuff home and giving their little brother a  
pair of shoes or some food, I don't have much to say about that,'' 
he said. ``If that's wrong, fine. I don't think so and I don't 
think people are going to think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Jones, president and founder of Feed the Children, said  
Wednesday that charity policy clearly prohibits employees from 
taking donated items. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Oklahoma City, where Feed the Children  
is headquartered, Jones said the incident is ``the greatest loss'' 
to his relief agency since he founded it 20 years ago. He added 
that the charity is conducting its own investigation, as are 
Oklahoma City authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, Jones said, he hired investigators when  
tipped that workers in Oklahoma City were taking items. They were 
arrested and prosecuted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not take questions from reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	WTVF's investigation began after workers at the warehouse told  
the station that administrative employees were using the warehouse 
as a personal shopping mall. Warehouse workers said they were not 
allowed to take any booty. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to believe it. When I started, I didn't want to  
believe it,'' warehouse worker Mike Brewer said.

<HEADLINE> Poultry Producers File Vitamin Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Tyson Foods and more than a half-dozen  
other U.S. poultry producers filed a federal lawsuit alleging a 
worldwide conspiracy among vitamin producers to fix prices for a 
popular animal-feed supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit makes claims similar to those in a federal criminal  
case that resulted in a multimillion dollar settlement last week. 
It seeks to recover threefold the wrongful costs incurred by 
poultry producers, but does not list a dollar amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we are the largest consumer of choline cloride in  
North America. As far as the actual amount we're out, we believe it 
is significant,'' Tyson general counsel Les R. Baledge said today. 
He declined to give a damage estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Fayetteville, alleges that  
Germany's BASF AG and other companies engaged in a 10-year 
conspiracy to fix, raise and stabilize the price of choline, 
commonly known as vitamin B4, and to divide up the world market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Choline is one of a number of vitamins essential to the diets of  
poultry. It assists in the transportation of fat from the liver and 
also affects certain nerve functions. 
</P>
<P>
	BASF agreed last week to plead guilty and pay $225 million in  
fines for a worldwide price-fixing scheme involving vitamins A, B2, 
B5, C, E and Beta Carotene. Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. 
Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd., also agreed to plead guilty and pay a $500 
million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Swiss vitamin manufacturer Lonza AG and five U.S.  
executives also agreed to plead guilty in a worldwide vitamin 
price-fixing conspiracy. Lonza, which is to pay a $10.5 million 
fine, was charged in a scheme for vitamin B3. The five executives 
were charged with plotting to fix prices and allocate customers and 
sales of vitamin B4. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the civil side of the justice department's criminal  
indictment,'' said Fayetteville lawyer John Elrod, representing 
poultry producers Simmons Food Inc. and Peterson Farms Inc. ``We're 
tracking on the civil side on behalf of the people who lost 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends a conspiracy existed from at least January  
1988 through September 1998 among companies involved in producing 
and distributing the food supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that the companies agreed to allocate  
customers, then either refrained from submitting bids or submitted 
collusive, non-competitive or rigged bids to supply choline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intended result of this conduct was to leave the customer  
with only one non-competitive bid from which to choose, and to 
force the customer to purchase choline at the seller's inflated 
price,'' according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the conspiracy, the price of choline was 60 to  
100 percent higher than the prices before and after the conspiracy, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends that the North American market was divided  
and allocated to Bioproducts Inc. of Akron, Ohio; Highland, 
Ill.-based DuCoa, which was a partnership operated by E.I. Dupont 
de Nemours Inc. and ConAgra Inc.; and the Chinook Group, 
headquartered in Toronto, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets, according to the lawsuit, were divided among  
BASF; Azko Nobel Inc. of the Netherlands; and UCB SA of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Others named in the lawsuit include Japan-based Mitsui and Co.  
and affiliates of the various companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the antitrust violations alleged in the suit, it

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 171.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded strongly today as  
bargain-hunters returned to a turbulent market following the 
biggest losing streak since late March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 171.07 points, a rise  
of 1.6 percent, to close at 10,702.16. At one point late in the 
session, the Dow was up 190. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into today's session, the Dow had fallen four straight  
sessions, including a combined 298-point drop in the past two days, 
and was off 5 percent from its May 13 record of 11,107.19. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was oversold,'' said Tony Dwyer, chief equity  
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. ``It's ready for a bounce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 20.23 to 1,304.63, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 45.36 to 2,426.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York  
Stock Exchange, with 1,498 down, 1,477 up and 557 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 868.39 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
816.28 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 7.50 to 624.84, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.82 to 782.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.96 to 435.41.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors today returned to some conventional favorites that  
have faltered in recent sessions. IBM, which had tumbled along with 
the entire technology sector, was the strongest of the Dow 
components today. A 2-for-1 split of Big Blue's stock takes effect 
after the close of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks have been hit particularly hard as concerns  
about potentially higher interest rates drew investors away from 
the high-priced shares that have fed the market's massive gains. 
Through Tuesday, the Nasdaq index had tumbled 10 percent from its 
all-time record of 2,652.05, set April 26. A decline of 10 percent 
or more is viewed as a ``correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, several industry leaders continued to languish. Intel,  
which unveiled a new chip design today, slipped throughout the 
session. But some Internet-related shares rebounded from recent 
losses, including search engine Yahoo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stocks were hurt by panic selling,'' Dwyer said. ``They  
were ready to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recent slump of Internet stocks, coupled with the market's  
losing streak, created a tough climate for the initial public 
offering of DLJ Direct, the online brokerage unit of Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. Its shares rose, but failed to triple or 
quadruple in the manner of previous Internet IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, DLJ's debut mirrored the IPO Tuesday of  
barnesandnoble.com. The new issue disappointed some traders with a 
modest 27 percent gain in its first day of trading. Today, however, 
barnesandnoble.com made some solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's market gained a measure of support from a Commerce  
Department report that showed orders for big-ticket manufactured 
goods fell an unexpectedly sharp 2.3 percent last month. The figure 
offered new evidence that the economy is not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sectors rebounded today. Drug stocks were higher, led by  
Bristol Myers Squibb. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking and financial stocks also rose, led by Merrill Lynch,  
which led the sector amid fresh rumors it will be acquired by Chase 
Manhattan Bank. Both companies denied the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market seemed to return to the stocks it liked earlier  
this year,'' said A. Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon 
Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Benefitting from a slight gain in oil prices Tuesday, shares of  
Dow component Exxon rose. Mobil and Chevron also gained as 
investment bank Schroder Wertheim, which increased its rating on 
the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some market weakness was still apparent today as declining  
stocks outnumbered advancers for much of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the healthiest of rallies,'' Acuff said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Voting on Union Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Berry pickers employed by the  
nation's biggest strawberry grower voted on whether to unionize 
Wednesday in a key test of a United Farm Workers effort to regain 
the clout it had when Cesar Chavez was its leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, the UFW committed itself to winning a union vote  
at Coastal Berry Co., hoping a victory there would create momentum 
throughout California's farm fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry growers have historically been among the most  
resistant to union organizing. And despite a promise from Coastal 
Berry not to block unions, the campaign has been plagued by 
setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW organizers have struggled to win the trust of workers  
and faced competition from a rival union backed by Coastal Berry 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strawberry industry wants to stop UFW progress at all  
costs, and Coastal Berry could be a crucial turning point for the 
workers statewide,'' UFW spokesman Marc Grossman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal's 1,500 employees in the farming communities of Oxnard,  
Watsonville and Salinas were voting by secret ballot Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Their choices: representation by the UFW, its rival, the 
Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker Committee, or no union at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	In Watsonville, pickers briefly left oceanside fields laden with  
fat red strawberries to place their ballots under the close watch 
of state labor officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballot count was delayed Wednesday night as officials  
checked to make sure all voters were currently employed by the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry President Ernie Farley has said the company is  
neutral on whether its workers should be represented by the UFW or 
the Farm Worker Committee. The UFW has said its rival is a sham 
union that doesn't have the workers' interests at heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry's pickers are treated better than some in the  
berry fields. They earn an average wage of between $7.50 and $8.50 
an hour and have full medical and dental benefits for themselves 
and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty much in the top of the industry. The dependents  
get health benefits even if they live in Mexico,'' Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union fell into the doldrums even before the 1993 death of  
its legendary founder, Chavez, who inspired thousands of 
farmworkers to join up in the 1970s and '80s. Union membership had 
declined to 20,000 at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a membership drive begun in 1995, membership is up to  
27,000 now.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoreans React to Train Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuadoreans see a countrywoman and her  
three children killed by a train in the United States as a symbol 
of the desperation that forces thousands of them to live -- and die 
-- abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Toledo, 46, who left for the United States a year and half  
ago looking for work, died under an Amtrak train in Fairfield, 
Conn. on Tuesday as she was trying to snatch her 10-year-old son, 
Jose, out of the way of the train. 
</P>
<P>
	Her three other children raced after her and were struck as  
well. Jose lost his left leg and is in critical condition with head 
injuries in Fairfield's Bridgeport Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death of this woman and her children is due to the  
desperation we Ecuadoreans feel to leave the country because of 
economic problems. There is no work here,'' Quito shopkeeper 
Bernardo Delgado said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose was so badly injured that even relatives were unable to  
identify him, and he was initially identified as his younger 
brother, Angel, who was 6. Also killed was Carlos, 12, and Pedro, 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the family's death filled the front pages of Ecuador's  
newspapers Wednesday. Reporters were trying to locate Jose's 
father, Carlos Luis Urgiles, who is thought to be in Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuadoreans expressed sorrow at a desperate single mother dying  
with her family at night far from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation of the country gets worse by the day,'' said Dr.  
Nolberto Devia, a physician at a private clinic. ``Everyone wants 
to leave. If I were a young man, I would also try my luck abroad 
like this mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This poor Andean nation of 12 million inhabitants is mired in a  
deep economic recession that President Jamil Mahuad has called its 
worst in 70 years. Inflation may top 100 percent this year and the 
economy is expected to contract 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment stands at 15 percent of the work force but an  
additional 57 percent are underemployed, meaning they have only 
part-time work or their pay does not meet their basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators in Connecticut are trying to figure out why the  
family was walking on the trestle over a two-lane road at 2:20 a.m. 
Rescuers found backpacks, books, report cards and a Bible strewn 
among the body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	A local newspaper reported that Toledo had quit her job as a  
university janitor recently because raising her four children alone 
and holding a demanding job had become too much for her. 
</P>
<P>
	She had moved out of her apartment and into a YMCA family  
shelter last week, the Hartford Courant reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo was not an American citizen but was living there legally,  
Julia's sister Maria Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a group of Ecuadorean immigrants held a vigil for  
Jose outside Bridgeport Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Airline Relaxes Cell Phone Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines is relaxing its rules requiring  
passengers to keep their cellular phones and laptop computers 
turned off before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	As of June 1, Delta passengers will be able to use cell phones  
on the ground as long as the plane is parked at the gate and its 
boarding door is open, the Atlanta-based airline said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Captains will also be allowed to OK use of laptops and cell  
phones during extended waits on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines restrict onboard use of cell phones and laptops because  
they may interfere with the plane's electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta agreed to the rule changes at the behest of passengers who  
have grown increasingly dependent on their techno toys, said Delta 
spokeswoman Kay Horner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cell phones are more and more a part of our life,'' she said.  
``They wanted to use them more on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulations prohibit any use of cellular phones during  
flight and use of laptops below 10,000 feet. Airlines are allowed 
to set their own policies for use on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs Square Buffalo Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- On the day after his Maple Leafs rebounded  
for yet another crucial win in the Stanley Cup playoffs, Toronto 
coach Pat Quinn had more to worry about than the groin of Buffalo 
Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to try to get better, and we need to get better,''  
Quinn said Wednesday on the eve of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference 
finals. ``We've got to be better. If we don't, we won't survive 
this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Quinn's protestations, the Leafs did OK in Game 2,  
jumping to an early 2-0 lead and winning 6-3 to even the series 
heading into Thursday night's game at Marine Midland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most goals the Sabres have allowed in the playoffs,  
and the only ones Buffalo got against goalie Curtis Joseph came on 
the vaunted power play. The Sabres have scored at least one 
power-play goal in each of their 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew they were going to come out hard, and they did,'' said  
Sabres center Curtis Brown, who leads the team with five playoff 
goals. ``But it's not about who wins the first game or the second 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's who's the first team to get to four. With Dom out, we  
can't focus on things that we can't control. Those are intangibles 
that you have to work through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that is the biggest intangible by far. One only needs to  
look back to Buffalo's first-round series sweep of Ottawa, which 
had finished second in the conference and entered the postseason 
with high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek intimidated the Senators, helping to hold their leading  
scorer, Alexei Yashin, without a point. Buffalo won three one-goal 
games, and Hasek pitched a shutout in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	And no matter what the coaches say, the absence of Hasek has had  
an effect on this series, and not just because the media has said 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard to play against Buffalo because of Hasek,''  
said Leafs defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich. ``We make like 50 shots 
and he always stops them all. It's hard to score on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hasek doesn't get better quickly, the Sabres will be  
hard-pressed to advance to the Stanley Cup finals for only the 
second time in team history. That they are unbeaten in five home 
games in the playoffs is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, the Dominator had some good news for his  
teammates. After medical consultation, he skated for a half-hour 
and liked how he was progressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt pretty good,'' he said. ``I didn't do everything. I  
didn't stop too many pucks, but my skating was almost without pain. 
I feel closer to playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know with this injury I won't be 100 percent. I know that.  
But I've already played with the injury and I wasn't 100 percent. I 
feel I am very close to being in that position, not 100 percent, 
but ready to play and play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that might be just what the Sabres need to revert to form.  
This series was expected to be a tight-checking affair, and it 
hasn't been. The teams have combined for 18 goals in what has 
turned into something of a shooting match. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Hasek to confront, the explosive Leafs, who led the NHL  
in scoring during the regular season, have 10 goals against 
seldom-used backup goalie Dwayne Roloson. With Hasek back in there, 
maybe the Sabres will display their customary defensive style of 
play, if only to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just looking to get back to our game,'' said Sabres  
defenseman Jay McKee, who is a solid plus-7 in the playoffs. 
``We're not happy with that last one. I don't know if Toronto has 
gotten us off our game or if it's just us, but it's too 
run-and-gun.''

<HEADLINE> Memo: China Spying Found in 1984 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military intelligence assessment was short  
and to the point: China was improving its nuclear warheads by 
stealing technology from the United States. The year: 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In language similar to that used in the Cox report 15 years  
later, the Defense Intelligence Agency stated that China is ``now 
deriving'' benefits ``from both overt contact with U.S. scientists 
and technology and the covert acquisition of U.S. technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Increased access to this technology and continued Chinese  
efforts will in the 1980s and early 1990s show up as qualitative 
warhead improvements,'' concludes the DIA document known as an 
``estimative brief.'' It is entitled ``Nuclear Weapons Systems In 
China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the blame game escalated Wednesday between Democrats and  
Republicans over alleged Chinese espionage, the National Security 
Archive -- a private Washington group -- released the document it had 
obtained from the DIA through the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the document says people at DIA, and I presume others  
in the intelligence community, understood exactly how the Chinese 
were going to go about improving their arsenal,'' said Jeffrey 
Richelson, who is compiling a 15,000-page collection of 
declassified documents on U.S.-Chinese relations for the archive. 
</P>
<P>
	Richelson said he doubts the DIA memo, dated April 24, 1984, got  
to the National Security Council inside the Reagan White House. But 
``certainly key officials in the government would understand the 
essence of the observation about how the Chinese would go about 
improving their nuclear arsenal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The assessment stated: ``There is evidence that the Chinese have  
been successful in assimilating into their nuclear weapons program 
United States technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In some areas, the gap between United States and Chinese  
nuclear warhead technology may begin to narrow,'' the estimate 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to move the blame for China's theft of U.S. nuclear  
secrets away from a Democratic White House and onto the Reagan and 
Bush administrations, Democrats on Capitol Hill circulated a 
document entitled ``What President Bush Knew.'' The five-page 
summary reviews dire warnings about Chinese espionage and security 
lapses at U.S. nuclear laboratories going back to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The summary juxtaposed Texas Gov. George W. Bush's strong  
criticism Tuesday of President Clinton with a lengthy recitation of 
incidents from the 1980s and early 1990s about Chinese nuclear 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cox report was released, Bush said, ``There is only  
one administration that has been given the news'' about Chinese 
espionage at weapons labs ``and that's the Clinton administration. 
The interesting question is when did they know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' summary targeting the Texas governor's father  
pointed to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Newspaper reports that Chinese intelligence agents had stolen  
nuclear weapons secrets from the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	--A lengthy series of reports by the General Accounting Office --  
Congress' investigative branch -- detailing security problems at the 
weapons labs that made them vulnerable to espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' summary also highlighted a recently published  
comment by Bush administration national security adviser Brent 
Scowcroft that lab security was not an issue when he was in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``If allegations of Chinese spying had been widely known, they  
would have been a major issue in the Clinton-Gore campaign in 
1992,'' responded Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Gov. Bush. ``They 
were not'' an issue ``because it's not true'' that the allegations 
were widely known. 
</P>
<P>
	``America deserves leaders who are honest, not partisans who  
attempt to spin their way out of responsibility for a major 
embarrassment that happened on their watch,'' said Hughes.

<HEADLINE>  Miss Botswana Wins Universe Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- A Botswana woman late Wednesday  
became the last Miss Universe of the century, winning the crown in 
her country's first-ever entry in the beauty pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	Mpule Kwelagobe, 19, reacted with shock, surprise then joy at  
the crowning in this Caribbean country. 
</P>
<P>
	She was announced the winner after responding to a final  
question on whether Miss Universe should be allowed to continue her 
reign if she got pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I think it should not in any way interrupt her  
duties. She should celebrate her femininity,'' Kwelagobe said to 
wild applause and yells of approval from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	In second place was Miss Philippines, Miriam Quiambao, a  
23-year-old physical therapist. Miss Spain, 24-year-old Diana 
Nogueria, took third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Puerto Rico, 23-year-old Brenda Liz Lopez, was named most  
photogenic and the Miss Congeniality award went to Marisa Ferreira, 
a 21-year-old student from Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwelagobe's prize means she no longer will she have to describe  
herself as ``unemployed,'' as she did on the pageant entrance list, 
where she said she was awaiting further studies and hoped to become 
an electronic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Her prize includes a $40,000 salary for the year's reign, along  
with a mountain of cash, a plush apartment in New York City for the 
year and a bonanza of designer clothes, jewelry, luggage and 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	She was chosen from five finalists, including beauty queens from  
the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, and Venezuela. Ten 
semifinalists were chosen, out of 83 contestants, after parading in 
swimsuits and evening gowns by designer Diane von Furstenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Their winner was announced by host Jack Wagner -- whose ``Melrose  
Place'' ended its long run on American television on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowning occurred in a converted U.S. Army helicopter  
hangar, a 3,900-seat auditorium that was sold out for the gala 
being broadcast live to 80 countries by CBS. The faded green 
corrugated iron building's interior has been converted into a 
lavish auditorium featuring artwork by Trinidadians. 
</P>
<P>
	Pier One, a private entertainment center, was the site of  
demonstrations by hundreds of people Tuesday demanding an 
explanation of how a worker with the Trinidad and Tobago Electrical 
Commission was electrocuted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonilal Hardeen, 31, was killed by a surge of electricity that  
the electric company said appeared to come from a standby 
generator. 
</P>
<P>
	Among judges was world heavyweight boxing champion Evander  
Holyfield, Buffalo Bills linesman Bruce Smith and Sirio Maccioni, 
owner of New York's chic Le Cirque restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on hand was U.S. business mogul Donald Trump, who owns the  
pageant with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Most ordinary Trinidadians seem to relish the entire affair,  
which has also reinforced admiration for a hometown heroine, 
outgoing Miss Universe Wendy Fitzwilliam.

	India Launches Kashmir Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Indian air force jets and helicopters  
fired on intruders in the disputed Kashmir province today, marking 
the most serious escalation of fighting since both countries tested 
nuclear weapons last year. Indian officials charge that about 600 
infiltrators -- allegedly Afghan mercenaries supported by Pakistani 
forces -- moved into the Indian-controlled Himalayan region earlier 
this month, posing a threat to Indian supply lines in the Himalayan 
state.	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz immediately issued a 
stiff warning to India. ``We are retaliating and we will 
retaliate,'' he warned.

	Russia Demands End To NATO Strikes

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Warning that the growing number of alliance  
attacks could destroy any chance of a political settlement, Russia 
demanded an immediate halt to NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia 
today. Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on Kosovo, said 
he would press for at least a temporary and immediate halt to the 
airstrikes during talks today with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. ``The result of the 
upcoming negotiations on Wednesday should be a stop to missile and 
bomb strikes on Yugoslavia,'' he told reporters.

	NATO To Increase Kosovo Force  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After approving a plan to nearly  
double the size of a proposed peacekeeping force to roughly 50,000 
troops, NATO launched fierce air attacks against Yugoslavia today. 
The original NATO plan called for 28,000 troops. Diplomatic efforts 
including an American and a Russian envoy were also set to resume 
in Moscow today after the night of heavy attacks that Serbian media 
said included hits on Kosovo's capital, Pristina, and the northern 
city of Novi Sad. Sustained NATO pounding also was reported in 
central and southern regions of Yugoslavia.

	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's 12-year-old brother was  
reportedly questioned by the grand jury investigating the little 
girl's death. Burke Ramsey appeared before the panel last week, 
according to today's Denver Rocky Mountain News, which cited a 
family friend, and KUSA-TV. Boulder authorities would not comment 
on whether the boy appeared. However, authorities have said 
previously that Burke is considered a witness in the case. Burke 
was 9 when his sister was found beaten and strangled in the 
basement of the family's Boulder home in 1996, the day after 
Christmas.

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- For many Chinese, the U.S. congressional report  
alleging that China stole American weapons secrets was another 
unfriendly salvo from a nation that seems intent on turning China 
into the new enemy. From China's Foreign Ministry to people on the 
street, reaction was the same: the allegations were designed to 
divert attention from NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia on May 7. Some couldn't see what the fuss was about, 
saying all nations spy. Others doubted that the United States would 
be so lax as to let another country steal its most prized nuclear 
weapons secrets.

	Meningitis Vaccine Study Released  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An analysis in The Journal of the American  
Medical Association shows that college students living on campus 
are about three times more likely to contract meningitis infections 
than those who don't. The findings prompted the association to 
renew its 1997 recommendation that all college students consider 
getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease, which can cause 
meningitis or an overwhelming and often fatal blood infection 
called meningococcemia. Meningococcal disease afflicts 125 to 175 
college students annually and kills 15 to 20 of them, according to 
public health estimates.

homers for the first time in team history. Greg Maddux, who has not 
won since April 29, allowed five hits in seven innings and left 
leading 2-0. He wound up with a no-decision and avoided his first 
four-game losing streak in three seasons.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Charge Involving Fetus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A state appeals court Wednesday threw out  
the case against a woman accused of trying to drink her fetus to 
death, ruling that she could not be charged with attempted murder 
because a fetus is not a human being. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case closely watched by civil libertarians and people on  
both sides of the abortion debate, the 2nd District Court of 
Appeals ruled in favor of Deborah Zimmerman, whose daughter was 
born in 1996 with a blood-alcohol level of 0.199 percent, twice the 
level considered intoxicated under Wisconsin law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The term `human being' was not intended to refer to an unborn  
child and Deborah's prenatal conduct does not constitute attempted 
first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless 
injury,'' the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman spent the day her daughter was born drinking at a  
bar, building a blood-alcohol level exceeding 0.30 percent at the 
time of birth. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hospital, Ms. Zimmerman allegedly told a nurse: ``I'm  
just going to go home and keep drinking and drink myself to death 
and I'm going to kill this thing because I don't want it anyways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman's baby was born limp and pallid. Ms. Zimmerman's  
lawyer, Sally Hoelzel, said the girl -- now 3 years old and living 
in foster care -- is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman has yet to stand trial. She took her case to the  
appeals court after a trial-level judge refused to dismiss the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman contended that her alcohol abuse during pregnancy  
was directed toward her own body and the fetus she carried -- not 
another human being. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities argued that Ms. Zimmerman should be prosecuted for  
attempted murder based on the state's ``born alive'' rule. The law 
says a person can be charged with murder if he or she harms a 
pregnant woman and her fetus is born alive and then dies. 
Prosecutors argued that the law should be extended to attempted 
murder if a fetus is born with injuries but survives. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruled Wednesday that that was not the  
Legislature's intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman has been in prison for violating her bail  
conditions in the case and is due for release in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zimmerman's attorneys and civil libertarians had argued that  
if the state succeeded, women would risk criminal charges if they 
did anything -- such as smoking or drinking -- that could harm a 
fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Heller, litigation director for the Center for  
Reproductive Law and Policy, which handled Ms. Zimmerman's defense, 
said there have been many rulings that a fetus is not a human 
being, including the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision 
legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, ruled that a viable  
fetus is a person under a statute punishing child abuse, he said. 
The court did not apply it to murder laws in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Lyons, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life,  
said the Wisconsin appeals court is ``behind the times'' because 
Wisconsin has passed laws to protect fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court had earlier passed the case along to the  
Wisconsin Supreme Court without ruling. But the case was sent back 
to the appeals court after the high court tied 3-3.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Casts Himself As Outsider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle once ranked near the top of the  
Republican establishment. Now he is campaigning against it, 
complaining about its poll-driven ``rush to judgment'' in favor of 
George W. Bush for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In Quayle's campaign script, the Texas governor is the  
establishment candidate, in the early lead because nervous 
Republicans are behaving like Bill Clinton and shaping their 
choices to the public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle casts himself as the outsider even though he got his  
national start as a ranking insider, in four years as vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions from conservative activists still are addressed to  
``Mr. Vice President,'' an echo of his term as No. 2 to President 
George Bush, father of the current GOP leader. Not front-runner, 
Quayle contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can talk all you want to about polls and all this happy  
nonsense, who the front-runner is, but you're not going to know who 
the true front-runner is until they vote in Iowa, on February 7,'' 
he said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press in the 
conference room of his own pollster's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's dispute with candidate-rating polls is understandable;  
they rank Bush far ahead of him, and Elizabeth Dole second on the 
list of 11 prospects for the 2000 nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``This presidential campaign, like most presidential campaigns,  
is going to come down to a choice between the establishment and a 
conservative,'' Quayle said. He said he and Bush will be the GOP 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush harvesting endorsements -- most of the GOP governors  
and more than half the Republicans in Congress -- and far ahead in 
campaign fund raising, Quayle and the rest of the entries have to 
slow the train if they are to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle insists that he will, that he can prove himself a winner  
in the opening 2000 primaries. Win, he said, and the past setbacks 
and stumbles will not count any more. Not even the Quayle jokes, 
which he insists do not bother him and will not hurt him. ``Jokes 
don't determine. Election issues do, ideas do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the laughing matter of late-night television certainly has  
not helped his image. His counter is that it proves he can take 
hits, get up and keep fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans today, they have become captivated by polls,''  
Quayle said. ``I think it shows that there is a genuine nervousness 
in the Republican Party and they're trying to go with the polls 
rather than ideas and that is a colossal mistake. ... I think that 
this thing is just a rush to judgment and shows that Republicans 
are nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What they are nervous about is winning the White House in 2000,  
after two Democratic terms. And about defending their narrow 
control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Bush soared in the polls, even before his landslide  
re-election as governor, he began reaping endorsements and rolling 
up campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle prefaced his own campaign with a 30-state, 70-candidate  
drive for Republican congressional candidates in 1996, the kind of 
effort that can gain allies for a presidential candidate. But in 
the endorsements game, Bush is the faraway leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't even really know where he stands, because he  
hasn't said where he stands on these national issues, he hasn't 
even campaigned yet,'' Quayle said. ``He hasn't defined himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush describes himself as a compassionate conservative. He has  
not been silent, answering questions, if cautiously. He has a 
record in five years as governor. Quayle discounted that, saying he 
wants to hear Bush on national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what kind of a campaign he's going to run,''  
Quayle said. ``I'm not even sure he knows what kind of a campaign 
he's going to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is, indeed, untested as a national candidate. That changes  
next month. Early favorites have fallen before. For Quayle to gain 
headway, that would have to happen again, and there is no guarantee 
that if it did, he would climb past the field. He has competition 
on the GOP right, and his initial campaign finance report showed 
that he spent $1 million in raising $2.1 million, compared with 
Bush's $7.6 million. ``We'll be adequately financed to get our 
message out,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can win,'' he told about 80 conservatives at the Washington  
headquarters of Americans for Tax Reform. ``If you're going to let 
the establishment take over, it might get you through the next 
poll, but it's not going to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm tired of losing.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Leader Urges Fight Vs. Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged  
the world's major powers today to fulfill years of promises to 
reduce global poverty and boost economic growth so the world's 3 
billion poor people can have the chance of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the fears of a global recession recede, there is a danger  
that the continuing economic crisis afflicting many countries may 
be overlooked,'' Annan said in a letter to German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder, host of a June 18-20 summit of Russia and the 
seven leading industrialized nations in Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general made clear that he wants the so-called  
Group of Eight to take concrete action to ensure that the bulk of 
the world's population is not left ``on the margin of today's 
liberalized global economy, living in abject poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called for more balanced and higher economic growth to open  
export markets that developing countries need for their economic 
recovery. He urged governments to reverse a nearly 40-year decline 
in development assistance, and also called on the G-8 to take 
further measures to strengthen the international financial system 
to prevent another global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Marta Mauras, director of the secretary-general's office, said  
Annan is concerned that the economic crisis is ``deeper and more 
pervasive in its magnitude than we had anticipated'' -- with growing 
inequalities between rich and poor and a slowdown in global 
economic growth from 3.6 percent in 1996 to 1.9 percent projected 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the international community's repeated commitments to  
reduce global poverty, Annan noted in the letter that 3 billion 
people still live on the margins of subsistence with little hope of 
a better life for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial crisis which swept Asia, Russia and Brazil caused  
a recession in Latin America, left some Asian countries with 
dramatically lower living standards and Africa barely able to 
sustain its already low income level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The present ``sluggish'' economic growth rate is not only making  
it impossible to eradicate poverty but ``is also aggravating the 
imbalance in trade among the leading industrial powers, and thereby 
threatening the stability of the international financial system'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To help spur economic recovery, Annan urged the major powers to  
boost output and open markets, to continue the momentum to reform 
the global financial system, to reduce instability in capital 
markets, and to include representatives of developing nations in 
deliberations on a new global financial architecture.

<HEADLINE>  Avs Look for Missing Sakic, Fleury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Where have you gone, Joe Sakic? And you, Theo  
Fleury? 
</P>
<P>
	While the Colorado Avalanche were forging a five-game playoff  
winning streak, no one seemed to notice the performanc of two of 
their most prolific scorers. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Avalanche bowed to the Dallas Stars 4-2 Monday  
night to square the Western Conference final series at one game 
apiece, the finger-pointing began. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's assist Monday night was his first point in the last  
five playoff games, dating back to Game 3 of the Detroit series on 
May 11. Sakic has just one goal and one assist in the last eight 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some great chances as a line,'' Fleury said Tuesday.  
``The puck is just not going in, for some reason. We're too good of 
players not to get on the scoreboard. We're doing all the right 
things. It's just a matter of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury said linemate Milan Hejduk, a rookie who scored his sixth  
goal of the playoffs Monday night, ``is playing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the series shifts to Denver for Game 3 tonight, the Avalanche  
were eager for Sakic and Fleury to regain their scoring touch, as 
well as for the defense to cut down on the number of shots faced by 
their goalie, Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas enjoyed a 45-19 advantage in shots on goal in Monday's  
game, including a 15-1 edge in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with desperation and a street-fighter mentality, the  
Stars delivered a message: This will be a long, tough playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a desperate team and they had to be,'' Fleury said,  
referring to the Stars' situation after losing Game 1 at home. 
``They threw everything at us in the third period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, this is the semifinals,'' Dallas center  
Guy Carbonneau said. ``You play each shift as if it were your 
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano scored goals in the Stars'  
dominating third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally found some seams and cracks through the defense to  
get to the net,'' Modano said. ``The second and third shots were 
finally there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said his team's more aggressive  
approach on Monday night was by design. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for us to play well, we have to press the pace,'' he  
said. ``It doesn't matter who we're playing. We've played two 
pretty good hockey games. Unfortunately, we lost the first one. I 
thought the difference was we played with desperation, knowing our 
status. We took some chances and we didn't get hurt by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing a team as good and as skilled as Colorado,  
you can take one of two attitudes -- either stand back and wait and 
hope that's going to work out, or press the issue. Obviously, by 
the way we played, we've made the decision to press the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a suffocating defensive game, Modano felt as if he  
was turned loose on Monday night. That observation drew a chuckle 
from Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might think he's been turned loose, but he's not,'' the  
coach said. ``This is just a different series. There just is no 
play in the neutral zone. It's in one end or the other. The games 
are very similar to the way we play against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the series against St. Louis, there was a tremendous amount  
of counter-attacking and neutral-zone play. In this series, there 
is none. So the feeling is that there's a lot of room because 
you're coming through that area between the two blue lines with a 
lot of speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain Colorado's somewhat lackluster play in Game 2,  
Hitchcock said, ``They got what they wanted. They got the split in 
our building. Now, we have to come in here and do that, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avs forward Peter Forsberg said his team must play ``much  
smarter, much harder. We have to be the ones that play desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lost forward Benoit Hogue for the remainder of the  
playoffs after he suffered torn knee ligaments in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, meanwhile, were hopeful of getting back center  
Stephane Yelle, their best penalty-killer. Yelle has been sidelined 
since May 3 with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably going to be a game-time decision,'' Colorado  
coach Bob Hartley said.

referring to the Stars' situation after losing Game 1 at home. 
``They threw everything at us in the third period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, this is the semifinals,'' Dallas center  
Guy Carbonneau said. ``You play each shift as if it were your 
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano scored goals in the Stars'  
dominating third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally found some seams and cracks through the defense to  
get to the net,'' Modano said. ``The second and third shots were 
finally there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said his team's more aggressive  
approach on Monday night was by design. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for us to play well, we have to press the pace,'' he  
said. ``It doesn't matter who we're playing. We've played two 
pretty good hockey games. Unfortunately, we lost the first one. I 
thought the difference was we played with desperation, knowing our 
status. We took some chances and we didn't get hurt by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing a team as good and as skilled as Colorado,  
you can take one of two attitudes -- either stand back and wait and 
hope that's going to work out, or press the issue. Obviously, by 
the way we played, we've made the decision to press the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a suffocating defensive game, Modano felt as if he  
was turned loose on Monday night. That observation drew a chuckle 
from Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might think he's been turned loose, but he's not,'' the  
coach said. ``This is just a different series. There just is no 
play in the neutral zone. It's in one end or the other. The games 
are very similar to the way we play against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the series against St. Louis, there was a tremendous amount  
of counter-attacking and neutral-zone play. In this series, there 
is none. So the feeling is that there's a lot of room because 
you're coming through that area between the two blue lines with a 
lot of speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain Colorado's somewhat lackluster play in Game 2,  
Hitchcock said, ``They got what they wanted. They got the split in 
our building. Now, we have to come in here and do that, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avs forward Peter Forsberg said his team must play ``much  
smarter, much harder. We have to be the ones that play desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lost forward Benoit Hogue for the remainder of the  
playoffs after he suffered torn knee ligaments in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, meanwhile, were hopeful of getting back center  
Stephane Yelle, their best penalty-killer. Yelle has been sidelined 
since May 3 with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably going to be a game-time decision,'' Colorado  
coach Bob Hartley said.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Try To Protect Surpluses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans, trying to protect their  
party's flanks on a volatile social issue, were poised Wednesday to 
push through legislation to put new obstacles in the way of 
spending government surpluses that come from Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers should have the confidence that the money they pay  
into Social Security and Medicare is used only for Social Security 
and Medicare, not bigger government or new spending,'' said House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Most House Democrats planned to vote for the GOP proposal,  
saying they believe it won't do much to help the nation's 
retirement system, but also couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this bill will probably not make things any worse, it  
won't make them any better,'' said Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	A stricter version of the legislation has been stalled in the  
Senate by Democrats' objections and faces a veto threat from the 
Clinton administration, however. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's budget surplus, expected to be $80 billion to $110  
billion, will come entirely from Social Security taxes. Under 
current projections, income tax surpluses aren't anticipated until 
after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The House GOP legislation would forbid Congress or the president  
from including Social Security surpluses in their budgeting for 
other programs of for tax cuts. Instead, it would have to be used 
to pay down the government's debt to private bondholders -- 
something economists say could help promote economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate votes on the House floor would be required for most  
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers could tap the money to help prepare Social Security or  
Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, for a cash 
shortfall expected after baby boomers, now in middle age, retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Skepticism has been growing, however, that Congress can pass a  
full-scale overhaul of the retirement programs in the politically 
charged year and a half before the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP drive to formally wall off Social Security surpluses is,  
in part, a fallback plan to counter Democrats' accusations that 
Republicans want to spend money that could help shore up the 
nation's retirement system on tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls, including polling by the Republican  
National Committee, indicate that Americans, by a double-digit 
margin, consider Democrats more likely than Republicans to make the 
right decisions about Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, RNC polling found that legislation to  
safeguard Social Security surplus dollars offered some cover, 
commanding strong support, with 87 percent of Americans in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is unclear whether the GOP strategy can succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version of the legislation is opposed by Democrats  
there and by the Clinton administration. It would lower the 
government's statutory debt limit, something administration 
officials say could hinder borrowing flexibility the Treasury 
Department needs in times of economic trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	And already, the conflict in Yugoslavia, with its $9  
billion-and-growing price tag, suggests that lawmakers are sure to 
face necessary -- or at least tempting -- exceptions to any new 
spending restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Democrats are challenging Republicans to set aside  
even more money, from expected income tax surpluses, for Medicare. 
The Clinton administration wants about $700 billion over 15 years 
for Medicare -- close to the same amount Republicans have budgeted 
for tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Springer Distributor Halts Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jerry Springer's bodyguards may be looking for  
new work. 
</P>
<P>
	The television distributor for ``The Jerry Springer Show''  
issued an order forbidding fights and has replaced some scheduled 
episodes with tamer shows. The actions are apparently another 
fallout from the recent school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will produce and distribute a program that we feel is  
responsible -- no violence, physical confrontation or profanity,'' 
Springer syndicator Studios USA said in a statement on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All three ingredients helped rocket Springer's talk show to the  
top of the ratings, with episodes often degenerating into 
hair-pulling, fists-flying donnybrooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer had no comment on the order, a spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	New programs will have to meet the no-violence standard and  
reruns will be edited to take out any fights, Studios USA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will inform stations that we are not providing any Jerry  
Springer program if these standards cannot be met,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios USA pulled scheduled Springer episodes titled ``Guess  
What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``I'm Proud to be a Prostitute'' this 
week. They were replaced with shows about tall people and street 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think you're seeing the reaction to Littleton, to last  
week's school shooting and the reaction to Jenny Jones,'' said 
Richard Kurlander, an expert on syndication for Petry TV. ``Those 
three are coming together to move a lot of people toward the 
center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a Michigan jury issued a $25 million verdict  
against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' for negligence in the shooting 
death of a homosexual guest who admitted a crush on another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prime-time shows depicting violence have been yanked  
from the air by networks since the Littleton school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer's studio, while reaping the benefits of his high  
ratings, has tried to rein him in before. A year ago, the studio 
ordered Springer to have security guards move faster to defuse 
explosive situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio blamed its own staff, however, for doing a poor job  
of policing the show.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Drop As Stocks Rebound / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds fell for the first time in four session as  
stocks rebounded from a steep slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/4 point,  
or $7.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.80 percent from 5.74 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasurys fell up to 9/32 point, and  
intermediate maturities fell between 13/32 point and 5/8 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds had been helped in recent days as stocks stumbled and  
investors sought a haven for their funds while they waited out the 
turbulence on Wall Street. But on Wednesday, as stocks bounced 
higher, with the Dow industrials jumping 171.07, money flowed out 
of Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.64 percent  
Wednesday as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point from Tuesday 
to 4.52 percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.79 percent as the 
discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields rose to 4.90 percent from Tuesday's auction,  
while the discount rose 0.03 percentage point from the auction to 
4.66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 7/32 point to 121 7/8. The average yield 
to maturity was rose to 5.37 percent from late Tuesday's 5.36 
percent.

<HEADLINE> NH House Votes To Add King Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The lawmaker leading the effort to create a  
permanent Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in New Hampshire said the 
civil rights leader's teachings helped him endure the 20-year wait 
for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can all learn this lesson from Martin Luther King --  
never give up,'' said Democratic Rep. Jim Splaine. ``From now on, 
kids from New Hampshire and everywhere will appreciate an important 
and great man and important and great principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state House approved a bill Tuesday that would make New  
Hampshire the 50th state to honor Martin Luther King Day each 
winter. The Senate is expected to pass the measure as well and the 
governor has said she will sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	A King holiday bill first came before the Legislature in 1979  
and has been introduced nearly every session since. The latest 
attempt failed by one vote in the House in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fear that the state's distinction as the only one without a  
permanent King holiday has harmed recruitment efforts at companies 
and prevented others from relocating here influenced lawmakers, 
said Rep. Lionel Johnson, D-Manchester, a sponsor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jean Shaheen joined about 75 people who gathered on the  
Statehouse steps after the vote. About a dozen clasped hands and 
sang ``We Shall Overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to congratulate all the people who worked so hard in  
passing this legislation, not just today but for the last 20 
years,'' Shaheen said. ``It confirms what our history is -- 
supporting all people equally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents objected to the way the birthdays of George Washington  
and Abraham Lincoln get lumped together as Presidents Day. They 
argued if Washington and Lincoln don't get recognized 
independently, why should King? (Technically, the federal and New 
Hampshire state holiday on the third Monday in February marks 
Washington's birthday, but it is popularly known as Presidents 
Day.) 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Donald White said he opposed the bill ``for the  
simple reason that the history of this great nation reflects the 
pride and energy of all our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers tried to fashion a compromise in 1991 with the  
creation of Civil Rights Day to honor ``the many people from a 
variety of cultural backgrounds who fought and died in the struggle 
to gain freedom and equality for all individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As successive Legislatures shot down the King bill, New  
Hampshire governors in the mid-1990s issued proclamations each year 
turning Civil Rights Day into Martin Luther King Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bill makes the change permanent.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed at Backwoods Party Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER FALLS, Pa. (AP) -- A 19-year-old man was arrested  
Wednesday in what police called the thrill killing of two women at 
a backwoods party spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Butler of Columbiana, Ohio, was charged with homicide hours  
after the victims' bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we know right now, there is no motive. It appears to  
be a kill-for-thrill type of thing,'' said state trooper Don Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarinda Collins, 21, of Rogers, Ohio, and Loretta Haines, 18,  
of East Palestine, Ohio, were both shot twice in the chest at close 
range and abandoned among empty beer cans not far from a strip mine 
near the Ohio state line. Ms. Haines had pellet wounds in her 
hands, indicating she threw her hands up in defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Police for years have chased teen-agers away from the hilltop  
clearing, which is a well-known party spot nestled among pine and 
maple trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Butler and a friend had persuaded the women to give  
them a ride to the spot for target shooting. The friend alerted 
police to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	No other charges were expected.

<HEADLINE> Small Businesses Offer Web Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses looking for success on the  
Internet should have functional, well-designed Web sites and 
advertising good enough to lure customers, a New England seafood 
retailer told a House committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanson Bros. Fresh Seafood of Portland, Maine, launched its Web  
site in February and already Internet sales account for 25 percent 
to 30 percent of the company's fresh fish and seafood business, 
said Brian Hanson, the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not sure what to expect from going online, but said he  
was lucky to get help from an Internet service provider that helped 
put him on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized that on our own we had very little chance of  
succeeding on the Internet,'' Hanson told the House Small Business 
Committee at a hearing on the effects of ``e-commerce'' on small 
businesses. ``We lacked technical skills, large capital for 
equipment and advertising and the time necessary to manage it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the Internet seemed a democratic forum for thought and  
dialogue, the advantage, as always, goes to the big players,'' 
Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But being on the Web has been beneficial, he said. The venture  
has created another avenue by which to sell the fish, broadened his 
customer base and generated sales in slower months to keep money 
flowing into the small, family owned business. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., said less than 2 percent of the 7  
million businesses with fewer than 100 employees operate online, 
compared with about 40 percent of companies with 1,000 or more 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the numbers ``mean that small businesses face the  
potential of losing market share to companies that are staying 
ahead of this new technological wave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Hill, assistant administrator for technology for the U.S.  
Small Business Administration, said the agency was working to 
encourage small businesses to take advantage of the Internet, where 
some 27 million purchases are made daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said consumer questions about privacy concerns prevail.  
</P>
<P>
	Alan Anderson, senior vice president for technical services at  
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said about 
three-quarters of customers do not complete transactions over the 
Internet because of such worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanson said 10 percent to 15 percent of his customers who order  
online will telephone later to make sure the order was received and 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while for people to feel comfortable,''  
he said.

	Milosevic Reportedly To Be Indicted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic has been  
indicted for atrocities in his homeland by the world tribunal that 
prosecutes war crimes, U.S. officials said. Speaking today on 
condition of anonymity, the officials said they were told the 
indictment was handed down yesterday by the U.N. body in The Hague, 
Netherlands. ``The decision has been made,'' one official said. The 
U.N. court's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, said she would make 
``an important announcement'' tomorrow. 

</P>
<P>
	Russia, Greece Want Bombing Stopped  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Greece called anew for a pause in the  
relentless NATO bombing of Yugoslavia today while Russia's senior 
mediator insisted the attacks be halted until there is a settlement 
in the Kosovo conflict. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou 
said a temporary suspension could promote diplomacy and eventual 
approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution on a settlement. 
Resisting, but also complimenting Greece for endorsing NATO's 
demands, including safe return of ethnic Albanian refugees, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the bombing would end 
only after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted them and 
started carrying out the demands. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate Backs War Funding  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today voted 77-21 against a move to  
cut off funding for U.S. participation in the NATO military 
campaign against Yugoslavia. Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., the sponsor, 
had told senators that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``has 
accomplished what he wanted to accomplish,'' driving ethnic 
Albanians out of Kosovo. ``I don't know what we're achieving in 
continuing to bomb.'' Senate leaders of both parties said they 
didn't want to undercut NATO and U.S. troops. Earlier, the Senate 
voted 60-40 to block cost-saving military base closings proposed 
for 2001.

	Court Nixes Charge Involving Fetus  
</P>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A state appeals court today threw out the  
case against a woman accused of trying to drink enough alcohol to 
kill her fetus, ruling that she could not be charged with attempted 
murder because a fetus is not a human being. In a case closely 
watched by civil libertarians and people on both sides of the 
abortion debate, the 2nd District Court of Appeals ruled in favor 
of Deborah Zimmerman, whose daughter was born in 1996 with a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.199 percent, twice the level considered 
intoxicated under Wisconsin law. ``The term `human being' was not 
intended to refer to an unborn child and Deborah's prenatal conduct 
does not constitute attempted first-degree intentional homicide and 
first-degree reckless injury,'' the court ruled.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Investing in S. Korean Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Goldman Sachs and Co. signed an  
agreement Thursday to invest $500 million in South Korea's Kookmin 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. investment firm agreed to buy $200 million in  
convertible bonds and $300 million in newly issued shares of 
Kookmin in June. 
</P>
<P>
	That will make Goldman Sachs the largest shareholder of Kookmin  
with a 16.6 percent stake. The South Korean government will be the 
second largest shareholder with a 6.9 percent stake. The remaining 
shares are owned by individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs said it will not take management control, but will  
appoint one board member and transfer advanced management know-how 
to Kookmin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share the vision of Kookmin's management team. We are  
looking forward to working together with Kookmin in its drive to 
become a world-class bank,'' said Henry Cornell, a managing 
director of Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialized in retail banking, Kookmin is South Korea's second  
largest bank with 580 branch offices and 11,800 employees. It has 
assets of about $94 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the second major foreign investment in South Korean  
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, British banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC signed a  
memorandum of understanding with the Korean government to acquire a 
70-percent stake in Seoulbank for $700 million.

<HEADLINE> Boston P.D. Sued For Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Eight white officers have filed a federal  
discrimination lawsuit against the Boston Police Department, saying 
it illegally schemed to promote black people to meet a quota. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers -- seven men and a woman -- say they were unfairly  
passed over for promotion while three black officers who received 
the same exam score got the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers allege the police department and state human  
resources officials targeted the cluster of three black officers 
for promotion as a way to maintain an internal quota for black 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They identified three black officers and decided they needed  
them to reach their goal, and excluded other officers by doing 
this,'' said lawyer Michael McLaughlin, who successfully challenged 
the race-based admissions policies of Boston's prestigious public 
exam schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Friday, alleges the department altered an  
original plan to promote 30 officers who took a sergeant's exam in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven officers scoring in the 90s and high 80s -- all  
white except for one -- were chosen. The department then tried to 
skip down the list to select three black officers who had scored 
84, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
	When the state Civil Service Commission said that practice was  
illegal, the department promoted six extra white officers who had 
scored 85 so that the three black officers scoring 84 could be 
chosen. No whites who scored 84 were promoted, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's legal advisor, Mary Jo Harris, said there was  
no manipulation, just a clearly stated goal to maintain minority 
representation in all levels of the force. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the department has the right to select candidates on  
the basis of race, language skills or other specialized training 
from a pool of same-scoring applicants.

<HEADLINE> Palmer Group Wants Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Pebble Beach golf course is close to being  
sold to a group that includes Arnold Palmer, Clint Eastwood and 
former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, according to 
Golfweek.com web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer confirmed Wednesday that the group is ``in serious  
negotiations'' to buy the prized Pebble Beach, Calif., properties 
from Lone Cypress Co., a Japanese partnership. Sources told the 
magazine that the deal is close to completion for a price of about 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Golfweek source who requested anonymity, Palmer  
met with some of his partners Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning 
at Bay Hill Club. Palmer's group also includes Richard J. Ferris, 
former chief executive officer of United Airlines and chairman of 
the PGA Tour Policy Board. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if his group is bidding on Pebble Beach, Palmer  
replied, ``Yes.'' He also confirmed Eastwood, Ueberroth and Ferris 
are part of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Palmer said the sale hasn't been finalized.  
</P>
<P>
	Lone Cypress Co., a partnership between Taiheiyo Club Inc. and  
Sumitomo Credit Services Ltd., bought the Pebble Beach Co. for $500 
million in 1992 from Japanese tycoon Minoru Isutani. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese banks have reportedly been pressuring Taiheiyo and  
Sumitomo to liquidate their assets to pay off rising debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Leach, managing director of Lone Cypress Co., could not be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pebble Beach Golf Links, the centerpiece of the Monterey  
Peninsula properties owned by Lone Cypress, will host the U.S. 
Amateur Championship this year and the 100th U.S. Open next year.

<HEADLINE> NFL To Give Loans for New Stadiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Acting on a new policy aimed at keeping teams  
from moving, the NFL today committed more than $200 million as 
collateral for stadiums in Philadelphia, Denver and Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes in response to the departure of two teams  
from Los Angeles and one each from Cleveland and Houston in 
1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crucial policy for the league to have strong footing in  
the largest media markets,'' said Philadelphia owner Jeffery Lurie, 
one of the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is the first to be committed under a bylaw enacted in  
March. The policy allows backing of up to 50 percent of private 
financing used for stadiums in the top six markets and 34 percent 
in those below that level. 
</P>
<P>
	New England and Philadelphia are in the first group and Denver  
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos owner Patrick Bowlen said he expects a commitment of $43  
million to $44 million, and the Eagles expect close to $50 million 
to $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots, recommitted to Massachusetts after a withdrawing a  
plan to move to Hartford, Conn., could get more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All three already have various commitments for public financing.  
</P>
<P>
	In other action on the final day of the league's spring meeting:  
</P>
<P>
	--The owners rejected a proposal to move kickoffs from the 30- to  
the 25-yard line to encourage returns. That first came up in March 
and was tabled but proponents were still unable to get a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	--The owners awarded the 2003 Super Bowl to San Diego, replacing  
San Francisco, which will not have a new stadium ready. South 
Florida was the only other contender. 
</P>
<P>
	--The league unveiled the technology for its new replay system,  
to be reinstated this fall after seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	--The owners extended NFL Europe for at least another season.  
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest impact may be the commitments toward stadiums.  
</P>
<P>
	For while the money is more collateral than loan, it will allow  
the teams involved to get a commitment for funds to build stadiums 
and to get them at lower interest rates than they might have. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also not likely to cost the teams involved. Money will be  
paid back from the 40 percent of club seat revenues that go to 
visiting teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, it's a continuation of a league policy. But never  
before has the NFL backed as much as half the building cost. 
Thirty-four percent was the most committed in the past, and most of 
that was for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an evolutionary thing not a new thing,'' commissioner  
Paul Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't sit well with everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tax on all the teams that won't benefit,'' Al Davis of  
the Raiders said. ``Never before in the history of the league have 
the poor given to the rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who recently withdrew from a  
$380 million stadium deal in Connecticut, suggested it was simply a 
case of partners helping each other. Massachusetts Gov. Paul 
Cellucci signed legislation Monday that will provide $70 million to 
help the Patriots build a new stadium in Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole stadium issue is an area that's highly complex,''  
Kraft said. ``Helping each other is one way to get things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On replay, the owners were shown the technology in which coaches  
will get two challenges a game, plus an unlimited number in the 
last two minutes of each half. The calls will be made by a replay 
official from a stadium booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a system designed to correct a mistake that the whole  
world knows is a mistake,'' said Dennis Lewin, the league's top 
television official.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Bangkok Bank Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Police have completed their  
investigations into the looting of Bangkok Bank of Commerce and 
have forwarded evidence to support prosecuting 40 former 
executives, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general will decide which cases to take to court,  
but with reports on the cases averaging 10,000 pages each, there is 
no telling when a decision will be made, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six of the cases were described by police at the Economic  
Crimes Division as major. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal at the Bangkok Bank of Commerce emerged in 1996. In  
what police have described as collusion, bank executives allegedly 
lent vast sums of money to a clique of politicians who put up 
collateral described as worthless and used the money for attempted 
hostile takeovers of companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly $3 billion was borrowed and never repaid to the bank,  
which plunged into insolvency. It was taken over the by the 
government and eventually shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports did not detail if any politicians would be prosecuted  
along with the former bank executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the executives have fled the country, including Rakesh  
Saxena, an ethnic Indian former BBC official who was described as 
Thailand's takeover king. Saxena is in Canada fighting extradition 
to Thailand. He has said he believes he will be made the scapegoat 
for the scandal because of his Indian origins.

<HEADLINE> SEC Points Finger at Ex-IBM Worker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An IBM secretary who knew of the company's plans  
to take over Lotus Development Corp. tipped off her husband, 
leading 25 people to pocket more than $1.3 million from insider 
trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged today. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the illegal trades -- many by novices to the  
securities markets who did not even have accounts when they 
received the tip -- were touched off when Lorraine K. Cassano told 
her husband about the Lotus acquisition, which occurred in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Marcel Marcelino, district administrator of the Boston SEC  
office, said the case was one of the largest ever in terms of 
number of people charged. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the SEC  
said Mrs. Cassano told her husband, Robert M. Cassano, a paging 
communications company salesman, who then told two friends who 
agreed to purchase stock for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two friends told others and soon the insider information  
had spread through a wide network of family members, friends and 
stock brokers, the SEC said in the civil action. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a rash of illegal insider trading among the 25  
individuals occurred during a 6 1/2 hour period on June 2, 1995, the 
SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, International Business Machines Corp.  
announced its takeover offer for Lotus and the value of Lotus 
common stock leaped from $32.50 per share to more than $61 per 
share, an increase of nearly 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cassano, a secretary in the Volumes and Revenue Department  
of the Software Group at IBM in Somers, N.Y., at the time of the 
insider trades, was suspended when IBM learned of the 
investigation. The North Salem, N.Y., resident was later fired, the 
SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those charged in the case was a pizzeria owner, a bank  
vice president, a private school teacher, a grocery store owner, a 
lawyer, the president of a direct-mail marketing company, a doctor, 
an engineer and several stockbrokers. Of those charged, 13 live in 
Staten Island, N.Y., and six live in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano first learned of the pending Lotus  
deal when she was asked to copy documents in late April or early 
May 1995. On May 5, 1995, her supervisor told her that IBM would be 
taking over Lotus, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 31, 1995, Mrs. Cassano learned that the board of  
directors had authorized the company to make an offer for Lotus and 
that it would be announced on June 5, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cassano then violated strict policies at IBM forbidding  
employees from disclosing nonpublic information, especially about 
the Lotus deal, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its court papers, the SEC asked the court to order the  
defendants to obey all securities laws, return any illegally 
obtained profits and be fined civil penalties up to three times 
their ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Mrs. Cassano's husband, Robert, pleaded guilty to  
insider trading on Jan. 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cassanos could not immediately be reached for comment on the  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the defendants tried to conceal their trades or the  
illicit nature of their trading activity by lying under oath about 
the reasons for their trades and falsely denying they knew the 
others in the group, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have pleaded guilty in the case thus far include  
lawyer Carmine DeSantis of Staten Island, salesman Michael Paul 
Green of Edison, N.J., computer technician P. Gerard Mazzone of 
Staten Island, delicatessen owner Peter G. Mazzone of Staten 
Island, computer technician Joseph Petrosino of Brooklyn, N.Y., and 
Dr. Gary Spierer of Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSantis pleaded to conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice,  
Green to obstruction of justice, both Mazzones to insider trading 
and perjury, Petrosino to perjury and Spierer to obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said both Cassanos as well as Green and Spierer have  
already settled the SEC civil charges, agreeing to obey securities 
laws and to pay back profits.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Fall 2.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods fell  
an unexpectedly sharp 2.3 percent last month, the Commerce 
Department reported today. Private economists did not regard the 
drop as a major setback to U.S. factories' recovery from a global 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, the second in three months, was driven by falling  
orders for transportation and defense goods. Without big declines 
in these two areas, orders for durable goods would have risen a 
strong 2.9 percent, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall decline in durable goods, which are items expected  
to last three or more years, followed a solid 2.7 percent rise in 
orders in March. Many analysts expected a gain of around 0.4 
percent for April orders. 
</P>
<P>
	For business groups, the new economic report indicated the  
economy is not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is coasting to a more sustainable pace following  
two quarters of unusually strong growth,'' said economist Jerry 
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
``The fundamental message of these numbers is that the economy is 
undergoing a mild slowdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, after four straight losing sessions attributed to  
concerns about inflation, reacted positively. The Dow Jones average 
of industrial stocks jumped 171 points to close at 10,702 on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Durable goods declined by $4.5 billion last month to a  
seasonally adjusted $194.4 billion. The drop is the biggest since a 
3.9 percent fall in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the decline came from a 36.4 percent decline in military  
orders. Defense orders rose 41.2 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new orders were down in large part because of the sharp  
reversal in defense orders which are likely to get stronger as we 
move through the year given all the ammunition we have used up in 
Kosovo,'' said economist Paul Kasriel of Northern Trust Company of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to defense, the other big source of weakness was a  
12.4 percent drop in demand for autos, aircraft and other 
transportation products. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you strip away transportation and defense, durable goods  
were actually up. And, that is more representative of what is going 
on in manufacturing,'' said Mark Zandi, economist at Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Manufacturing has had a 
dismal couple of years, but I think there is light at the end of 
the tunnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The global currency crisis has plunged one-third of the world  
into recession and contributed to the loss of more than 400,000 
U.S. manufacturing jobs over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this weakness, the overall U.S. economy has continued to  
forge ahead, growing at an annual rate of 4.5 percent during the 
first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will release a revised estimate for economic  
growth in the first quarter on Thursday. Many analysts believe it 
will show growth near the 4.5 percent level. 
</P>
<P>
	A key gauge of future economic activity, the Index of Leading  
Indicators, has risen for six straight months. While durable goods 
is a component of the index, analysts said the April drop should 
not have much effect because manufacturing has been weak for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the steel industry, competing against a flood of  
cheap imports from countries such as Japan, has suffered. But in 
the April report showed that primary metals, the sector that 
includes steel, had a 1.3 percent increase -- offering hope of a 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery rose by 3.5 percent in April,  
the fourth increase in this sector in the past six months, while 
orders for electronic equipment dropped 0.7 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a sign of current demand,  
fell 0.6 percent in April. compared with a 1.9 percent increase the 
previous month.

	Billed as the ``Team of the Decade Reunion Weekend,'' the event  
was held April 30 to May 2 at Pittsburgh's Lawrence Convention 
Center and featured Swann and 50 former Super Bowl teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann said his contract stipulated he would get $100,000 in  
exchange for 3,000 autographs at public and private signings, as 
well as appearances at a charity dinner and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Mahone or someone at his company stopped  
payment on Swann's check and sold some or all of the items Swann 
autographed, such as posters, footballs and football helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann, who lives in Pittsburgh, is a football commentator for  
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on Tuesday,  
Swann said only former players Terry Bradshaw and Joe Greene were 
paid in full. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahone said Tuesday that other players also were paid, but he  
declined to name them. He also said Swann signed 300 fewer 
autographs than he is claiming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sitting here with blank Lynn Swann photos and jerseys,''  
Mahone said. ``He says he signed 1,100 team lithographs. It's 983 
by my count.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahone said he is losing money because he had planned to sell  
1,000 photographs signed by each player to select customers and the 
QVC cable shopping channel. Instead, only 166 pictures were signed 
by every player and the QVC contract was canceled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not paying these players for something they didn't  
finish,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cops Shoot Neighborhood in Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LORTON, Va. (AP) -- Breanna Hafele was downstairs watching  
television when a submachine gun bullet flew through her 
second-story bedroom window and landed on her bed. The 4-year-old 
never heard the glass shatter. Neither did her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know it happened until my neighbor came over,''  
said June Hafele, who did hear gunfire but thought it was either 
thunder or electricians working in the alley. ``I didn't know what 
to think. I rushed upstairs and saw glass all over her bed and 
floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hafele's home was one of a dozen sprayed by submachine guns  
fired at a nearby shooting range used to train police officers. At 
least two rounds crashed through windows of homes with young 
children, including Breanna. Another bullet landed on a dining room 
floor where a father was holding his 8-month-old daughter. No one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three vehicles also were shot.  
</P>
<P>
	The gunfire came as a District of Columbia weapons instructor  
conducted an assault drill Monday at the district-owned complex on 
the grounds of the Lorton Prison. Officers from four nearby 
jurisdictions were being trained at the facility, said Sgt. Joe 
Gentile of the D.C. Police Department. The range is designed mainly 
for shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Charles Ramsey ``immediately directed that no  
firing be conducted at the range until further notice ... until we 
determine exactly what happened and how it happened,'' Gentile 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they are certain the bullets came from the  
facility, although they would have had to fly from the partially 
submerged shooting range, pass more than a mile of hilly fields, 
trees and rows of other homes before they struck the townhouse 
community, about 20 miles from the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We determined, using a tracking system, that, from the  
trajectory of the bullet ... that that is where it came from,'' 
said Gretchen Lacharite, a spokeswoman for the Fairfax County 
Police Department. ``In addition, there was evidence that was 
recovered in interviews with the people involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Conklin, who lives down the block from the Hafeles, said  
she heard popping noises but was used to hearing gunfire from the 
shooting range because ``they're out there a lot -- at least one day 
a week.'' At the time, she was in her basement with two 
grandchildren doing their homework. A pair of police officers came 
by later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said some of those houses had been shot by bullets in the  
firing range, and (one) looked up and he said, 'You have a bullet 
hole in your siding.''' Conklin said. ``I went, 'Oh my God, you're 
kidding me.' So I went outside, and there it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bullet struck the siding beneath a second-floor bedroom window  
of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a miracle that nobody was hurt,'' said Conklin, who wants  
to start a petition to close down the range because ``there are too 
many kids here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entire prison complex is slated for closure by 2002 under an  
agreement with the federal government.

	NATO Launches Extensive Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO officials say warplanes were  
involved today in the fiercest attacks yet in the three-month 
conflict against Yugoslavia. Serbia's state-run news agency said 
two children were killed and another seriously hurt when a NATO 
missile hit a village outside the Kosovo capital of Pristina. The 
Serbs say two other people were also wounded when missiles hit a 
family home in another Kosovo village. NATO said its jets 
participated in a record number of attack flights, bombarding 
artillery, tanks and mortar targets in Kosovo. A wide range of army 
barracks, ammunition storage sites, command posts and petroleum 
storage sites also were hit.

	DRAS, India (AP) -- Military leaders from India and Pakistan are  
planning to meet later today to try to defuse tensions after 
Pakistan accused India of dropping bombs on its territory in the 
disputed Kashmir region. India said there was ``no truth'' to the 
Pakistani claims and that the attacks occurred solely on its own 
territory and were aimed at what it called Afghan mercenaries 
supported by Pakistani forces. A Pakistani spokesman said the 
alleged attacks were ``very grave escalation'' of tensions between 
the wary neighbors, and that Pakistan would possibly retaliate.

	End to Gun Hunting Lessons Sought

<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Educators are questioning the wisdom of  
allowing children to bring guns to school, even for a hunting 
class. Officials in Wisconsin, citing reaction to the recent school 
shootings in Colorado and Georgia, decided to cancel the daytime 
hunter's education classes in Beaver Dam. They also want the 
nighttime courses canceled -- classes that have been offered for 40 
years -- and the school board is reviewing the request. Of the more 
than 800 such classes offered in Wisconsin last year, about a third 
were taught in schools for kids ages 12 to 16. But gun enthusiasts 
say better to teach gun safety, especially in a setting congenial 
to learning.

<HEADLINE> Opel Car Plant To Cut 4,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUESSELSHEIM, Germany (AP) -- The German unit of General Motors  
Corp., Adam Opel AG, plans to cut 4,000 of some 10,000 jobs at its 
main plant here as part of a four-year modernization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The personnel cuts will include early retirement of older  
workers, with reduced working hours for some, but no outright 
layoffs, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to board chairman Robert Hendry, Opel plans to replace  
its old facilities on the site with new buildings at a cost of 
$445.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will build one of the most modern automobile plants in the  
world,'' Hendry said. The new plant is to start production in 2002 
with an annual output of 270,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Opel works council chief Rudi Mueller said a  
step-by-step reduction of personnel would take place, cutting the 
number of employees to 6,000 from a current 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the bitter side of the development,'' Mueller said.  
But he added that revamping Opel's facilities southwest of 
Frankfurt was necessary to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the costs of construction, costs for razing old  
facilities and the possibility of adding a new model to its 
production line would push the outlay for the overall project to 
some $540 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Opel currently produces its Omega and Vectra model at the  
Ruesselsheim plant, which will continue during the interim phase. 
The new plant will be 40 percent smaller after the modernization is 
completed, with emphasis on productivity, quality and safety, said 
production manager Michael Wolf.

<HEADLINE> Reform Jews Adopt Traditional Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The spiritual leaders of the largest group of  
American Jews today approved a return to traditional values such as 
the wearing of yarmulkes, keeping kosher and praying in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the governing body of  
Reform Judaism, voted 324-68 in favor of the new platform after 
heated debate Tuesday and this morning. Nine rabbis did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm overjoyed. The overwhelming majority of my colleagues feel  
the same, and although this is not perfect, it is a framework for 
the future,'' said Rabbi Lawrence Goldmark, president of the Board 
of Rabbis of Southern California. ``This puts Reform Judaism in a 
positive light. This is what we stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group had worked until late Tuesday on the new set of  
principles, then postponed their vote to allow for more debate 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an organization where there are no smoky back rooms,''  
Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, executive vice president of the 
1,700-member rabbis' group, said in explanation of the delay 
Tuesday. ``We respect our members. ... We never expected it to go 
smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Eric Wisnia of New York City argued this morning that the  
group should not feel an obligation to pass the principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't broken. Why are we fixing it?'' Wisnia said as  
debate resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the document was so flawed that if passed, the rabbis  
would eventually have to repeat the same tortuous process of 
rewriting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a perfect document, but it is an important one,''  
countered Rabbi Laura Geller of Beverly Hills, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompting much of the debate was a section on intermarriage.  
Some participants were concerned that the section could be 
interpreted as condoning intermarriage, when their intent was 
instead to welcome non-Jews who were willing to convert. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new platform, ancient rituals sometimes scoffed at or  
ignored in Reform communities and usually associated with 
Conservative or Orthodox Jewry will again be embraced, such as the 
wearing of yarmulkes and prayer shawls, the observance of Jewish 
dietary laws and the use of Hebrew during prayer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform leaders said many of the 1.5 million Reform Jews in the  
United States already have been returning to traditional practices, 
and the new principles would only reinforce that. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting Tuesday and today was only the fourth time since  
Reform Judaism was established in North America in the mid-19th 
century that the rabbis' group met to issue comprehensive 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1885, 15 Reform rabbis issued the Pittsburgh Platform, which  
rejected traditional Jewish practices as ``entirely foreign'' for 
modern American times. 
</P>
<P>
	A platform adopted in 1937 encouraged rabbis to incorporate  
science into their views of sacred literature. And a conference in 
1976 produced a call for diversity, individuality and change. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest platform was not reached without controversy and  
several rewordings. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier draft was dubbed ``Conservative lite'' by Rabbi  
Robert M. Seltzer, professor of Jewish history at the City 
University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform leaders said the final draft maintains the traditional  
Reform ethos that sets their branch apart from Conservative Judaism 
-- the idea that Jews should choose traditions that help them and 
bypass those that do not.

<HEADLINE> IRL and CART Hold Unification talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The big names may be coming back to the  
Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of bitter rivalry that threatened the future of  
open-wheel racing in the United States, CART and the IRL have begun 
face-to-face talks about bringing the two racing circuits together. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations came as teams prepared for this  
weekend's race at the Indy 500, which has lost its luster during 
the feud as the best-known drivers stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that there have been some very informal talks  
with Tony George,'' said Andrew Craig, president and CEO of 
Championship Auto Racing Teams. ``However, I am not prepared to 
comment on any of the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no comment -- but also no denial of the talks -- from  
George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president who started the 
war when he formed the Indy Racing League late in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The answering salvo from CART was to quit the Indianapolis 500,  
leaving George to stage the world's most famous auto race with 
virtually no stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences between the two circuits once seemed  
insurmountable, with totally different chassis and engine rules in 
place. But the last few weeks have brought hope that a settlement 
could be achieved as early as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his differences with George, who started the IRL as a  
low-cost, ovals-only alternative to CART, Craig says a merger would 
be in the best interests of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's CART's position that open-wheel racing would benefit  
greatly from having one series instead of two,'' Craig said. ``I 
think everyone in the industry would like to see it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the two circuits who spoke on condition of  
anonymity say NASCAR president Bill France Jr., the most powerful 
man in American racing, is brokering the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	France did not return phone calls, but his interest is not  
surprising. International Speedway Corp., which owns and operates 
NASCAR, recently bought Penske Motorsports, giving ISC 10 
racetracks, with at least three more planned in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC will need more than just its stock car and truck divisions  
to keep those tracks busy and prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
	The war between CART and the IRL was destructive, and the timing  
couldn't have been worse, with NASCAR's emergence as the hottest 
American sport of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	CART has been solid almost since its debut in 1979, but it  
attracts far fewer fans at tracks where NASCAR also races. Although 
the Indy 500 will race Sunday before another sellout crowd 
approaching 400,000, for the most part the IRL has not drawn well 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	When CART was the one major open-wheel entity in America, its TV  
ratings were adequate and building slowly. Since the split, neither 
side has drawn more than a bare audience, except for Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	And even the once mighty Memorial Day weekend classic has  
slipped from a high rating of 8.4 in 1995 to 5.5 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But -- perhaps in hopes of a peace treaty -- ABC and ESPN haven't  
given up on either series. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN already had a deal with CART through 2001 before ABC  
re-upped for Indy last week, extending its contract through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also means ABC and ESPN will show the rest of the  
IRL schedule each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Katz, the new president of ABC Sports and the catalyst in  
extending the current contract with George, says the biggest 
problem facing the open-wheel folks is building stars. 
</P>
<P>
	CART is perceived to have the big names, with Michael Andretti  
and Al Unser Jr. still its marquee drivers. But neither has won a 
championship in five years, and former Indy winners Mario Andretti, 
Bobby Rahal, Emerson Fittipaldi, Rick Mears, Al Unser Sr. and Danny 
Sullivan -- have retired in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the biggest stars stayed with CART, the IRL had a shaky  
foundation. Its one big-name driver, two-time Indy 500 winner Arie 
Luyendyk, will race Sunday for the final time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got to build stars,'' Katz said. ``You've got  
to have a reason to root for or even against people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsorships, which supply most of the money for race teams,  
also are a problem for open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	CART still has more than $400 million in sponsorship backing,  
but many of the long-term contracts will end in either 2000 or 
2001, with no guarantees they will be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL, which started from nothing in 1995, has built perhaps  
$50 million in sponsorship, but with minuscule TV ratings and 
little identity it continues to be a hard sell to corporate 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR, massively promoted and armed with high TV ratings,  
already has about $500 million annually in sponsorship money and 
continues to grow at a fast rate, drawing sponsors away from the 
open-wheel divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	PPG Industries, the longtime series sponsor for CART, is one of  
the few backers involved in both open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've managed to keep a foot in both camps, feeling that there  
was value on each side of the fence,'' said Mike Sack, PPG's 
director of motorsports. ``That's a difficult position to be in, 
not only from the standpoint of money, but also politically 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know one sponsor that doesn't think peace between the  
series is a good idea.''

<HEADLINE> Truck Safety Measures Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics say the Clinton administration's plan  
to cut the number of truck-related deaths in half over the next 
decade is well-intentioned but unlikely to produce quick results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the things the secretary talked about are long-term,''  
said Jacqueline Gillan, vice president of Advocates for Highway and 
Auto Safety, a group with insurance industry support. ``The safety 
community wants action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater announced the  
goal and unveiled a series of steps to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his department would ask for $56 million more from  
Congress this year to increase the number of inspectors for 
commercial vehicles, which includes trucks and motor coaches, and 
to boost state and federal safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater also said the federal Office of Motor Carriers, which  
regulates commercial vehicles, would increase the fines for 
violations, move more swiftly to shut down unfit motor carriers, 
limit negotiated settlements in enforcement cases and aggressively 
pursue criminal or civil penalties when someone is killed in a 
commercial vehicle crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the secretary said he would push to reduce driving  
time for operators and seek to monitor compliance with rules 
through the expanded use of technology similar to airline 
flight-data recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Slater said he hoped to reduce the number of  
truck-related deaths from about 5,000 annually to about 2,500 
annually. In 1997, 5,355 people were killed; preliminary figures 
show the number fell to about 5,200 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, six people are killed each year in bus accidents,  
although the figure has spiked in the past six months after a 
Christmas Eve crash that killed eight in New Jersey and a charter 
bus accident earlier this month in New Orleans that killed 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we face up to a time for action, and the plan that I  
have outlined deals with action,'' Slater declared at a news 
conference. He was accompanied by Federal Highway Administrator 
Kenneth Wykle, who oversees the Office of Motor Carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals triggered swift and critical reaction from safety  
advocates and truckers. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Claybrook, president of the advocacy group Public Citizen,  
said: ``While we welcome DOT's statement on improved enforcement, 
they're still talking about useless safety education programs and 
'collaborative' government-industry research, for which they have 
been harshly criticized by the inspector general of the DOT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, truckers said they wished Slater had already reformed  
hour-of-service rules, which regulate the amount of time truckers 
are on the road, and created a separate agency to oversee motor 
carrier safety, much like the Federal Aviation Administration does 
with airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in this format, with a Senate-confirmed presidential  
appointee reporting to the secretary of transportation, will truck 
safety get its proper respect,'' said Walter McCormick Jr., 
president of the American Trucking Associations. 
</P>
<P>
	In his announcement, Slater ducked one demand of safety  
advocates: moving the Office of Motor Carriers out of the Federal 
Highway Administration and into the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are parts of the Transportation Department, but the highway  
administration largely oversees the interstate system, while the 
safety administration deals with issues such as drunken driving, 
air bags and seat belt use. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater didn't rule out the change, but said he would prefer to  
be accountable for results and ``not just rearranging boxes on an 
organizational chart.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's plan for  
generating competition among electric utilities was roundly 
criticized Wednesday by rural lawmakers who fear it could raise 
rates and hurt service in remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very much like we're being offered a pig in a poke,''  
said Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga. ``Nobody really know what this is 
going to do, if it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A deregulation bill introduced by the administration last month  
would allow all consumers to choose their electric utility by 2003 
unless their states decided after public hearings that they do not 
want the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states already have moved toward deregulating  
rates on their own. But administration officials told a House 
Agriculture subcommittee that federal legislation is needed to 
speed the process, overhaul tax laws and ensure that service 
remains dependable as competition increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department estimates consumers nationwide save $20  
billion a year by 2010, although rates could rise in some areas. 
The legislation provides for a tax that could be used to protect 
rural customers from rate increases and also guarantees that rural 
electric cooperatives would continue to buy federal hydropower at 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``No restructuring plan currently before the Congress is as  
complete or as sensitive to rural concerns as is the president's 
bill. ... One way or another, restructuring is coming,'' said Wally 
Beyer, administrator of the Agriculture Department's Rural 
Utilities Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said rural electric cooperatives could lose some of their  
biggest, most profitable customers to competing utilities. 
``There's going to be cherry-picking, no doubt about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Thune, R-S.D., said it should be left to states decide  
to decide how or whether they deregulate electric rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., expressed fears that rural electric  
co-ops could suffer the same fate as some rural telephone 
exchanges, which have been put up for sale or abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competitive forces do not favor the more remote parts of  
our country but would instead place them at risk,'' Minge said. 
</P>
<P>
	A USDA study that has not been released officially warned that  
deregulation could lead to rate increases in 19 states. USDA's 
chief economist, Keith Collins, told the House Agriculture 
subcommittee on general farm commodities, resource conservation and 
credit that the study was based on a worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	A more optimistic report by the Energy Department says that  
average rates would fall in 45 of the 48 contiguous states. Some 
consumers in Montana, Washington and Oregon would see increases, 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``With appropriate strategies to implement competition, the  
administration believes that even these three states. ... can 
assure benefits from competition to all customer classes, said Mark 
Mazur, the Energy Department's acting policy director.

<HEADLINE> Woman Hit by Train Faced Troubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- No one can say for certain why a mother  
and four of her sons would court a ghastly death by walking along 
railroad tracks in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pressures on Julia Toledo were mounting every day: Her  
husband had returned to their native Ecuador. She had filed for 
divorce. Day care was hard to find. She quit her job to care for 
the children. She stopped taking English lessons. She moved out of 
an apartment and into a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	And she had recently begun to worry that her kids would be taken  
away by the state, a friend said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Toledo, 46, may have been running from the hard  
times when she and three of her boys were killed by an Amtrak train 
early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have ruled the deaths an accident; they do not believe  
it was a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was obviously fleeing, but we don't know why. We wished we  
had known she was in trouble, because we could have helped her,'' 
said Sister Brenda Lynch of Caroline House, an educational center 
for immigrant women where Toledo took English lessons and other 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead boys were identified as Pedro Urgiles Toledo, 3; Angel  
Gabriel Urgiles Toledo, 6; and Carlos Urgiles Toledo, 12. The sole 
survivor was 10-year-old Jose Francisco Urgiles, who lay comatose 
Wedneday in critical condition. He lost most of his left leg and 
suffered a severe head injury and broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose was initially identified as Angel; he was so badly injured  
that even relatives were unable to identify him. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo's friends have a number of theories to explain why the  
family was walking along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said following train tracks is a common practice in Latin  
America. Toledo may also have believed it was safer to follow the 
tracks than to walk through a poor neighborhood at night, Lynch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a direct way, the tracks. What she did would make sense  
to her,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people who knew Toledo said she usually seemed happy and  
stable. Milagros Vizcarrondo, principal of Luis Munoz Marin 
Elementary School, attended by three of the boys, said Toledo 
sometimes sought help to buy clothes or food. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo had told school officials about her recent move to a  
shelter, worried that the children might have to switch schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was comfortable coming in here,'' Vizcarrondo said. ``She  
was comfortable asking for help. She had very happy children. She 
gave no indication that her situation had reached such heights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Brenda TeVogt said Toledo stopped attending English  
classes at Caroline House in early April, after being a steady 
student for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `Things are tough. I'm needing to get my life going,  
but I'll be back,''' TeVogt said. 
</P>
<P>
	TeVogt said Toledo had been having difficulty finding child care  
because of her unusual schedule. Until recently, she had worked 
nights cleaning offices at Fairfield University. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, 69-year-old retired construction worker Gabriel  
Sanchez, said Toledo had quit her job and was worried about being 
able to support her family. 
</P>
<P>
	And in recent weeks, Toledo told TeVogt of another fear. She  
said a relative had scolded her for being ``a bad mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is she was afraid of losing her children,'' TeVogt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wiltse, a spokesman for the state Department of Children  
and Families, said the agency had no record of involvement with the 
family and had not investigated any reports of abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency took temporary custody of the surviving child  
Wednesday in order to make legal and medical decisions about his 
care.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Man Charged With Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- A white man accused of driving onto a  
sidewalk to hit two black teen-agers on bikes has been charged with 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	James G. Langenbach, 27, intentionally swerved his car and sped  
toward the 14-year-old boys as they rode their bicycles, police 
allege. 
</P>
<P>
	One boy has been released from the hospital. The other was in  
satisfactory condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were upgraded Wednesday to two counts each of attempted  
murder while armed with a dangerous weapon, causing great bodily 
harm to a child with a dangerous weapon and leaving the scene of an 
injury accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges also include a hate crime provision, which can  
add up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines to each charge. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Langenbach faces 120 years in prison on the  
attempted murder charges, 60 years on the assault charges and 16 
years on the flight charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach has a history of run-ins with police and has been  
treated for psychiatric problems, records show. He had been placed 
on probation for ramming his car into a van carrying five black men 
eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Langenbach remained jail in lieu of $200,000 cash bond. Public  
defender Dennis Egre, Langenbach's attorney, declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Grant: No Hard Feelings Toward Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Brian Grant pondered the gash over his  
right eye -- opened up by one of Karl Malone's notorious elbows -- 
and decided he isn't angry about it. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the six-stitch cut represents what Grant wants to learn  
from Malone and the Utah Jazz: how to play with the intensity 
needed to win the biggest of games. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant and the rest of the Portland Trail Blazers face such a  
game tomorrow night in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals at 
the Rose Garden. The Jazz won Game 5 on Tuesday night, pulling 
within 3-2 and avoiding elimination for the third time in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone cut Grant while going for a rebound in the first quarter.  
Grant lay on the floor in pain, and came back after being stitched 
up. He was ineffective, however, scoring eight points on 1-of-7 
shooting in the Blazers' 88-71 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he wasn't planning on elbowing me in the eye,'' Grant  
said before practice Wednesday. ``Even if it was intentional, 
that's part of the game. Those things are going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, with the outcome decided, Grant was  
frustrated after Malone made a swipe at the ball Grant had 
rebounded. Grant faked a throw at the back of Malone's head, 
drawing a technical foul. That sent Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy 
into an uncharacteristic rage. 
</P>
<P>
	He stomped onto the court toward an official and, after being  
ejected, had to be restrained by assistant coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Grant was in Malone's face, exchanging heated words  
with the future Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to guess what I said to him, because it's  
between me and Karl,'' Grant said. ``This isn't about Brian Grant 
playing Karl Malone. It's about the Trail Blazers trying to win a 
championship this year. I know we're not going to be able to do it 
with me bickering with one player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any ill feelings toward any of the Jazz. If  
anything, I can take a page from their book someday as far as how 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Game 5, Blazers teammate Isaiah Rider hinted that the team  
might bring a role player off the bench to take out Malone, a 
suggestion quickly shot down by Dunleavy and Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not my approach,'' Grant said. ``I'm a ballplayer, not  
a wrestler. I'm not a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was fined $10,000 by the NBA for elbowing Grant in the  
mouth in Game 1. As in Tuesday night's game, Malone was not 
whistled for a foul in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a problem with his elbows,'' Dunleavy said. ``I  
don't want to make excuses. But if a guy continually hits people 
with elbows and they get cut, what does that tell you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rough play in Game 5 overshadowed an otherwise impressive  
performance by the Jazz, who say the pressure is now on the Blazers 
to win on their homecourt to avoid going back to Salt Lake City for 
Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they say they're not feeling a little pressure, I would say  
they're lying a little bit,'' Malone said. ``Because they're 
supposed to close us out because we're getting old, we can't do 
this, and we're predictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz are trying to become the seventh team in NBA history to  
come back from a 3-1 deficit. The last to do it was the Miami Heat 
in 1997, against the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have trailed 3-1 five times in the Malone-John Stockton  
era, and have yet to win the series. 
</P>
<P>
	But Utah is 6-1 the last two seasons when it had to win or go  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to come again with a whole lot of energy, and  
we've just got to come out with the same energy that we had in 
Games 1 through 4,'' said Blazers guard Damon Stoudamire. ``Playing 
hard makes up for mistakes, and all the little things that were 
happening to us last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 5, Utah showed intensity for the first time since Game  
2, when they came back from a 78-74 deficit to win 93-83. Utah also 
outrebounded the Blazers 45-31, and used their familiar screens to 
get open shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier now,'' said Utah guard Jeff Hornacek.  
``Sacramento proved it that when you're not playing under any 
pressure, it's a lot easier. The pressure is on them to try to 
finish us up.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Said To OK Diabetes Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SmithKline Beecham will make commercially  
available in the next few days a treatment for Type 2 diabetes that 
promises to have fewer risks than a current competing drug that has 
been linked to liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical company said Tuesday it has received approval  
from the Food and Drug Administration to market Avandia to treat 
diabetes in the same manner as Rezulin. But, unlike Rezulin, in 
studies of more than 4,000 patients Avandia showed no sign of liver 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA spokesman Brad Stone said he could not confirm the agency  
action and another FDA official did not return calls seeking 
comment. The company said the approval came late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the FDA last month recommended approval of the drug  
but warned that no one can say for certain that Avandia will never 
damage diabetics' livers. They said Avandia patients should have 
intensive liver testing similar to that now required for patients 
who take Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	In clinical trials, common side effects of using Avandia  
included upper respiratory tract infections and headaches. Some 
patients also reported weight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, which afflicts  
millions of Americans whose bodies lose the ability to properly use 
insulin, the hormone that processes blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was cheered widely  
when it hit the market in 1997 because it is the only drug sold 
that resensitizes the body to insulin. Many doctors contend it is 
invaluable for patients who have failed other diabetes therapies. 
Some 750,000 Americans now use the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Rezulin hit the market, however, it began causing  
liver failure. FDA officials list 43 Rezulin patients who suffered 
acute liver failure. Of those, 28 died and seven needed liver 
transplants to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned that those cases may represent only 10 percent of  
all Rezulin-related liver damage. Last month, the agency's advisers 
called for imposing new restrictions be put on Rezulin's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is also considering Takeda Pharmaceuticals' Actos,  
another drug that could offer Rezulin's benefit with fewer liver 
risks.

<HEADLINE> Dominik Hasek Might Skate Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- With Dominik Hasek out, the Toronto Maple Leafs  
are back in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, the star goalie for the Buffalo Sabres, sat out his  
second straight game Tuesday night with a sore groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Result: a 6-3 victory by the Maple Leafs that evened the  
best-of-7 series at a game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it,'' said Leafs winger Steve Thomas, whose  
third-period goal gave Toronto a 5-3 cushion after the Sabres 
pulled within a goal, ``Dominik Hasek is the best goaltender in the 
world. When he's not in there, they're definitely aware of that. 
But we've been successful against them before, and some of the 
goals we scored would have gone in even if Hasek had been in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe. Maybe not. Dwayne Roloson, who made 28 saves in Buffalo's  
5-4 win in Sunday's opener, his first-ever playoff start, played 
well again, but had less help from his teammates this time. It 
almost seemed as though they thought Hasek, the two-time league 
MVP, was back in there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five goals, and three of them were within five feet,'' Sabres  
defenseman Jason Woolley said. ``I don't know how much more he can 
do. It's real tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for the Sabres, Hasek said his injury probably  
wouldn't keep him out the entire series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel much better than I did two days ago,'' Hasek said  
before Tuesday's game. ``I feel pretty optimistic. I feel much more 
strength in my leg and that's good. I hope I'll be back in the 
series. It's day-to-day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has been taking anti-inflammatory drugs to ease the pain.  
Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said the team was considering using 
cortisone injections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try anything,'' Ruff said. ``We'll explore  
every avenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek first injured the groin in a 3-2 overtime loss to Toronto  
in Buffalo on Feb. 17. The Czech goalie, who led the NHL in save 
percentage (.937) for the sixth straight year, missed a dozen games 
and did not return until March 19. He flew to Germany on March 24 
for treatment after twisting his back in a game against the New 
Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	The groin injury flared up again in a Game 4 victory over Boston  
in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs and continued to 
hamper the acrobatic goalie in a 5-3 loss to the Bruins in Game 5. 
Hasek started and won Game 6 against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has got to get to a level where he feels comfortable and  
can perform his acrobatics,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, whose butterfly style relies on mobility and quickness  
and a capacity to rebound from a prone position, said he didn't 
know when he would return. The teams play Thursday and Saturday in 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I'm thinking about Thursday,'' said Hasek, who said  
he would try to skate today. ``Who knows? I cannot answer because I 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he would be cheating his teammates if he were to try  
to come back too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot go up and down, and if I cannot go up and down, I  
cannot do my job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI in Buffalo on Monday confirmed that Hasek has a strained  
groin, but a bone scan revealed no other damage, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said the Sabres were still a good team without Hasek.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can beat anybody, and we don't need every star player in  
the lineup,'' said Ruff, also missing leading scorer Miroslav Satan 
since the first round because of an ankle bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have recalled Martin Biron from Rochester, the team's  
AHL affiliate, to back up Roloson. Biron, named the AHL's 
outstanding goalie this season, made three starts and was 1-2-1 
with the Sabres.

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Baby Bouncers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 4,000 baby bouncers were recalled  
Tuesday after several reports of babies falling and bumping their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bungee Baby Bouncer allows a baby to bounce while supported  
in a ``belly band,'' suspended from a doorway. Knots tied in the 
rope that supports the bouncer can unravel, causing the baby to 
fall, said the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission and the bouncer's manufacturer, E &AMP; I Inc. of  
Bancroft, Idaho, have received six reports of knots failing, with 
babies being injured in four of those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should immediately stop using the bouncers and return  
the bungee assembly to the manufacturer for repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea and Scott's One Step Ahead catalogs, and baby specialty  
retailers in Utah and Idaho sold the bouncers from September 1998

<HEADLINE> Farmers Voting on Union Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Berry pickers employed by the  
nation's biggest strawberry grower voted today on whether to 
unionize, a key test of the United Farm Workers' long-running 
effort to restore its once-formidable clout in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW committed itself to winning such a vote at Coastal Berry  
Co. five years ago, hoping a victory there would create momentum 
for similar successes throughout California's farm fields. 
Strawberry growers have historically been among the most truculent 
opponents to union organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite unusual advantages at Coastal Berry, the foremost of  
which was a promise by its owners not to block unions, the campaign 
has been plagued by setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW organizers struggled to win the trust of workers and  
faced competition from a rival union backed by company supervisors 
who had ties to other anti-union growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strawberry industry wants to stop UFW progress at all  
costs, and Coastal Berry could be a crucial turning point for the 
workers statewide,'' UFW spokesman Marc Grossman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal's 1,500 employees in the farming communities of Oxnard,  
Watsonville and Salinas voted by secret ballot Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Their choices: representation by the UFW, its rival, the 
Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker Committee, or no union at 
all. Results were expected Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	In Watsonville, pickers briefly left oceanside fields laden with  
fat red strawberries to place their ballots under the close watch 
of state labor officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry Co. President Ernie Farley said Wednesday the  
company is neutral on whether its workers are represented by the 
UFW or the Farm Worker Committee. The UFW says its rival is a sham 
union that doesn't have the workers' interests at heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Berry's pickers are treated better than some in the  
berry fields. They earn an average wage of between $7.50 and $8.50 
an hour and have full medical and dental benefits for themselves 
and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty much in the top of the industry. The dependents  
get health benefits even if they live in Mexico,'' Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the UFW wants better wages, benefits and job security,  
not only at Coastal Berry, but at other growers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the vote will be pivotal in the UFW's effort to  
overcome the doldrums it fell into even before the 1993 death of 
its legendary founder, Cesar Chavez, who inspired 80,000 
farmworkers to join up by 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	That activism later faded, and union membership declined to  
20,000 at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fields, migrant farmworkers and undocumented immigrants  
were unwilling to risk their livelihoods by alienating their 
bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the UFW's revived organizing effort was begun in the  
most difficult place -- strawberry fields, where picking the crops 
is entry-level farmwork, the most backbreaking, low-skilled labor 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's $600 million strawberry industry employs about  
20,000 workers. Until this week, the only strawberry grower to sign 
a UFW contract is a small organic farm with 50 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the UFW has won 18 union elections and signed 22  
first-time contracts with growers of other crops, increasing 
overall union membership to 27,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coastal Berry campaign got a boost when the company's former  
parent Monsanto Corp., under pressure from Congress and Vice 
President Gore to resolve the berry company's labor problems, sold 
it to two liberal Washington, D.C., investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the company's efforts to achieve labor peace, some of  
its own supervisors actively opposed the UFW, and formed the Farm 
Worker Committee as an alternative union. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Worker Committee won a union election at Coastal Berry  
last July after the UFW refused to participate, claiming the 
workers had been intimidated by members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board invalidated the  
election because some workers weren't given the opportunity to 
vote. The company later fired several of the Farm Worker 
Committee's leaders, who had been accused of threatening workers.

<HEADLINE>  Churchill Will Be Site of 2000 Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Churchill Downs will be the site of the  
2000 Breeders' Cup, marking a record fifth time the event is to be 
held at the same track. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the announcement Wednesday, Breeders' Cup Ltd.  
president D.G. Van Clief Jr. cited the success of last year's 
championship, which also was held at Churchill, for the quick 
return to the track, home of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	A Breeders' Cup record crowd of 80,452 attended in 1998,  
breaking the previous record of 71,671 which was set when Churchill 
hosted the races in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The reception the championship got from the community was  
another factor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Churchill's management and staff have done a first-rate job in  
presenting the Championship on four previous occasions,'' Van Clief 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship, on Nov. 4, 2000, is thoroughbred racing's  
richest day, featuring eight races with purses and awards totaling 
$13 million. A new race, the Filly and Mare Turf, will be added to 
the card this year. 
</P>
<P>
	No track has held the event more than three times.  
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs has recently enjoyed growing crowds. Attendance  
at the 1999 Kentucky Derby was the second largest in the track's 
history. Four of the top five crowds in Breeders' Cup history were 
when the races were held at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Van Clief said it was unlikely the Breeders' Cup will  
be awarded exclusively to Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's healthy for the championship to be moved from city to  
city,'' he said. ``It gives it an aesthetic value it might not have 
if it was sedentary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the championship's revenue, Van Clief said, comes from  
the breeding industry in the form of nomination fees. Moving the 
championship to other states that are important to the breeding 
industry, such as Florida and California, is an acknowledgment of 
their contributions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, Van Clief also announced Wednesday  
that the Breeders' Cup will seek an agreement with The New York 
Racing Association to conduct the 2001 Breeders' Cup at Belmont 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Breeders Cup Championship will be held at Gulfstream  
Park in Hallandale, Fla., on Nov. 6.

<HEADLINE> The Mystery of Life in Art Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, England (AP) -- The works of two young American artists  
are filling the white-walled spaces of the Museum of Modern Art in 
this English university city. 
</P>
<P>
	On the face of it, the two exhibitions couldn't be more  
different. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstairs are Anna Gaskell's drawings and large colored  
photographs inspired by the Victorian story ``Alice in 
Wonderland''; upstairs are the sights and sounds of Manhattan as 
depicted by Sarah Morris in strangely compelling paintings and a 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	They have one thing in common: mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	What are they doing, these ``Alices'' in pinafores, white  
stockings and flat black shoes, tumbling about, pulling at each 
other or entwined in a tangle of arms and legs? 
</P>
<P>
	Why are these paintings of skyscraper office facades rendered in  
multicolored grids so anonymous and menacing? 
</P>
<P>
	Why is the nine-minute movie ``Midtown,'' depicting people on  
the sidewalks set to a soundtrack of throbbing, repetitive music, 
so gripping? After all, it's just a sequence of people walking 
toward the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Both artists live and work in New York City, but Morris also has  
a studio in London. She was born in England to an American mother 
and British father and raised in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaskell, who was born in Iowa, hired the girls in her photos as  
actors and took the photos in Minnesota, near the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always remember that I knew the Alice story,'' she says. ``I  
liked where Alice lived -- that place without boundaries where 
anything can happen. Alice wasn't sure of who she was when she 
entered Wonderland and she couldn't control her own size. My models 
are all one, all Alice, different parts of her person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the story, Alice grows and shrinks as she eats and drinks  
magic potions after following the anxious white rabbit underground. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaskell manipulates the models to express Alice's dilemmas and  
uncertainties, using camera distortion to make the point about the 
strangeness of change. 
</P>
<P>
	She also presents a continuous video loop of a young woman  
floating face down in water, then rising to the surface and opening 
her mouth, which fills the screen. It's inspired by Ophelia, who 
drowns herself in ``Hamlet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The viewer thinks this Ophelia is being saved, but the loop  
always returns to the face-down image of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' art draws its power from the shape of the city.  
</P>
<P>
	Her skyscraper-grid paintings and her movie, shot simply of  
people on the sidewalks of New York, combine the power of buildings 
with the everyday anonymity of crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	We see revolving doors, cliffs of concrete and glass, faces,  
feet and legs, a woman smoking and pacing restlessly outside an 
entrance, a man sitting with his back to fountains. They are people 
who never smile and never look at each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Narrative possibilities are explored but remain undeveloped,  
because we never know any more of these people than what we see of 
them. But there are germs of plots in the comings and goings. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my work deals with immediacy and how we see things through  
other forms of storytelling,'' Morris says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that man crossing the street going back to a business  
meeting or is he going out of town? It looks a bit suspicious, but 
we'll never know. I like that element. I wanted through repetition 
to achieve adrenaline and a sense of suspense. 
</P>
<P>
	``My paintings deal with elements of power and American  
corporatism invoking obedience and trust but also repulsion,'' she 
says. ``For the music, I took bits from my records and refigured 
them in a computer program, altering sound levels and repeating 
notes. It has the tension of the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Tarantino, head of exhibitions at Oxford MOMA, says  
there's no direct relationship between the two artists and that 
it's a coincidence they are shown together, through June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey native discovered Morris' work in a London  
gallery and approached her directly. He had seen Gaskell's work in 
art magazines when he was asked by the Museum of Contemporary Art 
in Miami if he was interested in bringing her show to Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery specializes in the new, so Tarantino says visitors  
should check their expectations of art at the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope lay people come with an open mind, without  
preconceptions,'' he says. ``Every show here looks different from 
the last. The worst thing that could happen would be if it became 
predictable.''

<HEADLINE> Survey: Japanese Worried About Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- With its economy stuck in a deep slump, three out  
of four Japanese are worried about job security, according to a 
newspaper survey released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by the Yomiuri newspaper showed that 76 percent of  
those polled said they are worried about current and future 
employment for themselves and other family members. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was up by 8 percentage points from a similar Yomiuri  
survey in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest survey, conducted May 15-16, asked the opinion of  
2,035 eligible voters picked randomly across Japan. As with many 
Japanese opinion polls, no margin of error was given. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, concerns over possibly losing jobs anytime soon  
were most severely felt by the middle-aged -- 83 percent of those in 
their 40s and 84 percent in their 50s, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In late April, the government reported Japan's unemployment rate  
in March climbed to yet another record high of 4.8 percent, as 
corporate restructuring efforts force more people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Japan's jobless rates will rise in coming months as  
the nation is undergoing profound structural changes in the economy 
and the breakdown of traditional business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that 64 percent of Japanese say that a  
performance-based wage system is more desirable than the 
traditional pay scale based on seniority, which was supported by 33 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a proof that people are beginning to accept changes in  
employment practice,'' Atsushi Seike, a professor on labor economy 
at Tokyo's Keio University, told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> AMA Restores Journal Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association said Wednesday  
it will guarantee the editorial independence of its weekly journal 
by creating a board to serve as a buffer between the editor in 
chief and the organization's management. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows criticism that erupted in January, when Dr.  
George Lundberg was fired as editor of The Journal of the American 
Medical Association for publishing a survey of college students' 
sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the AMA executive vice president,  
said at the time that Lundberg had inappropriately interjected the 
organization into a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA officials did their best not to mention the episode  
Wednesday, dodging questions about Lundberg's firing by saying they 
preferred to look to the future than dwell on the past. 
</P>
<P>
	They instead announced new guidelines to assure JAMA's  
independence and praised the spirit of solidarity among board 
members, Anderson and the search committee that drew up the 
guidelines and is looking for a new editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Roger Rosenberg, chairman of the search committee, called  
the safeguards ``the issue we felt was most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Editorial independence is essential,'' Rosenberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will not have solo firing authority under the new  
guidelines. A firing would have to be approved by the newly created 
oversight board and two-thirds of the AMA's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	The oversight board will be composed of six members from outside  
the AMA, and one member of the association's senior management. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerome Kassirer, editor of the New England Journal of  
Medicine, had criticized Lundberg's firing as irrational and inept. 
He said the oversight board is a good idea, if it truly serves as a 
buffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question will be: Are they going to be advocates for  
the editor in chief or advocates for the AMA policies?'' Kassirer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who had been JAMA editor for 17 years, is now editor  
in chief for an online medical information site, medscape.com. He 
did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Americans Give $175B to Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans opened their pocketbooks wider in  
1998, donating nearly $17 billion more to charities than the 
previous year, according to a new report on charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy, low inflation, a growth in personal wealth and  
more sophisticated fund raising helped fuel the 10.7 percent 
increase and raise overall charitable giving to $174.52 billion, 
said Ann E. Kaplan, research director for the American Association 
of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
	When adjusted for inflation, the increase was 9 percent, she  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals donated the bulk of the money, giving $134.84  
billion in 1998, an increase of 9.7 percent. Foundations gave the 
next highest amount with $17.09 billion, up 22.9 percent; bequests 
accounted for $13.62 billion, a 7.8 percent increase, and 
corporations gave $8.97 billion, up 9.3 percent, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third year in a row charitable giving increased  
dramatically -- it rose 11.8 percent in 1996 and 13.7 percent in 
1997 -- with religious organizations and denominations continuing to 
get the biggest piece of the pie. They took in $76.06 billion, a 
4.6 percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the increase may seem small at a time when more people  
say they are attending religious services, Kaplan noted that those 
who give to religious charities are also giving more to other 
charities. ``They are not abandoning religious contributions,'' she 
said. ``If anything, they appear to be broadening their charitable 
horizons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics for the ``Giving USA 1998'' report come from  
deductions listed on tax returns as well as reports submitted by 
more than 3,000 charities. Figures will be adjusted when late 
filing taxes are due later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributions in four nonprofit areas rose more than 20 percent.  
Civil rights and public affairs groups had the biggest increase, 
jumping 29.5 percent to $10.86 billion. Wildlife and environmental 
organizations took in $5.25 billion, up 28.3 percent; human service 
organizations got $16.08 billion, up 27 percent; and health 
organizations, including hospitals and major disease-related 
organizations, received $16.89 billion, up 20.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving to education, mostly to university capital campaigns, was  
up 10.8 percent to $24.56 billion and contributions to 
international affairs rose 9.3 percent to $2.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifts to foundations rose from $14.56 billion in 1997 to $16.94  
billion in 1998 and Kaplan said they may rise even further when 
other tax data is analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	The only decline was in the arts and cultures category, which  
dropped slightly by 0.8 percent. Kaplan said small, community-based 
arts programs and large institutions reported getting increases of 
6 percent from 1997 to 1998 but mid-sized organizations have had 
trouble fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these groups have been around less than 10 years and  
don't have well organized fund-raising efforts,'' Kaplan said.

<HEADLINE> Manhunt Caps Weird Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Political professionals in Louisiana say the  
race to replace Bob Livingston in Congress is unlike anything 
they've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Few campaigns, after all, start after an admission of adultery,  
move through a primary with a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and 
peak with a manhunt that takes one candidate to remote forests on 
the other side of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	For former Gov. Dave Treen, finding his grandson in an Oregon  
wilderness on Wednesday eclipsed his runoff contest with state Rep. 
David Vitter. It was, he said, ``better than getting elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How this latest twist might affect the outcome in Saturday's  
special election is unknown, chiefly because there isn't much 
precedent for a candidate ditching his campaign just days before 
the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Livingston thing was weird, and the situation with Treen's  
grandson just stopped the campaign with five days to go. That 
doesn't happen too often,'' said Joe Walker, a New Orleans 
political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might make a few people feel that they should vote for  
Treen because the guy was willing to give up his campaign to save 
his grandson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treen and Vitter, both conservative white Republicans, were  
running neck-and-neck before Treen pitched in to help in the search 
for Jason Neville, who was found in good shape by a news helicopter 
that spotted him flashing metal camping pans as it passed over the 
rugged Columbia Gorge. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville had set out alone last Thursday to celebrate his 20th  
birthday and got lost in the steep ridges and cliffs along the 
Columbia River about 40 miles east of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen planned to return today to resume a campaign that never  
really shut down after he left on Tuesday. His telephone, mail and 
television appeals continued to run during a manhunt that was 
exhaustively covered by the local media. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from a possible sympathy dividend for Treen, some voters  
said the unusual episode in Oregon may have little impact in a race 
where the divide between the issues is about as thick as a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has already made their decision,'' said Joel Hill, a  
voter who lives in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie. ``You're not 
looking at a major disparity in political philosophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, about the only major distinction between the two  
conservatives is their age. Treen, at 70, boasts he can hit 
Congress running, having served seven years in the U.S. House in 
the 1970s -- seven years that Speaker Dennis Hastert has said would 
count in seniority ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter, at 38, argues he is young enough to build the kind of  
seniority that Livingston amassed to ensure the 1st Congressional 
District gets its full share of Congressional largesse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The traditional things you get fireworks over can't exist in a  
situation like this,'' said Ed Renwick, head of the Loyola 
University Institute of Politics. ``It's not like there's a liberal 
and a conservative, black and white, man or woman. You've got none 
of the differences that make a very lively campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issues haven't been very lively, but the circumstances of  
the race in the suburban New Orleans district haven't been dull. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, a 21-year House veteran and protege of Treen, was  
poised to inherit the speakership from Newt Gingrich when he 
abruptly resigned and declared himself an adulterer to keep Larry 
Flynt from doing so in Hustler magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the primary election, white supremacist and former KKK leader  
David Duke placed third among nine candidates after bombarding 
voters with phone messages against the Kwanzaa holiday and the 
creation of a stamp honoring Malcolm X. He broadcast TV spots 
criticizing federal laws that ban segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	The special elections also were oddly scheduled, with the  
primary during the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the 
runoff on the Saturday that opens the long Memorial Day weekend. 
Turnout is expected to be low. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill predicted the vote in this predominantly white,  
middle-class district will be split by age and money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The older, landed people are going to vote for Treen and the  
younger ones are going to vote for Vitter,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Avs Look for Missing Sakic, Fleury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Where have you gone, Joe Sakic? And you, Theo  
Fleury? 
</P>
<P>
	While the Colorado Avalanche were forging a five-game playoff  
winning streak, no one seemed to notice the performanc of two of 
their most prolific scorers. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Avalanche bowed to the Dallas Stars 4-2 Monday  
night to square the Western Conference final series at one game 
apiece, the finger-pointing began. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's assist Monday night was his first point in the last  
five playoff games, dating back to Game 3 of the Detroit series on 
May 11. Sakic has just one goal and one assist in the last eight 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some great chances as a line,'' Fleury said Tuesday.  
``The puck is just not going in, for some reason. We're too good of 
players not to get on the scoreboard. We're doing all the right 
things. It's just a matter of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury said linemate Milan Hejduk, a rookie who scored his sixth  
goal of the playoffs Monday night, ``is playing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the series shifts to Denver for Game 3 tonight, the Avalanche  
were eager for Sakic and Fleury to regain their scoring touch, as 
well as for the defense to cut down on the number of shots faced by 
their goalie, Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas enjoyed a 45-19 advantage in shots on goal in Monday's  
game, including a 15-1 edge in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with desperation and a street-fighter mentality, the  
Stars delivered a message: This will be a long, tough playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a desperate team and they had to be,'' Fleury said,  
referring to the Stars' situation after losing Game 1 at home. 
``They threw everything at us in the third period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, this is the semifinals,'' Dallas center  
Guy Carbonneau said. ``You play each shift as if it were your 
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano scored goals in the Stars'  
dominating third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally found some seams and cracks through the defense to  
get to the net,'' Modano said. ``The second and third shots were 
finally there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said his team's more aggressive  
approach on Monday night was by design. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for us to play well, we have to press the pace,'' he  
said. ``It doesn't matter who we're playing. We've played two 
pretty good hockey games. Unfortunately, we lost the first one. I 
thought the difference was we played with desperation, knowing our 
status. We took some chances and we didn't get hurt by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing a team as good and as skilled as Colorado,  
you can take one of two attitudes -- either stand back and wait and 
hope that's going to work out, or press the issue. Obviously, by 
the way we played, we've made the decision to press the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a suffocating defensive game, Modano felt as if he  
was turned loose on Monday night. That observation drew a chuckle 
from Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might think he's been turned loose, but he's not,'' the  
coach said. ``This is just a different series. There just is no 
play in the neutral zone. It's in one end or the other. The games 
are very similar to the way we play against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the series against St. Louis, there was a tremendous amount  
of counter-attacking and neutral-zone play. In this series, there 
is none. So the feeling is that there's a lot of room because 
you're coming through that area between the two blue lines with a 
lot of speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain Colorado's somewhat lackluster play in Game 2,  
Hitchcock said, ``They got what they wanted. They got the split in 
our building. Now, we have to come in here and do that, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avs forward Peter Forsberg said his team must play ``much  
smarter, much harder. We have to be the ones that play desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lost forward Benoit Hogue for the remainder of the  
playoffs after he suffered torn knee ligaments in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, meanwhile, were hopeful of getting back center  
Stephane Yelle, their best penalty-killer. Yelle has been sidelined 
since May 3 with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably going to be a game-time decision,'' Colorado  
coach Bob Hartley said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Miffed Over Parody Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's treatment of a Web  
site that parodies politics has backfired in a Texas-sized way. 
</P>
<P>
	Zack Exley, a 29-year-old Somerville, Mass., resident, grabbed  
the unused ``www.gwbush.com'' domain name several months ago and 
put up a site satirizing a Bush presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, considered the front-runner for the GOP nomination next  
year, filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission and 
denounced Exley as ``a garbage man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parody George W. Bush Web site has gotten 6,451,466 hits  
during the first 25 days of May, thanks in part to the story's 
front-page treatment by The New York Times online edition, Exley 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the real George W. Bush Web site has gotten about  
30,000 hits in May, according to Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes politicians don't know when to shut up,'' said  
Michael Goldman, a political consultant working with Democratic 
presidential contender Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush might have been wiser to emulate his father, George Bush,  
who has good-naturedly mimicked impressionist Dana Carvey's 
imitations of himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the younger Bush complained about the Web site during a  
news conference last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ought to be limits to freedom,'' he said. ``We're aware  
of the site, and this guy is just a garbage man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exley, an independent computer consultant, said he has since  
received hundreds of e-mails running 2-to-1 against what he 
characterized as Bush's assault of freedom of speech on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The parody Web site looks like the real ``www.georgewbush.com''  
Web site. Unlike Bush's site, however, the parody prominently 
displays Bush's ``limits to freedom'' quotation and describes him 
as an ``unsuccessful Texas businessman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said the George W. Bush Presidential Exploratory  
Committee was worried that people would misconstrue the parody Web 
site for the genuine article. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is not that people are viewing it, but that they're  
viewing it in the right context,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said she recently got a phone call from a reporter  
working for a major metropolitan newspaper asking for a comment on 
Bush's proposal to ``free all grown-ups from prison,'' a feature of 
the parody site. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst called the flap much ado about nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is still relatively insignificant,'' said  
University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato. He said most 
people get their information about politics from television, 
newspapers and magazines, and friends and families, in that order.

<HEADLINE> House Backs Center for Missing Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federally funded clearinghouse that helps  
locate missing or mistreated children would receive $10 million a 
year over the next four years under a bill the House passed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 414-1 for the measure, and differences between  
that proposal and similar legislation the Senate passed last month 
must be worked out before Congress sends a bill to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills would free the National Center for Missing and  
Exploited Children, created by Congress in 1984, from having to 
apply yearly for federal grants it relies on to help run a national 
resource center and a 24-hour telephone hot line from its 
headquarters in nearby Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization received $8.1 million in federal aid this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Since its creation, the center has worked with the FBI, the  
Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies to help find 
more than 40,100 missing children, according to the proposed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., the House sponsor, said guaranteed  
annual appropriations for fiscal year 2000, which starts Oct. 1, 
through fiscal 2004 will ensure the center can focus on helping 
families of missing children without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, voted against the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., recognized Missing  
Children's Day by asking his House colleagues and other computer 
users to create links from their World Wide Web pages to the 
``CyberTipline.'' The site, run by the missing children's center, 
accepts reports about the sexual exploitation of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress needs to do its part to find missing children and  
protect America's kids from exploitation,'' Watts said. ``It's 
critical that we recognize and promote the positive uses of 
America's fastest-growing medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said the site received ``thousands of tips that have led  
to numerous arrests and reunited hundreds of missing children with 
their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 905 and S. 249. CyberTipline can be found at

<HEADLINE> Museum Guns Didn't Belong to James </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEARNEY, Mo. (AP) -- Jesse James aficionados never give up.  
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, a team of scientists exhumed remains from James'  
grave in Kearney and used DNA testing to conclude that the outlaw 
was indeed the man buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, extensive research by the director of the Jesse James Farm  
and Museum has shown that two guns James supposedly used in a train 
robbery actually were made after he died. 
</P>
<P>
	The error was discovered after a tourist asked an innocuous  
question about one of the guns, a Winchester rifle, prompting 
museum director Elizabeth Gilliam Beckett to review records. It 
turned out that the rifle and a Colt .45 revolver didn't have 
authenticity documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Using serial numbers, Ms. Beckett discovered the revolver was  
made in 1883 and the rifle was made in 1890. James was shot to 
death in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public needed to know these weren't Jesse's guns,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Four Guards Charged in Inmate Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Four prison guards were charged Wednesday  
in the beating death of an inmate who allegedly angered them by 
repeatedly crying out for his methadone treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards pleaded innocent in the death of Thomas Pizzuto, who  
died six days after entering the Nassau County jail to serve three 
months for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzuto, 38, a recovering heroin addict, had a seizure three  
days after the alleged beating and died. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 90-day sentence turned into a death sentence,'' Pizzuto  
family attorney Peter Neufeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	All four guards were released on $500,000 bond. Lawyers for the  
men said they would be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels he will be vindicated,'' said defense lawyer Edward  
Jenks, representing Officer Ivano Bavaro. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavaro, along with fellow jail guards Edward Valazquez and  
Patrick Regnier, were charged with two counts of federal civil 
rights violations. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the indictment, Bavaro served as lookout when  
Valazquez and Regnier went to the inmate's cell and beat him 
repeatedly on Pizzuto's second day in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	After the alleged Jan. 8 beating, Pizzuto was left in his jail  
cell over the weekend to let his injuries heal, his family claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, was charged as an accessory after  
the fact for allegedly doctoring a report of the death to claim 
Pizzuto suffered his injuries in a shower room fall. The maximum 
sentence for the charge is 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	All four officers remain on modified duty at the jail pending  
trial. Their weapons were taken away, and they are permitted no 
contact with inmates.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Dairy Recalls Cheese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Missouri dairy is recalling 135 pounds of  
Colby cheese that may be contaminated with listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningland Dairy Farms Inc., based in Mountain View, Mo., said  
Tuesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has temporarily 
closed its cheese-making operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, North Carolina officials reported a recall of a  
quantity of imported cheese after tests found evidence of the same 
bacteria in it. Routine testing at a grocery store revealed the 
Listeria monocytogenes pathogen in Pinna Ricotta Salata Cheese, 
made with 100 percent sheep's milk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri recall involved Morningland Dairy Chives Colby  
Cheese, which authorities said should be returned for refunds to 
retailers who sold it. The cheese is made from raw milk, and 
contamination showed up in tests by federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to sell anything that's going to make anyone  
sick,'' Morningland owner Margie Reiners said today. She said the 
family-run dairy would reopen when the tests come back negative. 
Test results are expected to take about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria can cause serious, potentially fatal, infections in  
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. It 
also can cause miscarriages. Healthy people, however, usually 
suffer short-term symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal 
pain and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled Colby cheese, sold in vacuum-packed plastic bags,  
carries the code A259 on the label. It was sold by mail and in 
retail stores in Missouri, Colorado, Utah, Illinois, Arizona, 
Tennessee, New York, California, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania 
and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses have been reported from the cheese recalled in  
North Carolina, which was imported from Italy distributed by Anco 
Foods of Fairfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Protection Division of the North Carolina  
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services advised consumers 
not to use the product in packaging bearing the code ``Sell by Sep 
18, 99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cheese also may have been distributed in South Carolina,  
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Abdullah: Palestinians Key to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- In a clear effort to persuade Syria  
not to make a separate peace with Israel, Jordan's King Abdullah 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat emphasized Wednesday the 
importance of Palestinians to all Middle East peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration by the two leaders was an important coup for  
Arafat, who is scrambling to head off a separate Israeli-Syrian 
agreement he fears will isolate and weaken him in future 
negotiations with the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	The two nations ``consider the Palestinian track as the heart of  
the peace process, including the right of the Palestinians to 
establish their own independent state with Jerusalem as its 
capital,'' said the statement, read after the new monarch's first 
visit to the Palestinian areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its neighbors, Israel has negotiated permanent peace  
agreements with Jordan and Egypt and an interim agreement with the 
Palestinians. Syria and Lebanon are still technically at war with 
Israel. An agreement with Syria would automatically include 
Lebanon, where Syria is the main powerbroker. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, who has long had poor relations with Syrian President  
Hafez Assad, has been in touch with Arab leaders since moderate 
Ehud Barak won Israeli elections last week. Barak's win promoted 
hopes of a thaw in the peace process frozen by the current 
hard-line prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Arafat last week, Egyptian President Hosni  
Mubarak called for a summit comprising the Palestinians, 
Jordanians, Egyptians, Syrians and Lebanese to coordinate peace 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Syrians have yet to reply, a move that has frustrated  
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, who pledged before the elections to revive all tracks of  
the peace process, has appeared more flexible on the Syria-Lebanese 
tracks since winning power. 
</P>
<P>
	In his victory speech, Barak outlined difficult ``red lines'' he  
says the Palestinians must accept. He said Israel would not return 
to its pre-1967 borders and would not relinquish sovereignty over 
disputed Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, his aides have said the ``depth of the peace'' with  
Syria will match ``the depth of the withdrawal'' from the Golan 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Syrians have welcomed Barak's victory in cautiously worded  
statements nonetheless remarkable for a regime that has 
traditionally professed to see no difference between Israeli 
moderates and hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah fears neglecting the Palestinians would result in a  
backlash that could engulf his kingdom, where Palestinians are the 
majority. Speaking to U.S. Jewish leaders this week, he warned of 
an outbreak of new tensions if Palestinians don't see results soon. 
</P>
<P>
	His joint declaration with Arafat was an early sign that he is  
forging a path separate from his father, who died in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement's explicit recognition of a Palestinian right to a  
capital in Jerusalem appeared to back away from past Jordanian 
claims to the city.

<HEADLINE> Bit Japan Telecom's Profits Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's  
biggest telecommunications company, said Wednesday that its profits 
more than doubled last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT said consolidated net profit soared to 602.69 billion yen,  
or $4.94 billion, in the year ended March 31, up from 289.86 
billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to 9.73 trillion yen, or $79.83 nillion, from 9.45  
trillion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong showing stemmed largely from strong growth by its  
mobile phone unit, NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., and a 
one-time gain of 823.9 billion yen from the sale of shares in the 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	That offset a slump in its mainstay fixed-line private and  
public phone service business due to Japan's prolonged recession 
and the growing popularity of making calls with mobile phones, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also credited discounting efforts and demand for  
Internet-based and other data communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the stellar performance in fiscal 1998, NTT expects to  
sink into the red in the current business year. It forecast a loss 
of 133 billion yen on sales of 10.24 trillion yen for this fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company didn't give a reason for the forecast.  
</P>
<P>
	NTT is vying with London-based Cable &AMP; Wireless for control of  
Japanese long-distance carrier International Digital Communications 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, NTT will turn itself into a holding company and split  
its business operations into two regional carriers and a 
long-distance carrier.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Recommends Autopilot Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The autopilot system in the Boeing MD-11  
jetliner should be modified to prevent severe reactions when pilots 
try to make flight course changes while the automatic flight system 
is engaged, the National Transportation Safety Board believes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration, board  
Chairman Jim Hall said overreactions caused severe pitching during 
two incidents in 1996 and 1997, seriously injuring four passengers 
and a flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing Co., which assumed the MD-11 aircraft when it bought  
McDonnell Douglas in 1997, has warned of the potential problem in 
flight crew operating manuals. But the safety board wants the FAA 
to order that Boeing place the warning in its agency-approved 
Airplane Flight Manual and that all MD-11 operators place the 
warning in their corporate aircraft operating manuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Boeing should also modify the autopilot system to  
prevent upsets when manual control inputs are made while the 
autopilot is engaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accidents raise concerns about the warning information and  
training provided to MD-11 pilots regarding proper use of the 
autopilot system that the Federal Aviation Administration should 
address,'' Hall wrote Tuesday in a formal safety recommendation to 
FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Les Dorr said: ``We just got the recommendations  
and as always we'll be considering them very carefully.'' In the 
vast majority of cases, the agency takes the action recommended by 
the safety board. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boeing spokeswoman in Long Beach, Calif., withheld comment  
until seeing the order. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-11 is a three-engine wide-body jet that is the upgrade  
for the widely used McDonnell Douglas DC-10. A Swissair MD-11 
crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia last year, killing all 229 
aboard, but there is no indication that accident was caused by an 
autopilot problem. In that case, the pilots had reported smoke in 
the cockpit 16 minutes before they crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the incidents that concerned the safety board occurred on  
July 13, 1996, as an American Airlines MD-11 flew over Westerly, R. 
I., en route from London to Kennedy Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the plane descended with its autopilot engaged, the  
captain became concerned it would not level off at its assigned 
altitude. The first officer adjusted a pitch wheel, which did not 
stop the descent, so the captain pulled back on the control stick. 
</P>
<P>
	The airplane experienced an immediate upward pitch of 2.3 times  
the weight of gravity. Several oscillations followed. One passenger 
was seriously injured and one passenger and two flight attendants 
suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The second incident occurred June 8, 1997, as a Japan Airlines  
MD-11 flew near Nagoya, Japan, on a flight from Hong Kong to 
Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, as the plane descended with the autopilot engaged,  
the captain became concerned that it would exceed its maximum 
operating speed. He grabbed the control stick and pulled back, 
triggering a series of pitch changes that ranged from adding 2.78 
times the weight of gravity to reducing it by one-half the weight 
of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
	Three passengers and a flight attendant received serious  
injuries.

<HEADLINE> Tigers First Baseman on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers placed slumping first baseman  
Tony Clark on the 15-day disabled list today with a ligament sprain 
in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred when Clark followed through on a swing  
Tuesday night during the Tigers' 5-3 loss to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark was back in the starting lineup Tuesday for the first time  
since being hit in the head by a pitch from Cleveland's Jaret 
Wright on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, a notoriously slow starter, is off to the worst start of  
his career, batting just .212 with four home runs and 21 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Clark on the roster, Detroit purchased the contract  
of outfielder Luis Polonia from their Toledo Triple-A club. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonia, 34, is a nine-year veteran who was a non-roster invitee  
to spring training with the Tigers. He was batting .323 with three 
home runs, 22 RBIs and a team-leading 13 stolen bases at Triple-A 
Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonia batted leadoff and was Detroit's designated hitter  
Wednesday against Toronto. It was his first big-league appearance 
since Sept. 29, 1996 with Atlanta.

<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 127.84 yen, down  
from 129.36 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Fritz  
Shurmur is seriously ill and will take a leave of absence, coach 
Mike Holmgren said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fritz has been diagnosed with a serious illness that will  
require a period of extensive treatment,'' Holmgren said in a 
statement. ``It is the hope that the treatment will allow him to 
resume his coaching duties sometime in the future.''

<P>
	Shurmur joined the Seahawks during the offseason after serving  
as the Green Bay Packers' defensive coordinator from 1994-98. 
</P>

<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	

</P>
<P>
	 *In the spotlight:* Alanis Morissette was born in Ottawa,  
Canada, on June 1, 1974. She appeared on the sketch-comedy show, 
``You Can't Do That on Television,'' in 1986. As a teen pop singer 
known as Alanis, she released two albums (in Canada only): 
``Alanis'' (1991) and ``Now Is the Time'' (1992). 
</P>
<P>
	 *Breakthrough:* Morissette released her U.S. debut album,  
``Jagged Little Pill,'' in 1995. The collection of tales about 
youthful anxiety and the search for self-esteem struck a nerve 
among pop-rock fans. The CD sold nearly 28 million copies 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, she won two Grammys for ``Jagged Little Pill'' and two  
more -- for best rock song and female rock vocal performance -- for 
her lyrically raw single ``You Oughta Know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As sales soared, Morissette felt the need to withdraw. She even  
traveled to India in search of spiritual renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:* ``Fame was touted as being something that would give me  
the ultimate happiness, and it didn't. So I basically stepped back 
and sat down and stopped for the first time in my life to see who I 
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Return:* Her album, ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,'' was  
released in 1998. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts. But 
after 22 weeks, the album had slipped to No. 100, with fewer than 4 
million copies sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Grammy for best female rock vocal  
performance went to Morissette for ``Uninvited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Up Next:* Morissette plays the role of God in Kevin Smith's  
film ``Dogma,'' starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Chris Rock.

<HEADLINE> Americans Give $175B to Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans opened their pocketbooks wider in  
1998, donating nearly $17 billion more to charities than the 
previous year, according to a new report on charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy, low inflation, a growth in personal wealth and  
more sophisticated fund raising helped fuel the 10.7 percent 
increase and raise overall charitable giving to $174.52 billion, 
said Ann E. Kaplan, research director for the American Association 
of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
	When adjusted for inflation, the increase was 9 percent, she  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals donated the bulk of the money, giving $134.84  
billion in 1998, an increase of 9.7 percent. Foundations gave the 
next highest amount with $17.09 billion, up 22.9 percent; bequests 
accounted for $13.62 billion, a 7.8 percent increase, and 
corporations gave $8.97 billion, up 9.3 percent, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third year in a row charitable giving increased  
dramatically -- it rose 11.8 percent in 1996 and 13.7 percent in 
1997 -- with religious organizations and denominations continuing to 
get the biggest piece of the pie. They took in $76.06 billion, a 
4.6 percent increase over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the increase may seem small at a time when more people  
say they are attending religious services, Kaplan noted that those 
who give to religious charities are also giving more to other 
charities. ``They are not abandoning religious contributions,'' she 
said. ``If anything, they appear to be broadening their charitable 
horizons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics for the ``Giving USA 1998'' report come from  
deductions listed on tax returns as well as reports submitted by 
more than 3,000 charities. Figures will be adjusted when late 
filing taxes are due later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributions in four nonprofit areas rose more than 20 percent.  
Civil rights and public affairs groups had the biggest increase, 
jumping 29.5 percent to $10.86 billion. Wildlife and environmental 
organizations took in $5.25 billion, up 28.3 percent; human service 
organizations got $16.08 billion, up 27 percent; and health 
organizations, including hospitals and major disease-related 
organizations, received $16.89 billion, up 20.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving to education, mostly to university capital campaigns, was  
up 10.8 percent to $24.56 billion and contributions to 
international affairs rose 9.3 percent to $2.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifts to foundations rose from $14.56 billion in 1997 to $16.94  
billion in 1998 and Kaplan said they may rise even further when 
other tax data is analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	The only decline was in the arts and cultures category, which  
dropped slightly by 0.8 percent. Kaplan said small, community-based 
arts programs and large institutions reported getting increases of 
6 percent from 1997 to 1998 but mid-sized organizations have had 
trouble fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these groups have been around less than 10 years and  
don't have well organized fund-raising efforts,'' Kaplan said.

<HEADLINE> Celtics GM Testifies in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A former Boston Celtics general manager testified  
today that Dr. Gilbert Mudge assured him Reggie Lewis would be able 
to return to basketball after fainting in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he said was that Reggie did not have ... an abnormal  
heart. He did not have a cardiac problem,'' Jan Volk said during a 
malpractice trial stemming from Lewis' subsequent death of a 
cardiac arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stated that he was very confident that Reggie would be able  
to return to competitive NBA play without limitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volk, called as a witness by attorneys for Lewis' widow in the  
fourth week of testimony, said Mudge told him tests had shown 
Lewis' problems were neurological and could have been caused by 
dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked his reaction to the news, Volk replied, ``I hoped he  
was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis died months later, on July 27, 1993, in the Celtics  
practice gym at Brandeis University. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and two consultants, Drs. Mark  
Creager and Peter Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed and 
mistreated her husband. A third consultant settled the case for an 
undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge announced the same optimistic prognosis at a news  
conference when Lewis was released from the hospital. But Volk's 
testimony called into question Mudge's assertions that in private 
he never had ruled out the possibility that Lewis had a heart 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lewis' collapse during a playoff game in April 1993, a  
team of doctors from New England Baptist Hospital assembled by the 
Celtics diagnosed him with a potentially life-threatening, 
career-ending arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, initially  
agreed with the group, but after further tests he told the All-Star 
he had a less-serious neurological condition that causes fainting 
spells. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Volk said Mudge had suggested the doctors from New  
England Baptist incorrectly diagnosed Lewis because their tests 
were faulty. 
</P>
<P>
	Volk testified that Mudge told the Lewises the earlier tests  
``had been calibrated for somebody much shorter, and that when it 
was recalibrated for somebody Reggie's height, the abnormality was 
not shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination by Mudge's lawyer, William Dailey Jr.,  
Volk acknowledged that Mudge told him when Lewis was discharged 
from the hospital that the Celtics would have to continue 
monitoring Lewis' health.

<HEADLINE> Space Station Program for Museums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- When Al Richmond began crossing the country to  
promote the planned international space station, his audiences' 
reaction was often a puzzled ``huh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are just so many other things in the news that have  
taken precedence, they don't realize the wonderful things that are 
happening around them,'' says Richmond, a former NASA employee who 
marketed the space station for Boeing, the project's prime 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the United States and 15 other countries are  
contributing resources and hardware to the multi-billion-dollar 
project that Richmond calls ``a bridge to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When completed in 2004, the orbiting research facility will be  
larger than a football field and will be visible to the unaided eye 
in the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
	But back on Earth, few were getting excited.  
</P>
<P>
	While Richmond pondered the problem, officials at the Bishop  
Museum in Honolulu approached Boeing about designing a program to 
educate museum visitors about the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is Star Station One, a series of discussions and  
multimedia presentations that grew to encompass more than 60 
museums, science centers and planetariums in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The program uses educational materials, exhibits and hands-on  
demonstrations to track the station's progress as astronauts 
assemble it in orbit -- piece by painstaking piece -- during a series 
of 45 space launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Materials are distributed to participating museums to coincide  
with each station mission. The next begins Thursday when space 
shuttle Discovery and its crew of seven are scheduled to blast off 
to deliver 1 1/2 tons of gear to the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for people to know about the station not only  
from an educational standpoint but from an advocacy standpoint,'' 
says Mike Levad, aerospace educator at the Bishop Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Star Station One debuted in November, prior to the launch of the  
first segment of the space station, the Russian-built Zarya module. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing paid $2.2 million to fund the program the first three  
years. In January, Richmond left the company to head up the Star 
Station One Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to 
expanding the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The only stipulation for participating museums is they are  
required to hold at least one workshop annually to instruct 
teachers about how to incorporate information about the space 
station into their lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the future for all of the kids in school right now.  
They're the next designers of the next space station,'' says Susan 
Tortorici, the Star Station One project manager at Space Center 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Levad estimates the program already has reached about 180,000  
people nationwide, and several other countries have expressed 
interest in participating. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Richmond, the true test of the program's success will  
come the next time he addresses a group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before they know it they'll be able to look up and see this  
thing streaking across the horizon,'' he says. ``We'd prefer they 
know about it.''

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Fall 2.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
manufactured goods fell a sharp 2.3 percent in April, the second 
drop in the past three months, led by a steep decline in demand for 
autos and other transportation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable  
goods, items expected to last three or more years, declined by $4.5 
billion last month to a seasonally adjusted $194.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.3 percent decline followed a solid 2.7 percent increase in  
March and was the biggest setback since a 3.9 percent fall in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The big drop off caught analysts by surprise. They had been  
expecting a 0.4 percent gain in durable goods orders for April, 
reflecting strength in the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market, which had suffered four straight losing  
sessions over growing concerns that the U.S. economy might be 
overheating and causing inflation to rise, viewed today's decline 
in factory orders as a welcome sign of a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamental message of these numbers is that the economy  
is undergoing a mild slowdown,'' said economist Jerry Jasinowski, 
president of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``The 
economy is coasting to a more sustainable pace following two 
quarters of unusually strong growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin cautioned against reading too  
much into any one economic report. ``I continue to think that our 
most likely track is what I have said many times before, low 
inflation and solid growth,'' he told reporters at Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	While durable-goods activity is one of the components of the  
Index of Leading Indicators, analysts said they did not believe the 
April drop in orders would be enough to significantly affect that 
report, which has been rising for the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that a global currency crisis has pushed  
one-third of the world into recession, the U.S. economy has been 
forging ahead, bolstered by the lowest unemployment rates in three 
decades and strong consumer spending in such areas as housing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, American manufacturers and farmers have been battered  
by the global trouble as they have suffered steep declines in their 
exports that have sent the U.S. trade deficit to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of export markets and increased competition from  
lower-priced imports has contributed to a drop of more than 400,000 
jobs in manufacturing over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the industries suffering the most has been steel, which  
has seen a flood of cheap imports from countries such as Japan. But 
in today's report, the government offered a glimmer of hope that 
the worst may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary metals, the sector which includes steel, saw orders  
increase by 1.3 percent in April following a 0.6 percent decline in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the 2.3 percent April drop in durable goods orders was  
led by a sharp 12.4 percent fall in demand in the transportation 
sector, which the government said included decreases in all 
components including autos and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the big drop in the transportation, orders would have  
risen by 0.9 percent. That compared to a 2 percent increase 
excluding transportation in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery rose by 3.5 percent in April,  
the fourth increase in this sector in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment were down  
0.7 percent in April following a big 4.5 percent March increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current  
demand, were down 0.6 percent in April after having risen 1.9 
percent the previous month.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Braces China Backlash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tighter export controls on the sale of  
computers and other high-tech products to China could cripple U.S. 
companies seeking to tap markets in the world's most populous 
country without improving national security, industry officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers and free-trade advocates fear that the House  
report detailing 20 years of Chinese espionage against the United 
States could create a backlash that would limit their ability to 
compete with foreign companies already selling computers, chips and 
machine tools in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly committed to protecting U.S. national security  
interests and we're investing millions of dollars to comply with 
U.S. export laws, but the fact is denying sales of computers that 
are widely available from other sources does little to protect 
national security,'' Bill Calder, a spokesman for Intel Corp., said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue for manufacturers is access to one of the world's  
fastest growing markets for high-tech products such as computers, 
cellular telephones and advanced manufacturing equipment. China is 
expected to spend $5.9 billion on personal computers during 1999 
and $15.2 billion in 2002, according to the research firm Dataquest 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The report released Tuesday recommends continued sale to China  
of technology for peaceful purposes and U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox, 
who chaired the investigation panel, said he doesn't want to hinder 
American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also urges the Clinton administration to negotiate  
agreements with other countries to impose the same level of 
restrictions on China trade as the United States and to create a 
system to verify that technology isn't used for military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Calder and others worry that an anxious Congress might decide  
the United States can act alone and impose restrictions 
unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's ability to negotiate multilateral export pacts,  
even with close allies, has diminished since 1994, when Cold 
War-era agreements designed to block technology transfers to the 
Soviet Union were abandoned, said Ivan Eland, a defense analyst 
with the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always tighten up our export controls in general and try to  
lead. Well, nobody ever follows us. Unilateral controls do 
absolutely nothing,'' said Eland. 
</P>
<P>
	Verification programs outlined in the report rarely work, he  
said. During the 1980s, the United States sold mainframe computers 
to South Africa with the understanding they would be for civilian 
use. South Africa foiled inspectors by allowing military users to 
log on by modem and use the mainframes even though they were 
installed at civilian institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to China of computers commonly used in the United States  
and exported freely to most countries have been under tight 
restriction for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Exporters already need a special permit to sell China computers  
equipped with Intel's newest 550 megahertz Pentium III chip. The 
Merced chip, due out in 2000, will push consumer-level technology 
even further past the government's ceiling, said Calder. 
</P>
<P>
	Desktop PCs have become a target of export restrictions in part  
because they have become far more powerful than in the past. More 
worrisome from a national security standpoint is the practice of 
parallel processing -- linking several desktops together to combine 
their computing power. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, chip manufacturers had hoped to see the ceiling lifted  
this year to allow easier export of the newer chips coming on line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The irony of it is we produce microprocessors in the millions  
each month and ship them through literally thousands of dealers all 
over the world,'' said Calder. ``Those other distributors can sell 
without restriction to any other country in the world. So the 
export controls in reality don't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American machine tool manufacturers already lose about $250  
million a year in China sales to European competitors because of 
existing export controls, said Paul Freedenberg, government 
relations director for the Association of Manufacturing Technology. 
The total overseas market for the industry is about $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The association supports controls on equipment that clearly can  
be used to improve China's military capabilities, but greater 
restrictions would only hurt U.S. companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. has a very tight system on most products. What  
happens is the U.S. companies that operate under that system lose 
business to the Europeans. The Europeans basically see it as a 
market opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Delays Payments in Boeing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal court judge today delayed the  
distribution of money in the settlement of a discrimination lawsuit 
against Boeing Co. so that a group objecting to the deal can state 
its case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Coughenour scheduled another hearing in  
the matter Sept. 23 after attorneys take depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing chairman Phil Condit and the Rev. Jesse Jackson announced  
the $15 million settlement of the class-action lawsuit on Jan. 22. 
The deal covers about 12,900 past and present black Boeing workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Alan B. Epstein of Philadelphia, who represents dozens  
of Boeing workers, filed the challenge to the settlement. He has 
argued that the settlement doesn't provide enough money or a means 
of enforcement to prevent future discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, Boeing lawyers have called Epstein's challenge  
``sour grapes'' from a lawyer who was less effective in the case 
``and therefore is not getting as much money in attorney fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The initial suit was filed by 41 Boeing workers who sought at  
least $82 million in damages. Court documents indicate they later 
were told by their lawyers that each would get at least $300,000. 
The maximum award under the settlement is $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar Desper III and Bruce Harrell of Seattle, the lawyers who  
brought the first case on March 17, 1998, would get $3.85 million 
under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein, who filed a separate class-action discrimination suit  
last summer on behalf of seven Boeing Helicopters workers in Ridley 
Township, Pa., would receive $200,000.

He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, a family friend, recalled his excitement

an investor in patents. 
</P>
<P>
	His most famous patent was probably for the ``drinking duck''  
novelty toy known as the Glub-Glub, a whimsical bird that appears 
to drink water from a glass as it bobs back and forth. He paid $800 
for the patent in the 1950s and sold 22 million.

<HEADLINE> Rookies Must Learn in Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League is succeeding in its  
plan to bring young drivers into the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the four who will take the green flag on Sunday, there  
have been 42 first-year starters at Indianapolis since the IRL took 
over in 1996, the largest group of rookies in any four-year span 
since 57 newcomers were in the lineup from 1929-32. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the 1970s, '80s and even the early 90s, when drivers  
such as A.J. Foyt, Johnny Rutherford, Al Unser Sr., Gordon 
Johncock, Mario Andretti and Rick Mears raced year after year, even 
decade after decade, experience is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this bunch of young kids that we have coming on ... they  
grew up driving sprint cars and midgets,'' said Rodger Ward, who 40 
years ago earned the first of his two Indy 500 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you this, that when you learn how to drive a race  
car, coming here and going this fast is a little bit different, but 
the training you get in a midget and sprint car and perhaps in a 
Silver Crown car is really the kind of experience that makes you 
into a damn good race driver,'' said Ward, 78, the oldest living 
former winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years ago, the Indy lineup had a record 260 driver-years  
of experience. Two years ago, after the boycott of many veteran 
Championship Auto Racing Teams drivers and the retirement of most 
of the old guard, the starters had a combined 70 years of previous 
starts at Indy, the fewest in modern Speedway history. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides pole-winner Arie Luyendyk and Roberto Guerrero, each  
making his 15th start; Raul Boesel, in the race for the 11th time; 
Eddie Cheever, making his 10th start; and Scott Goodyear, his 
ninth, no other driver this year has more than four previous 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new guys have all got talent from other arenas, and they  
come from the same place we came from,'' Rutherford said of the 
short-track background of many of today's Indy drivers. ``We all 
did the same bull-ring racing before, and I think it's just a 
mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No rookie has won at Indianapolis since Graham Hill in 1966.  
Guerrero in 1984, Jacques Villeneuve in 1994 and Christian 
Fittipaldi in 1995 finished second; the top rookie each of the past 
three years -- Richie Hearn, Jeff Ward and Steve Knapp -- finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Knapp, Robby Unser, Andy Michner and J.J. Yeley all  
finished among the Top 10, the most since five rookies were among 
the Top 10 in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Speedway president Tony George founded the IRL,  
which prompted the CART boycott, rookies were showing significant 
success at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	After Donnie Allison in 1970, the first rookie to drive the full  
500 miles was Nigel Mansell in 1993. Villeneuve then did it in 
1994, Fittipaldi and Eliseo Salazar matched the feat in 1995, Hearn 
did it in 1996, and Ward and Knapp did it in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A big reason for the rookies' success has been their better  
preparation before practice even begins. The Speedway started the 
annual Rookie Orientation Program in the early '80s. It was 
optional at first, then mandatory. No driver who hopes to qualify 
for the 500 can afford to pass it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all the rookies here in April and they went through  
their tests without the pressure of a lot of cars on the track,'' 
Rutherford said. ``They had a chance to run their tests, get 
through that, get some speed, have a couple of days to run on their 
own and experiment and be with other cars on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once that's out of the way, the newcomers can focus on  
qualifying and the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested previously twice, but this was a good step in the  
progression,'' said John Hollansworth Jr., the fastest rookie 
qualifier, who will start 12th, on the outside of the fourth row. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' said Robby McGehee, who will start 27th, on  
the outside of Row 9. ``I'm at a famous track and a famous race. 
It's been a childhood dream. What more could I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Jeret Schroeder qualified 21st for a start on the outside  
of Row 7. Wim Eyckmans, driving for owner-teammate Cheever, was the 
slowest qualifier and will start from the middle of Row 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's experience has helped me quite a lot,'' the rookie  
from Belgium said. ``He told me to drive like I always do, and do 
what you have to, to qualify. Mentally, it's really hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, as Cheever said, ``The most important thing about the 500  
is to be in it.''

<HEADLINE> TV Execs Discuss Fall Schedules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- We're excited about our new fall schedule.  
Really excited. Really, really excited. It's our best schedule in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, I know we told you that last year. But this year, we mean  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Really.  
</P>
<P>
	That, in a nutshell, is what television executives at seven  
broadcast networks told thousands of advertisers when they unveiled 
their fall schedules last week. That's no surprise; the meetings 
are sales presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	What's really revealing is what these network executives say  
about their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Take away the jokes and glad-handing from the likes of Conan  
O'Brien, Drew Carey and Ray Romano. Take away the glitzy venues 
like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. Take away, even, the posh 
parties and the free booze. It's the sniping that makes this 
frenzied annual ritual fun. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed like such a cozy fraternity when Scott Sassa, NBC West  
Coast president, paid tribute to some of his favorite shows that 
aired on other networks: ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The Simpsons,'' ``Buffy, 
the Vampire Slayer.'' Good programs help all of broadcast 
television, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to hurt each other in order to succeed,'' Sassa  
told the ad executives. 
</P>
<P>
	How sweet. Within a few minutes, that magnanimity was completely  
forgotten. NBC showed a short film with Kathy Griffin of ``Suddenly 
Susan'' that depicted NBC viewers as smart, wine-sipping and 
wealthy urban dwellers who lap up every product they see 
advertised.

	A typical Fox viewer was portrayed as a longhaired motorcycle  
gang member who crushes beer cans on his forehead. ``I don't like 
watching things on TV,'' he said. ``I just like watching things 
blow up.''

	Griffin moved on to Mrs. Crabtree, a befuddled elderly woman in  
a rocking chair watching CBS. This was a none-too-subtle reminder 
that CBS has many of the older, set-in-their-ways viewers that 
advertisers loathe.

<P>
	``If you have your own teeth,'' Griffin said, ``you recognize  
me.''

	CBS president Leslie Moonves didn't see the film, but he heard  
about it. And he seethed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can't they come up with newer jokes than to show an old lady  
on the screen?'' he said. ``Tell Scott he'd better come up with 
some new comedy writers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves quickly lost the high ground, though.  
</P>
<P>
	CBS's presentation was brutal, with some lines making audience  
members wince. Many believed Moonves has a chip on his shoulder 
because CBS, even though it's the new top-rated network, is looked 
down upon as the old-folks network. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves called NBC's Monday night schedule, with ``Suddenly  
Susan'' and ``Veronica's Closet,'' the ``NBC dumping ground for 
failed Thursday night comedies.'' He mocked NBC as the network that 
promoted ``Encore! Encore'' and ``Wind on Water'' as ``must-see 
TV.'' Both flopped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are right up there with, `I'll still respect you in the  
morning,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wham!  
</P>
<P>
	He pointed out that all of CBS's shows have more viewers than  
the high-buzz WB programs, ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' 
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Felicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You may not see many of our stars on the covers of  
magazines,'' he said. ``But then again, we're not in the magazine 
business.'' Time Warner, which owns the WB as well as People and 
Entertainment Weekly, is a magazine publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Pow!  
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Tellem, CBS entertainment president, ridiculed the ABC  
comedy, ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one pizza place that doesn't deliver,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Zap!  
</P>
<P>
	Not every network hit quite so hard. But none hesitated in  
pointing out things that other executives really wished would go 
unsaid. NBC isn't about to show that the ratings for its dominant 
Thursday lineup have slipped alarmingly this year. But a lot of 
other executives had those figures handy. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one thing to unite all the broadcast networks. When a  
CBS executive wanted to encourage advertisers to stay away from 
cable, he brought along a visual aid. This represents the top 10 
shows in an average week on cable, he said, and on cue eight men 
dressed as professional wrestlers hit the Carnegie Hall stage, 
joined by two kids dressed as ``Rugrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guffaw! Look at those poor saps at cable TV. Now THAT'S funny!

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday To Race in Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Silverbulletday will try to foil Charismatic's  
Triple Crown bid in the Belmont Stakes and become the first filly 
to win the race in 94 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's in the Belmont,'' trainer Bob Baffert said by telephone  
today from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a pure athlete, and athletes sometimes do things they  
are not supposed to do,'' owner Mike Pegram said of the decision to 
have Silverbulletday make her debut against colts in the testing 
1 1/2-mile Belmont on June 5. ``We have absolutely nothing to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, winner of 11 of 12 starts and unbeaten in five  
races this year, will be the 21st filly to start in the Belmont. 
The only filly winners were Tanya in 1905 and Ruthless in 1867, the 
first Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said the decision to run Silverbulletday was made after  
she worked six furlongs in 1:10 4-5 Tuesday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She cooled out great after a good, hard work,'' Baffert said.  
``She was playing and bucking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said Silverbulletday will be flown from Kentucky to New  
York on June 2, the day entries are taken for the Belmont. Jerry 
Bailey will ride her for the second time in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, bidding to become the 12th Triple Crown champion  
and first since Affirmed in 1978, also is scheduled to be flown on 
Wednesday from Churchill Downs to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday also was entered in the Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness, but was entered into filly stakes held the day before 
either of those races. She won the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs 
and the Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he second-guessed himself about not running  
Silverbulletday in the Derby or Preakness, Pegram said, ``Not one 
bit. But if I didn't run her in the Belmont, I would be 
second-guessing myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Silverbulletday in the race, owners of the last  
unsuccessful Triple Crown challengers will be represented in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram owns Real Quiet, second to Victory Gallop in last year's  
Belmont. Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of 
Silver Charm, second to Touch Gold in 1997. Menifee is co-owned by 
Arthur Hancock III, co-owner of Sunday Silence, second to Easy Goer 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, 3-year-olds considered set for the Belmont,  
besides Charismatic and Silverbulletday, are Adonis, Best of Luck, 
Lemon Drop Kid, Menifee, Pineoff, Port Bayou, Prime Directive, 
Stephen Got Even and Vison and Verse. 
</P>
<P>
	Listed as possible are Lead Em Home, Patience Game, The Groom is  
Red and Walk That Walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont Stakes is limited to 16 starters. The most in a  
field for one of 14 unsuccessful Triple Crown bids was 13 in 1971 
when Canonero II finished fourth. The biggest field for one of the 
successful Triple Crown bids was seven, three times.

<HEADLINE> Party Head Confirms Clinton's Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton intends to form a  
U.S. Senate exploratory committee and wants to spend part of the 
summer visiting families in upstate New York, the state's 
Democratic Party chief said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seems very exuberant and very excited,'' Judith Hope said.  
``Her commitment seems to be increasing toward this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hope said Mrs. Clinton called her Wednesday morning from  
Florida, where she is vacationing with the president, to ask for 
help in setting up this summer's visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said she doesn't want to do big events,'' Hope said. ``She  
wants to sit in people's living rooms and hear what kind of 
problems they're dealing with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is eyeing the Senate seat being vacated next year  
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, among others, is looking at the race on the Republican 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Mrs. Clinton have said that if she did set up an  
exploratory committee, it would mean she was almost certain to take 
the next step of entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope said Mrs. Clinton told her she planned to ``do a lot of  
first lady things'' after her current Florida vacation, ``and that 
if she is still leaning in the direction that she seems to be, 
which is toward making the race, she would expect to be creating an 
exploratory committee in late June or early July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to Mrs. Clinton had previously laid out similar  
timetables, but Hope's comments mark the first time one of the 
first lady's advisers has been willing to talk publicly about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope's comments came from one day after Robert Gigante, Staten  
Island's party chairman, said Mrs. Clinton had told him at a New 
York City fund-raiser the night before that she would run. 
</P>
<P>
	Gigante first made the remarks in an interview with the Staten  
Island Advance, then told other news organizations the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mrs. Clinton's top adviser, Harold Ickes, said the  
first lady didn't tell Gigante any such thing. Gigante said he and 
his wife were making small talk with Mrs. Clinton when he brought 
up the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ended by saying, `Do you have any good news for Staten  
Island?' and she said, `Yes,''' Gigante reported. ```Does that mean 
that you're running?' And she said, `Yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the exchange, Ickes said that according to Mrs.  
Clinton, the first lady told Gigante that she is thinking it over 
and hasn't decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Told about Hope's comments Wednesday, Ickes said again that the  
first lady had not made a decision about the race. ``This week is a 
big week for her,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not dispute the first lady's likely timetable as laid out  
by Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	While the first lady ponders a Senate bid, she has all but ruled  
out any presidential aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not even in the universe of my thinking,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said during a CBS ``60 Minutes II'' interview airing Wednesday 
night. She acknowledged that people have broached her about the 
idea of her running for president one day, but said she doesn't 
take such suggestions seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not possible, I don't believe,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Marge Schott Speaks Out Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott has decided  
to speak out again, telling a television station that she never 
imagined anyone would call her racist. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott allowed WCPO-TV into her suburban home for an interview  
that aired in part on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, National League spokeswoman Katy Feeney said today  
she was unaware of Schott's comments. Feeney said she would inquire 
into whether baseball had granted permission for the interview to 
take place. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of her current punishment from baseball, Schott is  
barred from giving interviews without baseball's permission. She 
was fined $10,000 by the National League for giving interviews in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott has twice been disciplined by major league baseball for  
inflammatory remarks. She was suspended by baseball's executive 
council for the 1993 season because of ``racially and ethnically 
offensive'' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by WCPO if she ever could have conceived of anyone calling  
her racist, Schott said, ``I wouldn't think so because I know how I 
was raised, I know the way we were brought up and I love people. I 
just like good people and don't like bad people and everybody's 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott agreed to turn day-to-day running of the club over to  
managing executive John Allen in 1996 rather than accept another 
suspension for more inflammatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she agreed to let Allen continue running the club  
while she tries to sell it rather than risk another suspension for 
allegedly using the names of Reds' employees on falsified sales 
records for her auto dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott agreed to sell all but one of her shares to three of the  
team's current limited partners on April 20. Major league baseball 
hasn't yet approved the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why she decided to sell, Schott said, ``I usually don't  
like to give up on anything, but there comes a time when you have 
to do something.''

<HEADLINE> Power Deregulation Plan Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's plan for  
generating competition among electric utilities was roundly 
criticized Wednesday by rural lawmakers who fear it could raise 
rates and hurt service in remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very much like we're being offered a pig in a poke,''  
said Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga. ``Nobody really know what this is 
going to do, if it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A deregulation bill introduced by the administration last month  
would allow all consumers to choose their electric utility by 2003 
unless their states decided after public hearings that they do not 
want the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states already have moved toward deregulating  
rates on their own. But administration officials told a House 
Agriculture subcommittee that federal legislation is needed to 
speed the process, overhaul tax laws and ensure that service 
remains dependable as competition increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department estimates consumers nationwide save $20  
billion a year by 2010, although rates could rise in some areas. 
The legislation provides for a tax that could be used to protect 
rural customers from rate increases and also guarantees that rural 
electric cooperatives would continue to buy federal hydropower at 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``No restructuring plan currently before the Congress is as  
complete or as sensitive to rural concerns as is the president's 
bill. ... One way or another, restructuring is coming,'' said Wally 
Beyer, administrator of the Agriculture Department's Rural 
Utilities Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said rural electric cooperatives could lose some of their  
biggest, most profitable customers to competing utilities. 
``There's going to be cherry-picking, no doubt about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Thune, R-S.D., said it should be left to states decide  
to decide how or whether they deregulate electric rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., expressed fears that rural electric  
co-ops could suffer the same fate as some rural telephone 
exchanges, which have been put up for sale or abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competitive forces do not favor the more remote parts of  
our country but would instead place them at risk,'' Minge said. 
</P>
<P>
	A USDA study that has not been released officially warned that  
deregulation could lead to rate increases in 19 states. USDA's 
chief economist, Keith Collins, told the House Agriculture 
subcommittee on general farm commodities, resource conservation and 
credit that the study was based on a worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	A more optimistic report by the Energy Department says that  
average rates would fall in 45 of the 48 contiguous states. Some 
consumers in Montana, Washington and Oregon would see increases, 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``With appropriate strategies to implement competition, the  
administration believes that even these three states. ... can 
assure benefits from competition to all customer classes, said Mark 
Mazur, the Energy Department's acting policy director.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Pitcher Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays left-hander  
Tony Saunders was taken off the field on a stretcher after injuring 
his upper left arm while throwing a pitch in the third inning 
tonight against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the injury was not immediately known, but Saunders  
was taken to Bayfront Medical Center for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders fell to the ground after making a 3-2 pitch to Juan  
Gonzalez in the third inning. The pitch sailed well wide of the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was delayed 10 minutes as medical personnel immobilized  
Saunders' left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders was making his third start since being recalled from  
Triple-A Durham on May 13. He had been optioned to the minor 
leagues on May 3, just two starts after coming within four outs of 
throwing the Devil Rays' first no-hitter against Baltimore on April 
22. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders, who is 3-3 in nine starts this season, was the Devil  
Rays' first selection in the 1998 expansion draft.

<HEADLINE> Parcells: At Least One More Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite the impending sale of the New  
York Jets, coach Bill Parcells isn't going anywhere for at least 
one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said Wednesday that John Hess, son of the late owner,  
had assured him there will be no changes in the front office 
through the 1999-2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me there'd be nothing that disturbs this season,''  
Parcells said Wednesday at the start of a three-day veterans 
minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I'm worried about is that. He said for me to run the  
operation as I've been running it, and if I need any help from the 
estate in doing that, to let him know. I was comforted a great deal 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, entering the third year of a six-year contract that  
pays him approximately $2.4 million annually, reportedly has a 
clause in the deal that protects him financially if the 
relationship is severed early for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, 57, won't confirm whether he plans to retire following  
the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My contract is explicit,'' he said, declining to elaborate.  
``So, I don't have any concern about that. I told the players that, 
my coaches know that and we're just looking forward to the season. 
I don't foresee any problems.'' 
</P>

	Of his own future, the coach added, ``Write whatever you want. I  
haven't had anything to say about it. I coach every year, and at 
the end of the year I decide what's going on. There's obviously 
going to be some changes here and we'll just have to see what the 
new ownership wants to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Parcells leaves, his successor is expected to be current  
assistant head coach Bill Belichick. When Belichick, the former 
coach of the Cleveland Browns, was hired by Leon Hess in early 
1996, his contract stipulated that he would become head coach when 
Parcells left. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the Jets is being supervised by the investment firm  
of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., with assistance from team president Steve 
Gutman. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about potential bidders, who likely would invest at  
least $500 million for the franchise, has included Cablevision 
chairman Charles Dolan and his brother, Larry, a Cleveland 
attorney, New York Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner, New 
York Mets co-owner Nelson Doubleday and New Jersey Devils owner 
John McMullen, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 79 players who gathered at the Jets complex  
Wednesday said that the pending sale of the team would have little 
effect on their preparation for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I don't think it will make an impact on me at all,  
or I won't let it, anyway,'' Pro Bowl quarterback Vinny Testaverde 
said. ``I don't worry about who's going to be the next owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, Parcells feels that the Hess estate won't  
be in any hurry to get something done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the sense that they're going to be very thorough about  
this,'' Parcells said. ``I don't see anything happening for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they find someone who's as good as the guy we had --  
which would probably be tough to do.''

<HEADLINE> Administration Defends Power Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is defending its  
plan for deregulating electric rates against concerns by rural 
lawmakers it would mean higher bills and poorer service in remote 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``No restructuring plan currently before the Congress is as  
complete or as sensitive to rural concerns as is the president's 
bill. ... One way or another, restructuring is coming,'' said Wally 
Beyer, administrator of the Agriculture Department's Rural 
Utilities Service. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill the administration introduced last month would require  
electric utilities to start competing for customers. All consumers 
would be allowed to choose their utility by 2003 unless their 
states decided after public hearings that they want to continue 
regulating rates. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states already have moved toward deregulating  
rates on their own. But administration officials told a House 
Agriculture subcommittee on Wednesday federal legislation is needed 
to speed the process, overhaul tax laws and ensure that service 
remains dependable as competition increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Thune, R-S.D., said it should be left to states decide  
to decide how or whether they deregulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very much like we're being offered a pig in a poke,''  
said Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga. ``Nobody really know what this is 
going to do, if it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department estimates consumers nationwide would save  
$20 billion a year by 2010, although rates could rise in some 
areas. The legislation provides for a tax that could be used to 
protect rural customers from rate increases and also guarantees 
that rural electric cooperatives would continue to buy federal 
hydropower at cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyer said rural electric cooperatives could lose some of their  
biggest, most profitable customers to competing utilities. 
``There's going to be cherry-picking, no doubt about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A USDA study that has not been released officially warned that  
deregulation could lead to rate increases in 19 states. USDA's 
chief economist, Keith Collins, told the House Agriculture 
subcommittee on general farm commodities, resource conservation and 
credit that the study was based on a worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	A more optimistic report by the Energy Department says that  
average rates would fall in 45 of the 48 contiguous states. Some 
consumers in Montana, Washington and Oregon would see increases, 
the study found.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rose Wednesday, with  
Seoul's key index soaring on a weaker Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
16.29 points, or 0.10 percent, to close at 16,230.52. On Tuesday, 
the average shed 176.26 points, or 1.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic institutional investors were buying some blue chips,  
including Sony Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., but the market generally 
lacked direction, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese  
yen for a second consecutive day on selling by overseas investors, 
retreating from last week's seven-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.10 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.62  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 122.70 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen and easing domestic interest rates fueled a  
strong rally in South Korean stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, the key Kospi index soared 3.1 percent, or 21.36  
points, to 720.05. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is believed to be positive for the price  
competitiveness of South Korean companies, which directly compete 
with Japanese companies in roughly half of their exports. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, stock prices ended a volatile session higher, with  
strong futures-related buying pulling the blue-chip index up near 
the market's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent, or 62.25 points,  
to 12,409.16. It had fallen 0.7 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the higher close, caution over a possible U.S. interest  
rate hike deterred aggressive buying. Hong Kong interest rate 
movements usually follow those of the United States because the 
Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.58  
points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 10,531.09 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rebounded as local and foreign investors picked  
up selected blue chips, which had plunged Tuesday. The SET index 
rose 7.16 points, or 1.6 percent, to 458.21. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell as a recent rally lost steam. The JSX  
Composite Index fell 14.090 points, or 2.3 percent, at 605.787. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares fell as investors cashed in on some  
index-linked stocks. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index fell 4.28 
points, or 0.56 percent, at 753.82 points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares rose ahead of Friday's scheduled release of first  
quarter economic data, which many predict will be favorable. The 
PSE Index rose 19.98 points, 0.8 percent, at 2,390.35. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares prices closed nearly flat, as late  
bargain-hunting lent support to the market. The Straits Times Index 
closed 2.48 points, or 0.1 percent, lower at 1,893.73. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares rose following sharp gains in the banking and  
media sectors, which helped counter widespread losses in some 
mining and energy companies. The All Ordinaries Index rose 7.0 
points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,918.5. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares rose as investors bought back selected technology  
shares amid more optimistic market sentiment. The Weighted Price 
Index rose 9.60 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,426.63. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares rose on gains in local forestry stocks such  
as Fletcher Challenge Ltd. and Carter Holt Harvey Ltd. The NZSE-40 
Capital Index rose 6.10 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,100.60.

<HEADLINE> Bill Russell Honored at Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain went one-on-one  
again Wednesday night, 30 years after they last battled on an NBA 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Their confrontation was verbal and good-natured, and again  
Russell came out on top as many of the NBA's greatest players 
turned out to honor the Hall of Fame center who led the Boston 
Celtics to 11 championships in 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man is greedy,'' Chamberlain said with a smile before the  
carefully orchestrated show, which lasted nearly three hours. ``He 
has 11 rings and 10 fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And two ceremonies at which his uniform number 6 was retired.  
</P>
<P>
	The first came on March 12, 1972, in an empty Boston Garden  
before a game that afternoon. His number was raised to the rafters 
with just a few people participating, the way he wanted it done. 
</P>
<P>
	The second came Wednesday night in a show, emceed by Bill Cosby  
with thousands of paying spectators at the FleetCenter. And plenty 
of other basketball legends -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Bob 
Cousy, Julius Erving, Oscar Robertson, John Havlicek -- were in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell and Celtics vice chairman Red Auerbach re-raised the  
banner bearing Russell's number. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Russell told the audience, ``I am terribly, terribly  
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things that I did with my team were what I thought I  
should do and the life that I led is the life that I thought I 
should lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football great Jim Brown also was there.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is a person of great character,'' Brown said of Russell.  
``If you can't stand the brutal truth, don't talk to Bill 
Russell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Russell's 11 titles, seven came against Chamberlain-led  
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an integral part of my career,'' said Russell, 65. ``He  
made me better and I made him better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they made the game of basketball better.  
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said the tribute to Russell is overdue now that  
Michael Jordan has left the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really haven't appreciated him. Maybe this time it's  
appropriate,'' he said. ``Because of the extraordinary dominance of 
Michael Jordan, people have gotten pretty myopic about what 
happened in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven championships in a row. That says it all.''  
</P>
<P>
	NBA commissioner David Stern said, though, ``we've always had a  
good historical perspective on Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll step out on a limb and say in a couple of 100 years, no  
one is going to win 11 championships in 13 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said he didn't want his number retired in 1972, but  
Auerbach, his former coach, insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said he agreed to do it again Wednesday so he could be  
linked publicly with teammates whose numbers also hang on banners 
from the FleetCenter rafters and to raise money for the National 
Mentoring Partnership, a group that arranges for adults to guide 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	A proud, private man, Russell -- Boston's first black sports star  
-- lived in the largely white Boston suburb of Reading, where his 
house was vandalized. He was perceived by many as aloof and didn't 
sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had any problem with the fans,'' Russell said  
Wednesday. But how did he feel about others in the Boston area? 
</P>
<P>
	``The opposite of love is not hate,'' he said. ``The opposite of  
love is indifference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players at Wednesday night's ceremony hid their  
admiration for Russell, a defensive wizard who averaged only 15.1 
points per game -- to go with 22.5 rebounds -- but measured his 
success in victories and titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admired Bill when I was in high school,'' Abdul-Jabbar said.  
``I could not have had the career that I had if it had not been for 
people like Bill who showed us how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to be the first guy to play above the rim,'' said  
Erving, who spent a lot of time up there. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell retired after the 1968-69 season. In his last game,  
Chamberlain outscored him 18-6 and outrebounded him 27-21. But the 
Celtics won that seventh game of the NBA Finals 108-106, giving 
Russell his final championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the best things that happened to me was Wilt coming  
into the league,'' Russell said. ``I realized if I didn't improve, 
I'd be embarrassed every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on Wednesday night, they were together again as Russell  
finally had his number retired in front of thousands of cheering 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful testament to the fact that legends don't  
die,'' said Dave Cowens, who replaced Russell as Boston's center. 
``They come back.''

<HEADLINE>  Congress Probing Chinese Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two principal authors of a congressional  
report on Chinese espionage said today the Clinton administration 
should step up efforts to get U.S. allies to agree on tighter 
restrictions on technology exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the panel that  
investigated Chinese espionage, said tougher controls on technology 
exports are needed, but unilateral U.S. action would only prompt 
China to get the technology elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be the worst of all possible worlds,'' Cox told a  
House International Relations subcommittee, because China would 
still get the technology but U.S. businesses and workers would be 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report concluded there has been extensive theft of  
nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons labs by China over 20 years, but 
said China also has obtained valuable military information and 
technology from commercial purchases of high-powered computers and 
civilian satellite launching technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said the most important of 36 recommendations from the  
committee was for the United States to enlist its allies, including 
Japan and Europeans, to tighten technology export controls when 
trading with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the China espionage panel's  
ranking Democrat, agreed. The two briefed the International 
Relations subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific on the 700-page 
report made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report, chronicling 20 years of Chinese espionage, is  
expected to be used as a springboard for an array of legislative 
initiatives in Congress in the coming weeks, including a push for 
new export control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the International  
Relations Committee, said administration efforts to embrace China 
as a ``strategic partner'' were ``naive ... misguided ... and 
wishful thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must recognize the very different values held by the  
current Chinese government and account for them'' when considering 
trade and other matters, said Gilman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are pledging to pass legislation on everything from  
tightening restrictions on foreign scientists visiting national 
weapons labs, to giving the Energy Department freer rein to conduct 
polygraphs, to throwing more money into security efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, nine committees of Congress are engaged in various  
inquiries into Chinese spying or security lapses at the Energy 
Department's nuclear weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks said today the Cox committee found no evidence that any  
administration official changed his or her behavior because of 
Chinese campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the whole question of did anybody make a decision based on  
political pressure, we found noting of that sort,'' Dicks said on 
NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, also interviewed on NBC, said  
the committee report was balanced and statesmanlike and added: ``We 
are fixing the problem. ... We've taken some dramatic 
counterintelligence measures to beef up security at the labs. ... 
Right now I don't believe there is penetration'' of security. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are showing an eagerness to beef up the Energy  
Department's security and counterintelligence budgets. A Senate 
subcommittee approved an additional $53 million Tuesday for 
anti-espionage activities at the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Various measures to tighten security at U.S. weapons labs and to  
put new restrictions on technology exports to China are headed for 
congressional votes, some perhaps as early as this week as Congress 
considers defense spending bills in both chambers. The Senate also 
is expected to act soon on legislation that would bar some Chinese 
officials from traveling in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has a duty to find out what happened in the past,  
what's occurring now and what should be done to hold those involved 
responsible for their reckless and illegal actions,'' House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Tuesday in a statement responding to 
the Chinese espionage report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report concluded that China stole information on the  
United States' most advanced thermonuclear weapons over 20 years of 
espionage and that thefts ``almost certainly continue to the 
present.'' It also said the information stolen helped modernize 
China's nuclear program and that some U.S. weapon design technology 
may end up being incorporated in China's next generation of nuclear 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has a clear duty to get the bottom of the facts, find  
out what happened and what is still going on, and to demand 
accountability from those responsible,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., 
R-Okla.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Robbie Knievel's jump over a gorge at the Grand  
Canyon last week has landed him a place among some of Las Vegas' 
favorite entertainers and historical figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel -- still on crutches -- was inducted Tuesday into the  
Casino Legends Hall of Fame at the Tropicana Hotel, where other 
members include Frank Sinatra, Howard Hughes and Siegfried and Roy. 
The banged-up bike Knievel used will be put in a glass case. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, the son of daredevil Evel Knievel, suffered two cracked  
ribs and a sprained ankle in the 231-foot jump over a 1,500-foot 
Grand Canyon gorge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I do is crazy to the normal person,'' Knievel said.  
``The main reason I do it is to show people how fast a bike can go. 
It is a spiritual, mental and physical feeling before a jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel said his next stunt -- a jump over 25 pickup trucks  
parked side by side at the Pikes Peak International Raceway in 
Colorado -- is planned for July 24.

 *AP Corrects Watercooler Item    	
</P>
<P>
	In a May 25 Watercooler business column, The Associated Press  
erroneously reported that a survey on children who care for their 
elderly parents was done by the employment consulting firm 
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Perkins Will Retire, If He Has Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The old man has one more goal.  
</P>
<P>
	Sam Perkins, the oldest Indiana Pacer, has appeared in more  
playoff games without winning the championship than all but two 
players in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pacers beat the New York Knicks for the Eastern  
Conference title, he will be one series away from reaching his 
ultimate goal. And also four victories away from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running on empty now. I'm running on fumes,'' the 15-year  
veteran admitted after practice Wednesday. ``If we win this all, 
I'll never be back here again. What for?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 series against the Knicks begins Sunday in Market  
Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing as long as I can to obtain this ring and fell  
short a couple of times, so it makes sense (to retire),'' said 
Perkins, who will turn 38 next month. ``I wouldn't stay around just 
for the money. The money's good, don't get me wrong, but I would 
retire if we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins was in the Western Conference finals four times with  
Dallas, the Lakers and Seattle. The Sonics lost in the championship 
series to the Chicago Bulls in 1996, and Perkins left Seattle as a 
free agent after last season and signed a two-year contract with 
the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got Sam to help us to win some regular-season games, but we  
got him mostly for the playoffs,'' coach Larry Bird said. ``If he 
can come in and hit some shots that helps us along the way, it just 
makes our bench that much stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins played in 48 of the 50 games and averaged a career-low 5  
points. He is averaging 4.7 points through seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indiana's sweeps of Milwaukee and Philadelphia in the first  
two rounds, Perkins has appeared in 135 career playoff games. The 
only players who have been in more postseason games without winning 
the championship are Utah's John Stockton (156) and Karl Malone 
(146), and they could face Perkins and the Pacers by beating 
Portland and then San Antonio in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some of the younger players are looking to Perkins  
for advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hang out with him a lot,'' said rookie Al Harrington, who  
was drafted last year out of high school and is the youngest Pacer. 
``Look at his longevity. That's what it's all about. He's been 
playing all these years, and that's the one thing I always ask him, 
`What did you do to stay in shape, stay healthy, all this time?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The series against New York is the fifth time in seven years the  
Pacers have played the Knicks in the playoffs. Each team has won 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in situations like that,'' Perkins said. ``I've  
watched some series with them. I'm in the trenches with them, so 
even though it's new to me as far as the rivalry, it's still the 
same old hat as far as going out there and being competitive. I had 
some battles out in the West with some rival teams all the time.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Chief Testifies on Collections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax collections by the IRS won't be  
jeopardized by broad new taxpayer rights, but they will be hurt if 
Congress fails to provide the agency with enough money to do its 
job, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti says. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Internal Revenue Service employees has dropped  
13.7 percent since 1993, making it harder to keep up enforcement 
actions while implementing a 1998 reform law emphasizing taxpayer 
service first, Rossotti told a congressional panel Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Rossotti noted that the number of returns with over  
$100,000 in income has risen 56 percent over the past five years, 
while the number of those returns subjected to audits is down 21 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The path that the IRS has taken cannot continue,'' he said.  
``Doing business the same way while the economy grows and resources 
decline will eventually undermine the whole tax system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that only about 2 percent of the $1.7 trillion in  
taxes collected this year come from enforcement actions, making it 
imperative to stress improvement in service for the 98 percent of 
taxpayers who comply willingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we have a choice to make between effective tax  
collection and fair treatment of taxpayers,'' Rossotti said. ``We 
do have to effectively target our enforcement where it's really 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti's comment came at a joint House-Senate panel composed  
of members of seven committees with jurisdiction over the IRS and 
tax law. The 1998 law requires such a session each year to get an 
overall look at the agency's performance and needs. 
</P>
<P>
	After 18 months on the job, Rossotti has broad support among  
Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill as he tries to convert an 
entrenched bureaucracy into one more responsive to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that the task of modernizing the IRS is not an  
easy one and may take some time,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several lawmakers questioned the drop in enforcement  
actions in the first half of 1999. Garnishments of wages and levies 
on bank accounts, for example, are down to 458,000, from 1.8 
million during the same time period two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said the causes were threefold: gradual budget  
reductions that have shrunk the IRS staff, requirements that 
collections agents perform other duties such as answering taxpayer 
calls and worker fears of mandatory firing under new laws -- known 
by workers as the ``10 deadly sins'' -- covering willful misconduct 
and mistreatment of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are issues that have certainly caused confusion and  
anxiety in our work force,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intensive training continues to ease those fears and it will  
take time for employees to become accustomed to the new 
service-oriented IRS, he added. But Congress must support spending 
on technology, new business practices and management. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is putting much of its stock in electronic tax filing  
programs, but on Tuesday acknowledged a glitch in one of them. The 
company contracted to handle credit card payments made errors in 
13,700 transactions on April 15, mistakenly applying the payment to 
1999 taxes instead of the 1998 return. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said anyone who received an IRS notice for tax due  
after paying with a credit card that day should do nothing. The 
company, U.S. Audiotex, will contact taxpayers about the correction 
being made and no penalties will be assessed.

<HEADLINE> California Cities Suing Gun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Using broad state laws against public  
nuisances and unfair business practices, a group of California 
cities and counties are suing handgun makers, claiming the 
industry's marketing allows criminals and children to buy guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to pay for the violence in this country,'' Los  
Angeles City Attorney James Hahn said. ``They need to pay for the 
bloodshed. They need to pay for the suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suits were filed Tuesday in Los Angeles and San Francisco,  
two of the seven California cities and two counties that hope to 
make the weapons industry pay the social costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton, West Hollywood, Sacramento, Berkeley, Oakland, San  
Mateo County and Alameda County also joined the Superior Court 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits claim the industry floods areas with more guns than  
the legitimate market can absorb and fails to place controls on 
distributors or dealers to ensure weapons aren't sold through 
illegal purchases or via ``straw buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suits also claim makers ignore safer gun technology, such as  
combination locks and design features that keep children from using 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	One gun manufacturer said the issues raised in the lawsuits have  
failed legal tests in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``These theories all been tried before and have all been shot  
down before,'' said Steve Sanetti, vice-president and general 
counsel of Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., the largest gun manufacturer in the 
United States. ``They have a very tough time to try to make these 
cases withstand legal scrutiny. These are political lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The claims in the California lawsuits differ from other lawsuits  
around the country in that they don't rely on product liability 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The city lawsuit will ask for injunctions to stop gun makers  
from using the disputed marketing methods, profits from sales using 
those methods, and civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each gun 
that can be traced to them, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's absolutely ridiculous,'' said Robert Ricker,  
executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council. ``This 
industry follows the law. How can following the law be an unfair 
business practice?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address ILO Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- Trying to change the debate around trade  
policy, President Clinton will address the International Labor 
Organization in Geneva next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's June 16 speech will be the first by a U.S. president  
to the international body of government ministers and the leaders 
of unions and business associations around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that he said in his State of the Union address that  
he wanted to put a human face on the global economy,'' said Labor 
Secretary Alexis Herman. ``This visit clearly will be a reflection 
of the fact that we're going to bring that face into focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to increase trade as a hedge against the financial  
turmoil that recently rocked Asia and Latin America. He insists 
that fast-track negotiating power is essential to carry out his 
plans to organize a new round of global trade talks and to bring 
Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But organized labor has led a coalition that successfully  
defeated efforts to re-authorize fast-track negotiating authority, 
saying that workers' rights must be spelled out in the heart of 
trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, with speeches to the World Trade  
Organization, the Council on Foreign Relations and other groups, 
Clinton has sought to steer a new course through the debate, 
acknowledging labor's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	As he speaks out against child labor, sweatshops and unsafe  
working conditions, he also is highlighting how trade can help 
create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the ILO speech will offer a deeper  
explanation of Clinton's views on trade and policy proposals to 
protect workers. Too often, Herman said, trade is viewed only from 
the point of view of markets and profits. ``It is also about 
working families and working conditions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ILO, founded 1919, operates on the basis of consensus and  
often is seen as a weak enforcer of international labor standards. 
But the Clinton administration has been encouraged by the 
leadership of new ILO chief Juan Somovia of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the president secured $30 million for the ILO to  
fight child labor around the globe and this year the 
administration's $35 million proposal for a fiscal 2000 Labor 
Standards Initiative embraced the ILO's efforts to hold members 
accountable for labor rights.

<HEADLINE> Disney's 'Hunchback' Goes to Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Don't look for Disney's latest musical theater  
spectacular on Broadway, or even London's West End. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' the third of the Walt Disney  
Co.'s animated films to make the leap from screen to stage, has its 
world premiere June 5 WAY off the Great White Way in a city hardly 
known for family entertainment: Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a new twist on the globalization of U.S. culture.  
Instead of making the product in America and exporting it around 
the world, Disney decided to take the idea and create a show here 
first -- in German, with a German partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working in a foreign language -- that's been a big stretch, and  
we've had to figure out along the way how to do that,'' says Thomas 
Schumacher, head of Disney's animation and theatrical productions 
divisions. ``That and the fact that it's far away ... makes it more 
complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a combination of factors supported the decision to ``break  
the mold'' and present an original production in Berlin, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	First, there was Disney's full plate of productions in the  
United States, plus the lure of a brand-new, custom-built theater, 
and the ``appropriateness'' of presenting a classic European story 
about racism and tolerance in the former Nazi capital at the same 
time the German government is making its historic return to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't have been able in this time frame to do it in the  
States,'' Schumacher said in a recent interview during rehearsals. 
``So it seemed a good idea to be able to do it here and see what we 
had. ... It seems like a good fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he adds, ``from a purely business perspective it's  
important to have the work out there around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing this multimillion-dollar tunefest to the stage, though,  
involves more challenges than just language barriers -- the musical 
is called ``Der Gloeckner von Notre Dame'' in German -- and grueling 
back-and-forths across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Big-budget, Broadway-style musicals have never taken off in  
uppity Berlin, a city more attuned to classical music, Brecht and 
saucy cabaret. And even in richer, more ``Americanized'' western 
Germany, where musical theater extravaganzas have boomed over the 
past decade, there are signs that interest is waning. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's new German partner, Stella AG, which pioneered the  
musical trend by introducing Germans to ``Cats'' in the mid-1980s, 
lost $50 million last year and has been run by a consortium of 
banks since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of its eight shows, ``Les Miserables'' and ``Joseph and the  
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' are closing and 20 percent of 
Stella's 5,000 employees will be laid off in an attempt to keep the 
company afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Stella's newly appointed chairman, marketing whiz Hemjoe Klein,  
plans to focus more on touring shows than permanent productions in 
newly erected musical temples, like the one built for ``Hunchback'' 
in the city-within-a-city development at Potsdamer Platz. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet with a reported $25 million already sunk in the show, Klein  
is also a ``Hunchback'' booster. He's counting on the combination 
of Disney magic and the revitalized Berlin's tourist appeal to make 
it a hit in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials also are hoping for a hit to add some life,  
especially after dark, to the still rather sterile streets of 
Potsdamer Platz, the heart of prewar Berlin that sat barren for 
decades, divided by the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no competing with Broadway,'' says Axel  
Wallrabenstein, spokesman for the city's culture department. ``But 
there'll certainly be a touch of New York in Berlin when Disney's 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stella officials did not respond to requests for information on  
how many tickets have already been sold. Prices are relatively 
high, ranging from $44 to $108. 
</P>
<P>
	But the marketing campaign is in full swing, with posters  
everywhere and newspaper ads showing the shadow of a hulking, 
hunchbacked giant on the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of Berlin, under 
the slogan, ``He's getting closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, while it earned more than $100 million in the United  
States, was considered a relative disappointment compared to 
predecessors like ``The Lion King.'' Many parents complained that 
the story -- about an evil judge who seeks to rid 15th-century Paris 
of its Gypsies -- was too dark and that references to sexual 
obsession and stake-burning were inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet European audiences flocked to the movie, drawing comparisons  
with Europe's current struggles with right-wing extremists and 
violence directed at foreigners. Disney hopes that resonance will 
carry over to the stage production, which hews even closer to 
Victor Hugo's 19th-century classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the values of the piece, and what it's talking about,  
about acceptance, about a culture that's rethinking itself, I think 
it's all interesting. I think it's all good stuff,'' Schumacher 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does that fit many places in the world? Absolutely. But it is  
certainly suited for where we are. That's a pulse that one feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, which has creative control over the show, chose an  
international cast to stress the point. 
</P>
<P>
	An American, Drew Sarich, is getting his first big leading role  
as Quasimodo. A Berliner, Judy Weiss, is Esmeralda, the Gypsy woman 
with whom he falls in love. Other cast members hail from as far 
away as the Philippines and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is written and directed by James Lapine, who has  
collected several Tonys and a Pulitzer Prize for his collaborations 
with Stephen Sondheim, the master of highbrow musicals. Famed 
choreographer Lar Lubovitch is doing the musical staging. 
</P>
<P>
	Academy Award winners Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz came up  
with nine new songs to fill out the 1996 movie's somewhat skimpy 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making an adaptation from the movie, but taking it some  
distance from the original,'' Menken says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just in choosing James Lapine to direct it and write the book,  
you've already made a major creative decision there. He's known as 
a director whose works tend to be very sophisticated, adult, 
somewhat intellectual in nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Disneyfied ending to the movie, in which Esmeralda is  
rescued from certain death by a heroic, love-struck Quasimodo, is 
being rethought. 
</P>
<P>
	Translator Michael Kunze, who describes his job as trying to  
``overcome the gap between the American writers and the German 
audience,'' has been campaigning to allow Esmeralda to die at the 
end, as she does in the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a feeling that the audience would be depressed if  
Esmeralda dies,'' he says. ``I feel that a European audience would 
see this as a very romantic ending ... two lost souls finally find 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will cry, but they'll be moved. And it is a very  
romantic ending. And I think this is a mentality thing, something 
that's much easier felt and understood in Europe than in the 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Producers are waiting to see how preview audiences react before  
making the final decision. ``This is the wonderful thing about a 
new production, you don't know what you end up with,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's exactly what Disney is waiting to see before deciding  
whether the show will have a life anywhere beyond Berlin. No 
further productions -- in any language -- are even being considered 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to make those plans until I see the whole show  
up,'' Schumacher insists. ``We will be as cautious with this and as 
protective with this as we are with all our products.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies Co-Owner Facing Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Attorneys agreed at a federal bankruptcy hearing  
Wednesday to allow a trucking company owned by Colorado Rockies 
co-owner Jerry McMorris to continue operating through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-based NationsWay Transport filed for Chapter 11  
bankruptcy protection on May 20, citing deregulation and 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing the company, creditors and union truckers  
signed off on the plan during a hearing before U.S. Bankrupcty 
Court Judge Sarah Sharer Curley. 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris has a controlling interest in the Rockies, but has said  
that NationsWay is separate from the baseball club. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not separate in the minds of NationsWay employees who  
attended the hearing. The bankruptcy left more than 1,000 employees 
out of work in Denver and 3,500 unemployed nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Teamsters members who attended the hearing called the  
trucking company's bankruptcy a ``deliberate plan'' by McMorris. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was all pre-planned. He used this to fund the ballclub,''  
said Tom Woodhouse, a truck driver for 33 years and a member of 
Teamsters Local 104 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's court action allows NationsWay to pay operating  
expenses for work done since the bankruptcy filing through Friday. 
A similar agreement had expired Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another hearing was set for June 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 11, a company is free from the threat of  
creditors' lawsuits while it reorganizes its finances. The debtor's 
reorganization plan must be approved by a majority of its 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsWay attorney Donald Gaffney said the company filed for  
bankruptcy in Phoenix because its largest terminal is here. Other 
trucking terminals are in Denver, Dallas and Harrisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters officials filed claims to recover unpaid wages and  
other monetary compensation due its members who work for 
NationsWay. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Gary Keltner, representing the Central States Health  
and Welfare Pension fund, said NationsWay faces a $2 million claim 
on behalf of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Chip Roth of the union's international office said  
NationsWay truck drivers were last paid on May 18 and missed their 
first paycheck this week. 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris, who built the trucking company from three rigs in 1959  
to more than 2,000, is involved in several business ventures, 
including two other trucking companies. Critics have suggested that 
McMorris spent too much time focusing on his baseball team and not 
enough time trying to save NationsWay. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials say members are angered that McMorris pays his  
baseball players millions but is unable to pay truckers' pensions.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Explores Safety Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Stock car racing's sanctioning body is  
exploring ways to prevent the wheels and hoods of vehicles from 
flying off in crashes and possibly landing in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety tethers on wheels have become a hot topic lately in  
racing because of two fatal accidents in the past year, both of 
which involved wheels that snapped off cars and flew into 
grandstands, killing spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the world's major open-wheel circuits have enacted  
rules requiring the use of wheel tethers. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the open-wheel tethers, which are made of relatively  
expensive fibers and can require intricate installations, the 
device being considered by NASCAR is easy to install and doesn't 
cost much. 
</P>
<P>
	The tether is merely a section of braided steel cable about a  
foot long and fastened into a loop at each end. NASCAR officials 
paid $7 for each unit, and because the sanctioning body feels that 
only the front wheels need to be secured, the cost would be $14 per 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices are relatively simple and inexpensive because the  
suspension systems on Winston Cup cars are radically different from 
those on open-wheel cars. While Indy-car wheels and suspension 
systems are designed to break free in crashes, the opposite is true 
with Winston Cup cars. 
</P>
<P>
	No spectators have ever been injured by a wheel or suspension  
parts that flew off a Winston Cup car. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoods are a different matter, however. They have been known to  
fly into stands at races, especially those on the circuit's larger 
tracks where the speeds are highest. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR is trying to develop a frame structure that would  
strengthen the hood and make it less likely to fly off in 
high-speed crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheel cables were tested on a few cars during last week's  
all-star race activities at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
NASCAR plans to test them again this weekend during the Coca-Cola 
600 Winston Cup race and the CarQuest 300 Busch Grand National 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very possible we can make them mandatory by Dover next  
week,'' NASCAR senior vice president Mike Helton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR officials are considering experimenting with a new hood  
frame design this week at Charlotte, but only during a test 
session. No cars are to use the new design during any races this 
weekend, and Helton said no timetable has been set to implement any 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton said NASCAR had been looking at improving wheel cables  
and hood designs for several months, but the sanctioning body 
``turned up the wick'' after a fatal Indy-car race at Charlotte 
earlier this month. Three spectators were killed and eight injured 
when a wheel and suspension parts from a three-car wreck flew into 
the stands during an Indy Racing League event. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it happens one time,'' Helton said, ``it's too much.''  
</P>
<P>
	One of the Winston Cup cars testing the wheel cables last week  
was the Pontiac driven by Ward Burton and owned by Bill Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no problems at all with them, but it's kind of a  
non-issue,'' Davis said. ``Tearing off suspension parts and them 
getting into the stands has really never been an issue. But at the 
same time, fan safety has to be our top concern, so if NASCAR 
decides to go with them, I don't think there's going to be any 
opposition down here.''

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 171.07  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded strongly today as  
bargain-hunters returned to a turbulent market following the 
biggest losing streak since late March. The Dow Jones industrial 
average shot up 171.07 points, a rise of 1.6 percent, to close at 
10,702.16. At one point late in the session, the Dow was up 190. 
Going into today's session, the Dow had fallen four straight 
sessions, including a combined 298-point drop in the past two days, 
and was off 5 percent from its May 13 record of 11,107.19. ``The 
market was oversold,'' said Tony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at 
Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. ``It's ready for a bounce.'' Broader stock 
indicators were mostly higher. The Nasdaq composite index with its 
many technology stocks rose 45.36 points to 2,426.26.

	Factory Orders Fall 2.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decline in demand for autos and other  
transportation equipment led a 2.3 percent decline in orders to 
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods in April, the 
second drop in the past three months. But Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin warned against reading too much into any one report and the 
president of the National Association of Manufacturers, economist 
Jerry Jasinowski, interpreted the numbers as indicating that the 
economy is moving to a ``more sustainable'' pace after two quarters 
of unusually strong growth. The April decline followed a 2.7 
percent increase in March.

Exchange today after its shares had dropped in recent sessions. 
Investors are returning to buy the widely held stock at a more 
affordable price. And it will become ``cheaper'' yet. After the 
close of trading, a 2-for-1 stock split was to take effect.

	SEC Points Finger at Ex-IBM Worker  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An IBM secretary who knew of the company's plans  
to take over Lotus Development Corp. tipped off her husband, 
leading 25 people to pocket more than $1.3 million from insider 
trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged today. In 
papers filed in Federal Court in Manhattan, the SEC says that after 
the secretary, Lorraine K. Cassano, who has since been fired, told 
her husband of the plan, he told two friends, who agreed to 
purchase stock for him, and the word spread from there. The Lotus 
acquisition occurred in 1995.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer expert who will be one of the final  
witnesses in the Microsoft trial revealed today how he has improved 
his method of disabling the Internet browser in Windows, touching 
on a central claim in the government's antitrust case. Edward 
Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton University, said 
some changes to his controversial technique were prompted by 
comments from Microsoft witnesses. Felten previously testified as 
one of the Justice Department's dozen witnesses. Microsoft 
questioned him again under oath today in a deposition at the 
federal courthouse here. The government wants Felten to take the 
stand again next month -- during the trial's rebuttal phase -- to 
rebut earlier testimony from Microsoft executive James Allchin. The 
trial resumes Monday after a 13-week break.

retailer told a House committee today. Hanson Bros. Fresh Seafood 
of Portland, Maine, launched its Web site in February and already 
Internet sales account for 25 percent to 30 percent of the 
company's fresh fish and seafood business, said Brian Hanson, the 
owner. He was not sure what to expect from going online, but said 
he was lucky to get help from an Internet service provider that 
helped put him on the Web.

$108 million over its role in the affairs of the late media baron 
Robert Maxwell. Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, which merged with Price 
Waterhouse in 1998 to form PricewaterhouseCoopers, was the auditor 
for Maxwell Communication Corp. Maxwell disappeared in mysterious 
circumstances at sea off his yacht in 1991. Earlier that year, his 
empire had collapsed. The company administrators sued Coopers &AMP; 
Lybrand for $160 million for failing to spot any problems at the 
Maxwell corporation.

	Judge Delays Payments in Boeing Case  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal court judge today delayed the  
distribution of money in the settlement of a discrimination lawsuit 
against Boeing Co. so that a group objecting to the deal can state 
its case. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour scheduled another 
hearing in the matter Sept. 23 after attorneys take depositions. 
The $15 million settlement of the class-action lawsuit was 
announced on Jan. 22 and covers about 12,900 past and present black 
Boeing workers. Attorney Alan B. Epstein of Philadelphia, who 
represents dozens of Boeing workers, filed the challenge to the 
settlement. He has said the settlement doesn't provide enough money 
or enforcement to prevent future discrimination. Boeing lawyers 
have called Epstein's challenge ``sour grapes'' from a lawyer who 
was less effective in the case ``and therefore is not getting as 
much money in attorney fees.''

is cutting fares on key routes to drive out competition and 
ultimately raise fares. AirTran sent a brief to the Justice and 
Transportation Departments outlining the accusations on the heels 
of a government lawsuit against American Airlines for predatory 
pricing against smaller rivals. ``Delta's competitive response to 
AirTran over the years, and increasingly in recent days, has only 
one objective -- drive a small-but-growing, successful low-fare 
carrier out of its markets,'' the brief said. Delta spokesman Bill 
Berry called the charges ``insulting and untrue.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters Say Best Is To Come </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Both are winning. And the Williams sisters say the  
best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Primed for a long-anticipated title in a major tournament,  
fifth-seeded Venus beat Natasha Zvereva of Belarus, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 
Wednesday, while her little sister, 10th-seeded Serena, downed 
Mariana Diaz Oliva of Argentina, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus took 1 hour, 22 minutes -- seven minutes longer than Serena  
-- as both reached the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters are in great form, capturing five titles and losing  
just nine matches between them this year. And while their rapid 
rise toward the top hasn't included any Grand Slam triumphs, they 
plan to change that at Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my ninth Grand Slam,'' Venus said. ``Now it's time for  
me to make a move. I'm ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena is equally upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a mater of time before I reach the top spot or reach  
my goals,'' the 17-year-old said. ``I plan on doing well here. But 
I'm taking one match at a time because in the past, I would look 
too far ahead in the draw and not do too well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the two-week tournament progresses, the sisters said, look  
for their games to rise, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm playing that well right now,'' Serena said.  
``It's not 100 percent, it is maybe 90 percent, but getting better 
every day. I made a lot of mistakes today and my serve was really 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But my dad says in order to be a champion you have to win even  
on your bad days,'' she added. ``I was able to come through today. 
I was stronger mentally. I never doubted I was going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena said she is still fighting back from the injury that  
forced her to pull out of the recent German Open, one of the few 
down points in a big year for the Williams'. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus is 27-4. After winning the Lipton championships, she  
crossed the Atlantic and began dominating the European clay-court 
season with back-to-back triumphs at the German and Italian opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Hamburg, I played perfect tennis. In Rome, I didn't play so  
well. Here, OK,'' Venus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena, 23-5 this year, also won successive events, at the Gaz  
de France in Paris and then in Indian Wells, before losing in the 
final of the Lipton to her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Zvereva, a finalist here 11 years ago, Venus was only  
briefly threatened when she was taken to a tiebreaker in the first 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go into tiebreakers, I just feel that I am going to  
win,'' the 18-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrapped up the on her first match point with a blistering  
forehand that, though it arrived just yards from Zvereva, was too 
hot to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love red clay,'' Venus said. ``I adapt my game. When I am on  
clay I rally and wait for my opportunity. When I am on grass, I 
come in and attack.''

<HEADLINE> Robinson Returns to N.J. Devils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Saying the last few years with the  
Los Angeles Kings has soured him on head coaching, Larry Robinson 
rejoined the New Jersey Devils as an assistant coach today. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was fired by the Kings last month, just days after the  
team missed the playoffs for the third time in his four years as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want a break from it,'' Robinson said of his decision  
to be an assistant again for a team that has been a regular-season 
wonder and playoff failure the past three years. ``The last two 
years, actually the last three years have taken their toll. I have 
never been in a position or been with an organization that wasn't 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that we didn't have success, but building a franchise  
and starting from the bottom, it takes its toll on everybody, me, 
my staff, and I'd just like to take a step back and enjoy myself 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In giving Robinson a five-year contract, the Devils not only get  
back a key assistant coach from their 1995 Stanley Cup championship 
team, they also have a coach in waiting should the team falter 
under Robbie Ftorek. 
</P>
<P>
	Ftorek, who replaced Jacques Lemaire after the 1997-98 playoff  
debacle, led New Jersey to its third straight division and another 
top seed in the Eastern Conference for the playoffs. However, the 
Devils were ousted in the first round for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, whose contract expired after this past season, had a  
122-161-45 record in four seasons with the Kings. He declined to 
sign a three-year extension that was offered last September, saying 
he wasn't sure he wanted to continue coaching.

<HEADLINE> Airports Lack Security at Bag Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Checking in at an airport, it's hard to miss  
the preoccupation with baggage security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you pack your own bags?'' the ticket agent asks. ``Did  
anyone ask you to carry anything on board?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a different story when passengers arrive at their  
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	At some airports, such as Los Angeles International, most  
airlines will not let passengers leave baggage claim areas without 
showing a claim stub for their luggage. But at others, including 
Reagan National and Dulles International near Washington, no one 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone can grab anything or, perhaps more worrisome for  
security, can leave a bag or package behind. The only safeguards 
are signs or public address warnings noting that many bags look 
alike so passengers should check their luggage tags. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, police arrested a man who took advantage of such  
lax security at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. They said that James 
Clarence Ringley of Arlington, Texas, stole about 500 bags from 
airline baggage belts and used the contents -- worth an estimated $1 
million -- to stock a booth at a flea market. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport police said it was the largest recovery of luggage at  
any major U.S. airport. Ringley recently received four years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wondered about it a few times as I've walked out with all  
kinds of bags and nobody's checked me,'' said J.T. Maiorano of New 
York, a lighting technician who travels over 150,000 miles 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing outside the USAirways claim area at Reagan National,  
where he just picked up a garment bag unchallenged, Maiorano said, 
``I wouldn't mind at all being checked. ... I'd rather do it than 
get ripped off of my luggage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government requires the baggage questions at  
check-in and the constant reminders about unattended luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	But security at the end of a trip -- in the baggage claim areas --  
is the responsibility of individual airlines. They typically lease 
and operate baggage belts from an airport authority. Airlines, in 
turn, say they provide checkpoints where they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't have a high incidence of problems, we don't do  
it,'' said United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``It helps keep 
down the cost of air travel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some airports like Hartsfield in Atlanta or Miami International  
provide baggage area security in many terminals as a basic service 
to their airline tenants. Atlanta, which handles 200,000 passengers 
a day, spends about $1.5 million annually on it. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, said Hartsfield spokeswoman Lanii Thomas, the  
airport does not have a high rate of baggage theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Airports generally don't keep track of stolen bags, deferring to  
the airlines. The carriers themselves are loath to report a bag as 
stolen, preferring to say that it is ``missing.'' Often a bag that 
has been reported stolen ends up back at its intended destination 
after a journey on the wrong flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department tracks mishandled bags -- those  
that are lost, damaged, delayed or ``pilfered.'' In March, the 
major U.S. airlines had about five reports of mishandled bags for 
every 1,000 they handled, about the same as the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Tightening security at baggage claim areas is not always  
foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Los Angeles police arrested a man who allegedly raided  
the airline baggage belts at Los Angeles International and walked 
away with 11 sets of golf clubs, professional camera equipment, a 
snowboard and other items worth an estimated $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While the airport had and continues to use a bag-matching  
program, the suspect found a way around it: He wore a Delta Air 
Lines pilot uniform and a fake ID and strode confidently past the 
checkout gates.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Japanese Worried About Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- With its economy stuck in a deep slump, three out  
of four Japanese are worried about job security, according to a 
newspaper survey released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by the Yomiuri newspaper showed that 76 percent of  
those polled said they are worried about current and future 
employment for themselves and other family members. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was up by 8 percentage points from a similar Yomiuri  
survey in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest survey, conducted May 15-16, asked the opinion of  
2,035 eligible voters picked randomly across Japan. As with many 
Japanese opinion polls, no margin of error was given. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, concerns over possibly losing jobs anytime soon  
were most severely felt by the middle-aged -- 83 percent of those in 
their 40s and 84 percent in their 50s, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In late April, the government reported Japan's unemployment rate  
in March climbed to yet another record high of 4.8 percent, as 
corporate restructuring efforts force more people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Japan's jobless rates will rise in coming months as  
the nation is undergoing profound structural changes in the economy 
and the breakdown of traditional business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that 64 percent of Japanese say that a  
performance-based wage system is more desirable than the 
traditional pay scale based on seniority, which was supported by 33 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a proof that people are beginning to accept changes in  
employment practice,'' Atsushi Seike, a professor on labor economy 
at Tokyo's Keio University, told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Hesitant To Tap Oil Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Faced with a huge budget shortfall, the  
Alaska Legislature raised a knife to the state's most sacred cow -- 
the $26 billion oil-royalty fund -- then passed the blade to the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nonbinding election Sept. 14, Alaskans will make a choice  
people in other states might envy: 
</P>
<P>
	Should the annual dividend check every man, woman and child  
receives in Alaska continue climbing from last year's $1,540, or 
should its growth be reined in to help keep the state free of an 
income tax or a state sales tax? 
</P>
<P>
	If voters say yes, lawmakers plan to cut the dividend to about  
$1,340 in 2001 and dedicate some of the fund's earnings to 
balancing the budget. The fund is expected to pay Alaskans 
dividends of more than $1,700 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is such political poison that lawmakers deadlocked  
for more than a week over whether to even ask it. Only a carefully 
negotiated compromise won over enough reluctant state senators to 
pass the bill Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing that we did today is agree to ask  
Alaskans a question,'' Senate President Drue Pearce said. ``It is 
responsible, it is realistic, it is definitely workable, and we 
hope that Alaskans will take the time to understand it and to tell 
us what they think in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oil royalties and taxes have paid for most of state government  
since the late 1970s. The wealth was so abundant that the public 
voted in 1976 to sock some of it away in what is called the Alaska 
Permanent Fund. Six years later, the fund began paying dividends to 
Alaska residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, dwindling oil production and slumping prices have widened a  
gap between state spending and income to more than $1 billion, a 
shortfall that could drain the state's budget-balancing reserve 
within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than four months, lawmakers have grappled with  
fundamental questions surrounding the fund and its dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the fund a rainy-day account to pay for state government or a  
vault to safeguard some of Alaska's wealth from politicians who 
would fritter it away on pork? 
</P>
<P>
	Is the dividend a giveaway that has outlived its time, or an  
inviolate entitlement that keeps thousands of families out of 
poverty? 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way to avoid the use of Permanent Fund  
earnings,'' said House Speaker Brian Porter, a Republican. ``No 
amount of reasonable statewide taxes could come close to filling 
the gap that we're faced with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the focus shifts to two questions: How to persuade voters to  
take hundreds of dollars out of their pockets for government, and 
what to do if they say no. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we go back to the drawing board at that point,'' said  
Sen. Sean Parnell, a Republican.

<HEADLINE>  IRL and CART Hold Unification talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The big names may be coming back to the  
Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of bitter rivalry that threatened the future of  
open-wheel racing in the United States, CART and the IRL have begun 
face-to-face talks about bringing the two racing circuits together. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the negotiations came as teams prepared for this  
weekend's race at the Indy 500, which has lost its luster during 
the feud as the best-known drivers stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that there have been some very informal talks  
with Tony George,'' said Andrew Craig, president and CEO of 
Championship Auto Racing Teams. ``However, I am not prepared to 
comment on any of the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no comment -- but also no denial of the talks -- from  
George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president who started the 
war when he formed the Indy Racing League late in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The answering salvo from CART was to quit the Indianapolis 500,  
leaving George to stage the world's most famous auto race with 
virtually no stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences between the two circuits once seemed  
insurmountable, with totally different chassis and engine rules in 
place. But the last few weeks have brought hope that a settlement 
could be achieved as early as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his differences with George, who started the IRL as a  
low-cost, ovals-only alternative to CART, Craig says a merger would 
be in the best interests of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's CART's position that open-wheel racing would benefit  
greatly from having one series instead of two,'' Craig said. ``I 
think everyone in the industry would like to see it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the two circuits who spoke on condition of  
anonymity say NASCAR president Bill France Jr., the most powerful 
man in American racing, is brokering the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	France did not return phone calls, but his interest is not  
surprising. International Speedway Corp., which owns and operates 
NASCAR, recently bought Penske Motorsports, giving ISC 10 
racetracks, with at least three more planned in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC will need more than just its stock car and truck divisions  
to keep those tracks busy and prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
	The war between CART and the IRL was destructive, and the timing  
couldn't have been worse, with NASCAR's emergence as the hottest 
American sport of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	CART has been solid almost since its debut in 1979, but it  
attracts far fewer fans at tracks where NASCAR also races. Although 
the Indy 500 will race Sunday before another sellout crowd 
approaching 400,000, for the most part the IRL has not drawn well 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	When CART was the one major open-wheel entity in America, its TV  
ratings were adequate and building slowly. Since the split, neither 
side has drawn more than a bare audience, except for Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	And even the once mighty Memorial Day weekend classic has  
slipped from a high rating of 8.4 in 1995 to 5.5 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But -- perhaps in hopes of a peace treaty -- ABC and ESPN haven't  
given up on either series. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN already had a deal with CART through 2001 before ABC  
re-upped for Indy last week, extending its contract through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also means ABC and ESPN will show the rest of the  
IRL schedule each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Katz, the new president of ABC Sports and the catalyst in  
extending the current contract with George, says the biggest 
problem facing the open-wheel folks is building stars. 
</P>
<P>
	CART is perceived to have the big names, with Michael Andretti  
and Al Unser Jr. still its marquee drivers. But neither has won a 
championship in five years, and former Indy winners Mario Andretti, 
Bobby Rahal, Emerson Fittipaldi, Rick Mears, Al Unser Sr. and Danny 
Sullivan -- have retired in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the biggest stars stayed with CART, the IRL had a shaky  
foundation. Its one big-name driver, two-time Indy 500 winner Arie 
Luyendyk, will race Sunday for the final time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got to build stars,'' Katz said. ``You've got  
to have a reason to root for or even against people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsorships, which supply most of the money for race teams,  
also are a problem for open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	CART still has more than $400 million in sponsorship backing,  
but many of the long-term contracts will end in either 2000 or 
2001, with no guarantees they will be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL, which started from nothing in 1995, has built perhaps  
$50 million in sponsorship, but with minuscule TV ratings and 
little identity it continues to be a hard sell to corporate 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR, massively promoted and armed with high TV ratings,  
already has about $500 million annually in sponsorship money and 
continues to grow at a fast rate, drawing sponsors away from the 
open-wheel divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	PPG Industries, the longtime series sponsor for CART, is one of  
the few backers involved in both open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've managed to keep a foot in both camps, feeling that there  
was value on each side of the fence,'' said Mike Sack, PPG's 
director of motorsports. ``That's a difficult position to be in, 
not only from the standpoint of money, but also politically 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know one sponsor that doesn't think peace between the  
series is a good idea.''

<HEADLINE> Mobile OKs Spending for Bowl Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- The City Council agreed to provide $950,000  
for the inaugural Mobile Alabama Bowl, scheduled for Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowl organizer Mike Gottfried said he met with several city  
officials last week and cleared up most of the questions that led 
to Tuesday's council approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Mike Dow also issued a four-page memo to council members  
Monday with information on revenues, expenses, potential economic 
impact and other events surrounding the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of questions, but when we talked, all of them  
were answered,'' Gottfried said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game will be played at Ladd-Peebles Stadium, matching the  
bowl committee's second choice selections from Conference USA and 
the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the WAC agreed to the bowl tie-in for one year only,  
Conference USA has committed to send a team for the next five 
years. Gottfried described Conference USA as ``bowl hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Council members said the bowl may need a few years to become  
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can sit here and go through this contract and I could  
probably find a hundred reasons why I shouldn't do this,'' said 
Councilman Charles Waller. ``But at the same time, I can find a 
hundred reasons why I should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of ticket sales, hotel nights and numbers of visitors  
are ``very conservative,'' according to the mayor's memo. The total 
direct economic impact to the city is estimated at about $5 
million, with a total economic impact of about $16.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team must purchase 7,000 seats at a minimum of $45 per  
ticket, said WAC Commissioner Karl Benson. Payouts to the two teams 
are guaranteed at $750,000 each but could run as high as $850,000, 
depending on total revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The city will receive eight 30-second commercials during the  
game, which will be shown on ESPN2.

<HEADLINE> USDA Orders New Processing Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is ordering  
meatpacking plants to revamp their processing methods to guard 
against the potentially deadly listeria bacteria, which has 
contaminated millions of pounds of hot dogs and luncheon meats in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100 plants that produce hot dogs and other ready-to-eat  
meats must begin using new processing methods immediately, USDA 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As summer begins, Americans need to be able to grill hot dogs  
or pack sandwiches for a picnic with confidence that their food is 
safe,'' said Tom Billy, administrator for USDA's Food Safety and 
Inspection Service. ``Working together with industry and consumers, 
we can take steps to better protect the public from foodborne 
illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes after contamination from the Listeria  
monocytogenes bacteria forced several food recalls last year, 
including an outbreak at the Sara Lee-owned Bil Mar Foods plant in 
Zeeland, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and luncheon  
meats in December -- the largest meat recall ever -- because of 
suspected contamination with a rare strain of the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, listeria-contaminated products from the plant have  
been linked to 100 illnesses in 22 states, as well as 15 deaths and 
six miscarriages or stillbirths. 
</P>
<P>
	``By requiring companies to handle this as part of their own  
hazard control programs, USDA is assuring that some action will be 
taken immediately,'' Carol Tucker Foreman of the Consumer 
Federation of America said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy advises plants to re-examine their plans under a  
scientific-based food inspection program, known as the Hazard 
Analysis and Critical Control Points system or HACCP. 
</P>
<P>
	HACCP is essentially a system of prevention-oriented checks in  
the food production system. Before the program was implemented, 
plant workers only poked at carcasses to search visually for signs 
of disease. Under HACCP, a company identifies vulnerable points in 
the production system, such as fecal contamination, and establishes 
constant checks to monitor those points. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants are expected to submit plans to comply within 30 days.  
Facilities that fail to implement the proper HACCP programs under 
the new policy will face enforcement action that could mean 
withdrawal of USDA's inspectors. Without inspectors present, plants 
must shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest meat processing plants began using HACCP last year.  
Nearly 3,000 smaller plants began implementing it in January, and 
the smallest plants will join the system next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also plan to launch a public education campaign about  
listeria. Advice includes reheating ready-to-eat foods since 
thorough reheating can kill any bacteria that might be present.

	Milosevic May Face War Charges  
</P>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- With speculation mounting that  
Slobodan Milosevic may soon be indicted, the tribunal charged with 
prosecuting war crimes in Yugoslavia said today it already is armed 
with evidence of atrocities ``on a massive scale.'' The U.N. 
court's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, said she would make ``an 
important announcement'' tomorrow. She would not comment on a CNN 
report citing European diplomatic sources as indicating an 
indictment against the Yugoslav leader was imminent.

an 11-day mission to Yugoslavia, calling the situation in Kosovo 
``calamitous'' and the humanitarian needs ``immense.'' The team was 
the first group of international observers allowed to visit Kosovo 
since the large-scale exodus of ethnic Albanians from the province 
began two months ago. About 840,000 have fled or been driven out by 
Serb forces.

Milosevic's villa and hit army barracks and command posts. Jets

John McCain, R-Ariz., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., to authorize a new 
round of base closings in 2001 as part of an $288.8 billion defense 
spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1. ``The timing 
could not be worse'' for additional base closings, said Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. He said that, with the military 
already stetched thin by the conflict in Kosovo, it was no time to 
be closing down any military installations.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's transportation safety panel  
is recommending that the autopilot system in the Boeing MD-11 
jetliner be modified to prevent severe reactions when pilots try to 
make flight course changes. The National Transportation Safety 
Board said overreactions caused severe pitching during two

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Fall 2.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods fell  
an unexpectedly sharp 2.3 percent last month, the Commerce 
Department reported today. Private economists did not regard the 
drop as a major setback to U.S. factories' recovery from a global 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, the second in three months, was driven by falling  
orders for transportation and defense goods. Without big declines 
in these two areas, orders for durable goods would have risen a 
strong 2.9 percent, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall decline in durable goods, which are items expected  
to last three or more years, followed a solid 2.7 percent rise in 
orders in March. Many analysts expected a gain of around 0.4 
percent for April orders. 
</P>
<P>
	For business groups, the new economic report indicated the  
economy is not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is coasting to a more sustainable pace following  
two quarters of unusually strong growth,'' said economist Jerry 
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
``The fundamental message of these numbers is that the economy is 
undergoing a mild slowdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, after four straight losing sessions attributed to  
concerns about inflation, reacted positively. The Dow Jones average 
of industrial stocks jumped 171 points to close at 10,702 on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Durable goods declined by $4.5 billion last month to a  
seasonally adjusted $194.4 billion. The drop is the biggest since a 
3.9 percent fall in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the decline came from a 36.4 percent decline in military  
orders. Defense orders rose 41.2 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new orders were down in large part because of the sharp  
reversal in defense orders which are likely to get stronger as we 
move through the year given all the ammunition we have used up in 
Kosovo,'' said economist Paul Kasriel of Northern Trust Company of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to defense, the other big source of weakness was a  
12.4 percent drop in demand for autos, aircraft and other 
transportation products. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you strip away transportation and defense, durable goods  
were actually up. And, that is more representative of what is going 
on in manufacturing,'' said Mark Zandi, economist at Regional 
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Manufacturing has had a 
dismal couple of years, but I think there is light at the end of 
the tunnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The global currency crisis has plunged one-third of the world  
into recession and contributed to the loss of more than 400,000 
U.S. manufacturing jobs over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this weakness, the overall U.S. economy has continued to  
forge ahead, growing at an annual rate of 4.5 percent during the 
first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will release a revised estimate for economic  
growth in the first quarter on Thursday. Many analysts believe it 
will show growth near the 4.5 percent level. 
</P>
<P>
	A key gauge of future economic activity, the Index of Leading  
Indicators, has risen for six straight months. While durable goods 
is a component of the index, analysts said the April drop should 
not have much effect because manufacturing has been weak for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the steel industry, competing against a flood of  
cheap imports from countries such as Japan, has suffered. But in 
the April report showed that primary metals, the sector that 
includes steel, had a 1.3 percent increase -- offering hope of a 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery rose by 3.5 percent in April,  
the fourth increase in this sector in the past six months, while 
orders for electronic equipment dropped 0.7 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a sign of current demand,  
fell 0.6 percent in April. compared with a 1.9 percent increase the 
previous month.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Cops Have Toilet Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- An alleged toilet paper shortage at police  
stations prompted a radio station to donate rolls on Wednesday, but 
city officials say there's plenty of TP for the P.D. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're somebody in need at a particular time, and you're  
sitting there, it's an emergency to you, but we just have not been 
able to detect that there hasn't been toilet paper,'' said Greg 
Bowens, spokesman for Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council Member Key Everett said Tuesday the situation is an  
example of a supply problem throughout city departments caused by 
Detroit's new computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowens said that was news to him.  
</P>
<P>
	Precincts may have overreacted when they received partial cases  
of tissue instead of the customary full-case deliveries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	As word of the shortage spread Wednesday, officers in one  
precinct called a radio station in search of donations. The result: 
420 rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the precinct never called building maintenance first to  
request toilet paper, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Roslyn Beard said: ``I've been carrying my own since I was  
a little girl ... My mama taught me that.''

<HEADLINE> Delphi Takes Final Step Away From GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. declares its  
independence Friday, when General Motors Corp. distributes its 
remaining shares of the world's biggest auto parts manufacturer to 
sever Delphi's final ties to GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the move was planned well in advance, some GM  
shareholders may be surprised when they open up a newspaper stock 
table and see GM shares had drop nearly $15 overnight as a result 
of the spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But looks can be deceiving. While GM stock will drop about 17  
percent, or $14.42 a share, as a result of the spinoff, current 
stockholders essentially will have the same stock value because 
they will get Delphi shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the current shareholder there's no drop,'' said Mark  
Tanner, GM's director of financial communications. ``All other 
things being equal, you're going to have the same money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM shareholders will get 0.69893 -- about seven-tenths -- of a  
share of Delphi common stock for each share of GM stock. About 
452.56 million shares of Delphi stock will be distributed to 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that as Delphi grows, then the stock will be of great  
value to me,'' said stockholder and GM retiree Ralph Drake. ``We're 
all going to be nicely rewarded for holding on to the stock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors gave a cool response to Delphi after details of the  
distribution were released. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Delphi was  
down more than 5 percent, or by $1.06 1/4, at $19.56 1/4 a share, while 
GM was up 25 cents at $84.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the details of the spinoff, GM said its  
shareholders would effectively be getting a dividend increase. 
That's because GM said it intends to maintain its quarterly 
dividend at 50 cents a share of common stock, even though Delphi no 
longer will be part of its financial results, while Delphi intends 
to pay a dividend of 7 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Dunsby, a GM spokeswoman, said the terms of the  
spinoff were based on Tuesday's closing stock values. 
</P>
<P>
	GM first announced plans to spin off Troy-based Delphi in  
August. On Feb. 5, Delphi began trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange in an initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	J. T. Battenberg III, Delphi's chairman, chief executive officer  
and president, said independence from GM will make Delphi a 
completely different company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the final step of a long journey,'' he said Wednesday.  
``We're going through quite an extensive cultural change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be truly ... an all-new company.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tanner and Battenberg said they anticipated that GM and Delphi  
would experience growth after the split. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is truly a win-win situation,'' Battenberg said.  
``(GM) should be able to focus very sharply on their car and truck 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being the largest auto parts maker in the world,  
Delphi is the 36th largest U.S. company in terms of sales. GM, 
DaimlerChrysler, Fiat, Toyota and Volkswagen are its largest 
customers.

<HEADLINE>  Vince Carter Named Top NBA Rookie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors was the  
overwhelming choice today as the NBA's rookie of the year, 
capturing the award with 113 of 118 votes in a panel of media 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento's Jason Williams received three votes and Boston's  
Paul Pierce got two. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was the fifth selection in the 1998 NBA draft and  
averaged 18.3 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.0 assists for the Raptors. 
He was the team's leading scorer, hitting 20 or more points 20 
times and 30 or more three times. 
</P>
<P>
	An early entry player out of the University of North Carolina,  
Carter was drafted by Golden State and then swapped almost 
immediately to Toronto in exchange for cash and his college 
teammate, Antawn Jamison, who was the No. 4 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is the second Raptor to win the award. Damon Stoudamire,  
who was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in 1998, was rookie of 
the year in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The award is sponsored by Schick.

	Riding for the commercial team Saeco, the Italian edged

<HEADLINE> Charter To Buy Falcon Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen took a major  
step toward becoming a cable TV baron with a deal announced today 
to acquire Los Angeles-based cable company Falcon Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, the latest in the rapidly consolidating cable TV  
industry, will make Allen's Charter Communications Inc. of St. 
Louis the nation's fourth-largest cable company with 5.5 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter officials put the price of the deal at $3.6 billion in  
cash and stock but did not provide a breakdown or comment on how 
much assumed debt was included in the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition vaults Charter into the big leagues of the cable  
TV industry, behind AT&AMP;T, which became the industry leader with its 
purchases of TCI and MediaOne, and behind Time Warner and Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates in 1975,  
has been assembling a growing cable business over the past year. He 
also owns stakes in several technology companies, as well as 
football's Seattle Seahawks and basketball's Portland Trail 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcon acquisition furthers Allen's goal of creating a  
powerful network to deliver telecommunications services to a wide 
base of subscribers. AT&AMP;T is also hoping to use the cable TV 
pipelines to deliver packages of network services that include 
local phone service, Internet connections as well as television. 
</P>
<P>
	``These properties, when combined with our other properties, are  
an excellent fit with Paul Allen's wired-world strategy,'' Charter 
president Jerald L. Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Falcon, the deal with Charter gives the company the  
financial backing and technological expertise to upgrade its cable 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon was founded in 1975 to provide bare-bones cable service  
to remote communities underserved by broadcast TV. Most of its 
systems can deliver just 35 channels, compared with the industry 
standard of more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs of upgrading systems in sparsely populated  
communities, however, have kept small operators such as Falcon 
behind the competitive curve, driving many to sell out. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-four percent of Falcon is controlled by founder Marc B.  
Nathanson, who will become vice chairman of Charter. The other 46 
percent of Falcon is owned by AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP; Internet Services, 
which has approved the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathanson, who was appointed by President Clinton as chairman of  
U.S. International Broadcasting, said he was looking ``forward to 
helping Charter continue its rapid growth and devoting more time to 
my government duties.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Loss To Pacers Still Vivid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- The memory of the key moments in last  
year's playoff loss to the Indiana Pacers remains vivid in the 
minds of Chris Dudley and Jeff Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	It was late in the fourth quarter of Game 4, the Knicks were  
ahead by seven points and had a chance to tie the series 2-2 with a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Problem was, Rik Smits was unstoppable.  
</P>
<P>
	Dudley wanted to do something about it, but Van Gundy wouldn't  
let him as the coach stuck with an exhausted Patrick Ewing, who was 
playing just his third game after making a surprise comeback from a 
wrist injury. Smits easily outplayed him. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Dudley might get a chance to be the Smits stopper.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could see them playing together, but I can't see Patrick not  
playing down the stretch of a close game,'' Van Gundy said 
Wednesday after the team held a light workout in preparation for 
the Eastern Conference finals beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smits really hurt us in the fourth quarter of Game 4, and  
that's why we started (Dudley) him against him when we played him 
this season,'' Van Gundy said. ``Smits made a great adjustment 
against Chris and scored pretty easily the second time we played 
him at Indiana, so now it's up to Chris to adjust to what Smits did 
to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider that a message from the coach to Dudley. If he wants to  
be the stopper in Game 6 or 7, he's better be a stopper in Game 1 
or 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley was the hero of Game 3 in the second round against  
Atlanta with 14 points and 12 rebounds, but he is such an offensive 
liability that it's tough to leave him in down the stretch of close 
games. But with Ewing's mobility reduced by sore knees and Achilles 
tendinitis, Dudley might be the Knicks' best option to keep Smits 
from turning the series around as he did last year when he scored 
14 points in the fourth quarter of Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks led 100-93 with 3:47 left in that game before Smits  
scored twice and Reggie Miller hit a 3-pointer off an offensive 
rebound with 5.9 seconds left to force overtime. The Pacers went on 
to win the game and take a 3-1 lead in the second-round series they 
would eventually win 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I'd relish to be given that challenge down the  
stretch to stop him, but I have confidence in him as well,'' Dudley 
said of Ewing. ``But I do hope I get put in that situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another big-man option for the Knicks is the frail Marcus Camby,  
who will be called upon to mix it up underneath with the brawny 
Davises, Antonio and Dale, while also trying to outrun them and 
score points in transition with New York's uptempo second unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident. I mean those guys just hang around the basket  
getting putbacks and rebounds, so I definitely have to come 
prepared to battle on offensive and defensive rebounding,'' said 
Camby, who found out Wednesday that the Pacers' Antonio Davis had 
been knocking him. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis told reporters in Indianapolis that he liked the Charles  
Oakley trade because it makes the Knicks much less physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see,'' Camby said. ``It's a long series, they've got to  
beat us four times and I'll be there. We'll see.''

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Clinton Ratings Slipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public approval of President Clinton's job  
performance has slipped to its lowest level in almost three years 
in a new poll that shows the public about evenly split regarding 
which party should control Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Apprehension about the Kosovo conflict has risen in the CNN/USA  
Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's job approval declined from 60 percent earlier  
this month to 53 percent, the lowest rating he has had in that poll 
since August 1996. During the months of the Monica Lewinsky scandal 
and impeachment trial, his approval rating consistently stayed 
between 60 percent and 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the country would be better off if Republicans or  
Democrats controlled Congress, the public was divided, with just 
over a third, 36 percent, choosing Republicans and about the same 
number, 37 percent, choosing Democrats. Democrats had a 41-30 edge 
in December's CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority, 57 percent, said they were very confident or  
somewhat confident in the president's ability to handle the Kosovo 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But the number who said they were very confident in his ability  
to handle the conflict dropped from 27 percent in late March to 17 
percent in late May. And the number not at all confident in his 
ability to handle Kosovo grew from 13 percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half said they oppose sending ground troops if NATO  
airstrikes are not effective. In mid-April, a slim majority said 
they would favor sending ground troops in that circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
	And support for U.S. involvement in the NATO action in Kosovo  
slipped to 49 percent, the first time that support has been below 
50 percent since the airstrikes began in late March. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of five said they favored the United States and its  
NATO allies temporarily suspending the airstrikes and trying to 
resolve the conflict through negotiations. More than 70 percent 
opposed stopping all military action and making no further effort 
to help refugees return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,050 adults was taken Sunday and Monday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Woodard Retires From WNBL To Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Lynette Woodard, the all-time collegiate  
scoring leader and first woman to play for the Harlem 
Globetrotters, today announced she is retiring from professional 
basketball and returning to the University of Kansas as an 
assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodard scored 3,649 points during her career at Kansas and was  
named the Big Eight player of the decade for the 1980s. She was 
captain of the 1984 Olympic team that won the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides playing with the Globetrotters, Woodard's professional  
career took her to Japan and Italy before she was an elite draft 
pick of the Cleveland Rockers in the WNBL in 1997. She was with the 
Detroit Shockers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodard will become an assistant to her college coach, Marion  
Washington, who just completed her 26th season as coach of the 
Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodard, a Wichita native, played at Kansas from 1977-81.

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel To Examine Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A new ethics commission will examine 14 ``minor  
allegations'' of misconduct by IOC members during past Olympic 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee panel, set up in the wake of  
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, studied replies from national 
Olympic committees for information on any improprieties during the 
bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was determined 14 cases have not so far been addressed,''  
the IOC said in a statement Wednesday from Lausanne, Switzerland. 
``But, after a brief review, the commission noted most of them 
involved minor allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the IOC members involved and details of the  
allegations were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel established a set of rules and procedures to deal with  
each case ``rationally and fairly,'' and will submit its findings 
to the IOC executive board, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	No specific timetable was given, but the IOC said the commission  
would meet again ``as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics panel has drafted a code of conduct that  
will be submitted for approval at the committee's general assembly 
in Seoul, South Korea, next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned after being  
accused of receiving improper inducements during Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of that scandal, the IOC asked for details on any  
other misconduct by members going back to the bidding for the 1996 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the case of embattled Australian IOC member Phil  
Coles may move toward a resolution next week. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said the executive board  
will review the Coles case Monday and a special three-person 
investigative panel may meet Thursday to conclude its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles received a severe warning from the IOC for accepting  
lavish travel and other benefits from Salt Lake bidders, and is now 
under investigation for further allegations of abusing his Olympic 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	His ex-wife has told the IOC that the couple received jewelry  
valued at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid 
for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also has been accused of compiling secret dossiers on IOC  
members for Sydney's successful 2000 bid. Those files were also 
passed on to Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000, an 80-member task force set up to propose reforms and  
restructuring of the organization, will meet for the first time 
Tuesday and Wednesday in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of new openness, the IOC said the commission's plenary  
sessions would be beamed to the media via live closed-circuit 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more open,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ``We've broken a lot  
of tradition recently. We have nothing to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there will be no break with tradition at the assembly  
in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC session will remain closed,'' the spokesman said.  
``It's an important forum for debate of IOC procedures and internal 
issues.''

<HEADLINE>  Strawberry Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry of the New York Yankees  
pleaded no contest today to drug and solicitation charges, a move 
that could lead to further punishment by major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old outfielder was sentenced to 18 months of  
probation and must be tested for drugs twice a week for that time, 
Florida Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. said. He also must stay out 
of bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, recovering from colon cancer, must undergo more drug  
treatment, perform 100 hours of community service and pay $456 in 
court costs and fees. If he successfully completes probation, this 
will not go on his criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	His future in baseball is more uncertain. Strawberry is on  
administrative leave from the Yankees and now faces the possibility 
of suspension from baseball as a multiple offender of its drug 
aftercare program. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Strawberry apologized and said he hopes  
to win back the trust of his wife, family, teammates, fans and 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said he can't discuss Strawberry's  
future with the team until major league baseball acts. A telephone 
call to baseball officials in New York was not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him a week ago and he sounded good,'' Torre said  
today from Yankee Stadium before a game with Boston. ``That was my 
main concern. Initially, he sounded terrible. He seems to be better 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, accompanied to court by his wife, Charisse, and  
lawyer Joseph Ficarrotta, was lectured by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in this courtroom will be asking why this is  
happening to you,'' Espinosa said to Strawberry. ``Do you feel like 
you're special?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, dressed in a black sports jacket and matching gray  
slacks and vest, said: ``No, I do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Espinosa admonished the eight-time All-Star for being before  
him, reminding of how many similar cases he handles daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all got an excuse,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	``This really isn't about baseball. It isn't about your job, but  
about you,'' Espinosa added. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you stop producing (in baseball), nobody will care about  
you. If this is the picture of life after baseball, it's not 
pretty,'' the judge said. ``This is only an opportunity. I hope you 
make the best of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without being asked, Strawberry replied: ``I will.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after his April 14 arrest, baseball placed Strawberry  
on administrative leave, meaning he is barred from workouts or 
games with the Yankees or their farm teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with having 0.3 grams of cocaine in his wallet  
after offering an undercover police officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his probation, the judge ordered Strawberry to stay  
out of bars and asked police and prosecutors to supply him with a 
map highlighting ``hot spots'' he should avoid in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	In a handwritten statement read outside the courthouse,  
Strawberry expressed remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for any pain or disappointment I have caused any of  
them, particularly my wife, Charisse, and Mr. Steinbrenner. I hope 
that I can win their trust back,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recovery has not been easy. I am, however, committed to it  
and now that I have finished chemotherapy and feel healthy, I'm 
looking forward to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry underwent cancer surgery last October. He had been  
working at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa in hopes of 
rejoining the team when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	He told police that the cocaine found in his wallet, which had  
an estimated street value of $20, did not belong to him. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he acknowledged discussing sex with the undercover  
officer, he insisted he was joking and never intended to meet her 
at a motel.

<HEADLINE> Salad Plant Comes to North Dakota / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- In a state where beef and wheat rule, some  
agriculture officials hope to persuade farmers to try salad, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A vegetable growers' group is joining with a development  
organization to build a salad processing plant in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant would use area-grown vegetables and other products to  
produce a line of prepared deli salads for sale in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there are few vegetable growers in the region, but that  
hasn't stopped organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've done is to recognize that the processing and the  
markets for farmers have to come first,'' said Rod Holth, 
secretary-treasurer of Central Dakota Growers, one of the partners 
in the project. ``Once we have a processing facility in place, 
getting people to grow more vegetables won't be a problem at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Central Dakota Growers received a $39,000 grant from the North  
Dakota Agricultural Products Utilization Commission to prepare 
salad recipes, conduct taste tests and complete a feasibility 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is a joint effort of Central Dakota Growers, the Red  
River Trade Council and a European company with similar processing 
facilities overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Holth declined to name the company, citing confidentiality  
agreements. But he said the company has been interested in 
developing partnerships to expand vegetable processing in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Sorenson, a senior associate for agri-industry with the  
Red River Trade Council, said his organization has been trying for 
a number of years to expand vegetable farming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal has been to find markets in addition to the fresh  
produce market, which is pretty limited,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Radke, an agricultural diversification specialist with the  
North Dakota State University Extension Service, has been helping 
with the project. He said the biggest hurdle may be convincing 
farmers in North Dakota that they can grow vegetables and make a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been established in North Dakota as a vegetable  
production area, but that doesn't mean we can't grow them here,'' 
he said. ``We know we can grow the products here. What we have to 
do is set up the markets and the processing to make it 
worthwhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenson said organizers of the processing plant already have  
conducted a number of ``positive'' marketing studies and now are 
studying the feasibility of building the processing facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant money also is being used to help pay for a private  
consultant who is conducting taste tests and developing a line of 
salad recipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenson and Holth said it will be at least six months before  
organizers have a decision on whether to go ahead with the project. 
No decision has been made yet on its size, or how many people it 
might employ, or a specific site. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm very optimistic and excited about it,'' Holth said.  
``It might not be on a large scale to begin with, but I think once 
we have a processing facility and a market for growers, this thing 
could take off.''

<HEADLINE> Trade Advocates Assess China Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates of closer economic ties with China  
tried on Wednesday to gauge the damage of a House espionage report, 
even as some lawmakers sought to tighten restrictions on technology 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout, at the least, could wind up delaying negotiations  
over China's long-sought entry into the World Trade Organization, a 
slowdown that open-trade advocates suggest could hurt American 
companies more than Chinese enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional conservatives were urging those talks be put  
on hold as overall U.S.-Chinese relations are reviewed. The talks 
had already been disrupted by Chinese anger over the mistaken 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute could also make it harder for the Clinton  
administration to win congressional approval next month for 
renewing normal trade relations with China, a contentious vote even 
the best of times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should rush to judgment,'' Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said in terms of overall U.S.-Chinese 
relations. ``We should understand the full ramifications of what 
happened here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Lott asked the Senate to approve legislation  
designed to tighten export controls in trade with China to prevent 
more weapons technology from falling into Beijing's hands, and to 
strengthen Pentagon monitoring of Chinese missile launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's proposals were among a rash of legislative measures  
expected to be offered in the coming days that target Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., an advocate of closer ties with China,  
said he hoped Congress could separate trade and security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once members realize that we're not giving anything to China  
with WTO membership and that it's China that has been making all 
the concessions, this will turn out to be a temporary bump'' in 
trade relations with Beijing. ``It's for us, for America. It's 
China that has been making all the concessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Geneva-based WTO oversees and facilitates international  
trade and referees disputes. So far, most trade between China and 
the United States has been one way, with Americans mostly buying 
Chinese goods. Last year, by U.S. accounting, the trade deficit 
with China soared to a record $57 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Chinese had made key concessions on  
opening their markets to U.S. goods in an effort to win U.S. 
backing for joining the WTO. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky told a group of senators on Tuesday that there had been 
little recent progress in those talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being excluded from one of the world's fastest growing markets  
is not good for U.S. companies,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, an 
economist with the Economic Strategy Institute, which specializes 
in trade issues. ``There is no question that the embassy bombing 
and the spying charges have put a chill on relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he favors expanding trade with  
China. ``The scandal is not that China was spying on us. The 
scandal is here domestically,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chill in relations comes just days before President  
Clinton was expected to seek annual renewal of trade benefits for 
Beijing. Clinton has until June 3 to notify Congress he's renewing 
the favorable trade status that gives China the lowest-possible 
tariffs on its exports. 
</P>
<P>
	This status -- formerly known as ``most favored nation'' but now  
called ``normal trade relations'' -- is extended permanently to most 
U.S. trading partners but must be renewed yearly for China. 
Congress has 90 days to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had planned to ask for permanent trade status  
for China with its ascension to the WTO. But, with those talks now 
in limbo, it is expected to go for yet another one-year renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clearly going to be a lot of political churning in  
Congress,'' said John Schott, an analyst with the Institute for 
International Economics. ``The administration is going to have to 
make a strong case on why a policy of engagement is in the overall 
U.S. interest.''

	Congress Probing Chinese Spying  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan congressional report concludes  
that China stole information on the United States' most advanced 
thermonuclear weapons over 20 years of espionage and that thefts 
``almost certainly continue to the present.'' It also said the 
information stolen helped modernize China's nuclear program and 
that some U.S. weapon design technology may end up being 
incorporated in China's next generation of nuclear warheads. 
Committees in both the House and Senate are to learn details of the 
espionage findings at hearings Wednesday.

	India Intensifies Kashmir Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Indian Air force jets launched  
airstrikes Wednesday in the disputed mountains of Kashmir, where 
the army has been exchanging mortar and heavy artillery fire with 
Pakistani forces, a domestic news agency reported. India and 
Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir. More 
than 15,000 people have been killed in fighting between rebels and 
security forces in Kashmir in the last 10 years. The use of Indian 
air force jets was the most serious escalation of the conflict 
since both countries tested nuclear weapons in May 1998, prompting 
fears of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats said Tuesday they want their

restrictions. But GOP lawmakers are refusing to be rushed into a 
vote before mid-June. Democrats say that ignoring the urgency of 
the matter following two school shootings this year would mean 
defeat of a widely supported bill. Though Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. says he supports ``common sense'' 
legislation that keeps guns away from children, he and other 
Republicans indicated they think changes in the Senate-passed 
measure are warranted.

Wednesday, nearly 600 years after the last time it met. The 
60-member body will give Welsh lawmakers greater power over how 
their principality is run. The assembly will not have tax-raising 
or general legislative powers, but it will control distribution of 
the annual $13 billion grant from the British government. British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair proposed the assembly under a plan to 
surrender some power from the central government by giving Wales, 
Scotland and Northern Ireland more independence, while also 
preserving the British union.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A trio of lawsuits filed by Nazi death camp  
survivors accuses three German pharmaceutical companies of 
participating in gruesome and unscientific medical ``experiments'' 
by Dr. Joseph Mengele. The lawsuits filed May 13 against Bayer AG, 
Hoechst AG and Schering AG are among the first in the nation 
linking German companies to Nazi medical experiments. The 
Associated Press learned of the lawsuits Tuesday. They are the 
latest filings in a recent wave of litigation by survivors of Nazi 
death camps or slave labor factories aimed at European banks, 
insurance companies and industrial firms.

conducted for the American Association of Retired Persons. The 
respondents said they would prefer to live to about 91, on average.

percent.

Cardinals on Tuesday night. Mark McGwire homered for the fifth time 
in six games, hitting his 13th for St. Louis. The loss was the most 
lopsided for the Cardinals since Atlanta beat them 17-1 on May 8, 
1991. The Cardinals had not allowed so many runs since losing to 
San Diego 17-4 on Aug. 24, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Living to 100 Not Such a Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Everybody wants to live to 100, right? Not  
according to a new survey. It found that Americans, on average, 
would rather call it quits at 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, only about one in four Americans hopes to reach the  
100-year milestone, according to survey conducted for the American 
Association of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings left a leading researcher on centenarians -- folks  
who are least 100 years old -- scratching his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was struck by the low number of people who want to live to  
be 100,'' said Dr. Thomas Perls of Harvard Medical School. ``The 
vast majority of us have incredible genes to get to our mid to late 
80s and we can compress the time that we're sick to the very end of 
our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perls speculated that people may not want to live to 100 because  
they aren't preparing well for old age. People have poor diets and 
exercise habits and are living about 10 years less than ``our 
average set of genes would allow us to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Official calculations in recent years for the life expectancy of  
newborn babies were just over 73 for males and just over 79 for 
females, said Richard Suzman, a researcher at the National 
Institute on Aging. For those who live to age 65, men on average 
live an additional 15 to 16 years and women an additional 19, he 
said. Some demographers place life expectancies for those born 
today even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons most often given for not wanting to live to 100 were  
worries about declining health, mentioned by 46 percent, and 
concerns about not having enough money to support themselves, 38 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While 63 percent said they didn't want to live to be 100, just  
over a fourth, 27 percent, said they did want to reach that age. 
Ten percent either didn't answer or said they don't know how long 
they want to live. The respondents said they would prefer to live 
to about 91, on average. 
</P>
<P>
	Those polled were optimistic about medical advances. About  
three-fourths think there will be cures for cancer, AIDS and 
Alzheimer's disease over the next 50 years, and about two-thirds 
think there will be a cure for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Constance Swank, research director for AARP, the nation's  
largest advocacy group for people over 50, said the optimism about 
medical cures was noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Older respondents were more optimistic than younger  
respondents,'' she said. ``Older respondents have seen medical 
breakthroughs for diseases like polio and tuberculosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other concerns about aging mentioned by those surveyed were the  
possibility of losing mental faculties, increasing dependence on 
others, being isolated or alone and living in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive features of living to old age were having more time to  
spend with family and friends, not having to work after retirement 
and having time for hobbies and for personal or spiritual growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The respondents, on average, thought that a person is considered  
``old'' when they reach age 69. Young adults between 18 and 24 
thought old age started at age 58 and those 55 or older say that 
someone 74 or older is considered ``old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is being released in connection with the airing,  
starting June 2, of the PBS special, ``Stealing Time: The New 
Science of Aging.'' That special is funded in part by AARP and the 
AARP Andrus Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 2,032 adults was taken April 9-14 and has an  
error margin of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, larger for 
subgroups.

<HEADLINE>  Strawberry Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry of the New York Yankees  
pleaded no contest today to drug and solicitation charges, a move 
that could lead to further punishment by major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old outfielder was sentenced to 18 months of  
probation and must be tested for drugs twice a week for that time, 
Florida Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. said. He also must stay out 
of bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, recovering from colon cancer, must undergo more drug  
treatment, perform 100 hours of community service and pay $456 in 
court costs and fees. If he successfully completes probation, this 
will not go on his criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	His future in baseball is more uncertain. Strawberry is on  
administrative leave from the Yankees and now faces the possibility 
of suspension from baseball as a multiple offender of its drug 
aftercare program. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Strawberry apologized and said he hopes  
to win back the trust of his wife, family, teammates, fans and 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said he can't discuss Strawberry's  
future with the team until major league baseball acts. A telephone 
call to baseball officials in New York was not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him a week ago and he sounded good,'' Torre said  
today from Yankee Stadium before a game with Boston. ``That was my 
main concern. Initially, he sounded terrible. He seems to be better 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, accompanied to court by his wife, Charisse, and  
lawyer Joseph Ficarrotta, was lectured by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in this courtroom will be asking why this is  
happening to you,'' Espinosa said to Strawberry. ``Do you feel like 
you're special?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, dressed in a black sports jacket and matching gray  
slacks and vest, said: ``No, I do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Espinosa admonished the eight-time All-Star for being before  
him, reminding of how many similar cases he handles daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all got an excuse,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	``This really isn't about baseball. It isn't about your job, but  
about you,'' Espinosa added. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you stop producing (in baseball), nobody will care about  
you. If this is the picture of life after baseball, it's not 
pretty,'' the judge said. ``This is only an opportunity. I hope you 
make the best of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without being asked, Strawberry replied: ``I will.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after his April 14 arrest, baseball placed Strawberry  
on administrative leave, meaning he is barred from workouts or 
games with the Yankees or their farm teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with having 0.3 grams of cocaine in his wallet  
after offering an undercover police officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his probation, the judge ordered Strawberry to stay  
out of bars and asked police and prosecutors to supply him with a 
map highlighting ``hot spots'' he should avoid in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	In a handwritten statement read outside the courthouse,  
Strawberry expressed remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for any pain or disappointment I have caused any of  
them, particularly my wife, Charisse, and Mr. Steinbrenner. I hope 
that I can win their trust back,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recovery has not been easy. I am, however, committed to it  
and now that I have finished chemotherapy and feel healthy, I'm 
looking forward to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry underwent cancer surgery last October. He had been  
working at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa in hopes of 
rejoining the team when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	He told police that the cocaine found in his wallet, which had  
an estimated street value of $20, did not belong to him. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he acknowledged discussing sex with the undercover  
officer, he insisted he was joking and never intended to meet her 
at a motel.

<HEADLINE> Reform Jews Debate New Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Traditional practices such as keeping kosher  
and praying in Hebrew would be encouraged under a new set of 
guidelines being debated by the biggest and most liberal branch of 
American Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the governing body of  
Reform Judaism, worked until late Tuesday on the new set of 
principles aimed at a return to tradition, then postponed their 
vote to allow for more debate today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Eric Wisnia of New York City argued this morning that the  
group should not feel an obligation to pass the principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't broken. Why are we fixing it?'' Wisnia said as  
debate resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the document was so flawed that if passed, the rabbis  
would eventually have to repeat the same tortuous process of 
rewriting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a perfect document, but it is an important one,''  
countered Rabbi Laura Geller of Beverly Hills, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The 550 men and women were expected to eventually approve the  
major revision in the Principles of Reform Judaism, which are not 
enforceable regulations but more like suggestions or guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an organization where there are no smoky back rooms,''  
Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, executive vice president of the 
1,700-member rabbis' group, said in explanation of the delay 
Tuesday. ``We respect our members. ... We never expected it to go 
smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prompting much of the debate was a section on intermarriage.  
Some participants were concerned that the section could be 
interpreted as condoning intermarriage, when their intent was 
instead to welcome non-Jews who were willing to convert. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new platform, ancient rituals sometimes scoffed at or  
ignored in Reform communities and usually associated with 
Conservative or Orthodox Jewry would again be embraced, such as the 
wearing of yarmulkes and prayer shawls, the observance of Jewish 
dietary laws and the use of Hebrew during prayer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform leaders said many of the 1.5 million Reform Jews in the  
United States already have been returning to traditional practices, 
and the new principles would only reinforce that. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's meeting was only the fourth time since Reform Judaism  
was established in North America in the mid-19th century that the 
rabbis' group met to issue comprehensive principles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1885, 15 Reform rabbis issued the Pittsburgh Platform, which  
rejected traditional Jewish practices as ``entirely foreign'' for 
modern American times. 
</P>
<P>
	A platform adopted in 1937 encouraged rabbis to incorporate  
science into their views of sacred literature. And a conference in 
1976 produced a call for diversity, individuality and change. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest platform was not reached without controversy and  
several rewordings. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier draft was dubbed ``Conservative lite'' by Rabbi  
Robert M. Seltzer, professor of Jewish history at the City 
University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform leaders said the final draft maintains the traditional  
Reform ethos that sets their branch apart from Conservative Judaism 
-- the idea that Jews should choose traditions that help them and 
bypass those that do not.

<HEADLINE> Dolly the Sheep May Age Prematurely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dolly the cloned sheep may be susceptible to premature aging and  
disease because her genes were copied from a 6-year old sheep, 
Scottish scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no direct evidence that Dolly will die prematurely. She  
is a healthy 3-year-old Finn Dorset sheep and has delivered lambs 
in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the older DNA in her cells shows telltale signs of wear that  
are more typical of an older animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Geneticists said the finding, published in Thursday's issue of  
the journal Nature, provides further evidence that cloning has its 
limits and that researchers cannot endlessly manufacture copies of 
animals without the original genetic blueprint wearing out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recall when the news first came out, somebody said that  
Dolly was a sheep in lamb's clothing,'' said Jerry Shay, a 
molecular biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center in Dallas. ``I think that's an appropriate quote now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Dolly became the first large animal to be cloned from  
genetic material extracted from an adult cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists inserted a cell from a ewe's udder into an egg from  
the same animal after removing the egg's DNA. The bioengineered 
embryo was implanted in the ewe's womb and Dolly developed as a 
clone. Her birth at the Roslin Institute in Scotland was announced 
in 1997 and caused an international sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, researchers at PPL Therapeutics, a firm associated with the  
Roslin Institute, have determined that the ``caps'' on Dolly's DNA 
that regulate a cell's lifespan are shorter than average. 
</P>
<P>
	All chromosomes are capped with tips known as telomeres that  
prevent a cell's genetic code from fraying. When the telomere 
finally wears down after repeated cell division, it signals the 
cell to self-destruct as part of the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortened telomeres had been predicted as one outcome of  
cloning, said Alan Colman, research director for PPL. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Dolly could age faster and be more at risk for  
cancer, which occurs when cells fail to self-destruct and begin 
uncontrolled growth. Sheep have a life expectancy of 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd also expect reduced fertility,'' said David Corey,  
another UT Southwestern Medical Center researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic tests are continuing on Dolly's offspring, including  
Bonnie, born in 1998, and a set of triplets born this year. Tests 
on Bonnie showed no significant telomere shortening, but she was 
conceived naturally, and half her DNA came from her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Colman said the only problem posed by telomere fraying could  
come if a clone were made from a clone, ``but we see no reason why 
sequential cloning would be necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corey said sequential cloning would be like making a copy on a  
photocopying machine, and then putting the fresh copy into the 
machine and repeating the process. Eventually, the copies are 
unreadable-- just as the genetic code would be unreadable.

<HEADLINE> Appleby To Defend Kemper Golf Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Stuart Appleby knows the galleries will be  
pulling for him at the Kemper Open -- the last tournament his wife 
saw him win before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my choice to be the sentimental favorite,'' he said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renay Appleby was crushed by a car last year while unloading  
luggage at a London train station after the British Open, six weeks 
after Kemper. 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby credits his wife's inspiration for subsequent victories  
at the Coolum Classic in Australia in December and the Houston Open 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to think there are people out there supporting me,  
maybe more than someone else,'' he said. ``That's their choice. I'd 
rather be someone who they like and they're all happy to see win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby will not be the only favorite when the field tees off  
Thursday at the tree-lined TPC at Avenel course. There is also Fred 
Funk, who was born in nearby Takoma Park and coached at the 
University of Maryland from 1982-88. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Kemper, Appleby and Funk walked together down the  
18th fairway in the final group. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first time Funk lost a tournament he led going into  
the final round. He shot a 77 to tie for third, missing by far his 
best chance to win one of the biggest events on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I replayed for months what happened to me on Sunday,'' Funk  
said. ``I wanted this tournament too much. I put a lot of pressure 
on myself. Two days after that, I didn't sleep for three days. 
Since then, I have had trouble on weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funk has been playing better lately, tying for second last week  
at the Colonial, but he's been bothered this week by a recurring 
neck injury that would have him withdrawing from other tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to push it,'' Funk said. ``If I can swing  
at all, I'm going to play. If it were a normal tournament, I'd have 
probably pulled out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another golfer with a hot game, and local ties, is Olin Browne,  
a Washington native who won the Colonial for his second career 
title. He's dealing with his restless nights before the tournament 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I haven't had a decent night's  
sleep yet,'' said Browne, who is staying with his mother and having 
his brother caddy. ``I'm just going to try to let things flow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since it became host of the Kemper 12 years ago, the Avenel has  
developed into a challenging course that merits respect. 
</P>
<P>
	All the winners of last year's majors -- Vijay Singh, Lee Janzen  
and Mark O'Meara -- are in the field, as are seven of the top 15 on 
the PGA Tour money list.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Man Accused of Abusing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- A man has been arrested for allegedly  
beating and starving his disabled wife for 17 years, hiding her 
from the world on a decrepit sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Matthew David, 59, pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges  
of second-degree assault. He could get up to 10 years in prison. He 
was being held on $150,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, police were called to the couple's sailboat by a social  
worker who was trying to determine whether David was fraudulently 
collecting his wife's disability checks. She has multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Linda David, 50, wearing filthy, vomit-stained  
clothes in a room covered with dog feces, according to court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	She was almost blind and barely able to speak. Her face was  
badly scarred, and her arms had been broken and had healed without 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to some of the officers who were involved at the  
time,'' police spokesman Elliot Woodall said Tuesday, ``and they 
said that it was among the worst conditions they'd ever seen a 
human living in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. David, who is now recovering in a nursing home, said: ``No  
way I could get off (the boat) to get help. That was home. I never 
had anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said David wasn't arrested for 2 1/2 more years because  
of the difficulty in building a case. He had kept his wife so 
well-hidden that neighbors thought she did not really exist, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	David said any injuries his wife suffered came when she fell out  
of a truck.

<HEADLINE> NY Cop Case Continues Without Volpe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge told jurors today that a white police  
officer had pleaded guilty to torturing a Haitian immigrant with a 
wooden stick, and rejected a motion for a mistrial by two 
co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Eugene Nickerson did not detail Officer Justin Volpe's  
plea Tuesday other than to tell jurors he pleaded guilty. He 
cautioned the 12 jurors and six alternates that the development 
``can't be used as evidence in determining whether the other 
defendants are guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors, who are not sequestered, had no visible reaction.  
The lead defendant was conspicuously absent when the jury returned 
to Brooklyn federal court today. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge rejected defense motions for a mistrial. Defense  
attorney John Patten, who represents Sgt. Michael Bellomo, said 
Tuesday that Volpe's departure creates ``a prejudice that adheres 
to everyone else at the defense table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday -- with his mid-trial bid for a plea bargain rejected  
and chances of an acquittal obliterated -- Volpe pleaded guilty to 
violating the civil rights of the prisoner, Abner Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	``There came a point in time where the evidence became  
overwhelming,'' said Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, admitted ramming a stick into the handcuffed victim's  
rectum, pulling it out and putting it up to his face. He said he 
mistakenly believed Louima had punched him while police tried to 
quell a disturbance outside a nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's dramatic decision could land him in prison for the rest  
of his life. What it meant for his co-defendants was much less 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The spotlight could shift to Officer Charles Schwarz, who is  
accused of holding down Louima, 32, during the assault in the 
bathroom of the stationhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz and Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder also are  
charged with beating Louima in a patrol car en route to the 70th 
police precinct after his arrest on false charges he punched Volpe. 
Bellomo, their supervisor, is charged with covering up the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima has identified Schwarz as the second bathroom assailant.  
Two police officers also testified that they saw the officer 
searching Louima at the front desk of the station hours before 
marching him in the general direction of the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	During Tuesday's hearing, Volpe said another officer was present  
during the attack in the bathroom. When pressed by the judge, he 
said the other officer did not hit Louima but ``saw what was going 
on and did nothing to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was understood from the circumstances that the police  
officer would do nothing to stop me or report it to anyone,'' Volpe 
said. Volpe did not name the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz has denied ever being in the bathroom.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury learned of Volpe's plea as the U.S. Civil Rights  
Commission began holding hearings this morning on the New York 
Police Department -- how it operates, trains its officers and deals 
with non-white citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani testified that there had been fewer fatal  
shootings by police and fewer incidents of discharging weapons than 
in the past. His comments were met by hissing and groans from the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor acknowledged that the police force does not reflect  
the city's racial makeup, but said there were new recruiting 
efforts, and he insisted that the police stop suspects based on 
descriptions given to them by victims, and not because of a policy 
of racial profiling.

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Hart Is Victim of Gimmicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It takes more than a full nelson or a good body  
slam to impress the rabid pro wrestling fans of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters are constantly trying to outdo each other by offering  
more salacious storylines, more muscle-bound behemoths and more 
hardcore action -- from guys slamming each other with ladders, 
barbed wire and trash cans to 225-pound men flying in from the 
rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	The can-you-top-this pursuit of more outrageous stunts may have  
cost Owen Hart, the Blue Blazer, his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, wrestling was getting so far out and my poor brother  
Owen was a sacrifice for the ratings,'' Ellie Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, a member of a prominent Canadian wrestling family,  
plummeted at least 70 feet to his death Sunday at Kemper Arena in 
Kansas City, Mo., as he was being lowered into the ring from the 
ceiling by cables. The cause of the accident is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's family lashed out Tuesday at wrestling officials, saying  
both the Stamford, Conn.-based World Wrestling Federation and 
Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling take too many chances 
with perilous stunts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept on getting more and more far out with the gimmicks  
and angles,'' Ms. Hart said. ``We figured sooner or later somebody 
was going to end up with a tragedy because of the direction 
wrestling was taking with both WWF and WCW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF would not comment on safety. In the past, president  
Vince McMahon has said the violence and sexual innuendo are no 
worse than other prime-time shows. WCW President Eric Bischoff has 
blamed the WWF, accusing the rival organization of pushing the 
envelope on inappropriate material. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bischoff said Tuesday that criticism of wrestling after  
the accident is a ``knee-jerk, uneducated reaction to a very tragic 
incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Accidents occur at every walk of life, at construction  
sites,'' he said. ``Accidents happen in our line of work as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The competing Monday night shows from the WWF and the WCF have  
been the top two cable programs for more than a year, routinely 
beating out ``real'' sports like basketball and baseball. Millions 
also tune in to monthly pay-per-view extravaganzas that cost about 
$30 a pop and feature even more outrageous and uncensored action. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling is now so mainstream that a former star, Jesse ``The  
Body'' Ventura, was elected governor of Minnesota, and Hulk Hogan 
is considering a presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Meltzer, editor of the weekly Wrestling Observer  
newsletter, said the competition and the money at stake have led 
both organizations to become more reckless in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to go to greater and greater extremes to get the  
fans going,'' he said. ``It used to be one guy hitting one guy with 
a chair. Now you have to set them on fire, you have to throw them 
off the balcony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The competition between the two companies heated up in the last  
few years after Ted Turner took control of WCW -- once a second-tier 
Southern federation -- and used his money and marketing clout to 
take on the WWF. The WCW began signing away the WWF's biggest 
stars, including Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	As the WCW climbed in the ratings, WWF's show became more  
adult-oriented, with extreme violence and lusty story lines. One 
character -- Val Venis -- was introduced as a former porn star. He 
had a particularly lewd finishing move called ``The Money Shot,'' 
and was involved in a skit in which he was supposedly castrated. 
</P>
<P>
	To stay ahead of each other and underdog Extreme Championship  
Wrestling, both organizations are employing even more wild tactics: 
dance teams in tight outfits; female managers who wear heels and 
revealing gowns at ringside; and no-holds-barred -- but scripted -- 
matches in which men batter each other with wooden planks, road 
signs and metal pots. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the battles spill out of the ring onto the concrete  
floor, and even into arena tunnels and locker rooms. Sometimes the 
wrestlers even go into the parking lot and throw each other through 
windshields. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, WWF's Mick Foley fell 15 feet from the top of  
a cage through a table, then was thrown through the cage roof, 
suffering a broken collarbone and losing some teeth. WCW's Sting 
has been flying into the ring from the rafters in a stunt similar 
to Hart's for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lichter, president of Center for Media and Public Affairs,  
said wrestling has ``gone from something laughable to something 
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's brother Bret, a WCW star, told ABC's ``Good Morning  
America'' Tuesday that his brother was uneasy about the stunt, 
``but somehow over the weekend he got talked into doing it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're professional wrestlers. We take our falls on the mat,  
inside the ring,'' Hart said. ``I was never a stuntman, and my 
brother Owen was never a stuntman.''

<HEADLINE> Spy Threat to U.S. May Be Marginal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lost amid the alarm over the alleged Chinese  
theft of U.S. nuclear secrets is a conclusion being articulated by 
arms control advocates, intelligence officials and even some 
Republicans: The threat to the United States may be marginal at 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
	China has yet to field a weapon a decade after it purportedly  
stole design information from U.S. nuclear weapons labs, they say. 
Some of the information Beijing's spies allegedly collected is now 
declassified. And in the strange world of nuclear strategy, a 
somewhat improved Chinese nuclear arsenal may actually add to 
superpower stability, these critics argue, by reducing the chances 
that anyone would be tempted to launch a preemptive first strike on 
China's arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	These cautionary voices have been drowned out amid the uproar on  
Capitol Hill over a special report by a House select committee on 
Chinese espionage that studied China's efforts to improve its 
nuclear warheads and the missiles that deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	Also lost is the fact that Tuesday's report is filled with  
conditional phrases: the People's Republic of China ``could'' or 
``may'' take detrimental actions ``if the PRC decides to develop'' 
weapons it currently does not possess. 
</P>
<P>
	``The depiction of China as an impending nuclear nemesis just  
does not accord with the facts,'' said Robert Norris, a nuclear 
weapons expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an arms 
control and environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the report hinges on a prediction that China will soon  
test and field improved weapons based in part on secrets allegedly 
stolen from U.S. nuclear weapons labs. For example, China is 
developing a mobile DF-31 missile that the report says could be 
tested later this year and fielded in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 15-year-old weapons system already. It's never been  
tested,'' said Norris. ``It may be tested this year. I think five 
years ago I said the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who chaired the House committee  
that wrote the report, said nothing was blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not engage in opinion. We reported only facts, and that  
is why we could agree with one another,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served two  
Republican presidents, cautioned Wednesday against overreacting to 
the espionage in a way that so demonizes China that it hurts U.S. 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	He told senators that even with stolen U.S. nuclear secrets, it  
would take China 15 years to develop the capacity to manufacture 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about the deterioration in our relations with  
China,'' Kissinger told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats have noted that the report's predictions were  
written in a ``worst-case fashion,'' but both Republicans and 
Democrats alike were anxious to position themselves as concerned 
and responsive to the perceived threat. 
</P>
<P>
	One fact not in dispute is that the U.S. arsenal is vastly  
superior to Beijing's. China has 20 single-warhead ICBMs capable of 
reaching North America. The United States has about 6,000 nuclear 
warheads that could reach China. 
</P>
<P>
	To field improved nuclear weapons with any confidence, China  
would have to conduct several explosive tests per weapon, said 
Daryl Kimble of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	But China has signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a pact  
about to be considered for ratification by the National Peoples 
Assembly. The treaty bans all nuclear testing, including 
underground.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Players Do Desperation Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stick around as long as John Stockton and Karl Malone have, and  
little tricks become a big part of your arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	They do desperation well.  
</P>
<P>
	Old age and treachery beat youth and skill Tuesday night, though  
it might be for the last time this season. Down 3-1 and facing 
elimination in their Western Conference semifinal against Portland, 
Stockton and Malone had enough up their sleeves to lead Utah to an 
88-71 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did everything better than we did -- physically, mentally,  
emotionally, spiritually,'' the Trail Blazers' Greg Anthony said. 
``They won every facet of the game. They out-everythinged us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That should have surprised no one. The Jazz are 6-1 the last  
seven times they faced elimination, including three times in the 
past 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple. Like aging actors, the 37-year-old  
Stockton and the 35-year-old Malone -- with 29 postseasons between 
them -- are no longer capable of a command performance every night. 
But on any given night, they can take back as many seasons as they 
need to. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was an inspiration from the outset Tuesday, scoring 11  
points and leveling Portland's Brian Grant with an elbow as the 
Jazz put together their best opening quarter this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm passive, I think they are,'' Malone said about his  
teammates. ``So I tried to be aggressive right off the bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His attitude was infectious. The Jazz defended a little more  
ferociously, their cuts to the basket were sharper, their picks to 
free shooters a little more rattling. Everybody in a white jersey 
thrived from the increased contact, but no one more than Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first four games, he seemed uncomfortable running  
the offense, always peeking over his shoulder for the bigger, 
younger, stronger defenders Portland kept throwing at him. But on 
this night, Stockton was the conductor in charge of his orchestra 
again. He remembered where everything was; and what he couldn't 
see, he sensed. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton tracked Shandon Anderson weaving through traffic and  
threaded a bounce pass that met him at the intersection of baseline 
and basket. Or he drove the lane himself, sensed Bryon Russell 
parked in the corner and instinctively whipped the ball out for a 
3-pointer. Stockton finished with only six points, but he had 14 
assists -- four more than the entire Portland team -- and committed 
just two turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's game was as confrontational as Stockton's was subtle.  
Coming down with a rebound in the first quarter, his elbow caught 
Grant above the right eye, opening a cut that would require six 
stitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anything in that game was done intentionally,''  
the Trail Blazers' Jim Jackson said. ``It was just a really, really 
physical game with some hard play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA, of course, will have final say on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
	Malone was slapped with a $10,000 fine for elbowing Grant in  
Game 1. And though he would never admit as much, if the Mailman 
gets slapped for this second delivery, he would consider it money 
well spent. Because up until the moment Grant's face interrupted 
Malone's landing, the momentum in the series was flowing one way -- 
Portland's. 
</P>
<P>
	And like a delayed knockout, Grant didn't feel the blow's effect  
until nine minutes remained. With Portland trailing 72-58, he got 
whistled for swinging his elbows on a rebound and then, after the 
Jazz missed their next shot and Grant rebounded again, he got hit 
with a technical because he pretended to throw the ball at Malone's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	That set Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy after referee Ron  
Garretson, dragging two assistant coaches and Anthony along until 
Dunleavy got ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy acknowledged that for the moment, anyway, the Jazz had  
regained some of their edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have some momentum after this,'' Dunleavy said. ``It's  
our job to take it away from them, however we have to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Portland is younger, deeper, just as tough and unlikely  
to get sucker-punched again, they will. 
</P>
<P>
	Too bad.  
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Stockton have shared the MVP award at an All-Star  
game, received gold medals at the Olympics together and stood 
side-by-side when the NBA's ``50 Greatest'' were assembled. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also walked off the floor in disappointment together  
when the Bulls and Michael Jordan won the championship the last two 
years. With the breakup in Chicago, this was supposed to be their 
year. But life is rarely fair. It might turn out that all those 
seasons of hard work bought Stockton and Malone, finally, was one 
more magnificent night.

<HEADLINE> CBS Is Season's Ratings Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is back as television's top network, but not  
everybody is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The home of ``Touched By an Angel'' and ``Everybody Loves  
Raymond'' has claimed the season's ratings crown for the first time 
in five years. The television season is considered over after 
today, when summer reruns begin. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's accomplishment, climbing from a distant third three years  
ago, was minimized by some rivals and advertisers who deride it as 
an old folk's network. And it occurred within the broader context 
of continued slipping viewership among broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS will earn a narrow victory over NBC, which won the last  
three seasons. ABC will be third and Fox fourth, according to 
Nielsen Media Research estimates. CBS President Leslie Moonves 
called the win ``greatly gratifying'' on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be applauded for that, mildly -- clap, clap,  
clap,'' said Gene DeWitt, head of the advertising firm DeWitt 
Media. ``It's nice, but the CBS thing is not going to get them a 
single penny from advertisers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because among adults aged 18 to 49, the demographic group  
most prized by advertisers, CBS is in fourth place behind NBC, Fox 
and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the Nielsen derby for top network is fourth on NBC's  
list of priorities, said Scott Sassa, NBC West Coast president. NBC 
concentrates on the 18-49 age group, upscale demographics and 
making sure it provides strong programming leading in to its 
affiliates' nighttime news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NBC easily saw the most precipitous decline in viewership  
among the major networks. It was hurt by the loss of ``Seinfeld'' 
and the ratings deterioration of its strong Thursday lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa estimated that NBC earns an average of $160,000 per  
30-second prime-time advertisement, and CBS gets half that. Moonves 
said NBC's estimated earnings were inflated. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we try to do is get the audience that will provide us  
with the best opportunity to get ad revenue,'' Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS considers those arguments the sour grapes of losers. CBS  
said it is effectively the top choice for everyone over aged 35, 
and that the ability to reach the largest possible audience is 
increasingly valuable at a time television viewership is 
splintering. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ability to reach a broader audience is even more important  
as its rivals all seek younger viewers next fall. Moonves said 
there are 11 dramas dealing with teen-aged angst on the upcoming 
fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to chase what everyone else is chasing,'' he  
said. ``Our strategy is to be different and it's working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, NBC and ABC each will set all-time ratings lows this  
season. Fox will be lower than at any time since its inaugural 
season. The rating that CBS is projecting for its final average 
would have put the network in fourth place just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss in viewership share is inevitable given the increasing  
number of alternatives on the cable dial, Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the fledgling WB is the only network to see its  
ratings go up from last year. It has done well with the popular 
family show ``7th Heaven'' and a series of dramas appealing 
primarily to teen-aged girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a victor this season, it's the WB,'' DeWitt said.  
``They have grown a relatively young audience from a small base.''

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Brother Said Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's 12-year-old brother was  
reportedly questioned by the grand jury investigating the little 
girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke Ramsey appeared before the panel last week, according to  
today's Denver Rocky Mountain News, which cited a family friend, 
and KUSA-TV. Boulder authorities would not comment on whether the 
boy appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't ever comment on grand jury matters, whether  
they're true or false,'' said Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for 
District Attorney Alex Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	However, authorities have said previously that Burke is  
considered a witness in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke was 9 when his sister was found beaten and strangled in  
the basement of the family's Boulder home in 1996, the day after 
Christmas. Other than his parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, Burke was 
the only person known to have been in the house when the 6-year-old 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said that the parents remain under suspicion. A  
grand jury has been investigating the case since Sept. 15. Its work 
is secret, but it's believed neither of JonBenet's parents has 
appeared before the panel.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Story Flops in the Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In terms Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura can  
understand, his television story was body-slammed by Michael 
Landon, Cleopatra and Will Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, with the help of Landon and Susan Lucci's victory at the  
Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday, won last week's Nielsens prime-time 
ratings race over second-place NBC as the May ratings ``sweeps'' 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	For the broadcast networks, Sunday nights are often the most  
competitive sweeps month battlegrounds. Sunday is usually the most 
popular night for TV viewing and the time for the networks' 
high-profile movies and mini-series. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's Sunday movie, ``Michael Landon: The Father I Knew''  
narrowly beat ABC's critically-praised miniseries opener, 
``Cleopatra.'' Both were in the week's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's showing of the Smith movie, ``Independence Day,'' came in  
third place Sunday night. But it was still the network's second 
most-watched program of the week behind ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's TV movie on Ventura, the former pro wrestler and now  
Minnesota governor, was the big loser. It drew poor reviews and 
even worse ratings, a dismal 58th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC can take some solace from the solid performance of its  
Thursday night lineup. The triumvirate of ``ER,'' ``Frasier'' and 
``Friends,'' in their season finales, was easily the week's three 
most-watched programs. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's telecast of the Daytime Emmy awards was Friday's most  
popular program. Soap star Lucci climaxed that broadcast by winning 
her first best actress award after 18 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.6 rating and 16 share, and NBC had a  
9.3 rating and 16 share. ABC was third at 7.3 and 12, while Fox had 
a 7.0 rating and 12 share. The WB had a 3.4 rating and 6 share, UPN 
had a 1.7 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.4 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.1 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 5.8 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 17-23, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 22.1; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 18.1; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 17.0; ``CBS Tuesday Movie: Joan of Arc, Part 
Two,'' CBS, 12.9; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.6; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: Michael Landon, the Father I Knew,'' CBS, 12.4; ``ABC 
Premiere Event: Cleopatra,'' ABC, 11.9; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.7; 
``Home Improvement'' special, ABC, 11.6; ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 
11.3; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.3.

<HEADLINE> Informix, Ernst &AMP; Young Settle Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Database software maker Informix Corp.  
and its former auditors today agreed to pay $142 million to settle 
allegations the company misstated revenues and traded on inside 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Informix and Ernst &AMP; Young LLP, the former auditors,  
reported the signing. The amount is more than twice what the 
company earned last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that we have reached this settlement,'' said  
Bob Finocchio, chairman and chief executive officer for Informix. 
``It is a well-structured solution that allows Informix to move 
forward unhindered. We can now devote all of our efforts to 
building the new Informix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Informix said the deal, which is subject to court approval,  
calls for the company to pay about $3.2 million in cash, $13.8 
million in insurance payments on behalf of several current and 
former officers, and 9 million shares of company stock worth about 
$91 million. Ernst &AMP; Young will pay $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernst &AMP; Young LLP made a business decision to settle in order  
to eliminate the burden of further litigation,'' company spokesman 
Don Howarth said Wednesday. ``Our former client, Informix, also 
wished to settle so a global resolution to the matter made sense 
from a business perspective. There is no admission of wrongdoing 
from Ernst &AMP; Young in the settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go to compensate those who held company stock  
from early 1995 to late 1997. During that period, Informix 
allegedly padded revenues with hundreds of millions of dollars in 
nonexistent sales to boost the company's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Chief Executive Officer Phillip E. White and former  
Informix Chief Financial Officer Howard Graham sold more than $15 
million worth of stock before the company announced in 1997 it was 
losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission questioned Informix and,  
in November 1997, the company restated its financial results for 
the previous 14 quarters, wiping out almost $240 million in 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Informix, based in Menlo Park, earned $57.7 million on sales of  
$735 million last year.
