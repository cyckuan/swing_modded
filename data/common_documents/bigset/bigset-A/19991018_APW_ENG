<HEADLINE> BoSox Fans May Redeem Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They had one more chance to get it right.  
</P>
<P>
	No, not the Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
	Their fans.  
</P>
<P>
	The ruckus in Fenway Park near the end of Game 4 of the American  
League playoffs was the reason there were almost as many cops on 
hand Monday night as there were at Woodstock this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing ballplayers used to talk about New York or Philadelphia  
-- sometimes Cleveland and Chicago -- as the tough places to play. 
There's no need to bother with lists anymore. Every town is tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, we understand their frustration,'' Boston center fielder  
Darren Lewis said. ``But when you throw things on the field, you're 
crossing a line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sad part about too many sporting events is how blurred the  
line has become. Only a few letters, after all, separate ``fan'' 
from ``fanatic.'' What's troubling about now, however, is how 
easily a few miscreants, stoked by alcohol, rage or a pathetic need 
to be part of the show, can lead entire crowds down the wrong road. 
</P>
<P>
	What ever happened to peer pressure? At an NFL game in  
Philadelphia a few weeks ago, ugliness spread through the stands at 
Veterans Stadium like a virus. While Dallas Cowboys receiver 
Michael Irvin lay motionless on the turf after a numbing hit, what 
began as a few isolated cheers gathered momentum until it crashed 
over him like a wave. Minutes later, the same sick sentiment 
rippled through the crowd a second time as a stretcher was rolled 
onto the field to carry Irvin off. 
</P>
<P>
	That episode hardly marked the first time an injury to an  
opposing player was cheered. Especially in Philly, a town so tough, 
a manager once joked, that when baseball games were rained out, 
fans went to the airport and booed bad landings. Yet, what was so 
troublesome about the latest display there was how easily the crowd 
let a few morons hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the number of bottle- and garbage-throwers in the  
Sunday night crowd at Fenway were just a few dozen among nearly 
34,000 people. What was stunning was how quickly those few managed 
to make the whole place feel unsafe. All they needed was an excuse. 
And when Red Sox manager Jimy Williams went out to argue an 
umpire's blown call -- the third to go against Boston this series -- 
they had it. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, every baseball fan knows the story of how Red Sox owner  
Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to New York just before the 1920 season 
to finance a Broadway play. And how The Bambino led the Yankees to 
the first of their 24 World Series titles and how Boston has not 
won one since. Naturally, some people believe Williams' tirade 
provided the wick for those 80 years of bottled-up frustration that 
spilled over after Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	What a crock. Even Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whose  
ballpark may be the most notorious garden spot in all of sports, 
knew better. What happened Sunday night was the same thing that 
always happens: a few idiots act up; too many other people stand 
around and do nothing, or worse, get caught up in the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys are too young to remember,'' he lectured reporters  
late Sunday night, ``but things could get pretty brutal around here 
in the 1970s when the Yankees came to town. Same thing with the Red 
Sox in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What changed the mood back then was an agreement between  
Steinbrenner and Haywood Sullivan, his counterpart in Boston, to 
ratchet down the rivalry by any means necessary. They started with 
more cops, cracked down on rowdy fans faster, and ejected people at 
the hint of a problem. While no owners have had the guts to 
seriously cut into liquor sales at their parks, they've learned 
that cutting troublemakers out quickly definitely makes the rest of 
the herd easier to steer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we don't have to go back to New York to play these guys  
again,'' Steinbrenner said. ``But if we do, I don't think the 
Boston players have anything to be worried about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's hoping that his confidence is not misplaced.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, we've seen one crazed fan run out of the  
stands to stab tennis star Monica Seles at courtside and another 
goof parachute into a boxing ring. The reason our athletes perform 
so flawlessly in front of so many is because it used to be an 
article of faith that the crowd would just sit and scream. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dangerous few are more inventive, more abusive and more  
menacing. And unless the rest of us are serious about stopping 
them, soon they'll be the only ones in attendance. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> McCartney Not Looking for Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Paul McCartney says that he's not looking for  
another woman, more than a year after the death of his wife Linda, 
but that he's open to the possibility of a new relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might happen, I don't know, you know, I'm not really  
working at it. I just take things as they come,'' McCartney said in 
an interview broadcast Monday by Independent Television News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Linda would want me to be happy,'' he said. ``We'll  
just see what happens really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda McCartney died of cancer in April 1998. She had married  
the former Beatle in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney said he decided not to throw himself into his music  
immediately after her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just did what came naturally and that involved a lot of  
crying, basically, and a lot of letting it out, wherever I was, 
sometimes a bit embarrassing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a question of how long did she want me to grieve,  
because she was such an upbeat lady I think she would have said, 
'Come on, get on with it now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney recently released a new album, ``Run Devil Run.''

<HEADLINE> Fiedler's Perserverance Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Many quarterbacks would have given up  
after two years without an NFL job. Not Jay Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his game polished by playing a season in the World  
League, then coaching at Hofstra. Back in the NFL again, he finally 
got his chance Sunday, sparking the Jacksonville Jaguars to a 24-7 
victory over the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always kept myself in shape and I always knew I could  
play in this league,'' Fiedler said. ``I had the confidence. I had 
seen it up close. It's just a matter of finding the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars had little choice when Mark Brunell went down with a  
strained oblique muscle. Brunell said he first irritated the muscle 
in practice last week. It forced him out of the game after a long 
pass down the sideline in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell said he expected a full return to health by  
Jacksonville's next game, Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, Fiedler will be the man. He was 12-of-14 for 113 yards  
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very good, very cool under pressure and very poised,''  
coach Tom Coughlin said. ``He showed the same things that he showed 
in the preseason that allowed us to decide he could be the second 
quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Akili Smith's second NFL start didn't go quite  
as well as his first. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith struggled through a 17-3 loss to Pittsburgh on Sunday that  
showed how far he has to go. He threw two interceptions, had passes 
batted down at the line repeatedly and undercut the Cincinnati 
Bengals' only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	It was nothing like his debut, an 18-17 victory in Cleveland a  
week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The only impression from start No. 2 is that he's got a long way  
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a good job disguising their defenses,'' said Smith,  
who was 19-of-38 for 207 yards and was sacked four times. ``It's 
tough when you're a young quarterback because you haven't seen some 
of the looks that I saw yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of blitzing Sunday, the Steelers dropped into zone  
coverages and disguised what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was staring at his primary receivers a little too  
much,'' coach Bruce Coslet said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Smith's most glaring mistakes came on his most  
spectacular play. On second-and-17 at the Steelers 24 late in the 
second quarter, Smith eluded two Steelers who shot through the 
line, then threw to Marco Battaglia for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem: It was supposed to be a screen pass, so the Bengals  
had blockers downfield. The penalty nullified the score. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins bolstered their special  
teams Monday by signing Roell Preston, who returned three kicks for 
touchdowns for Green Bay in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Preston has a career average of 23.9 yards per  
kickoff return and is expected to be used primarily in that role. 
He played in two games this season for Tennessee, his fourth NFL 
team, before being released Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster for Preston, Miami released tackle  
Mike Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit Lions quarterback Charlie Batch  
took a hit on his upper right arm and sat out the second half 
Sunday, but he should be ready this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The swelling on Batch's arm had gone down by Monday and Lions  
coach Bobby Ross felt certain he would be back at quarterback 
Sunday against Carolina. Ross also had high hopes for getting 
defensive ends Robert Porcher and Luther Elliss back. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, maybe we're getting better,'' Ross said. ``I hope so. It  
would be nice to get some of these people back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Washington Redskins starter Gus Frerotte replaced Batch  
and directed the game-winning drive in Detroit's 25-23 victory over 
the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte was 15-of-24 for 140 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	Ross announced Monday that defensive tackle Dan Owens had won  
the club's award for courage. Owens is almost ready to return from 
a serious injury to his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most cases, this would have been a career-ending injury,''  
Ross said. ``You want to see a guy out here at 6:30 a.m., Dan's 
your guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Packers wide receiver-kick returner  
Jahine Arnold, who hasn't caught a pass in the NFL since 1996, will 
need reconstructive surgery on his right knee and will miss the 
rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold missed 36 of 48 regular season games during his first  
three NFL seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers because of injury or 
inactivity. His contract expires at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold was inactive for Green Bay's first four regular season  
games and was listed as the team's No. 4 receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold likely would have returned kicks against the Broncos on  
Sunday, but he tore a ligament in his right knee during a 
non-contact drill in practice on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He tore the same ligament in his left knee two years ago and  
missed the Steelers' entire 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he broke his collarbone during training camp and  
missed the first four games. He played in three games without 
making a catch or a return, then was lost for the season with a 
broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said he doesn't  
want to place tight end Shannon Sharpe on injured reserve because 
that would mean losing him for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe broke his left collarbone in Denver's 16-13 victory over  
Oakland on Oct. 10 and is expected to miss at least another six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to try to keep Shannon,'' Shanahan said. ``My intention  
is not to put him on the IR. I want him back to play. Sometimes you 
have to do things if you lose too many players, but that's not in 
the plan right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Sharpe and reserve tight end Desmond Clark sidelined with a  
torn knee ligament, the Broncos will rely on Byron Chamberlain and 
Dwayne Carswell. Fullback Anthony Lynn also could be used in an 
emergency, Shanahan said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose modestly Tuesday morning  
after a gain on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 57.91  
points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,333.24 at the end of the morning 
session. On Monday, the average closed down 326.24 points, or 1.85 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.60 yen at late morning, up 0.58 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
105.08 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, prices opened higher Tuesday following the  
advance in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed 
up 96.57 points, or 1 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the Tokyo equity market was the dollar's  
relative stability against the Japanese currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York last week, the Dow recorded its worst weekly point  
fall in history, losing 630.05 points, or 5.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 12.18 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,472.41. 
The TOPIX closed down 50.03 points, or 3.31 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher after gains in New  
York stock prices on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Dow's recovery overnight, the dollar is firm against  
the yen in the early Asian session,'' said Kazuki Fujita, a senior 
foreign exchange analyst at the Industrial Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar often benefits from a rise on Wall Street as overseas  
investors must purchase the greenback to buy U.S. shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were expecting the U.S. currency to trade in a narrow  
range ahead of the release of U.S. consumer price data later 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors will be watching that indicator closely amid fears  
inflation may be rising in the United States after the Friday's 
announcement that U.S. wholesale prices rose 1.1 percent in 
September. That was far above the market estimate of 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 113.99 yen, down  
from 114.10 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was  
unquoted in morning trading. On Monday, it settled at 1.7700 
percent and its price stood at 99.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> F. Lee Bailey Faces Ethics Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Bar filed ethics charges  
Monday against famed attorney F. Lee Bailey related to a dispute 
over millions in stock that he claimed he received for legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Bailey spent 43 days in jail for contempt of court  
stemming from a dispute over $16 million in stock owned by a client 
and for withdrawing $3 million from a Swiss bank account 
established with the stock without court permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock belonged to Bailey's client, Claude Duboc, who was  
convicted in a drug case and ordered to forfeit his assets to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey claimed he was given the stock as his fee, while the  
government contended it was part of the forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Bailey was only allowed to use the money to  
maintain Duboc's posh French estates until they could be sold and 
the money forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to allegations that he misappropriated funds, Bailey  
is also charged with violating rules of professional conduct by 
commingling proceeds from the stock with his own funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bar seeks that Bailey be ``appropriately disciplined,'' but  
what that could be was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	David Robert Ristoff, the attorney handling the case for the  
bar, could not be reached for comment after business hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey refused comment as he left federal court in Orlando on  
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey gained fame by representing Dr. Sam Sheppard, whose case  
inspired the movie ``The Fugitive.'' He also represented Albert 
DeSalvo, who claimed he was the Boston Strangler, and was on the 
team of defense lawyers for O.J. Simpson.

	``Breakdown'' (Island Records) -- Melissa Etheridge  

</P>
<P>
	After breaking into the male-dominated genre of hard rock in the  
early 1990s -- and doing it with a much-needed dose of emotional 
honesty -- Melissa Etheridge followed with even stronger work that 
put her on an artistic level with other female ground-breakers like 
Joan Armatrading and Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
	But after nearly a decade in what has been at times a  
controversial spotlight, Etheridge took four years off from 
recording, her longest hiatus to date. And the rest helped, 
evidenced by ``Breakdown,'' her strongest album to date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the credit for that has to go to longtime guitarist John  
Shanks, who provides the musical grit and a steady co-producing 
hand to go along with Etheridge's gravel-laced voice. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is Etheridge, who writes all her own material, who shows  
that she is still one of the few artists who sound like they truly 
feel what they're singing -- whether it be the rage of 
``Scarecrow,'' an ode to a college student who was killed because 
he was gay, or the gentleness of ``Sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no surprises here for longtime Etheridge fans. But she  
refines the straight-ahead, emotionally raw approach of her earlier 
work and raises it to a new level.

	``A Cheap and Evil Girl'' (Trauma Records) -- Bree Sharp  

</P>
<P>
	While Bree Sharp and her quirky, gimmicky single ``David  
Duchovny'' appear to have one-hit-wonder written all over them, ``A 
Cheap and Evil Girl'' shows there's hope for a future. The angst 
shown in the parody ``Duchovny,'' which tells of an unrequited 
obsession with the star of ``The X-Files,'' is prevalent throughout 
the edgy, uneven record. But too often, the disc sounds like 
something quickly thrown together to capitalize on the success of 
the single. A lot more of Sharp's sass and a little more polish 
might be the ticket next time, if there is a next time.

	``Shakespeare at Covent Garden'' (Philips) -- Musicians of the  
Globe, directed by Philip 
</P>
<P>
	Pickett; ``Nutmeg and Ginger: Spicy Ballads From Shakespeare's  
London'' (Philips) -- Musicians of the Globe, directed by Philip 
Pickett 

</P>
<P>
	Poor Henry Bishop.  
</P>
<P>
	George Bernard Shaw called this 19th-century British composer a  
``secondhand Mozart.'' He produced an ``immense amount of hack 
work'' as musical director of Covent Garden from 1810-1824, says 
the Norton/Grove Encyclopedia of Music. Philips doesn't even put 
his name on the cover of its latest Shakespeare-themed release, 
``Shakespeare at Covent Garden,'' even though he composed the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh well. Bishop did write ``Home, Sweet Home,'' and even the  
maligned and mediocre deserve a hearing. The British opera-going 
public in Bishop's day certainly heard plenty. Along with a large 
output at the opera house, he was responsible for the London 
premiere of ``The Marriage of Figaro'' in 1819 -- but with much of 
Mozart's music replaced with his own, according to the witty linear 
notes here by Andrew Pinnock. 
</P>
<P>
	These settings of Shakespeare text are modestly pleasing, and  
give an inkling to the more historically minded listener of what 
the public liked in the English musical desert between Purcell and 
the Vaughan Williams-Elgar-Britten resurgence. Pinnock also makes a 
case that Bishop influenced Gilbert and Sullivan, something indeed 
noticeable in these settings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickett and his pickup band of ``Globe'' musicians perform well,  
but the four-square, almost music-hall quality of the music is a 
galaxy away from the Elizabethan world that produced the texts. 
</P>
<P>
	Closer to that world is another recent release in the series,  
``Nutmeg and Ginger,'' music composed in Shakespeare's day. It is a 
mix of unaccompanied ballads for voice, mixed vocal and 
instrumental numbers and purely instrumental pieces. Some are 
anonymously composed; some are attributed to Farnaby, Campion, 
Dowland and other composers. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, the performance is of high quality -- almost too beautiful  
for what one might imagine 16th- and 17th-century street music to 
be. And again, the title -- ``Spicy Ballads'' -- is a little 
misleading. Only half of the numbers have texts, and only a couple 
can remotely be called spicy. One of these uses the phrase 
``Watkins ale'' as a euphemism for sex, a baffling and intriguing 
linguistic mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the sort of joke the proper Henry Bishop would never make.

<HEADLINE> J.P. Morgan Profits almost Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With profits almost tripling in the third  
quarter, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. said Monday it would purchase up to $3 
billion of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan posted net income of $442 million, or $2.22 a share,  
beating analysts' estimates by 7 cents a share. The results were 
far better than the $156 million, or 75 cents a share, J.P. Morgan 
earned in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based commercial and investment bank had a 53  
percent jump in revenues to $1.99 billion from $1.3 billion in the 
year-ago period. Expenses fell $330 million in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our performance this year marks an important milestone in our  
strategic shift toward a less capital intensive business model,'' 
Douglas A. Warner III, company chairman, said in a statement. ``The 
earnings engine we have built in our core business, combined with 
our focus on capital and expense productivity, allows us to return 
significant capital to shareholders and, importantly, retain more 
than enough to pursue significant future growth opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan said it would buy back about 27 million of its  
shares, based on current prices, over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Stock repurchase programs improve a company's earnings per share, 
and thus its stock price, by reducing the number of shares 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has almost completed the $750 million stock buyback  
program announced last December, but the effects were offset by the 
stock options issued to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, J.P. Morgan plans to increase its quarterly  
dividend by 1 penny to $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors liked the news, and sent the company's shares up $3.31  
to $109 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, J.P. Morgan reported net income of  
$1.55 billion, or $7.76 a share, vs. $874 million, or $4.28 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $6.67 billion, up from $5.45 billion.

<HEADLINE> Giants QBs Failing Under Jim Fassel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- After the New York Giants hired Jim  
Fassel in 1997, it was almost impossible to read anything about him 
without seeing the phrases ``quarterback guru'' and ``offensive 
genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway, Jeff Hostetler and Boomer Esiason seemed to thrive  
while having Fassel as an assistant, and the Giants had visions of 
a high-powered offense with him as their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Giants won the NFC East in Fassel's first season,  
their search continues for their first good quarterback since Phil 
Simms in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The past three years have been highlighted more by changes than  
quarterback growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Brown started the first year and was replaced by Danny  
Kanell. He lasted until 10 games into 1998 when Kent Graham took 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham has struggled this season, and there are those calling  
for a change to Kerry Collins, the nearly $17 million free agent 
who started last week against Arizona because Graham had a 
concussion. Like Graham, he struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I took the job and started here, I knew this was not  
going to be a quick fix,'' Fassel said. ``I knew it wasn't. Did I 
think it would take a shorter time than this? Yes, I did. As we 
have evolved, my biggest disappointment is that we haven't come 
further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers this year are almost as bad as last year, when the  
Giants finished 29th in the NFL total offense -- which in 1998 was 
next to last -- and missed the playoffs with an 8-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is 26th in total offense this year and 29th in  
third-down conversions, clear indicators why the team has lost 
three of five games. The team's 71-point total entering Monday 
night's game against Dallas was among the lowest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody can put any more pressure on me than I  
put on myself,'' Fassel said. ``I take everything from the outside 
with a grain of salt. It's part of the job description. It does not 
matter. If we don't play well, then I'm going to get hit. It's just 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where you get in trouble and where you lose your way is if you  
let all that stuff affect you,'' Fassel said. ``You just can't do 
it. Then you start making decisions that aren't very smart 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel was offered a lot of outside help this week in deciding a  
quarterback. He chose Graham over Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	The general consensus among reporters covering the team was that  
Collins, the fifth pick overall in the 1995 draft, has a bigger 
upside than Graham, a journeyman at best. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel picked Graham, however, because he felt Graham gave him a  
better chance against the Cowboys. Collins seemed slow getting 
plays off, an indication he is still learning the finer points of 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice seemed risky because Fassel's boss, general manager  
Ernie Accorsi, went out and signed Collins after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, I understand what all this could mean to Jim,''  
Graham said. ``I know this isn't about winning one game. It's about 
saving the season and there is a lot of pressure on him right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Fassel in the third year of a four-year contract, the  
pressure is only going to increase if the quarterback guru doesn't 
come up with something soon.

</P>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Donald D. Dahl, who spent 28 years with  
The Albuquerque Tribune, died Friday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahl began his career at the Tribune in 1954 as a copy editor.  
He later was a telegraph editor before becoming news editor. He 
retired in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in Rhame, N.D., Dahl helped his mother publish the  
weekly Rhame Review. ``I was setting type by the time I was 15 
years old,'' Dahl used to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahl, who served in the Navy during World War II, worked as  
managing editor of the Navy News, a daily newspaper published by 
the Navy in Manila. He also worked for The Providence 
Journal-Bulletin of Rhode Island and for United Press.

                            *Jim Jensen    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former WCBS-TV anchorman Jim Jensen, whose  
gravely voice and deliberate demeanor brought three decades of news 
to millions of New York-area viewers, died Saturday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen apparently suffered a heart attack on Friday, said Carlos  
Hernandez, a WCBS-TV assignment editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen, who began work at WCBS in 1964, covered Robert F.  
Kennedy's Senate campaign, sat behind the anchor desk during the 
1977 New York City blackout and went to Israel to cover the Gulf 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever the news was happening, if it was possible for him to  
go, he was there,'' said Chris Borgen, a longtime colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen, who once played for a minor league baseball team in  
Minneapolis, got a job as a newspaper sportswriter after an injury 
ended his pitching career, Borgen said. He was soon hired by a 
Minneapolis radio station, then moved to Boston, where he spent 
three years reporting for CBS radio and television affiliates. He 
began working as an anchorman soon after his move to WCBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen left WCBS in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two daughters and a son.

<P>
                            *Leo Lionni    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Artist Leo Lionni, who devoted his versatile talents  
to everything from philosophical children's books to high-profile 
ad campaigns, died Oct. 11. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, he moved to Genoa, Italy, where his abstract paintings  
won him an invitation to exhibit with the then-cutting-edge 
Futurists. He worked on his first graphic design projects in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussolini's Fascist racial laws turned Lionni away from Italy  
and toward the United States in 1933, when he wove his artistic and 
business talents into a successful career in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	As art director of N.W. Ayer in Philadelphia, Lionni designed ad  
campaigns for clients including Ford and General Electric, 
employing respected contemporary artists such as Fernand Leger and 
Willem De Kooning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, he became art director for Fortune magazine and  
edited catalogs for New York's Museum of Modern Art and 
Metropolitan Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, Lionni published his first children's book, ``Little  
Blue and Little Yellow.'' The idea -- the book's protagonists are a 
blue dot and a yellow dot whose adventures blend them together into 
Little Green -- sprung from a story he once improvised for his 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Lionni went on to write and illustrate another 30 children's  
books, which have been published in 11 languages.

</P>
<P>
	BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Ella Mae Morse, whose classic 1942  
recording ``Cow Cow Boogie'' became Capitol Records' first 
million-selling single, died Saturday. She was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been suffering respiratory problems following a long  
illness, according to her publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas-born Ms. Morse combined boogie woogie, blues, jazz,  
swing and country influences in the 1940s and 50s, helping to 
create a pioneering ``pop'' sound that would later grown into rock 
'n' roll. Elvis Presley even praised her for teaching him how to 
sing. 
</P>
<P>
	Described as a black-trained, white ``hepchick,'' her songs,  
including ``The House of Blue Lights,'' earned her 10 gold records. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Morse stopped recording in 1957, but continued performing  
until 1987. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Glen Payne    	
</P>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Gospel singer Glen Payne, the lead  
vocalist of the Cathedrals, died Friday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne was diagnosed with liver cancer six weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	During Payne's nearly 60 years in gospel music, his group won  
numerous awards and was nominated for 11 Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	His work was honored by the Gospel Music Association's Hall of  
Fame, the Texas Music Hall of Fame, the Southern Gospel Music 
Association's Hall of Fame and the Radio Music Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1951 to 1957, Payne sang in the Stamps-Ozark Quartet before  
leaving to join the Weatherfords. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, Payne formed a trio to perform at evangelist Rex  
Humbard's Cathedral of Tomorrow in Akron, Ohio. George Younce 
joined the trio and it changed its name to the Cathedral Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne and Younce became constants in the group that would  
feature 17 other members over the next 35 years on its way to 
becoming a pre-eminent gospel group.

                            *Sam Renick    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sam Renick, one of America's top jockeys 50  
years ago and a founder of the Jockeys' Guild, died Saturday from 
complications of a stroke suffered last winter. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Renick became a jockey as a teen-ager in the late 1920s. He rode  
for some of horse racing's leading stables. He was a contract rider 
for Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt and for Harry Warner, and he won many 
of the major stakes races on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	After he retired, Renick hosted the TV program ``Racing with  
Renick,'' which was broadcast from tracks in New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockeys at the time had no insurance or medical protection.  
Renick teamed with close friend Eddie Arcaro and another top rider, 
Johnny Longden, to form the Jockeys' Guild. The goal was to provide 
basic protections for jockeys and their families in case of injury 
or death.

</P>
<P>
	NEWTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Donald H. Riddle, the former president of  
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of 
New York, died Oct 11. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddle was credited for changing the college's curriculum to  
produce more highly educated law enforcement officers by 
introducing required courses in language and the humanities. Before 
his tenure, from 1968 to 1975, police were commonly trained as 
little more than gun-carrying security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people asked President Riddle how to educate the police,  
he famously replied, 'Like everybody else,''' said Gerald W. Lynch, 
the college's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddle also gained national attention in 1970 for standing up to  
then-FBI head J. Edgar Hoover on a matter of academic freedom.

                              *Luis Sa

<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Luis Sa, a leading member of the  
Portuguese Communist Party and former member of the European 
Parliament, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the former Portuguese colony Angola, Sa joined the  
Communists in 1974, after the April 25 Carnation Revolution that 
toppled a 41-year-long rightist dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	A law graduate, he was first elected to the Republican Assembly,  
Portugal's Parliament, in 1991 and was recently re-elected as No. 2 
in the party's list for the general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Sa also was a member of the European Parliament in 1994.  

</P>
<P>
                           *Jean Shepherd    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jean Shepherd, the prolific radio raconteur  
whose easy storytelling style earned comparisons to Mark Twain, 
died Saturday near his home in Sanibel Island, Fla. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, once described by media critic Marshall McLuhan as  
``the first radio novelist,'' spent 21 years on WOR-AM in New York 
City, attracting a large, loyal following along the Eastern 
seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked without a script, conjuring tales based on his Indiana  
upbringing, creating characters like his alter-ego, Ralph Parker, 
and his neighbors, the Bumpuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that likely inspired the climactic scene in the movie  
``Network,'' Shepherd would tell his listeners to crank up the 
volume on their radios and scream along with him. ``Drop the tools, 
we've got you covered!'' was one of Shepherd's favorite shout-along 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, while best known for his radio work, excelled as a  
multimedia performer. His films included the 1983 classic ``A 
Christmas Story,'' a sardonic account that he wrote and narrated. 
He had hoped to call it ``Satan's Revenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His writing appeared in a vast assortment of publications, from  
The New York Times to the National Lampoon. He wrote several books, 
including 1966's ``In God We Trust'' and the 1971 story collection, 
``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd did a pair of syndicated PBS TV programs, ``Jean  
Shepherd's America'' and ``Shepherd's Pie,'' and often sold out 
Carnegie Hall for his live shows.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Lower; Grains Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures fell in early trading today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, propelled by rains in Brazil that may 
end a drought in soybean growing regions. Grain prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for the high-output Brazilian soybean crop brightened  
with weekend rainfall as well as with forecasts for more 
precipitation in key northern areas over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent soybean futures tumbling.  
</P>
<P>
	Grains opened lower in sympathy with soybeans before turning  
higher. Soybeans also were rallying after opening sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat got support from a forecast for dry weather for the  
southwestern Plains and a strong close on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 2 cents to $2.58 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 cent to $2.00 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 1/2 
cent to $1.10 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 1 1/2 cents to $4.90 1/2 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were higher in early trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle rose .33 cent to 71.25 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle rose .88 cent to 82.55 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs rose .55 cent to 47.65 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies rose 1.35 cents to 66.75 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Irene Moves Out to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene raced out to sea today,  
but not before dumping nearly a foot of rain in parts of eastern 
North Carolina and rekindling fears of residents displaced by 
Hurricane Floyd a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina's third hurricane in two months churned through  
Florida during the weekend and up the southeast U.S. coast toward 
the Carolinas. Late Sunday, it turned northeast back to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene's maximum sustained winds increased to 105 mph overnight  
and it accelerated its movement out into the Atlantic. Tropical 
storm warnings were canceled as the storm moved away from the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the current forecast track, the core of the hurricane  
should stay off the North Carolina coast,'' said Jack Beven, a 
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
``It looks like it will go out to sea and will never return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT, the storm was 240 miles south of Massachusetts'  
Nantucket Island, moving northeast at 39 mph. Storm surges of up to 
4 feet above normal were expected to decrease later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Torrential rains -- mostly from 3 inches to 6 inches but up to 11  
inches in isolated areas -- closed several dozen roads. The rain had 
stopped falling by early today, and forecasters expected skies to 
clear rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	But delayed river flooding and washed-out roads were still the  
biggest concern to state officials. The Tar, Neuse and Cape Fear 
rivers were expected to be above flood stage by the middle of the 
week. During Floyd, most of the state's 49 deaths involved rising 
water, not high wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sun can come out, the winds can die down, and there can  
still be deadly force among us,'' state public safety secretary 
Richard Moore said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in south-central Hoke County today evacuated 150 homes  
near a small lake whose dam was overflowing and in danger of 
breaking. Public schools in several eastern counties were closed or 
delaying opening today because of uncertain road conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said that roughly 500 people in adjacent Cumberland  
County were without water after their water system failed. 
</P>
<P>
	In southeastern Virginia, the hurricane dumped up to a foot of  
rain Sunday and early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of streets that are flooded out and  
impassable,'' Mike Carey, a police spokesman in Virginia Beach, 
said Sunday night. ``We have a lot of disabled vehicles in flooded 
out streets that we simply cannot get to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, more than 6 inches of rain fell on Horry  
County, which was still trying to dry out from the 20 inches of 
rain left behind by Hurricane Floyd. The rain had stopped by Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	As Irene neared North Carolina, an evacuation order was issued  
for several beach towns near Wilmington, and people living in 
low-lying areas and mobile homes were encouraged to seek shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Many left homeless by Floyd, which dumped up to 20 inches of  
rain Sept. 16, were evacuated from temporary trailer villages to 
shelters. About 6,000 homes were damaged during Floyd, with damage 
expected in the billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad, it's really sad,'' said Fannie Lewis of Princeville,  
which took the brunt of Floyd's deluge last month. She was waiting 
out Irene at a Rocky Mount school that was turned into a shelter. 
``I'm trying to hold on because where there's a will there's a way. 
But this is sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross reported at least 690 people were staying  
in shelters Sunday night. More than 2,100 homes and businesses were 
without power in the eastern half of the state as of Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said the worst flooding was expected in the Fayetteville  
area and along the Cape Fear River, which was expected later this 
week to crest 20 feet above flood stage, or more than 10 feet 
higher than it climbed after Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A 43-year-old motorist died Sunday in a storm-related accident  
when a vehicle hydroplaned into a tree in Granville County. Irene 
has been blamed for seven deaths, five of them in Florida and two 
in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were injured from separate tornadoes spawned by the  
hurricane. One touched down Sunday evening near Weeksville in 
Pasquotank County, destroying six homes, damaging several more and 
causing one injury. Another tornado caused damage and an injury 
near Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusts reached 47 mph on the Outer Banks late Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	State officials prepared for Irene by activating 500 National  
Guardsmen, opening 39 Guard armories and putting 10 water rescue 
teams on standby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not see the real dangers present themselves for several  
days,'' said Andy James with North Carolina's emergency response 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, another weather system in the Atlantic became  
Tropical Storm Jose early today and was expected to strengthen into 
a hurricane in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbados was put under a hurricane watch and forecasters said a  
similar watch could be issued for the southeastern Caribbean later 
today.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP To Meet on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid rising tension marked by President  
Clinton's veto of a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill he said smacks 
of ``a new American isolationism,'' the president and Republican 
congressional leaders agreed Monday to hold budget talks at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was set for Tuesday after Republican leaders  
accepted Clinton's invitation. They said they would insist that no 
taxes are raised and that using Social Security's surpluses to pay 
for remaining spending bills is ruled out. House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Republicans consider the surpluses issue 
``the highest goal of our budget season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's to try and get congressional Republicans to join an  
irresponsible scheme to spend Social Security and raise taxes, I 
don't think the president will find us a receptive audience,'' 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants to talk about the two sides' differences  
over education, anti-crime and environmental programs and how the 
measures would be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to make these critical investments and maintain  
our fiscal discipline to keep our economy strong, we're going to 
have to make tough choices, and we're going to have to make them 
together,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving in Newark, N.J., later for a Democratic fund-raising  
event, Clinton said he hoped that bitter partisan feelings could be 
left behind. ``I'm just going to reach out a hand of friendship and 
hope that we can work together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president lamented the growing divide between the  
administration and congressional Republicans, and said he found it 
``almost inexplicable'' that some seem to think good economic times 
allowed them the ``luxury of indulging in division and diversion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The session was arranged three days before Thursday's expiration  
of stopgap legislation that has kept federal agencies functioning 
since fiscal year 2000 began Oct. 1. Clinton said he would sign a 
short-term extension, and GOP leaders planned to send him an 
extension through Oct. 29 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the White House and Congress, already soured  
by Clinton's impeachment trial, have worsened in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's Senate rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty, a  
top administration foreign policy goal, has prompted bitter 
accusations of partisanship from both sides. Both stood to gain by 
holding a meeting that would afford chances to appear reasonable as 
they address the year's highest-profile remaining issue: the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what Tuesday's meeting would achieve. There were  
some hopes on both sides that it would lead to a series of 
lower-level meetings where specific remaining differences could be 
resolved. But clearly, both face political risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many rank-and-file Republicans loathed the omnibus spending bill  
the White House and GOP leaders wrote last fall, which contained 
billions in spending that conservatives attacked as excessive. Top 
Republicans said anew they would not repeat that process, but they 
risk GOP disaffection if things seem similar. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next year's election campaigns, many Democrats  
have been happy to see Republicans struggle to write spending 
bills. They would react negatively if a quick agreement were struck 
that blurred partisan differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five of the 13 spending bills for fiscal 2000 have been  
enacted. Two have been vetoed, and three face veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	On the five most controversial bills, Clinton wants less than  
$10 billion over what Republicans have offered, a tiny portion of 
the near $600 billion that the annual spending bills control. But 
the two sides have philosophical differences, such as how extensive 
state control over federal education aid should be and GOP 
provisions to help oil and mining industries that the 
administration considers anti-environmental. 
</P>
<P>
	The vetoed foreign aid bill fell $2 billion below Clinton's  
request. It omitted any of the $500 million he wants for Israel and 
the Palestinians to implement the accord they struck last year at 
Wye River, Md. It also provided less than he wanted for 
international debt relief, the Peace Corps and efforts to reduce 
the nuclear threat from Russia, North Korea and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me to be the next big chapter in the new American  
isolationism'' following the Senate's defeat of the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty last week, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As they have for weeks, Republicans sought to cast Clinton as  
demanding to use Social Security's surpluses for extra spending, in 
this case for a program that has little public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to increase foreign aid by 30 percent, and  
he knows that the money will come out of the Social Security trust 
fund. We will not raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for 
more foreign aid,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House rejects that argument and cites projections by  
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and others that GOP 
spending plans would eat into the Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Monday, House and Senate Republicans agreed to a  
compromise $37 billion measure financing the Commerce, Justice and 
State departments. Democrats said Clinton would probably veto the 
measure, which contains about $2 billion less than he wants, 
including less than half his $1.3 billion request for hiring local 
police officers.

<HEADLINE> Delta Air Lines Buying Comair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Delta Air Lines is buying the Comair commuter  
airline for about $1.8 billion in an effort to expand a regional 
connection between its hubs and cities served by smaller carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said today it will offer $23.50 a share for the 78 percent  
share of Comair Holdings Inc., parent of the Comair airline, it 
does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal will result in few, if any, job reductions, Delta  
management said. Comair's senior executives are to be absorbed into 
Delta's management and Comair labor agreements remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair is to keep its headquarters in northern Kentucky, and  
retain its separate work force, as well as salary and benefits 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair has helped its own growth for years by coordinating  
flight schedules with Atlanta-based Delta. Delta's move is designed 
to make the connections more efficient and use aircraft of both 
airlines more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a code-share agreement, Comair has flown customers  
primarily from cities in the Midwest and Florida to Delta's hubs in 
Cincinnati and Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair Holdings has 95.5 million shares of common stock  
outstanding. Delta now owns 21.1 million of these shares, or 22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said it wants to own at least two-thirds of the  
outstanding shares, including the portion it already owns. The deal 
is subject to federal regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Delta acquired Atlantic Southeast Airlines.  
In September, Delta began a 10-year agreement with Atlantic Coast 
Airlines for exclusive use of 45 regional jets, starting in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Other airlines in the Delta Connection carrier network are  
SkyWest, based in St. George, Utah; Trans States Airlines, in St. 
Louis; Atlantic Coast Airlines, in Dulles, Va.; and Business 
Express, in Dover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair offers more than 700 daily flights to 88 cities in 31  
states and three countries through its hubs at Cincinnati/Northern 
Kentucky International Airport and Orlando International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Veto Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will veto a $12.6 billion  
foreign aid bill, his spokesman said today, and will refuse to sign 
other spending bills passed by the Republican-led Congress despite 
a budget deadline looming this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is adopting a tough stance on spending, accusing  
congressional Republicans of accounting gimmickry. A temporary 
budget bill that has kept the government running since the start of 
the fiscal year on Oct. 1 will expire on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was meeting with Cabinet officers this morning to talk  
budget strategy. He also plans to invite congressional leaders to 
White House for a meeting this week ``to figure out a way to get 
out of the box created by appropriators to date,'' press secretary 
Joe Lockhart said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign aid bill passed over loud opposition from Democrats  
and the White House, who claim it shortchanges important American 
foreign policy interests such as furthering the Mideast peace deal 
known as Wye River. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't meet the president's priorities,'' Lockhart said.  
``Wye River is certainly an important element to that, and it is an 
important part of continuing to exercise U.S. leadership around the 
world. We can't expect nations in troubled parts of the world, like 
the Middle East, to move forward with their peace process when we 
won't meet the commitments we've made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said a veto of the defense spending bill may be on the  
way. ``That is under consideration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is beyond what the president requested, and there are  
also a number of gimmicks in it. They make operations and 
maintenance an emergency. The Pentagon is a pretty big building, 
but I don't know if you can go over there ... and find one person 
who considers the operations and maintenance of armed forces an 
emergency,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's foreign aid veto today, the 28th of his presidency,  
will likely stand. The bill only narrowly cleared the House with a 
vote of 214-211, and the Senate with a vote of 51-49. A two-thirds 
vote in both houses is needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, in a statement prepared in  
anticipation of Clinton's veto, said that the extra money Clinton 
wants can only be obtained by raiding the Social Security trust 
fund. He called that ``wrong and irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will not use Social Security as a pot of gold to fund  
foreign aid,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, chairman of the House Foreign Operations  
subcommittee, said Republicans Congress have sent a consistent 
message that ``we will not raid Social Security, nor will we agree 
to raise taxes, to pay for increased foreign aid spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As passed by Congress, the aid bill provides $2 billion less  
than Clinton sought and none of the $500 million down payment he 
had sought to help Israel and the Palestinians carry out the peace 
accord negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. In all, Clinton has 
pledged $1.8 billion in U.S. support for the Mideast peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides significantly less money than Clinton  
requested for international debt relief, the Peace Corps and for 
efforts to reduce the nuclear threat from North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When the possibility of a veto was first voiced earlier in the  
month, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations panel on foreign operations, said it could shut off 
$735 million in aid to former Soviet Republics, $285 million in 
narcotics-fighting assistance and $180 million to combat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	However, foreign aid likely would continue to flow at current  
levels as part of stopgap spending legislation that covers agencies 
and departments for which there has been no appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also had complained that the legislation cuts  
many economic assistance programs, including those for poor 
countries in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	And it eliminated a $241 million State Department program to  
help find work for former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists in an 
attempt to make sure they do not sell their services to rogue 
states attempting to develop nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Venus Eyes Top Ranking in Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Venus Williams has big plans. And  
Martina Hingis might not like them. 
</P>
<P>
	By hammering her way past Hingis in the final of the Swisscom  
Challenge 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday, Williams believes she was serving the 
top-ranked Swiss star notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely will be No. 1, and probably next season,''  
Williams said. ``I have everything going for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of power. I'm capable. I'm a smart girl. I'm hard  
on myself, I have six titles this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having clashed five times already this season, the two  
19-year-olds have been locked in a fierce -- sometimes bitter -- 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's victory marked Williams' second consecutive win over  
the Swiss player, having defeated Hingis in the semifinals of the 
Grand Slam Cup just two weeks ago, before coming up short against 
sister Serena. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Swiss player still has an 8-5 win-loss record against  
the lanky American, Williams leads this season's head-to-heads 3-2, 
having also defeated Hingis in the semifinals of the Italian Open 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' only losses to Hingis came in the semifinals of the  
U.S. Open and the final in San Diego, when the Swiss player 
reclaimed her place atop the world rankings from American Lindsay 
Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to Williams, Hingis' lease on the top spot is  
nearly up. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that younger Serena was the first sister to win  
a Grand Slam title, defeating Hingis in the final of the U.S. Open, 
Williams still believes she'll be the one to replace the Swiss star 
from atop the world rankings next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no Grand Slams, so I have no major points to defend,''  
Williams said. ``I have nothing to lose and only one way to go: 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's final against Hingis, Williams' most potent weapon --  
her missile-like serve -- played as much against her as for her. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving up seven aces on the sluggish carpet, only 47 percent of  
Williams' first serves were good. Unwilling to risk a double fault, 
Williams' muscle was wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	But since losing to Hingis in the semifinals of the U.S. Open,  
Williams has been making a determined effort to master her serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Once she does, Williams says she'll be a force to reckon with.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be unbelievable,'' Williams said. ``You wait and see.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm practicing my consistency and placement and I'm really  
going for it,'' she said. ``When I get it just right you won't 
believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams might need more than just a strong serve to oust  
Hingis, the winner of 26 career titles, including five Grand Slams 
and nearly $11 million in career earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis has won seven titles this season, including the  
Australian Open. Four other of her titles this year came at Tier 1 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	She also reached the final of the U.S. and French Opens and has  
a 65-11 win-loss record this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some more physical training, I can beat her again,''  
shrugged a confident Hingis.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nurse Convicted in 6 Ind. Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- It has always been clear to Paula Holdaway:  
Her 80-year-old mother was killed by a deliberate overdose of 
powerful chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a doubt in my mind,'' Holdaway said Sunday  
after a jury found former nurse Orville Lynn Majors guilty of 
administering lethal injections to her mother, Dorothea Hixon, and 
five other elderly patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors, 38, faces a maximum of 65 years in prison on each of the  
six murder counts. The judge set sentencing for Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims hugged and cried when the verdict was  
read. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he gets his life right with the Lord,'' said Tanya  
Cottrell, who testified she saw Majors inject her father, Freddie 
Wilson, just before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Majors, 38, injected Wilson and six other  
patients with epinephrine and potassium chloride while he was a 
licensed practical nurse at Vermillion County Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors could not reach a verdict on a seventh patient. But  
Rodney Smith was satisfied his father got justice, even though the 
panel couldn't agree whether Majors killed 74-year-old Cecil Smith, 
who died in April 1994, after being admitted with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Nina Alexander said: ``That's probably the most  
satisfying part of this -- that these family members were pleased 
and maybe they can finally get some closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the celebration, Majors' elderly parents, Orvil and Anna  
Bell, remained in their front-row courtroom seats with shocked 
expressions on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could they do this to him? He didn't kill anyone,''  
Majors' sister, Debbie McClelland said as she rested her head on 
the shoulder of an Indiana State Police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said they plan to appeal the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lynn is very upset. It's very human to feel some sense of  
closure, or peace even, at the worst possible news,'' said defense 
attorney Carolyn Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients died in a 13-month span between 1993 and 1995 at  
Vermillion County Hospital in Clinton. Relatives of the seven 
testified they saw Majors near the patients just before they died, 
and witnesses said they saw him give injections to four of the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors had contended the patients died of the ailments that put  
them in the hospital. Prosecutors said the deaths were consistent 
with injections of potassium chloride, epinephrine or both. Police 
found containers of those drugs at Majors' house and in his van. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors never saw statistical studies that linked Majors to as  
many as 130 of 147 deaths at the hospital. Special Judge Ernest 
Yelton, fearing the deluge of information would overwhelm the jury 
and bog down the trial, didn't allow prosecutors to use the 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had heard evidence for five weeks, which included  
testimony from 79 witnesses. Twenty-three were doctors who offered 
them highly technical medical interpretations. They began 
deliberating Thursday morning, and met for a total of 33 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began more than four years ago when a nursing  
supervisor became suspicious of the rising death rate in the 
hospital's intensive care unit, where Majors worked most days.

<HEADLINE> SEC Cracking Down on Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators plan to take action against  
the practice of publicly traded companies leaking information to 
Wall Street analysts before making it public, the chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt also appealed to Corporate America,  
``in the spirit of fair play,'' to open to everyone its quarterly 
conference calls with financial analysts by posting them on the 
Internet and inviting the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``The behind-the-scenes feeding of ... (significant) information  
from companies to analysts is a stain on our markets,'' Levitt said 
in a speech to an economists' group. ``This selectiveness is a 
disservice to investors and it undermines the fundamental principle 
of fairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an era when information flows freely and instantly, he added,  
``these sorts of whispers are an insult to fair and public 
disclosure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The analysts' clients, such as big institutional investors, can  
gain an unfair advantage because companies' financial data and 
forecasts often push stock prices up or down and their clients can 
trade ahead of others. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt was speaking Monday night in Manhattan to the Economic  
Club of New York. Copies of his speech were released earlier in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the SEC planned in the next few months to consider new  
rules ``to close the gap between those in the ... 'know' and the 
rest of us in the public.'' He did not provide details of a 
possible proposal by the market watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
	About 13 percent of big, publicly traded companies already  
transmit their conference calls publicly over the Internet, said 
Lou Thompson, president and chief executive officer of the National 
Investor Relations Institute, a group representing company 
officials who deal with shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most discussions between companies and analysts are above  
board, they are legal and they do not constitute selective 
disclosure,'' Thompson said in a telephone interview. ``There are 
exceptions ... but it isn't a common problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Spellman, a spokesman for the Securities Industry  
Association, said the Wall Street group was discussing the issue 
with the SEC regulators. ``Public trust and confidence are the 
industry's biggest priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials have stepped up criticism in recent weeks of what  
they see as efforts by some company executives to curry favor with 
analysts by giving them data in advance of officially announcing 
quarterly earnings or other financial news. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also has been pushing companies to improve their  
financial reporting and avoid manipulating their earnings to meet 
analysts' projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the SEC accused 68 people and companies -- including  
Hall of Fame quarterback and Atlanta businessman Fran Tarkenton -- 
of accounting fraud in the first nationwide ``sweep'' against 
inflating earnings and other alleged reporting misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quality information is the lifeblood of strong, vibrant  
markets,'' Levitt said in Monday's speech. ``Without it, investor 
confidence erodes. ... Fair and efficient markets simply cease to 
exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While denouncing what he called ``gamesmanship over the  
numbers,'' he said strong progress has been made in getting 
Corporate America to reduce it but it still persists.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Opposes Navy Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called Monday for  
an immediate and permanent end to the use of a Puerto Rican island 
as a Navy target range. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's comments as came the same day that a Pentagon  
panel, working at the direction of her husband, recommended that 
Navy bombing be allowed to resume on Vieques Island, but that use 
of the facility be phased out over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disappointed that this panel has recommended that the  
Navy resume its bombing on Vieques. Live ordnance training should 
not take place on a small, inhabited island,'' Mrs. Clinton, who is 
expected to seek a U.S. Senate seat from New York, said in a 
statement. ``There should be an immediate and permanent end to the 
bombing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady said that because ``military readiness is  
critical to the security of the United States,'' she hoped the Navy 
would quickly find a replacement target range. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment against the Navy's use of Vieques has been growing in  
Puerto Rico since a bombing accident in April killed a civilian 
security guard. Protesters have been camping out on the bombing 
range since then, but the Navy has been eager to resume using it. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has a large Puerto Rican population and Mrs. Clinton  
strained relations with some of their political leaders in the 
state when she announced her opposition to President Clinton's 
offer of clemency for a group of imprisoned Puerto Rican 
nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day filled with campaign-like activities, Mrs. Clinton also  
said she won't make her final decision about running for the Senate 
from New York until sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady also had kind words for former Sen. Bill Bradley,  
who is battling Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
Polls show Bradley running stronger in New York than the vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Mrs. Clinton said that while she favors campaign finance  
reform, she won't ``unilaterally eliminate any potential 
fund-raising means'' in her quest for the Senate, other than not 
accepting tobacco money. Her fund-raising team hopes to raise $25 
million for the race that is expected to pit her against Republican 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief, hallway encounter with reporters, Mrs. Clinton said  
a proposal to put an Indian-run casino in the Catskills is ``really 
worth considering'' because of the potential benefits it could 
bring the economically struggling area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking toward after the first of the year to make a  
final decision'' about running, Mrs. Clinton said following a forum 
on pensions and economic security held at a community center in 
Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton gave every indication her candidacy is a go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be doing interviews after the first of the year,'' she  
told reporters just a few minutes after saying at the forum that 
she would begin doing one-on-one interviews with the news media 
``when I become a candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While both the first lady and Giuliani have begun raising money  
for the Senate race, neither has formally declared their 
candidacies. The Clintons have purchased a five-bedroom home in 
suburban Westchester County that will allow Mrs. Clinton to 
establish residency in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bradley, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she is ``very  
committed'' to Gore's candidacy. Nonetheless, she also said she had 
``a lot of respect and admiration for Senator Bradley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased that both of them have come forward with  
important ideas and positions for this campaign ... It's an 
important debate that I think the two of them will have in the 
weeks ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent statewide polls have shown Bradley, a former New York  
Knicks star and former senator from neighboring New Jersey, running 
stronger in New York than Gore against the Republican front-runner, 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent pollster Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's  
Institute for Public opinion, said Mrs. Clinton's kind words for 
Bradley ``makes good New York sense'' given his level of support in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something to be said for Clinton fatigue and the  
combination of Al Gore and Hillary Clinton certainly contributes to 
that in New York,'' the pollster said.

<HEADLINE> France Telecom Buying Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German utility groups Veba AG and RWE  
AG tentatively plan to sell their 60.25 percent stake in the E-Plus 
mobile telephone network to France Telecom SA for $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday depends on agreement from U.S. phone  
company BellSouth Corp. which owns 22.5 percent of E-Plus and has 
pre-emptive rights over the utilities' sale of their stakes in the 
mobile phone company, France Telecom said in a separate statement. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom said it hoped to reach a quick agreement with  
BellSouth, which is based in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Vodafone Airtouch PLC holds the remainder and is  
seeking a buyer, E-Plus said. 
</P>
<P>
	With 3.2 million customers, E-Plus is Germany's third-largest  
mobile telephone operator, with a market share of 16 percent. Sales 
in 1998 were $984 million. The firm, with 3,100 employees, will 
remain based in Duesseldorf, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-border competition has been heating up in Europe's  
recently liberalized telecommunications market. France Telecom said 
it intends to use E-Plus to branch out into the German telephone 
and Internet market. 
</P>
<P>
	The former French telephone monopoly said it will finance its  
E-Plus purchases by selling its stake in U.S.-based Sprint Corp., 
worth around $9.3 billion, and its 2 percent stake in Deutsche 
Telekom, which is worth about $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom's plan to form a global partnership with Deutsche  
Telekom was dealt a severe blow after the German carrier pursued an 
ill-fated attempt to merge with Telecom Italia in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakup of the French company's Global One joint venture with  
Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp. also has been expected since MCI 
Worldcom's announcement earlier this month that it would acquire 
Sprint for $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom also holds 10 percent of Sprint and is  
pondering what to do with its stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the sale price, $4.1 billion will go to Veba and $3.8 billion  
to RWE, Veba said.

<HEADLINE> Census Might Revise Poverty Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Census Bureau, in revising its definition of  
U.S. poverty, is experimenting with a formula that would send 
millions more families below the poverty line, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new formula, for a family of four to be considered  
above the poverty line, their annual income would have to be 
$19,500 a year, instead of the current $16,600 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would make 46 million Americans, 17 percent of the  
population, poor. Last month, only 12.7 percent were considered 
poor, the lowest level in almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The current poverty formula was created during President Lyndon  
B. Johnson's administration and has not changed since 1965 except 
for inflation adjustments. The new poverty measure is an attempt to 
determine what poor people spend on food, clothing, housing and 
extras, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is certainly our opinion, and the opinion of every  
researcher we have talked to, that something should be done to 
update the poverty measure,'' said Edward Welniak, the Census 
Bureau's chief of income statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher poverty line would mean a rise in government spending  
to pay for benefits such for the poor, such as food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the White House, which would have to authorize the  
change in the poverty formula, said a few more years of work needs 
to be done before poverty can be redefined.

<HEADLINE> Ads Get Texas Residents Walking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Margie Flores was sitting on the couch  
watching TV when she saw something that finally inspired her to 
lose some weight. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Ms. Flores, a diabetic, was carrying upwards of 305  
pounds on her 5-foot-2 1/2-inch frame. Three months earlier her doctor 
told her she'd better start exercising. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the commercial that popped up on her TV screen that  
got her moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walk El Paso, walk!'' went the jingle, accompanied by images  
of people of various ages walking through parks and neighborhoods. 
``Do it for your health, do it for your family!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Walk El Pasoooh, walk! Just 20 minutes a day, three times a  
week!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, 'If that little old lady can do it, I can do it,'''  
says Ms. Flores, a 37-year-old secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	So she started to walk. At first it was 10 minutes a day.  
Gradually, she built up to an hour and a half a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, just over a year later, Ms. Flores has lost about 75  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a long way to go, but I feel so much healthier,''  
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flores is among hundreds of people who have responded to TV  
and radio ads, billboards and fliers since a local private 
foundation started the ``Walk El Paso!'' campaign in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by its own 1996 survey showing that about 75 percent of  
El Pasoans don't get enough exercise, the Paso del Norte Health 
Foundation put together the advertising blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Paso del Norte, which was created in 1995, committed $2.5  
million to the five-year project. Foundation officials gave a grant 
to the YMCA of Greater El Paso to organize walking groups -- there 
are now as many as 70 -- and paid a local advertising firm to come 
up with the commercials, which run in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Harvard University endocrinologist and  
preventive-health specialist, says the timing of the ``Walk El 
Paso!'' campaign couldn't be better. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a tremendous need for public health campaigns to  
prevent obesity in view of this increasing epidemic in the United 
States,'' she says. ``Regular physical activity is probably as 
close as we've come to a magic bullet in preserving health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jose Luna Jr., an El Paso family physician, says the  
campaign is especially important in this city, where residents 
enjoy lots of high-fat Mexican cuisine and surveys show that 
``we're all couch potatoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that with simple exercise, walking, which is cheap and  
convenient, that you can help reduce weight,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 survey showed that 33 percent of El Pasoans were  
overweight, compared with 28.6 percent of Texans, and that 7.3 
percent of El Pasoans reported having diabetes, compared with 6.5 
percent statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	Overweight people run a higher rate of premature death,  
according to the largest study ever done on obesity and mortality, 
released last week by the American Cancer Society. And obesity also 
is a factor in diabetes, heart disease, stroke and several forms of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paso Del Norte's president, Ann Pauli, says about 18,000 people  
have called the foundation to request free advertised ``walking 
kits.'' The brochures include information on the health benefits of 
walking, advice such as how to set goals, a journal to keep track 
of minutes and weight, and suggestions on where to walk in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, says Ms. Pauli, remind people that they need to  
exercise, whether or not they choose walking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We picked walking because it was easy,'' she says. ``The  
majority of people can do it. It's inexpensive. You can really make 
an impact with a small amount of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paso del Norte will try to measure the campaign's results when  
it conducts a door-to-door diabetes survey this winter. 
Participants will be asked whether they were influenced by the 
walking ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to people who say they get sick of the 'Walk El  
Paso!' jingle, but I don't care,'' Ms. Pauli says with a laugh. 
``If it annoys you, you may get up and turn off the television and 
get out of the house!''

<HEADLINE> Petition To Recall Ventura Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A petition to recall Gov. Jesse Ventura  
was dismissed Monday by Minnesota's chief justice, who said the 
ex-wrestler didn't do anything wrong by making money off a book 
deal and public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall petition -- the first in the state since it became  
legal in 1996 -- was filed by environmentalist Leslie Davis, an 
unsuccessful write-in candidate for governor last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis claimed Ventura committed malfeasance by using the  
prestige of his office to secure a better book deal and a higher 
price for his return to the wrestling ring; and by taking gifts and 
favors from his book publisher and wrestling promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Chief Justice Kathleen Blatz said the allegations  
did not constitute grounds for a recall. She ruled that the 
governor's actions either were not within his official duties, or 
they were not illegal or wrongful. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura spokesman John Wodele said the ruling went as expected.  
``The governor has always separated his private ventures from his 
responsibility as governor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he is done with Ventura now and plans to return to  
his environmental work. He had unsuccessfully tried to have Ventura 
prosecuted through the attorney general's office, two counties and 
the city of Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Harrison May Miss Packers Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Pro Bowl strong safety Rodney Harrison, one of  
the leaders of the San Diego Chargers' punishing defense, will 
probably miss this Sunday's home game against Brett Favre and the 
Green Bay Packers because of a deep bruise in his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison was hurt making a tackle in the second quarter of the  
Chargers' 13-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks, which gave San Diego 
sole possession of first place in the AFC West at 4-1. He left the 
locker room Sunday afternoon with his arm in a sling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty sore,'' coach Mike Riley said Monday, adding that  
Harrison likely will be listed as doubtful on the injury report 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison's spot will go to Greg Jackson, an 11-year veteran who  
won a Super Bowl ring with the New York Giants following the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg Jackson is a great guy to rally around,'' Riley said.  
``He might be one of the most prepared guys for being a 
non-starter. He came in Sunday and made a bunch of plays. He won't 
give an inch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre struggled in a 31-10 loss at Denver on Sunday, but the  
Chargers figure the Packers probably will come in angry. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley also said he had a good idea who he'll start at  
quarterback Sunday, but wanted to talk to both Erik Kramer and Jim 
Harbaugh before announcing his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to think about it a little more, no more than  
that,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, making his second straight start in place of the injured  
Harbaugh, threw interceptions to end San Diego's first four 
possessions in the second half. He then moved the Chargers into 
range for John Carney to kick the tying and winning field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said the four interceptions don't necessarily hurt  
Kramer's chances to start this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's all part of the competitive evaluation,'' Riley  
said. ``Erik had a pretty decent day besides that, throwing the 
ball. Our offense made enough plays at the end to go down there at 
the end to go down there at the end to kick the field goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said he felt good about his game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I made two, three errors in judgment that resulted in a couple  
of bad plays, but over the course of a game that's going to 
happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was 27-of-44 for 296 yards. He was 6-of-6 for 85 yards on  
San Diego's final two drives. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Chargers continue to make small improvements in their  
weak offense, their running game is ranked last in the league after 
gaining just 49 yards on 21 carries against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's defense regained its No. 1 rating by holding the  
Seahawks to 61 yards on 27 carries. No back has gained 100 yards 
against San Diego in 24 straight games.

<HEADLINE> Ali Wants To Get Back in Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After almost 18 years, Muhammad Ali is ready to  
get back into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old three-time heavyweight champion said he wants to  
fight again. While improbable, Ali plans to get in shape despite 
his Parkinson's disease that has slowed his speech and movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm fighting Parkinson's disease. But I don't let it stop  
me. I still travel, attend to my business, do interviews,'' Ali 
wrote in a first-person remembrance in this week's Newsweek 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``And let me tell you something that'll shock the Earth. I'm  
going to train and get in really good shape, lose 35 pounds and do 
an exhibition in Madison Square Garden with two or three 
contenders,'' he wrote. ``I'll dance for 15 rounds, and whup 'em. I 
haven't forgotten. I'll be weighing in at 210 pounds. I'll just 
say, `I am returned. Get the contract.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali last fought professionally on Dec. 11, 1981, a 10-round loss  
to Trevor Berbick. He finished with a 56-5 record and 37 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali travels with his wife, Lonnie, who speaks on his behalf. His  
speech is limited by Parkinson's, a degenerative nerve disease. His 
walk is a little slower, but his intellect is unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali's daughter, Laila, one of his eight children, won her first  
professional fight on Oct. 8 with her father in attendance. She 
plans on fighting again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Newsweek article, Ali called his fight with Joe Frazier  
in 1975, the ``Thrilla in Manila,'' his greatest bout. He also said 
the greatest thing he ever did was not go to Vietnam when drafted 
in 1967.

<HEADLINE>  Favorites Do Well in America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Prada lost a man overboard and  
veteran Dennis Conner got a scare from a first-time team when the 
long contest for the America's Cup got underway today. 
</P>
<P>
	The first races of the elimination series to decide who will  
take on the defending home team for yachting's most prized trophy 
in February 2000 started with good weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But by afternoon, the Pacific island nation's notoriously fickle  
weather turned, with the wind regularly shifting in direction from 
6 to 12 knots. Yachstmen found themselves navigating through rain 
squalls and choppy waters on the two challenger courses in the 
Hauraki Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The big-spending favorites fared well, with the New York Yacht  
Club's Young America, skippered by Ed Baird, and the St. Francis 
Yacht Club's AmericaOne with Paul Cayard at the helm securing two 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's most exciting moment came when Prada's Simone de Mari  
lost his balance and plunged into the gulf's icy waters as he tried 
to secure a gennaker as the Italian team rounded the leeward mark 
of its 2nd race. After slowing down to fish him back on board, 
Prada recovered quickly to defeat Japan's Nippon Challenge and join 
the leaders with two points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have one of our best roundings,'' Prada's skipper  
Francesco de Angelis said. ``We didn't plan that maneuver well and 
it was a big mess. Luckily, this time, we were able to clean it up 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams said the weather conditions, combined with crews'  
performances under the pressure of race conditions for the first 
time, made their races difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conditions were very shifty and today was a tricky day,''  
AmericaOne tactician John Kostecki Kostecki said. ``It wasn't a 
real straightforward day, but I think that's what we can expect 
here for more races to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his only race today, Conner, sailing in his eighth America's  
Cup competition, had a clear lead of 1 minute, 17 seconds over the 
French team at the second windward mark when his boat, Stars and 
Stripes, lost its spinnaker halyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Le Defi Francais was able to get back more than 1 minute on the  
last leg and took Conner down to the wire. In the end, the 
Americans scraped over the line to win by 9 seconds and secure one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	The French team had a convincing win over Young Australia in its  
afternoon race to finish the day with one point. Hawaii's 
Abracadabra 2000 and Nippon also finished with one point. Teams 
which failed to score were the San Francisco Yacht Club's America 
True, Switzerland's Fast 2000, the Spanish challenge and Young 
Australia. The Australians and Stars and Stripes had byes and raced 
only once each today. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races that will decide the America's Cup  
challenger, the 11 teams competing get one point for each win in 
the first of three round-robins, four points in the second, nine in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
	A finals series will decide the winner, which will meet the Team  
New Zealand in a best-of-regatta for the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Zealanders, who have elected not to have a defender's  
competition, practiced today on their two new yachts on a separate 
course, also in Hauraki Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Bush Meets With Computer Execs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush put a high-tech twist on his plans to improve education and 
limit federal regulations as he met Monday with computer industry 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding of the role of government is not to create  
wealth, but to create an environment in which entrepreneurship can 
flourish,'' Bush told reporters before speaking at the 
computer-focused Agenda 2000 Executive Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government can hurt as opposed to help growth,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bush says he will continue to speak out on issues,  
even when doing so puts him at odds with Republican leaders on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	He told The Washington Post in an interview in its Tuesday  
editions that he is not turning his back on his Hill colleagues, 
but will continue to ``state my opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Bush drew the ire of some Republicans and  
conservatives for criticizing a plan by GOP congressional leaders 
to balance the budget by shifting money from a tax credit program 
for the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor also said the party was too often too  
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Since challenging their plan for the tax credit program, which  
was dropped, Bush said he has talked to House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., and House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay -- both of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can still be friends and have disagreements on issues,''  
Bush told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, Bush said leaders in the ever-changing computer  
industry also understand the need to provide every child a good 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the real dangers and challenges for America is that as  
our world becomes more high-tech dependent, the gap between those 
who have knowledge and those who don't can increase and make it 
less able for those to realize the American dream,'' he said before 
attending the conference at the Phoenician resort.

<P>
	Bush supports expanding the educational options of parents for  
their children, including charter schools, choice in public schools 
and private school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also favors giving states greater control over how to operate  
their schools so long as they meet higher standards of achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	During his speech at the computer conference, Bush outlined  
proposals to make it easier to sell technology that is already 
available overseas but improve protections on sensitive technology 
by penalizing companies that violate export rules. He also called 
for a permanent tax credit for high-tech research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's visit to Arizona was his second in the past three weeks.  
The state, home of Sen. John McCain, one of Bush's GOP rivals, is 
drawing considerable interest from Republican presidential 
candidates because it holds the party's third primary Feb. 22.

<HEADLINE> 3 Major US Banks See Higher Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three major U.S. banks posted profits for the  
third quarter that beat Wall Street's expectations as the strong 
economy boosted mortgage loans, credit card purchases and fees from 
mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. all  
reported healthy earnings and revenue growth, while also trimming 
expenses over the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common theme is cost cutting, combined with pretty decent  
fee revenue,'' said Michael Ancell, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
Plus, he added, ``customers are still paying off there loans. 
That's made for a pretty good quarter for the big banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at their results:  

</P>
<P>
                            *Citigroup    	
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup reported a 229 percent jump in profits for the third  
quarter as the nation's largest financial company saw business boom 
in its global and investment banking units, which had suffered the 
most during last year's market tumoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup posted net income of $2.4 billion, or 70 cents a  
share, beating Wall Street's forecast by 2 cents a share. The New 
York-based company had net income of $729 million, or 20 cents a 
share in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Citigroup appears to be delivering on the promised  
synergies of the merger between Citibank and Travelers insurance 
group last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citigroup is also well on the way to meeting its goal of  
doubling earnings every five years,'' Richard K. Strauss, an 
analyst for Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's global corporate and investment bank division showed  
a strong rebound for the quarter from the loss in the 1998 period 
that resulted from severe global economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global corporate banking income totaled $461 million vs. a  
loss of $2 million in the third quarter period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney, the company's investment bank, reported  
income of $432 million, a complete turnaround from the $396 million 
loss in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Income from the Citibank's lending operations increased 65  
percent to $604 million. Income from the bank's credit card 
business, one of the largest in country, grew 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, international income grew by about one-third to $270  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors liked the numbers, and bid up Citigroup shares by  
$1.56 1/4 to $43.68 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Citigroup earned $7.25  
billion, or $2.07 a share, a 41 percent jump from $5.13 billion, or 
$1.43 a share, in the year-ago period. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Bank of America    	
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica reported a nearly sixfold increase in third-quarter  
profits as the nation's second-largest bank continued to cut costs 
and reap the benefits of its acquisition by NationsBank last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte, N.C.-based company posted earnings of $2.15  
billion, or $1.23 a share, topping Wall Street's expectations by 
two cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America earned $374 million, or 21 cents a share, during  
the same period a year ago, including a one-time, pre-tax charge of 
$725 million for the cost of integration with NationsBank. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charge, earnings a year ago were $893 million, or  
50 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsBank acquired San Francisco-based BankAmerica in a $43  
billion deal completed September 1998. The merger created a 
coast-to-coast bank with 30 million customer households and $621 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say the bank still has some work to do to combine  
its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsBank was successful in converting BankAmerica's branches  
in Arizona and New Mexico this year, but postponed the rest of the 
conversion to avoid any year-2000 computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to tell,'' said Andrew Collins, an analyst at  
ING Barings. ``The real work to be done has not yet been done,'' 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's noninterest income increased 55 percent to $3.73  
billion in the third quarter on better results in its credit card, 
investment banking and mortgage banking businesses. Fee income grew 
45 percent to $3.28 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared pleased with the bottom line improvement, and  
sent BankAmerica's stock up $1.37 1/2 to $49.56 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, net income was 49 percent  
higher. It totaled $5.98 billion, or $3.37 a share, compared with 
$4 billion, or $2.24 a share, for the same period a year ago. 

</P>
<P>
                            *J.P. Morgan    	
</P>
<P>
	With profits almost tripling in the third quarter, J.P. Morgan &AMP;  
Co. surprised investors Monday by announcing it would purchase up 
to $3 billion of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan posted net income of $442 million, or $2.22 a share,  
beating analysts' estimates by 7 cents a share. The results were 
far better than the $156 million, or 75 cents a share, J.P. Morgan 
earned in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based commercial and investment bank had a 53  
percent jump in revenues to $1.99 billion from $1.3 billion in the 
year-ago period. Expenses fell $330 million in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan's tradional lending business is now overshadowed by  
investment banking business, including stock and bond underwriting, 
money management services, and fees from advising companies on 
mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are almost exiting the more traditional lines of business  
to increasingly focus on investment banking and asset management,'' 
said Collins, the ING Barings analyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan said it would buy back between 14 percent and 15  
percent of its shares over the next 12 to 18 months. Stock 
repurchase programs improve a company's earnings per share, and 
thus its stock price, by reducing the number of shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a huge number,'' Collins said. ``It dwarfs most other  
share repurchases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan has almost completed the $750 million stock buyback  
program announced last December, but the effects were offset by the 
stock options issued to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, J.P. Morgan plans to increase its quarterly  
dividend by 1 penny to $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered the news, and sent the company's shares up  
$7.31 1/4 to $113 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, J.P. Morgan reported net income of  
$1.55 billion, or $7.76 a share, vs. $874 million, or $4.28 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $6.67 billion, up from $5.45 billion.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Quake Uncovers New Fault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An earthquake that rocked California and  
the Southwest has propelled the U.S. Geological Survey to focus its 
attention on a fault line it previously had ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly coined Lavic Lake fault, named for a dry lake bed near  
the Mojave Desert through which it broke ground, will now become 
one of the most studied in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of information about this quake, a ton,'' USGS  
geologist Ken Hudnut said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The temblor that struck at 2:46 a.m. Saturday near the remote  
desert town of Ludlow, caused minor injuries during a passenger 
train derailment. Light damage was reported elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of the quake was put today at 7.1. It had been  
listed as a 7.0 quake, but the reading was upgraded after a review 
of data, said Robert Tindol, spokesman for seismologists at the 
California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake happened along a 25-mile-long fault geologists had  
only partly mapped, hadn't researched and hadn't yet named. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tasks were low priority because of the fault's location.  
Other faults, such as San Andreas, are constantly monitored because 
they are located near heavily populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't going to do a lot of research along a fault that  
would only bother a rattlesnake,'' said Lucy Jones, a USGS 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudnut said the more geologists can learn about the physics of  
earthquakes, the more they can do to advise planners to avoid 
building on active faults and keep buildings already on them safer 
during temblors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other things they learned: The 1992 Landers and Big Bear Lake  
earthquakes, which happened three hours apart and killed one 
person, may have had a large effect on the Lavic Lake fault and 
hastened Saturday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudnut, who flew over the area with two colleagues in a  
helicopter to inspect the fault, said they marveled at the giant 
fissure that moved a dry river bed 12 feet to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had wonderful surface rupture,'' he said. ``It was exciting  
for us. Most geologists study things that happened thousands of 
years ago. This is something that happened yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also was the first major event recorded on the TriNet  
quake data system, a network of 200 seismographic stations that 
measure quake intensity and other properties. The system and 
stations are linked by computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all this equipment in place,'' Jones said. ``We were  
looking for a model to test it. This was perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While geologists got down to business Sunday, the 50 residents  
of Ludlow near the quake's epicenter, had to fix mobile homes that 
slipped off foundations and broken glass and broken dishes that 
slowed service at the town's only diner. 
</P>
<P>
	The small town that heralded itself as ``famous for absolutely  
nothing'' is now known as the site of the strongest quake to hit 
California since Landers in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Foster in Line for Re-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Even rivals of Louisiana's Republican  
governor have acknowledged he has become an easy frontrunner in an 
open primary election less than a week away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only question in the governor's race is whether Gov. Mike  
Foster will win in the primary or in a runoff with Congressman Bill 
Jefferson,'' said political analyst Ed Renwick. ``So far, it looks 
like Foster will avoid a runoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson, elected in 1990 as the state's first black  
congressman this century, is trying to stir voters to show some 
interest in order to force a Nov. 20 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the specter of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in the  
race hasn't boosted interest and state election officials are 
predicting a turnout Saturday of no more than 55 percent of the 2.8 
million registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson and fellow Democrat Phil Preis, another candidate in a  
field of 13, have made much of reports that Foster purchased Duke's 
voting list for $150,000 in the 1995 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster was fined $10,000 by the State Ethics Board for not  
reporting the purchase on campaign records. He has said he tried to 
keep the purchase secret because ``it ain't real cool to put out 
there that you're buying something from David Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury is looking into the purchase.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Duke thing lost him a few points early on but nothing  
substantial,'' said Renwick, head of the Loyola Institute of 
Politics in New Orleans. ``No one has been able to make an issue 
out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster has been immensely popular, his approval ratings near 80  
percent for most of his administration, as he focused new, massive 
spending on education, infrastructure and creating a program to 
train the hard core unemployed and those leaving the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruff and not too articulate, Foster comes off like the neighbor  
down the street, belying his wealth and planter class social 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
	He switched parties in the 1995 race but retained some of his  
populist Democrat views that have scored points with lower income 
working people. He has been a defender of social programs and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also received support from the Legislative Black Caucus  
for most of his programs, especially $1 billion in new funding for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	However, much of the black support is considered soft and will  
be transferred to Jefferson in Saturday's primary, most analysts 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll sponsored by WVUE-TV in New Orleans and taken Oct. 5-7  
said Foster was at 63.8 percent, Jefferson at 15.5 and two others 
with less than 3 percent each. The undecided vote was just under 13 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The pollster, Bernie Pinsonat of Southern Media and Opinion  
Research, said Foster will lose 3 to 4 points as more blacks move 
to Jefferson. Still, ``the bottom line is that Foster should go 
back into office in the primary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsonat said his company interviewed 600 likely voters and the  
margin of error was 4.5 percentage points either way. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson and Preis complain that while Foster is popular, the  
state still ranks near the top of the nation in poverty and at the 
bottom in education. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman has spent nearly $600,000 on television, talking  
about poverty and education woes, blaming Foster for not doing 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster has countered with an equal amount of money on  
television, touting an education accountability program that is 
just now underway. As for poverty, ``if I leave any legacy, I want 
to get us away from being one of the poorest states in the 
nation,'' said Foster. ``But, it takes time. You don't do that in 
four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preis is hoping enough blacks will shun Jefferson and turn to  
him. ``They know that a vote for Bill Jefferson is a vote for Mike 
Foster,'' he said. ``The people of this state will not, at this 
point, elect a black governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No black politician in Louisiana has won a statewide election.  
Blacks made up 33 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race is an artificial barrier,'' said Jefferson. ``We built  
the fence ourselves and we can tear it down. We will tear it 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other candidate to actively campaign is state Sen. Tom  
Greene, a Republican, who is backed by some segments of the 
Christian right angry at Foster for not stamping out gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the state's unique open primary, all candidates run on the  
same ballot, regardless of party. If no one gets more than half the 
vote, the top two go into a runoff.

<HEADLINE> One Down, One To Go for Purdue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- After knocking Michigan State from  
the ranks of the undefeated, Purdue seeks to duplicate the feat 
against No. 2 Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	A Michigan State team that came to Ross-Ade Stadium undefeated  
and ranked fifth in the nation, saw its defense picked apart by 
Boilermakers quarterback Drew Brees in a 52-28 loss Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Nick Saban placed the blame for the loss  
squarely on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game can slam you in a hurry and we got slammed,'' said  
Saban, who saw Brees complete 40-of-57 passes for 509 yards and 
five touchdowns. ``Getting ready to play the game, focus, 
concentration, execution -- I'm responsible for it all. I didn't get 
it done with our players, our organization and I'm not blaming 
anybody else but me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue has won 10 straight at home and is 15-1 at Ross-Ade since  
coach Joe Tiller took over in 1997. The only loss was to Penn 
State, 42-17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers (5-2, 2-2 Big Ten) moved from 20th to 16th in  
the AP poll with the upset. Michigan State (6-1, 3-1) tumbled to 
No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Daniels caught 21 passes for 301 yards, setting Big Ten  
records in each category. Meanwhile, Purdue's defense made it a 
long day for Michigan State quarterback Bill Burke. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after passing for a school-record 400 yards in a 34-32  
win over Michigan, Burke was intercepted four times, sacked five 
times and lost a fumble. Two of his five turnovers resulted in 14 
Purdue points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel embarrassed by my performance,'' said Burke, who had  
234 yards passing after going 21-of-33, including a touchdown pass. 
``But what am I going to do about it now? We're going to get this 
thing fixed. The seniors aren't going to let it steamroll out of 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Purdue prepares to play Penn State this week, the Spartans  
travel again to take on No. 17 Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees said Daniels' record-setting day wasn't planned.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just happened that everything was to his side, or the  
coverage made it to where we were throwing to him,'' Brees said of 
Daniels, who went into the game leading the Big Ten in receptions 
with 57 and was second in receiving yards with 562. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels had touchdown catches of 51, 10 and 4 yards -- all in the  
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daniels is a great receiver, and I know I can depend on him,''  
Brees said. ``But, it just happened to be going to him. In this 
offense, any guy, any day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels' reception total was two short of the NCAA record set by  
Randy Gatewood of UNLV against Idaho on Sept. 17, 1994, and matched 
the third highest in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Daniels) made some great catches, and we didn't cover him  
very well at times,'' Saban said. ``He's a very good receiver, he's 
a go-to guy for them, and he made some outstanding catches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiller agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brees threw with more velocity, and the guys had glue on their  
hands to hang onto the ball,'' Tiller said. ``Chris really hung in 
there and executed well. He played a really heady game out there, 
as well as making the big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels had caught only two TD passes in the first six games.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted the ball every single time,'' Daniels said. ``I just  
knew I would catch it. I just felt it. I always seemed to be open 
and I could feel the ball coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the nation's top rushing defense, Brees completed passes  
to eight receivers while the junior continued his climb up Purdue's 
career lists. He has 571 completions, 6,537 yards and 55 touchdowns 
after just 27 games and 20 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough because they have so many receivers who can do the  
job,'' said Michigan State cornerback Renaldo Hill, adding that 
Daniels was not his team's primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good receiver, but I didn't see him exploding like that  
on us. We were more worried about (Vinny) Sutherland and (Randall) 
Lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels topped Lane's conference mark of 18 receptions in a  
game, set last year against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory came after consecutive road losses to Michigan and  
Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew this game would be a huge test for the team,'' Brees  
said. ``Coming back here, playing a national championship-caliber 
team, we just kind of had that attitude, this is going to be our 
season. We've got to turn it around.''

<HEADLINE>  Favorites Do Well in America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Prada lost a man overboard and  
veteran Dennis Conner got a scare from a first-time team when the 
long contest for the America's Cup got underway today. 
</P>
<P>
	The first races of the elimination series to decide who will  
take on the defending home team for yachting's most prized trophy 
in February 2000 started with good weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But by afternoon, the Pacific island nation's notoriously fickle  
weather turned, with the wind regularly shifting in direction from 
6 to 12 knots. Yachstmen found themselves navigating through rain 
squalls and choppy waters on the two challenger courses in the 
Hauraki Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The big-spending favorites fared well, with the New York Yacht  
Club's Young America, skippered by Ed Baird, and the St. Francis 
Yacht Club's AmericaOne with Paul Cayard at the helm securing two 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's most exciting moment came when Prada's Simone de Mari  
lost his balance and plunged into the gulf's icy waters as he tried 
to secure a gennaker as the Italian team rounded the leeward mark 
of its 2nd race. After slowing down to fish him back on board, 
Prada recovered quickly to defeat Japan's Nippon Challenge and join 
the leaders with two points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have one of our best roundings,'' Prada's skipper  
Francesco de Angelis said. ``We didn't plan that maneuver well and 
it was a big mess. Luckily, this time, we were able to clean it up 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams said the weather conditions, combined with crews'  
performances under the pressure of race conditions for the first 
time, made their races difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conditions were very shifty and today was a tricky day,''  
AmericaOne tactician John Kostecki Kostecki said. ``It wasn't a 
real straightforward day, but I think that's what we can expect 
here for more races to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his only race today, Conner, sailing in his eighth America's  
Cup competition, had a clear lead of 1 minute, 17 seconds over the 
French team at the second windward mark when his boat, Stars and 
Stripes, lost its spinnaker halyard.

<P>
	Le Defi Francais was able to get back more than 1 minute on the  
last leg and took Conner down to the wire. In the end, the 
Americans scraped over the line to win by 9 seconds and secure one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	The French team had a convincing win over Young Australia in its  
afternoon race to finish the day with one point. Hawaii's 
Abracadabra 2000 and Nippon also finished with one point. Teams 
which failed to score were the San Francisco Yacht Club's America 
True, Switzerland's Fast 2000, the Spanish challenge and Young 
Australia. The Australians and Stars and Stripes had byes and raced 
only once each today.

	In more than 700 races that will decide the America's Cup  
challenger, the 11 teams competing get one point for each win in 
the first of three round-robins, four points in the second, nine in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
	A finals series will decide the winner, which will meet the Team  
New Zealand in a best-of-regatta for the America's Cup. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coffee Futures Take a Soaking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices plummeted 12 percent Monday on New York's  
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange, extending a month-long yo-yo ride 
as investors reacted to weekend rains in drought-prone Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other commodities, sugar dipped to a seven-month low and  
prices of pork bellies retreated sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices have had a string of double-digit percentage  
swings in October, ranging between 80 cents and $1.20 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the price immediately sank 9 cents as rains in  
producing regions of Brazil dampened expectations of a drop in 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	For the day, coffee for December delivery fell 12 3/4 cents to  
95.65 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are still trying to get a handle on expected  
production from the 2000-2001 crop, with October a key month for 
soil moisture. Prices soared 40 percent during a three-day period 
last week, when an extended dry spell raised fears about what was 
supposed to have been a record crop of some 40 million bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers had been expected over the weekend in some producing  
areas. But even though rainfall amounts were not significant, the 
market responded emphatically. New forecasts also call for rain in 
the coming few days, although it's far from clear the drought will 
be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Ganes, senior commodities analyst for Merrill Lynch, said  
traders are ``spooked'' by the Brazilian weather situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market overreacted,'' she said. ``The word 'rain' is what  
did it -- people react to that, and that trips the technical 
signals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rains appear to have missed the central part of the coffee  
belt, and cooperatives in the affected region said the weekend 
showers were not enough to restore the crop to previous levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless more rain materializes, the price is likely to shoot back  
up again, Ganes said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same exchange, sugar futures also plunged but for largely  
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were pressured by stock market uncertainties, the decline  
in other commodities and a continuing world surplus of sugar. Even 
with supplies already high, the European Union beet harvest is 
expected to exceed last year's and cane crops in Brazil and 
elsewhere are large. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar settled down 10 cents at 6.46 cents per pound.  
</P>
<P>
	On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, contracts for pork bellies  
sank nearly 4 percent as investors took profits after prices hit a 
five-month high earlier in the session. Concerns over a heavy 
slaughter also contributed to the selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	February frozen pork bellies fell 2.38 cents to 63.02 cents a  
pound.

<HEADLINE> Boston Cops Beef Up Fenway Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There were plenty of taunts but no reported  
trouble Monday night at Fenway Park where a beefed-up security 
presence was in place to prevent a repeat of the ruckus that 
temporarily halted Game 4 of the ALCS on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans booed the umpires while they were introduced and took the  
field for Game 5 between the Boston Red Sox and the New York 
Yankees, paying no attention to a videotaped plea from Red Sox star 
Nomar Garciaparra to be ``courteous'' and ``respectful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans brought signs that read: ``Dump the Umps!''  
</P>
<P>
	Blown calls against the Red Sox in the eighth and ninth innings  
of Game 4 sparked an outburst by some Fenway fans who hurled 
debris, boos and insults at the umpires and Yankee players. 
</P>
<P>
	When umpire Dale Scott called Garciaparra out at first base on a  
close play in the ninth, Red Sox manager Jimy Williams sprang from 
the dugout to argue, and was ejected by Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans reacted with a stream of bottles, cups and other debris,  
prompting the umpires to clear the Yankees from the field and 
bullpen -- a move that halted play for eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston fans Bryan Fuller and Lauren Cooperstein showed up  
wearing dark glasses and using canes to guide them along -- their 
version of blind umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	They carried a sign that said: ``I could be an umpire, too.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The odds and the gods were already against us. We didn't need  
the malevolent umpires we had,'' 28-year-old Cooperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Harrington, the team's chief operating officer, pinned the  
disturbance on just a few of the thousands attending the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A very small group in a crowd of more than 33,000 people  
behaved outrageously, inappropriately and uncharacteristically for 
Red Sox fans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Kevin Jones, a Boston police spokesman, said he knew of  
no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have 36,000 fans there, and a lot of them are standing  
up,'' he said. ``It's hard to identify the person who is 
throwing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams denied Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's assertion  
that his actions in arguing with the umpires incited fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Georgie Porgie speaks, I don't listen, I didn't incite  
the fans,'' Williams said. ``But what they did last night is not 
the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Hallinan, baseball's executive director of security, said  
the problem Sunday developed when police left the ballpark before 
the end of the game to handle crowd and traffic control outside the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were directed to stay inside the park as long as needed  
Monday night to make sure it was secure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Thomas Menino said the unruly fans shamed the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``The inappropriate behavior demonstrated last night by a  
handful of Red Sox fans was an embarrassment to the city of 
Boston,'' he said. ``That was not what Boston is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said he didn't mind the taunts  
Saturday of Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, but said fans shouldn't 
have chanted, ``Just Say No!'' on Sunday at Darryl Strawberry, who 
has battled drug and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``What went on with Darryl Strawberry yesterday I thought was  
over the line. I didn't think that was right,'' Torre said. ``Watch 
TV, go to the movies, listen to the radio. Everything's down now. 
There are no barriers at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Herald columnist Michael Gee called the fan conduct ``a  
disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A certain number of the 33,596 fans at Fenway Park couldn't  
hold their liquor. Or maybe they were born pigs,'' he wrote. ``Each 
and every person reading this should be ashamed for what some of 
his neighbors did last night. If you love sports, you should be 
sickened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Globe sports writer Dan Shaughnessy described the game as ``a  
hail of errors, bad umpiring, and worse conduct by Boston fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary,'' he wrote. ``Police were unable to stop dozens  
of unruly spectators from tossing things and the reigning world 
champion Yankees cleared the field while officials weighed the 
merits of resuming the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Yankees' wives were escorted from Fenway Park by police  
after Sunday night's game, Hallinan said there were no incidents 
involving them, although there was taunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the nature of the beast,'' he said. ``The wives are  
cheering when the other fans are not. It's not out of hand and was 
fairly good natured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallinan also said the Red Sox security official who got into a  
shouting match with Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson apologized to the 
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Jose Strengthening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A weather system brewing in the Atlantic became  
Tropical Storm Jose early today and was expected to strengthen into 
a hurricane in the next few days, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 24 to 48 hours it could reach hurricane status,'' said Jack  
Bevin, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbados was under a hurricane watch today. Forecasters said a  
similar watch could be issued for portions of the Windward Islands, 
an island chain in the southeastern Caribbean, later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinidad and Tobago, residents were preparing for possible  
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, the center of Tropical Storm Jose was about 430  
miles east-southeast of Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose was moving west near 10 mph and a gradual turn toward the  
west-northwest was expected. Maximum sustained winds were near 40 
mph, with higher gusts. The storm's tropical force winds extended 
outward up to 50 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose is the 10th tropical storm of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane  
season, which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Join Students at Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spurred by school killings and stalled gun  
legislation, President Clinton, 350 high school students and a 
largely Democratic group of lawmakers open a two-day conference 
Tuesday on children's violence. A goal is to decide causes of 
dangerous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred-thirty members of Congress selected up to five  
student delegates from their districts. Republican Reps. Jennifer 
Dunn of Washington, Sue Kelly of New York and Connie Morella of 
Maryland were the only participating GOP lawmakers, said Laura 
Nichols, spokeswoman for House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, 
D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why so few Republicans were participating, John Feehery,  
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said it was a 
Democratic-sponsored event and ``we didn't get invited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference opens Tuesday morning with greetings from Clinton  
and Gephardt and a showing of a new MTV documentary, ``Fight for 
Your Rights: Through My Eyes.'' Workshops follow on programs to 
address youth violence, including demonstrations of violence 
prevention methods. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, participants will form small groups to identify  
the top five primary causes of and solutions to youth violence. 
They will present findings to House and Senate leaders on the 
Capitol steps. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference ends with an Internet broadcast, moderated by  
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, of a town hall-style 
discussion with youths in Washington and participating schools 
around the country. Panelists will include William Moffitt, 
president of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Attorneys, and William Modzeleski, director of the Department of 
Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program.

<HEADLINE> Delta, Continental Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Delta and Continental airlines reported a drop in third-quarter  
earnings as Hurricane Floyd grounded hundreds of flights for both 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta reported Monday its earnings excluding a one-time gain  
fell 13 percent during the quarter, while Continental Airlines said 
its earnings fell 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
 *Delta Air Lines Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines reported earnings of $290 million, or $1.96 per  
share, compared to $327 million, or $2.08 per share, in the same 
quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results did not include the proceeds of a one-time stock  
sale. With that one-time gain included, Delta's net earnings came 
to $352 million, or $2.38 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta exceeded the $1.91-per-share expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd, which struck the southeastern coast in  
September, forcing 1,100 Delta flights to be canceled, reduced 
revenues for the Atlanta-based airline by about $20 million. Delta 
reported total revenues for the quarter of $3.87 billion, up from 
$3.80 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's net earnings were boosted by the sale of 35.2  
million shares of Singapore Airlines it had held since 1989. Delta 
also bought back its own common stock held by Singapore Airlines, 
giving the U.S. carrier a pretax gain of $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also sold 1.8 million shares of Priceline.com, an online  
ticket bidding company, for another $115 million. Delta still owns 
16.8 million shares of Priceline.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta's stock rose 25 cents to $50.37 1/2 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the one-time gain, Delta reported nine-month net  
income of $933 million, or $6.19 a share, up from $884 million, or 
$5.57 a share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $11.34 billion, up from $10.95 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Delta announced it is buying the Comair commuter  
airline for $1.8 billion. The deal is part of Delta's effort to 
expand a regional connection between its hubs and cities served by 
smaller carriers. 

</P>
<P>
                     *Continental Airlines Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Continental's net earnings fell 27 percent to $110 million, or  
$1.53 per share, from $150 million, or $1.94 per share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results do not reflect a one-time charge for the  
retirement of aging aircraft. With that charge included, the 
year-ago earnings came to $73 million, or 97 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental's latest results surpassed predictions of analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp., who anticipated earnings of $1.47 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $2.3 billion, up 8 percent from $2.1 billion in  
the 1998 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Continental reported the cancellation of 700  
flights due to Hurricane Floyd, which cut into the airline's 
revenue. The carrier also reported its results were hurt by a 15 
percent rise in fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental shares rose 25 cents to $36.31 1/4 in New York Stock  
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Continental announced it has sold its interest in  
Amadeus Global Travel Distribution SA for $408 million. The sale 
will close Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time charge, Continental reported nine-month  
net income of $331 million, or $4.51 a share, up from $317 million, 
or $4.15 a share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $6.54 billion, up from $6.01 billion.

<HEADLINE> Gun Lobbying Costs Up 467 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeing a chance for a rare legislative  
victory, the leading gun-control group has increased lobbying 
spending almost fivefold over 1998 levels and recruited 
entertainers Susan Sarandon and Rosie O'Donnell for an advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Success on Capitol Hill, however, remains elusive, thanks in  
part to an aggressive counteroffensive by the National Rifle 
Association. The NRA also has spent more as it tries to stymie 
gun-control advocates who hope that this year's spate of deadly 
school shootings had sufficiently bolstered their case. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high and the issue remains alive despite months  
of gridlock on gun-control proposals that House and Senate 
negotiators are considering as part of juvenile-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders believe agreement is near on provisions to bar  
minors from possessing assault weapons, ban certain large-scale 
ammunition clips and require ``reasonable'' mandatory background 
checks for purchases, including those at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of legislative gains led the largest gun-control  
organization, Handgun Control, to spend $340,000 on lobbying 
between January and June, compared with $60,000 during the same 
period in 1998, according to reports filed with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	It still did not keep pace with the NRA, the country's  
best-known advocate of gun owner's rights. The group reported that 
it poured $850,000 into its lobbying effort during the first six 
months of 1999, compared with $750,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity stems from congressional action on gun  
control that took center stage after the April shooting at 
Columbine High School outside Denver left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	By one vote, the Senate passed legislation that included  
mandatory background checks on all firearms buyers at gun shows and 
required dealers to provide safety devices with all handguns. A 
month later, the House deleted the gun measures from the 
juvenile-crime bill after some Republicans argued they were too 
strong and some Democrats asserted they were too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	That has left it to a House-Senate conference to resolve the  
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	For Handgun Control, there finally is a bill that gun-control  
advocates can use to pressure lawmakers, spokeswoman Naomi Paiss 
said. Contributions also rose, and helped finance more lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun control had been stymied for many years,'' Ms. Paiss said.  
``We finally got something on the floor that people understood was 
critically important to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals 
and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, acknowledging the important fight, hired two new  
outside lobbying firms to buttress the efforts of the group's 
staff, including one headed by Randall Scheunemann, a former top 
aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could have found 15 more people who were particularly  
effective, I would have hired them too,'' said James Baker, the 
NRA's chief lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the NRA urged its members to contact lawmakers  
involved in the gun-control talks as well as their own members of 
Congress. ``It is critical that you call ... to ensure that no 
anti-gun language is included in the final conference committee's 
'compromise' legislation,'' the NRA said in a fax message. 
</P>
<P>
	Handgun Control spent $100,000 on television ads last month in  
Washington, D.C., and 10 congressional districts. They including 
those represented by Reps. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn. and Anne Northup, 
R-Ky., which both went President Clinton in 1992 and 1996; 
conservative Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C.; and Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla., chairman of the House Judiciary crime subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Performers O'Donnell and Sarandon each narrated a commercial,  
which included scenes of shootings at Columbine and a Jewish 
community center in Los Angeles in August, as well as the 1998 
killings of five people in Jonesboro, Ark., shot as they left 
school during a fire alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough. No more excuses,'' O'Donnell and Sarandon  
said in separate ads. ``Call Congress and tell them to close the 
loopholes that give children and criminals easy access to 
firearms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA quickly answered with its own $50,000 ad campaign,  
citing a study that found the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms is sending fewer gun-related cases to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need tougher gun laws,'' the narrator says in a  
message that mirrors what NRA lobbyists carry to Capitol Hill. ``We 
need to get tougher on violent criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the prosecution is a very salient point,'' Baker  
said. ``It's one we're trying to put across in every venue 
possible.''

<HEADLINE> Nortel, Clarify To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Nortel Networks, North America's No. 2  
maker of telecommunications products, said Monday it is buying 
software maker Clarify Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $2.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ontario-based Nortel had sales of $17.6 billion last year,  
trailing only Lucent Technologies in the manufacture of switching 
hardware, wireless, and broadband network systems for service 
providers and telephone systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarify makes software that automates interactions with  
customers, from help desks to sales and customer service. The 
company, whose biggest competitor was Seibel Systems, has nearly 
800 employees. It had $130.5 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarify will be a wholly owned Nortel subsidiary based in San  
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing customer relationships is seen as the next big step in  
the development of e-businesses, said F. William Conner, president 
of Nortel's Enterprise Solutions unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together we will provide a new customer experience by unifying  
the high performance Internet with front office solutions and 
customer interactions of all kinds,'' he said. ``This will deliver 
greater returns on customer relationships for enterprises and 
service providers worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction approved by the boards of directors of both  
companies gives Clarify shareholders 1.3 shares of Nortel stock for 
each share of Clarify they own. That represents a 50 percent 
premium for Clarify shareholders, based on Monday's closing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel shares closed down 31 1/4 cents at $52.37 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Clarify stock rose $1.96 7/8 to close at $45.31 1/4 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> American Home Increases Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising sales of its estrogen replacement and  
arthritis drugs helped American Home Products Corp. post a 2 
percent increase in third-quarter earnings. The results do not 
reflect $3.29 billion in charges mostly related to the company's 
proposed national diet drug settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home said Monday it earned $633.46 million, or 48 cent  
per share, compared to earnings of $618.99 million, or 46 cents a 
share, in the same quarter a year ago. Results beat analysts' 
forecasts by a penny, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 3 percent to $3.32 billion from $3.22 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Including $3.29 billion in previously disclosed charges related  
to the company's proposed settlement of fen-phen diet drug 
litigation and some other issues, American Home had a net loss of 
$2.87 billion in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, the fifth-largest U.S. drug maker, said the net  
loss amounted to $2.20 per share, and also included after-tax 
charges of $220 million for restructuring of the company's poor 
performing Cyanamid crop-protection business and buybacks of 
herbicide products. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.,-based American Home on Oct. 7 announced it had  
agreed to pay $4.83 billion over a period of up to 16 years as part 
of a national settlement of thousands of fen-phen liability 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, which must be approved by a federal  
judge in Philadelphia, the company would set up two funds to pay 
for medical checkups and injury claims for all patients who took 
its diet drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine), and chemical cousin Redux 
(dexfenfluramine) before the medicines were recalled in 1997 after 
being linked to heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, which markets the Premarin female hormone  
replacement drugs and rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, said its 
drug sales increased 10 percent in the third quarter to $2.58 
billion. Premarin is the mostly widely prescribed drug in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the company's consumer health division, including  
over-the-counter products such as the painkiller Advil and Centrum 
vitamins, rose 7 percent to $606.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's agricultural products sales dropped 57 percent to  
$130.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special charges, profits for the first nine months of  
1999 decreased 3 percent to $1.74 billion, or $1.33 per share, from 
$1.79 billion, or $1.34 per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Including charges, the company had a nine-month net loss of  
$1.82 billion, or $1.39 per share, compared to profits of $2.12

</P>
<P>
	Sales were flat at $10.08 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Offended by Gore Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is not  
offended that Vice President Al Gore doesn't want his help in 
seeking to win the White House. ``No one can help anyone else in a 
campaign beyond a certain point,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president told reporters he agrees with Gore, who told The  
Washington Post last week that his bid for the Democratic 
nomination is a ``very personal quest'' and that he might ask 
Clinton not to help his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a decision he ought to make at an appropriate  
time,'' Clinton said following a meeting with his economic 
advisers. ``I agree with what he said about it. It won't matter who 
said it as much as it matters what is said. I just want the 
American people to make this judgment based on what's best for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said while he has not decided whether he would turn down  
Clinton's help, ``I may do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that is fine. ``The candidates will be the major  
players. Everybody else, to a greater or lesser degree, is in a 
subordinate role,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> QBs Passing Through Revolving Door </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dan Marino leaves and Damon Huard plays just fine as his  
replacement. Same for Jay Fiedler in place of Mark Brunell. Even 
Brian Griese has found new life and Dave Brown is back for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the way of the NFL, where Kurt Warner can come out of  
the Arena League and lead the downtrodden St. Louis Rams to five 
straight wins to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the way of NFL fans, who were yelling ``Fiedler,  
Fiedler,'' after the journeyman from Dartmouth went 11-for-13 to 
pull out a win after Brunell went down. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, there is reason for concern in a sport in which one  
position plays so prominent a role. With the season one-third 
complete, 14 of the 31 first-string quarterbacks have been injured 
-- some temporarily, some for the season and one (Steve Young) 
perhaps for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	A partial list:  
</P>
<P>
	--Marino, the NFL's career leader in most passing categories,  
completed one pass Sunday in New England. He threw an 8-yarder on 
the second play of the game that made him the first QB to surpass 
60,000 yards in his career. Then he left with a sore shoulder, 
giving way to Huard. He won the game 31-30 on a 5-yard TD pass to 
Stanley Pritchett with 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	--Brunell, the player most responsible for Jacksonville's early  
success as an expansion franchise, bruised his ribs with the 
underachieving Jaguars trailing expansion Cleveland 7-6 in the 
third quarter. Enter Fiedler, a relative of the late conductor 
Arthur Fielder and a quarterback who has bounced from Philadelphia 
to Minnesota to Jacksonville in four years. Fifteen points later, 
Jags win 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jake Plummer was already playing with a variety of injuries  
that have kept him from fulfilling the promise shown last season. 
He broke his right index finger in a 24-10 loss to the Redskins. 
Enter Brown, a one-time first-round draft choice run out of New 
York by the boos of Giants fans. Brown threw a TD pass that got the 
Cards back in the game temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	--Detroit's Charlie Batch, another bright young QB. He left the  
game with Minnesota with a bruised right shoulder, believed not to 
be overly serious. In the same game, another maligned QB, Jeff 
George, took over for an ineffective Randall Cunningham. George 
nearly won the game out for the Vikings and will start next week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Then there's Brett Favre, who had pulled out all three of Green  
Bay's wins with touchdown drives in the final minutes. Playing with 
a thumb injury that causes constant pain, he had the worst game of 
his career in Denver. He completed 7-of-23 for 120 yards with three 
interceptions in a 31-10 loss to the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thumb has been bothering me all year, but it is not an  
excuse,'' Favre said. ``I don't want it to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Griese was supposed to be benched until Bubby Brister came up  
with a strained rib muscle. But he threw for 363 yards in that 
game. Coach Mike Shanahan, playing quarterback roulette all season, 
declined to say if Brister or Griese will start next week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Finally, Steve Young. He wanted to come back in the second half  
of San Francisco's game in Arizona Sept. 27 after sustaining yet 
another concussion in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he's missed three games now, and the unrelated  
Steinbergs, agent Leigh and Dr. Gary, seem to want him to retire. 
The agent is outspoken; the doctor is guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	In his stead, Jeff Garcia has done decently.  
</P>
<P>
	But he's not Steve Young.  
</P>
<P>
	Nor is Damon Huard Dan Marino.  
</P>
<P>
	In this year of declining and emerging quarterbacks, only Kurt  
Warner has looked like a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's had only five games. Give him time.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOWN BY THE BAY:* It finally looks as if San Francisco's  
fabulous run is near an end. Not because Young has been replaced by 
Garcia at quarterback but because the rest of the parts aren't 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Niners lost 31-29 to Carolina Sunday, ending a 19-game home  
winning streak in a strangely symmetrical fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last regular-season loss at home was 30-24 to the Panthers  
on Dec. 8, 1996. George Seifert was San Francisco's coach in that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, eased out as Niners' coach after that '96 season  
despite a career winning percentage of .766, was the Panthers' 
coach Sunday. He returned as the enemy for the first time to the 
city where he was born, raised and spent most of his coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as excited as I can be,'' he said after the game, about as  
strong a statement as the laid-back Seifert ever makes. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the 49ers, they're 3-3 with a bad secondary and  
questionable offensive and defensive lines. In a league where 
parity reigns, they may not win 10 games this season, ending a run 
of 16 consecutive seasons with double-figure wins. 

</P>
<P>
	 *GEORGIA CONNECTION:* With Terrell Davis and Derek Loville  
injured, Denver turned to rookie Olandis Gary on Sunday. He 
responded with a heavy-duty 124 yards on 37 carries. That was a 
major reason why the Broncos had the ball for an astounding 45 
minutes, 14 seconds in their 31-10 win over the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a connection here.  
</P>
<P>
	Gary was a fourth-round pick from Georgia. That's the same  
school from which the Broncos plucked Davis, who won Super Bowl MVP 
and league MVP awards the last two years, on the sixth round in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another connection.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis transferred to Georgia from Long Beach State after it  
dropped football. He got hurt, then got caught in a pass-happy 
offense led by Eric Zeier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary came from Marshall with Jim Donnan, who moved from there to  
Georgia to replace Ray Goff in 1996, the year after Zeier and Davis 
left. He was a backup to the injured Robert Edwards of the New 
England Patriots before becoming a starter last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's Denver's secret: Draft Georgia running backs late.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Sues Cyber Squatters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has  
filed a lawsuit to keep others from selling variations on the 
committee's Web site trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	One broker tried to sell an investigator working for the SLOC  
three of the Olympic Web site names for $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC filed the federal suit Friday against Branjack Inc., a  
defunct company with only a mail drop in Wilmington, Del., and 
apparent pseudonyms Brandon Walker and Regina Cephas. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are offering to sell five Internet domain names,  
all variations on Salt Lake, games and 2002. The names were 
approved by an Internet registrar that does not screen applications 
for trademark violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC hosts the Web site www.slc2002.org and owns 13 similar  
names, including ``2002 Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our simple intention is to prevent the improper infringement  
of our domain names. These electronic addresses are considered a 
valuable corporate asset,'' SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's lawsuit seeks a court order that would force the  
defendants to turn the counterfeit domain names over to the SLOC. 
The suit also seeks punitive damages of three times the profits the 
defendants earn hawking Olympic domain names or attorneys fees. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding the defendants won't be easy. Investigators traced  
only unoccupied offices, dead telephones and lapsed or nonexistent 
incorporation records. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigator who sent an e-mail to one of the Internet sites  
got a response from a ``John'' offering for $25,000 to sell the 
names saltlake2002.com, saltlakecitygames.com and 
saltlakecity2002.com. 
</P>
<P>
	A search of Internet domain names by The Associated Press on  
Monday turned up numerous other variations on SLOC's Web site 
address, including saltlake2002.org. The owner of that domain name 
didn't immediately return a call for comment.

<HEADLINE> Grain and Soybean Futures Advance / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rose Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, drifting higher for technical reasons and 
mounting fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	After opening sharply lower following weekend rains in Brazil, a  
top world producer, soybeans drifted steadily higher as investors 
realized rainfall totals were not significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices increased as funds covered their short positions, in  
which they had invested in lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	With a continuing fall in the stock market casting a long  
shadow, investors also were acting on inflation fears that 
heightened ahead of Tuesday's release of key government data on the 
consumer price index and housing starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were supported by forecasts of dry weather for the  
southwestern Plains that could hamper emergence of the winter wheat 
crop there. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3 3/4 cents to $2.60 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 3 cents to $2.02 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 1/4 
cent to $1.10 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 3 cents to $4.95 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle rose 1.15 cent to 69.87 cents a pound;  
November feed cattle rose .70 cent to 82.37 cents a pound; December 
lean hogs rose .12 cent to 47.22 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies fell 2.38 cents to 63.02 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Ditka Pays $20,000 Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Mike Ditka coughed up $20,000 and an apology  
for two obscene gestures he made to taunting fans after the New 
Orleans Saints lost for the fourth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes getting old is not getting smart,'' Ditka said  
Monday, his 60th birthday. ``What I did was probably as stupid as 
anything I've ever done. I make no excuse for it, no alibi. I 
apologize to everybody -- the fans, the city, the organization, my 
players and the league. There's no place for anything like that 
regardless of the amount of frustration or disappointment or 
anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints fined Ditka $20,000. The money will be contributed to  
area charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fans have been loyal to us for three decades,'' general  
manager Bill Kuharich said. ``The entire Saints organization agree 
that our fans do not deserve that type of behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka made an obscene gesture and shouted an obscenity at fans  
as he left the field at halftime Sunday. The fans were booing after 
the Saints mismanaged the clock and failed to score after having a 
first down on the Tennessee Titans' 1-yard line with 12 seconds 
remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints (1-4) were leading 10-0 at the time but lost 24-21.  
It was the fourth straight game the Saints have lost in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game a small crowd chanted at Ditka as he and team  
left the field. As the coach walked past, Ditka stopped, turned 
toward them and grabbed his crotch and mouthed another obscenity 
before walking onto the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fine was justified,'' Ditka said. ``I make the promise  
that, of course, it will never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time he had been fined as a coach, Ditka said.  
The NFL will not take further action against Ditka, Kuharich said. 
Greg Aiello of the league confirmed that. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka's frustration is mounting along with a string of losses  
that have all come during fourth-quarter collapses. 
</P>
<P>
	After consecutive 6-10 seasons, Ditka traded eight draft picks  
to get running back Ricky Williams this spring, pronouncing him the 
``final piece to the puzzle,'' and the Saints' ticket to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Williams -- the most prolific runner in college football  
history -- has been hampered by injuries. He has gained just 292 
yards and has not scored in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike is frustrated, we're all frustrated,'' said center Jerry  
Fontenot, who also played for Ditka in Chicago. ``Nobody want's to 
win more than Mike. It's not a good time, but I think he's handling 
it as well as anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints have lost 14 of their last 18 games. The offense has  
not been more effective than last year when they were 28th overall 
and dead last in rushing. New Orleans had not scored in the fourth 
quarter until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Titans, Ditka admitted he called the wrong play at  
the end of the first half when he sent Williams running up the 
middle for no gain and time expired without the Saints scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka has questioned his own game plans, saying Williams is not  
being run enough, but then said he's calling more than half the 
plays. He's said that the wrong personnel has been on the field at 
times and plays have been run wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Ditka said after the latest loss. ``If I had  
the answer I would be glad to tell you. I do not know right now. I 
have no idea what we can do. We can keep working on it and try to 
get better.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Criminal Appeals convictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed today to use a  
California case to clarify when criminal defendants can appeal a 
judge's decision to let jurors hear about their prior criminal 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear a woman's argument in a drug case  
that she should be allowed to appeal such a ruling, even though she 
told jurors from the witness stand about the earlier conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Suzuki Ohler was stopped by customs agents when she tried  
to enter the United States from Mexico at San Ysidro, Calif., in 
July 1997. An agent noticed an interior panel of her van had been 
tampered with, and a search found more than 80 pounds of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors sought permission to introduce evidence of her 1993  
felony conviction for possession of methamphetamine. Before the 
trial began, the judge ruled such evidence could be used to attack 
Ohler's credibility if she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohler took the stand and during her testimony told jurors of the  
earlier conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury convicted her on charges of importing marijuana and  
possessing the drug with intent to distribute. She was sentenced to 
30 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	She appealed, arguing that the judge should not have ruled that  
her prior conviction could be used against her. The 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld her conviction and said she waived 
that argument by mentioning the conviction in her own testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal granted review today, Ohler's lawyers said she  
admitted the prior conviction in an effort to ``to remove the sting 
of the imminent cross-examination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The admission of a defendant's prior conviction is one of the  
most deadly weapons in a prosecutor's arsenal,'' her lawyers said. 
They added that federal appeals courts have split over whether a 
defendant's testimony about a prior conviction waives the right to 
argue on appeal that the conviction should not have been used as 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said the 9th Circuit court ruling  
means defendants must choose between preserving the right to appeal 
that issue or ``attempting to soften the blow of damaging info by 
introducing it on direct examination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Ohler vs. U.S., 99-9828.

<HEADLINE> Natural Rubber Shortage Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- World production of natural rubber will fall short  
of consumption in 2000 for the second year in a row, leading to a 
further reduction of stockpiles, the International Rubber Study 
Group forecast Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group predicted that world natural rubber output -- 70 per  
cent of which goes into tires -- would rise to 6.79 million metric 
tons in 2000 from 6.68 million tons in 1999. A metric ton is equal 
to about 2,204 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumption next year is projected at 7.03 million tons,  
compared with an estimated 6.78 million tons this year, according 
to the London-based intergovernmental agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, production was 6.69 million tons and consumption 6.61  
million tons, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's forecast for synthetic rubber puts production at  
10.57 million tons in 2000 following production of 10.28 million 
tons this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumption is forecast at 10.31 million tons in 2000, up from  
10.09 million tons this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's forecasts by country for natural rubber production  
this year included Thailand at 2.15 million tons, Indonesia 1.62 
million tons, Malaysia 850,000 tons, India 621,000 tons, China 
460,000 tons, Vietnam 238,000 tons and the Ivory Coast 116,000 
tons.

<HEADLINE> EU Studies Canada Airline Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators have opened  
an extensive probe of the proposed acquisition by Onex Corp. of 
Canada's two major airlines, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, 
citing fears the merger will harm competition on transatlantic 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, the European Commission said it was  
investigating concerns the merger would create an unfairly dominant 
position on direct flights between London and Canada. It cited 
plans by Onex to have Air Canada join the Oneworld alliance that 
already includes British Airways and Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oneworld would become the only alliance whose members serve  
London-Canada direct,'' the Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to launch a full probe gives EU regulators four  
months to decide if the merger complies with EU antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alliances may well make life easier for the traveler. Yet only  
if alliances face head-on competition will their benefits come at a 
fair price,'' said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-based Onex offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock for  
the Canadian carriers in August. It will also assume $2.7 billion 
in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Canadian Airlines welcomed the offer, the larger Air  
Canada has charged the bid was a front for a takeover by American 
Airlines, whose parent, AMR Corp., is backing Onex. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR owns 25 percent of Canadian and would own 15 percent of the  
new airline, to be called New Air Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU statement pointed out that government agreements  
authorize only British Airways and the two Canadian carriers to fly 
direct between Canada and London's Heathrow airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inquiries suggest that potential competitors may experience  
difficulty in obtaining appropriate takeoff and landing rights at 
Heathrow,'' the EU Commission said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Coup Worries Wheat Growers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- For the second time in two years, Pacific  
Northwest wheat growers are worried about losing one of their top 
export markets, Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress exempted wheat exports and other  
agricultural products from the trade sanctions imposed after India 
and Pakistan exploded nuclear weapons. Now the wheat industry fears 
a new ban on wheat exports to Pakistan following last week's 
military coup by Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistan situation ``could be a really big problem,'' said  
Glen Squires, an analyst for the Spokane-based Washington Wheat 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's just kind of in a wait-and-see mode to see what  
happens in Pakistan, and how the U.S. responds,'' Squires said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, which wants Musharraf to restore civilian and  
democratic rule, announced earlier that it would impose new 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. officials have said they have little leverage over  
the new regime because of the heavy sanctions already imposed 
following last year's nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Squires said the waiver that exempted agricultural products from  
the current sanctions expires Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials could decide not to extend the waiver -- thus  
barring wheat exports to Pakistan -- in an attempt to persuade 
Musharraf to restore democracy, Squires said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coup's effects already have been felt in the Northwest. On  
the day news of the coup broke, the price of a bushel of soft white 
wheat sold at Portland, Ore., grain terminals dropped 10 cents, 
Squires said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northwest's wheat industry already is suffering from a  
two-year price slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan blends U.S. soft white wheat with its own domestic  
wheat to make chapati, a flat, thin bread that is a staple in the 
Central Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Pakistan bought 1.3 million tons of Northwest wheat,  
making it the No. 2 buyer of the region's wheat behind Egypt, 
Squires said. Sales to Pakistan totaled about $137 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Pakistan was the Northwest's top wheat customer, buying  
about 37 percent of the region's crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wahl, an associate professor of agricultural economics at  
Washington State University, said Australia's wheat industry has 
been trying to make inroads on the United States' domination of the 
Pakistani market in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia likely would step in to take the United States' place  
if the White House bars wheat exports, Wahl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan has got money, and it's going to get wheat  
somewhere,'' Wahl said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. agricultural interests have increasingly pressured the  
White House and Congress in recent years, arguing that sanctions 
are ineffective and cost jobs at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unilateral embargoes generally only are going to hurt domestic  
producers,'' Wahl said.

<HEADLINE> 'Seinfeld' Co-Creator Does HBO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry David, so misunderstood.  
</P>
<P>
	A funny guy? Sure. ``Seinfeld,'' which he co-created and often  
wrote, proved it. So does ``Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' 
his HBO special premiering Sunday at 10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	But what about the accompanying stigma -- that he's  
mega-neurotic, hypersensitive or simply odd? Where does that kind 
of nonsense get started? 
</P>
<P>
	If a recent interview proves anything, Larry David is in fine  
psychic fettle. For example, even after his triumph with 
``Seinfeld,'' there's no swelled head for him. ``I maybe have just 
a little more confidence in my work now,'' he allows, ``but not 
that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor has his ``Seinfeld'' payday -- a reported $242 million -- made  
a material difference in his world. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do have thoughts occasionally like, 'Holy cow! I have a  
lot of money!''' he admits. ``But it's not like, 'I must be 
great.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 51, David knows exactly who he is: the same as he was a  
long time ago, plus years of experience to seal it. ``I really 
don't think that anything about me has changed since I was, I don't 
know ... 12?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps his biggest life change: the onset of baldness.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I like how I've taken to it,'' he declares with a  
mirthless laugh. ``No toupees. No beard to offset it. I'm quite 
proud of how I've adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I ever did for it was try the Chinese Bald  
Cure. We did an episode about it on the show.'' (That would be 
``Seinfeld'' No. 25, ``The Tape.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``But it actually happened. We asked the guy bringing the  
Chinese food to call China on the phone from my apartment, after we 
tried and couldn't get anybody who spoke English. And the stuff 
came. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worked great.''  
</P>
<P>
	Consider that last remark an exercise of comic license. And  
expect more on ``Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' David's first brush with 
TV since the May 1998 ``Seinfeld'' finale, this is a very funny 
special about Larry David putting together a Larry David special. 
</P>
<P>
	During ``Curb,'' he kvetches to his manager, frets to his wife,  
stews during meetings at HBO, and wonders why he said OK to cameras 
stalking him to get it all. 
</P>
<P>
	On the program, David is a hybrid form of volatile  
impassiveness, someone capable of juggling stubbornness with 
cautious indecision. Meanwhile, as any ``Seinfeld'' fan would 
expect, he has a tendency to deconstruct life's every passing 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	After waiting for his manager to get off the phone, David lodges  
a complaint about the office-greeting policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know I'm in the room, how come you don't pick up your head  
and say, 'One second?''' David asks. ``All you have to do is: `One 
second.''' His right hand cradles an invisible receiver. ``When I'm 
on the phone, I go, `One second.' Or you don't have to SAY `One 
second,' just --'' he hoists the index finger of his other hand -- 
``like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beside such telling glimpses, this ``mockumentary'' includes  
insights from David's friends, Jason Alexander, Richard Lewis and, 
of course, Jerry Seinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of all, it captures him doing stand up for the first time  
in 9 1/2 years (who knew!), seen in snatches from club dates he books 
to steel himself for his big HBO concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who do you think has more freedom -- the married men in America  
or the single men in Communist China?'' he asks the room. ``I gotta 
go for the single guy in Communist China, no contest. I'm a married 
guy in America. I can leave the country -- but I can't leave my 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was David's real-life itch to get back onstage that led to  
this ``Curb Your Enthusiasm'' spoof: Somebody suggested he should 
film his practice sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very reluctantly said, `Oh ... OK,''' recalls David, sipping  
his nonfat decaf cappuccino. ``That's exactly the way I make up my 
mind to do anything: a reluctant OK. I never go, 'Yeah! Great idea! 
Let's do it!' Never. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I thought, `Well, maybe this needs some narrative around  
the stand up.' It became more and more of a comedy film, and less 
and less of a stand-up film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David says he made seven or eight unannounced appearances at  
clubs in Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And how did it feel? ``I was as anxious as I was 10 years ago.''  
</P>
<P>
	So why did he want to go back? Among comedy cognoscenti, David  
is as well-known for his hatred of stand up as for his mastery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated it and loved it, all at the same time,'' he explains.  
``When it goes badly, you have one of two attitudes: either, `Well, 
everyone is stupid, but I'm great,' or, 'People are really smart 
and I stink, I have no talent, what am I doing?' 
</P>
<P>
	``But when it goes well, everyone is brilliant and I'm the  
greatest thing on the planet!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words: David doesn't hesitate to assume that the  
consensus of everyone on Earth is reflected by 100 people in a 
comedy club. ``They're a very representative group,'' he insists. 
``A scientific sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The funny thing is, he's got proof.

<HEADLINE> Delta Airlines Buying Comair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Delta Air Lines said Monday it will buy the  
Comair commuter airline for about $1.8 billion in order to feed 
more travelers from small towns into Delta hub terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta, which already holds 22 percent of Comair, said it will  
offer $23.50 a share for the outstanding shares of Comair Holdings 
Inc., parent of the Comair airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta will also assume $110 million worth of Comair debt in the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Delta hopes to penetrate smaller markets with  
Comair's well established routes for regional flights throughout 
the Midwest and Florida, said Leo Mullin, Delta's president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair has helped its own growth for years by coordinating  
flight schedules with Atlanta-based Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta's move is designed to make the connections more efficient  
and use aircraft of both airlines more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the deal, but it must  
still be approved by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will result in few, if any, job reductions, Delta  
management said. Comair's senior executives are to be absorbed into 
Delta's management and Comair labor agreements remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair is to keep its headquarters in northern Kentucky, and  
retain its separate work force, as well as salary and benefits 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a code-share agreement, Comair has flown customers  
primarily from cities in the Midwest and Florida to Delta's hubs in 
Cincinnati and Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Delta acquired Atlantic Southeast Airlines.  
In September, Delta began a 10-year agreement with Atlantic Coast 
Airlines for exclusive use of 45 regional jets, starting in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Other airlines in the Delta Connection carrier network are  
SkyWest, based in St. George, Utah; Trans States Airlines, in St. 
Louis; Atlantic Coast Airlines, in Dulles, Va.; and Business 
Express, in Dover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Comair offers more than 700 daily flights to 88 cities in 31  
states and three countries through its hubs at Cincinnati/Northern 
Kentucky International Airport and Orlando International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Bears Need More From McNown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Cade McNown played like a rookie, which  
isn't bad considering that's what he is. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chicago Bears needed him to be better than that. They  
needed him to play like a veteran, make a spectacular throw or two, 
win the game and continue the momentum they had with Shane 
Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, folks, don't go anointing him the next Dan Marino yet.  
</P>
<P>
	``We expect so much out of him,'' Bears coach Dick Jauron said  
Monday. ``He performed well for his first start, but not well 
enough to win the game. He can do a lot of things, and he will get 
better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown had some impressive moments in Chicago's 20-16 loss to  
the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. There was the 80-yard touchdown 
pass to Marcus Robinson in the third quarter, the first TD throw of 
his career and the longest by a Bears quarterback since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the second half, when he rallied Chicago for 10 points  
and came a failed fourth down from possibly pulling out the 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	But then there were the rookie moments. Like the interceptions  
on two straight possessions, one of which set up a Philadelphia 
field goal. The four sacks, most for a Bears quarterback this 
season. And, most importantly, the final score, which snapped 
Chicago's two-game winning streak and gave the Eagles their first 
road victory since Dec. 14, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot when you don't win games. I don't want to be in  
that position,'' said McNown, who finished 17-of-33 for 255 yards, 
and rushed for another 23 yards. ``We learned some valuable lessons 
and we'll come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While starting is never easy for a rookie -- look what happened  
to Akili Smith when the Cincinnati Bengals played a good team -- 
McNown was put in an even tougher position with the absence of 
Curtis Conway, Chicago's leading receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway, who has 29 catches for 310 yards and four touchdowns,  
missed Sunday's game with a sprained ankle. He's expected to play 
this week against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown also is left-handed, and the Bears are used to Matthews,  
a right-hander. Sure, he's had at least a series each game, but a 
series or two is a lot different than an entire game. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't the problem, said Bobby Engram, who led the  
Bears with six catches for 59 yards 
</P>
<P>
	``More is made out of that than it should be,'' Engram said.  
``Obviously, the ball is going to rotate differently, but it's all 
about making plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added tight end Alonzo Mayes, ``Cade starting wasn't a major  
adjustment. It was coming out and not being able to be fired up or 
execute the way we wanted to or the way we should have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a perfect, injury-less world, there's no way McNown would  
even be starting. Let the Cleveland Browns play Tim Couch and the 
Bengals play Smith. Jauron wanted to take it easy on his franchise 
quarterback, play him a series or two a game and let him adjust to 
the NFL without getting killed. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Matthews pulled his hamstring at Minnesota, Jauron  
didn't have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a couple of throws that you wouldn't want him to make,  
obviously,'' Jauron said. ``He is just going to get better from 
this. We know who he is and what he is going to be, and those kinds 
of things are going to occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Matthews remains the Bears' starting quarterback, there's  
no telling when he'll be healthy enough to play again. He's 
doubtful for this weekend at Tampa Bay, although he'll be 
reevaluated later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	If McNown has to go again, that's fine, Mayes said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can win with Cade,'' he said. ``It's a learning process for  
all of us, week to week, and Cade is going through the same 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, after all, is what rookies do.

<HEADLINE> After Irene: Crop Cleanup in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe Borek surveyed 70 acres of submerged  
tomato plants and figured he lost more than $210,000 in seedlings, 
labor and equipment in the wake of Hurricane Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	Borek, who farms 500 acres of squash, tomatoes, pole beans and  
tube peppers, was one of many growers, nursery owners and seasonal 
workers who took stock of the damage over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've rode through this whole county,'' Borek said Sunday.  
``The man that thinks he's got something left -- well, he doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The total agricultural loss could reach about $100 million in  
Miami-Dade County, said Mayor Alex Penelas. The county has about 58 
percent row crops; 25 percent tropical fruits, such as limes, 
avocados, lychees and mangos; and 17 percent horticultural 
nurseries, according to a 1992 study by the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, which dumped as much as 18 inches of rain, will set  
farmers back this season even if no additional rains hinder 
recovery of flooded fruit and vegetable fields, said Borek. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could get hold of the fellow that bought the Brooklyn  
Bridge, I'd try to sell him some waterfront property,'' said 
Richard Alger of Alger Farms, where he and his son grow sweet corn 
and potatoes and have a field nursery. 
</P>
<P>
	Sebanos Torres was supervising about a dozen seasonal workers at  
a muddy avocado grove owned by Acosta Farms Nurseries Inc. They 
were boxing the dark green fruit that had been blown from the 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in galoshes and wielding a machete to cut away damaged  
tree limbs, Torres said workers must first pick through the 
approximately 45-acre grove before company officials can determine 
how bad the losses were. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday the water was up to here,'' he said, pointing to  
just below his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agricultural damage in southern Florida, which supplies 75  
percent of the nation's winter produce, was not limited to 
southeastern Miami-Dade. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sugar Corp.'s Bryant Sugar processing mill in Palm Beach  
County suffered $4 million in damage when Irene's winds destroyed 
two cooling towers and ripped down walls, said Robert Buker, Jr., 
senior vice president of the Clewiston-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	It is too early to tell how much of a loss the company sustained  
to its 180,000 acres of sugar cane, he said, adding that the 
harvest had already been delayed because of September rains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will hurt our bottom line by millions'' of dollars, said  
Buker. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sugar also grows oranges in neighboring Hendry County. The  
company lost about 500,000 boxes of oranges -- a box weighs 90 
pounds -- or about 10 percent of its orange crop, Buker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach officials at the state Department of Citrus on  
Sunday were unsuccessful and a message left with Florida Citrus 
Mutual, a growers' trade group in Lakeland, was not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frank Dunnahoe, president of Dundee Citrus Growers  
Association, a growers' trade group in Polk County, estimated that 
between 15 and 25 percent of Florida's citrus crop could be ruined 
by Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when farm lands eventually dry, many farmers and growers  
will have financial difficulty the rest of the season because they 
rely on revenues from early-season crops to finance new crop 
planting, said Borek. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to go back to square one,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reebok Admits Poor Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Reebok is blowing the whistle on itself for poor  
working conditions at its factories in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletic shoe company, known for giving out annual human  
rights awards, said an independent study found health and safety 
problems. It also said that many workers didn't understand their 
rights or workplace policies and that women aren't getting adequate 
opportunities for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers suffered rashes from harsh chemicals, and pregnant  
women had to stand or sit on uncomfortable stools with no back 
support. The women also had to work around chemicals that could 
cause nausea and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoughton-based Reebok International Ltd. said it ordered the  
report in an effort to improve working conditions at its factories 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that this will also break through and encourage more  
companies to do something like this,'' said Sharon Cohen, executive 
vice president for human rights. ``We have nothing to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reebok paid $35,000 for the report, which led to more than  
$500,000 in factory improvements, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reebok owns none of its own factories, relying instead on a  
network of subcontractors. Reebok is supplied by five factories in 
Indonesia, and it also buys products made in China, Thailand, 
Vietnam and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights activists have long worried about labor conditions  
in developing countries that make American clothing. Nike has come 
under attack for alleged abuses at its shoe factories. Activists 
have also charged that Kathi Lee Gifford's clothing line is 
produced in sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
	Medea Benjamin, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based labor  
rights group Global Exchange, said Reebok's report was more 
thorough and candid than a 1997 Nike report on alleged abuses at 
its foreign factories. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we've been asking the companies to do, be honest,  
be open and be public. I think it's great that Reebok did this,'' 
Ms. Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Nike report on Vietnamese factory conditions was  
conducted by former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, workers' rights 
advocates called the investigation a sham and a guided tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reebok report was prepared after a 14-month study of the  
factories by Insan Hitawasana Sejahtera, a Jakarta consulting firm. 
Researchers reviewed factory records, conducted surveys and 
confidential interviews, observed working procedures and inspected 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The study noted that workers at two Jakarta-area factories, run  
by the firms PT Dong Joe Indonesia and PT Tong Yang Indonesia, 
frequently were not fully informed about policies regarding wages, 
overtime and promotions. Although women made up more than 80 
percent of the work force, they were far less likely to hold 
supervisory positions.

<HEADLINE> Census Might Revise Poverty Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Census Bureau, in revising its definition of  
U.S. poverty, is experimenting with a formula that would send 
millions more families below the poverty line, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new formula, for a family of four to be considered  
above the poverty line, their annual income would have to be 
$19,500 a year, instead of the current $16,600 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would make 46 million Americans, 17 percent of the  
population, poor. Last month, only 12.7 percent were considered 
poor, the lowest level in almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The current poverty formula was created during President Lyndon  
B. Johnson's administration and has not changed since 1965 except 
for inflation adjustments. The new poverty measure is an attempt to 
determine what poor people spend on food, clothing, housing and 
extras, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is certainly our opinion, and the opinion of every  
researcher we have talked to, that something should be done to 
update the poverty measure,'' said Edward Welniak, the Census 
Bureau's chief of income statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher poverty line would mean a rise in government spending  
to pay for benefits such for the poor, such as food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the White House, which would have to authorize the  
change in the poverty formula, said a few more years of work needs 
to be done before poverty can be redefined.

<HEADLINE> Helms May Block Moseley-Braun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, whose opposition has sunk  
both treaties and nominations, took aim Monday at former colleague 
Carol Moseley-Braun's bid to be ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	An Illinois Democrat who was the nation's first black female  
senator, Moseley-Braun comes to the Senate for confirmation under 
``an ethical cloud,'' asserted Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms clashed with Moseley-Braun during her one term in  
Congress, most memorably on the Senate floor over use of the 
Confederate Flag. She later accused Helms of taunting her in an 
elevator by singing ``Dixie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative, combative committee chairman suggested his  
panel would scrutinize allegations raised in Moseley-Braun's 1998 
re-election campaign, including never-proved ones that she used 
1993 campaign funds to pay for personal luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats suggested Helms was giving Moseley-Braun a hard time  
to settle an old score. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he won't do that,'' President Clinton told reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called it yet another sign of ``a new isolationism in  
this country, that we don't really care whether we have ambassadors 
in some of these places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president made similar ``isolationism'' accusations last  
week when the Senate turned down a nuclear test ban treaty that he 
had championed. That Senate action drew condemnation from around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms was a leading foe of the test ban treaty and contributed  
to its defeat by refusing to hold hearings for two years. He also 
torpedoed the 1997 nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. William 
Weld to be ambassador to Mexico by refusing to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Helms announced in a statement that he would hold  
hearings on Moseley-Braun to ``examine serious charges of ethical 
misconduct in her past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Charges of ethical lapses led the voters of Illinois to  
determine she was not fit to represent them in the U.S. Senate,'' 
Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it turns out in the course of those hearings that all these  
reports are false, the committee will consider her nomination,'' 
Helms said. Clinton had announced the nomination on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also cited ``reports in the New Zealand press'' suggesting  
that the government of New Zealand was concerned and had ``appealed 
to the Senate to examine her record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand officials denied that was the case. ``The New  
Zealand government has certainly never asked for any sort of probe 
at all,'' said James Funnell, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade. ``Her -- Ms. Moseley-Braun's -- name was put 
forward and we agreed to it. Full stop. That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun did not return a message left at her Chicago home.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the  
Foreign Relations Committee, ``will work to see that she is 
confirmed and he is confident that when all is said and done, she 
will be confirmed,'' said Biden spokesman Chris Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	It is rare for a senator to oppose the nomination of a former  
member. The last time the Senate rejected the nomination of one of 
its own was in 1989, when it turned down President Bush's 
nomination of former Sen. John Tower, a Texas Republican, to be 
defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun lost her re-election bid to Republican Peter  
Fitzgerald. In addition to the allegations of misuse of 1993 
campaign funds, she was criticized for a 1996 visit to a Nigerian 
dictator. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, she led a successful effort to reject legislation  
by Helms that would have granted the United Daughters of the 
Confederacy a renewed patent on an insignia featuring the 
Confederate Stars and Bars, the original Confederate Flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun called it a cruel reminder that blacks were once  
``human chattel'' in America. 
</P>
<P>
	She later recounted a meeting in a Senate elevator between  
herself, Helms and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. She said when she got 
on, Helms started to sing the song ``Dixie'' and told Hatch: ``I'm 
going to sing 'Dixie' to her until she cries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Helms and Hatch portrayed the episode as a  
good-natured exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' objections to the nomination were first reported by  
Congressional Quarterly magazine and Roll Call, a twice-weekly 
Capitol Hill newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got so many problems, that I would not suggest you hold  
your breath waiting for her to be reported out,'' Congressional 
Quarterly quoted Helms as saying in the publication's ``Daily 
Monitor.''

<HEADLINE> Snyder Denies Naming Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder on  
Monday denied a report that he had concluded a record deal to sell 
the naming rights to Redskins Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today columnist Larry King wrote the Redskins had sold the  
naming rights in a 27-year deal worth $189 million. King did not 
name the sponsor, saying only that Snyder had told him that it was 
not northern Virginia-based America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I even said that to Larry,'' Snyder said. ``I  
don't think we've said anything to Larry. I don't know where that 
came from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since purchasing the team in July, Snyder has been negotiating  
with several corporations eager to put a name on the 2-year-old 
facility formerly known as Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. Snyder gave no 
timetable for an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, everyone knows we're working on doing a naming  
rights transaction,'' Snyder said. ``But I'm not going to comment 
on any speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder made the comments at a luncheon held by the Fairfax  
County Chamber of Commerce. Guest speaker Paul Tagliabue, who next 
week marks his 10th anniversary as NFL commissioner, assured fans 
that the Redskins and Dallas Cowboys will probably remain in the 
same division when the league undergoes realignment in 2002 with 
the addition of Houston as the 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most owners I've talked to see Dallas and Washington in the  
same division,'' Tagliabue said. ``They see Buffalo and Miami in 
the same division. In some cases, you might have to a make an 
ad-hoc judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue also speculated about the future of the league,  
imagining a day when games are broadcast live on the Internet in 
the United States. He said games are already available on the Web 
this season in Austria, the Netherlands and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at what's going on with other business, you can  
see the expectation that the Internet's going to be a primary 
channel of distribution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said Snyder would be one of the owners who would lead  
the way for such innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have great young talent at the ownership level,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Films Battle for Box Office Title / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy'' held onto first place at  
the weekend box office by a dangling thread -- although two 
newcomers could end up on top when final weekend numbers are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' took in $10.5 million over the weekend,  
according to industry estimates released Sunday. Final figures were 
to be available today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Story of Us,'' Rob Reiner's romantic comedy starring  
Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis, debuted with $10.4 million, and 
the ultra-violent ``Fight Club,'' with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, 
opened with $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary figures were based on box office receipts  
studios gather from theaters for Friday and Saturday, plus 
projections for Sunday ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are estimates,'' said Tom Sherak, head of distribution  
for 20th Century Fox, which released ``Fight Club.'' ``You can't 
project how many people are going to the movies until they go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bucksbaum of box-office tracker Reel Source Inc., which  
does its own projections based on surveys of theater chains, said 
he thinks ``Fight Club'' will come out on top when final numbers 
are reported. ``Story of Us'' probably will come in second and 
``Double Jeopardy'' third, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means so much that a studio can promote a movie as No. 1,''  
Bucksbaum said. ``You can promote that for the next week, and it 
does make a difference at the box office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Story of Us'' might wind up as No. 1 because it plays well to  
older women, who were more likely to hit theaters on Sunday, said 
Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which released the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Lewellen, distribution president for Paramount, said the  
studio's Sunday estimates for ``Double Jeopardy'' were based on the 
film's box-office pattern over the last three weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in the market long enough to predict our grosses,''  
Lewellen said. ``Certainly, it's a projection at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Fight Club,'' Pitt and Norton lead a band of dissatisfied  
men who gather in bloody male bonding sessions to pummel one 
another in barefisted brawls. Their violence eventually expands 
beyond fistfights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy,'' starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones,  
tells the story of a woman bent on revenge against her husband, who 
faked his death and framed her for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether No. 1 or not, the film has grossed $80.6 million in 24  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Double Jeopardy' does continue to roll along,'' said Paul  
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie 
ticket sales. ``That genre of a revenge-seeking woman has really 
caught on in a big way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' edged near the  
quarter-billion-dollar mark in its 11-week run. ``Sixth Sense'' 
took in $5.2 million to raise its total gross to $249.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations. Final figures 
were to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $10.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Story of Us,'' $10.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Fight Club,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Three Kings,'' $7.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``American Beauty,'' $6.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Random Hearts,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Superstar,'' $5.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Blue Streak,'' $3.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Omega Code, $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler, Peugeot Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG and France's  
Peugeot Citroen SA confirmed Monday that they are talking about 
sharing technology, but dismissed a report that said they might buy 
into each other's companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The French and German-U.S. carmakers said the talks involve  
Peugeot supplying a small-car chassis to DaimlerChrysler. Analysts 
have speculated in recent weeks that DaimlerChrysler may use the 
platform for a new, four-door version of its Smart mini-car, which 
is built in France and available only in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	A Peugeot spokeswoman in Paris said the talks are exclusively on  
``technical cooperation'' and that ``capital links'' are not on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler spokesman in Stuttgart, Enrico Mueller, also  
said the talks concerned platforms, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The business daily Handelsblatt reported Monday that  
DaimlerChrysler was interested in cooperating on small cars with 
either Peugeot or Italy's Fiat SpA. The newspaper said an outright 
acquisition of either carmaker was highly unlikely, but that the 
cooperation could include sharing parts or buying stakes in each 
other's companies. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified DaimlerChrysler manager was quoted by the  
newspaper as saying a decision could be made at the next 
DaimlerChrysler supervisory board meeting Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller would not comment on the rest of the report, which he  
dismissed as speculative. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat has repeatedly said it will not sell its passenger car  
operations. The Italian automaker is nevertheless a potential 
partner since it has recently been seeking ways to strengthen its 
business, including joint ventures and shareholdings with other car 
manufacturers, Handelsblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, which sells mainly Mercedes luxury cars in  
Europe, is under pressure to expand its small-car offerings to meet 
its target of improving its average fleet mileage. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 it introduced its first small Mercedes, the A Class. It  
also hopes to expand the year-old Smart car line to improve lagging 
sales as well as introduce smaller Chrysler models in Europe as 
part of its strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of all three automakers were down in early European  
trading. Analysts said that the French and Italian companies were 
potentially good candidates for a pact with DaimlerChrysler, but 
that the German-U.S. automaker was still dealing with too many 
issues related to its own merger.

<HEADLINE> Kin of Japanese Novelist Seek Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- An author must pay $47,000 to the heirs of Yukio  
Mishima for publishing letters from the Japanese novelist without 
their consent, a court ordered on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Bungei Shunju Ltd. and Jiro Fukushima, who claims to  
have been Mishima's lover, were ordered to pay $23,600 each to 
Mishima's adult children, Noriko Tomita and Iichiro Hiraoka, who 
inherited the rights to Mishima's work, Kyodo News agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the publisher and the court rang unanswered Monday  
night, and a call to Fukushima was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo District Court also ordered the publisher to stop  
printing the book, ``Yukio Mishima -- Sword and Winter Red,'' the 
story of the relationship between Mishima and Fukushima. It 
includes 15 letters from Mishima to Fukushima. 
</P>
<P>
	Presiding Judge Toshiaki Iimura ruled that the letters were  
literary works protected by copyright law and their publication 
violated the right to protect Mishima's image. 
</P>
<P>
	The publisher will appeal, said Hideki Amemiya, head of Bungei  
Shunju's presidential office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bungei Shunju sold about 90,000 copies of the book, and recalled  
about 10,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mishima is considered one of Japan's foremost modern writers.  
His works include the autobiographical ``Confessions of a Mask,'' 
``The Sound of Waves'' and ``The Temple of the Golden Pavilion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A right-wing nationalist, he committed ritual suicide in 1970  
after urging soldiers to revolt against Japan's U.S.-written 
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Boston Cops Beef Up Fenway Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There were plenty of taunts but no reported  
trouble Monday night at Fenway Park where a beefed-up security 
presence was in place to prevent a repeat of the ruckus that 
temporarily halted Game 4 of the ALCS on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans booed the umpires while they were introduced and took the  
field for Game 5 between the Boston Red Sox and the New York 
Yankees, paying no attention to a videotaped plea from Red Sox star 
Nomar Garciaparra to be ``courteous'' and ``respectful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans brought signs that read: ``Dump the Umps!''  
</P>
<P>
	But there weren't any problems Monday night as the Yankees won  
6-1 to take the best-of-7 series five game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there was one problem at all,'' Red Sox  
spokesman Kevin Shea said of Monday night's game. ``Last night, 
there was a handful of people who acted inappropriately. Today 
everybody was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blown calls against the Red Sox in the eighth and ninth innings  
of Game 4 sparked an outburst by some Fenway fans who hurled 
debris, boos and insults at the umpires and Yankee players. 
</P>
<P>
	When umpire Dale Scott called Garciaparra out at first base on a  
close play in the ninth, Red Sox manager Jimy Williams sprang from 
the dugout to argue, and was ejected by Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans reacted with a stream of bottles, cups and other debris,  
prompting the umpires to clear the Yankees from the field and 
bullpen -- a move that halted play for eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston fans Bryan Fuller and Lauren Cooperstein showed up  
wearing dark glasses and using canes to guide them along -- their 
version of blind umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	They carried a sign that said: ``I could be an umpire, too.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The odds and the gods were already against us. We didn't need  
the malevolent umpires we had,'' 28-year-old Cooperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Harrington, the team's chief operating officer, pinned the  
disturbance on just a few of the thousands attending the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A very small group in a crowd of more than 33,000 people  
behaved outrageously, inappropriately and uncharacteristically for 
Red Sox fans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Kevin Jones, a Boston police spokesman, said he knew of  
no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have 36,000 fans there, and a lot of them are standing  
up,'' he said. ``It's hard to identify the person who is 
throwing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams denied Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's assertion  
that his actions in arguing with the umpires incited fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Georgie Porgie speaks, I don't listen, I didn't incite  
the fans,'' Williams said. ``But what they did last night is not 
the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Hallinan, baseball's executive director of security, said  
the problem Sunday developed when police left the ballpark before 
the end of the game to handle crowd and traffic control outside the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were directed to stay inside the park as long as needed  
Monday night to make sure it was secure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Thomas Menino said the unruly fans shamed the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``The inappropriate behavior demonstrated last night by a  
handful of Red Sox fans was an embarrassment to the city of 
Boston,'' he said. ``That was not what Boston is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said he didn't mind the taunts  
Saturday of Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, but said fans shouldn't 
have chanted, ``Just Say No!'' on Sunday at Darryl Strawberry, who 
has battled drug and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``What went on with Darryl Strawberry yesterday I thought was  
over the line. I didn't think that was right,'' Torre said. ``Watch 
TV, go to the movies, listen to the radio. Everything's down now. 
There are no barriers at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Herald columnist Michael Gee called the fan conduct ``a  
disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A certain number of the 33,596 fans at Fenway Park couldn't  
hold their liquor. Or maybe they were born pigs,'' he wrote. ``Each 
and every person reading this should be ashamed for what some of 
his neighbors did last night. If you love sports, you should be 
sickened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Globe sports writer Dan Shaughnessy described the game as ``a  
hail of errors, bad umpiring, and worse conduct by Boston fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary,'' he wrote. ``Police were unable to stop dozens  
of unruly spectators from tossing things and the reigning world 
champion Yankees cleared the field while officials weighed the 
merits of resuming the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Yankees' wives were escorted from Fenway Park by police  
after Sunday night's game, Hallinan said there were no incidents 
involving them, although there was taunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the nature of the beast,'' he said. ``The wives are  
cheering when the other fans are not. It's not out of hand and was 
fairly good natured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallinan also said the Red Sox security official who got into a  
shouting match with Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson apologized to the 
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys, Giants Set for Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Troy Aikman doesn't want to hear  
anything about the New York Giants being in turmoil. The Dallas 
Cowboys quarterback has already heard it all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants' offense is struggling, quarterbacks are playing  
musical chairs, their defense is miffed that it has worked so hard 
for nothing and the team is heading toward a second straight 
disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Put it all together and the Cowboys (3-1) should have no problem  
handing the Giants (2-3) another Monday night mauling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be willing to bet Philadelphia was a little divided  
last week, too,'' Aikman said sarcastically as he reminded everyone 
that the then-winless Eagles overcame their problems to beat Dallas 
13-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you don't like to see any team divided,'' Aikman  
said. ``I have been in those situations earlier in my career, and 
it is very frustrating. But I don't think that that necessarily 
means that they are not going to go out and play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys have their own problems to worry about. They will be  
without receiver Michael Irvin for an undetermined period because 
of a neck and spine injury sustained in last week's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Mills and Wane McGarity will replace him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in the guys that are going in and playing,  
but at the same time, any time you lose a player of Michael's 
stature, you lose something off your football team,'' Cowboys coach 
Chan Gailey said. ``It will have an impact. How much of an impact 
remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants are a troubled team coming into the game. The offense  
has struggled since opening weekend, and that's taking a toll on 
the defense, which has played well enough to win four games. 
</P>
<P>
	After last week's 14-3 loss at Arizona, the defenders were so  
angry that coach Jim Fassel came close to having a civil war in his 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooler heads prevailed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about the team,'' said center Brian Williams, who  
is expected to return to the lineup after missing the Cardinals 
game with a hand injury. ``We got a lot of things out in the open 
earlier on. We know what we have to do, but obviously we have to go 
out and execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Kent Graham, who missed the Arizona game with a  
concussion, will return to the starting lineup. Kerry Collins 
struggled in his start last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead hasn't noticed any outward  
changes in the offense this week. It has always been an emotionless 
group, and the rift with the defense didn't change that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all got to wait and see,'' Armstead said. ``I don't know  
what will happen. I don't know if the gun is going to shoot forward 
or shoot back. Too much attention can help you or hurt you. It 
might make a guy realize that the spotlight is on, and if it's on 
you, you can't hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants have never beaten Dallas in six Monday night games.  
The Cowboys won 31-7 last year to keep the record perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I start worrying about that stuff, it will make me  
nervous,'' Fassel said. ``The bottom line is it's prime time, and 
we have to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmitt Smith of Dallas comes into the game leading the NFC in  
rushing with 409 yards. Giants receiver Amani Toomer is tied for 
the conference lead with 29 receptions.

<HEADLINE> Boise St., La. Tech Make League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With an eye toward regional balance and adding  
more football bowl games, the Western Athletic Conference announced 
Monday that Boise State and Louisiana Tech will be joining the 
league in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The WAC was forced to once again reinvent itself after Texas  
Christian bolted for Conference USA last week. That defection came 
only months after after eight teams left to form the Mountain West. 
</P>
<P>
	School presidents of the remaining seven schools -- plus Nevada,  
which is joining the WAC next summer -- met over the weekend and 
debated whether the league should have eight, 10 or 12 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	They opted for 10 because it would allow the WAC to remain one  
division, while also making sure it could handle future departures. 
Southern Methodist was ready to join C-USA, too, but wasn't 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this configuration gives us the best chance to have  
stability,'' Hawaii president Ken Mortimer, the chairman of the 
league's board of directors, said Monday in a conference call. ``In 
my opinion, the WAC most needs stability so it can get on with 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fourth reconfiguration of the WAC announced this  
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	After going with nine teams from 1980-92, the WAC spent four  
years with 10 teams and two years with 16. The league has eight 
members this school year and will go to nine when Nevada joins next 
year. Losing TCU while adding Boise State and Louisiana Tech will 
boost the WAC to 10 teams in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Boise State, currently in the Big West, will give the WAC five  
Western teams, joining Fresno State, San Jose State, Nevada and 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech, a football independent and a basketball member  
of the Sun Belt Conference, will be part of the ``eastern'' half of 
the league with Rice, SMU, Tulsa and Texas-El Paso. UTEP is a bit 
forced into that grouping considering it's in the Mountain time 
zone, but the link to other Texas schools makes it work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel like one of the WAC's greatest attributions will  
be our geographical diversity,'' commissioner Karl Benson said. ``I 
think we have a great mixture of urban and semi-rural type 
universities, with some great destinations with Reno and 
Honolulu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the expansion candidates not picked included Idaho, New  
Mexico State, North Texas, Arkansas State and other Louisiana 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	They were left out because they didn't offer the same proximity  
to postseason bowl games as Boise State and Louisiana Tech. The 
Humanitarian Bowl is played in Boise and Louisiana Tech is in 
Ruston, La., not far from games in Mobile, Ala., and Shreveport, 
La. 
</P>
<P>
	Boise State already has promised the WAC a spot in the  
Humanitarian Bowl beginning with the 2000 game, even though it 
won't join the league until the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That obviously is part of the membership arrangement with  
Boise State,'' Benson said. ``With Boise State in the Big West in 
the year 2000, I think it's logical to assume it would be a WAC vs. 
Big West game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the WAC champion will be headed to the Las Vegas  
Bowl, with the Mobile Bowl getting its choice of the remaining 
schools. One-year deals with both games expire after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2000, the WAC had a deal with the Silicon Valley Football  
Classic in San Jose, Calif., plus the Humanitarian Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to pursue both Mobile and Las Vegas for the  
future,'' Benson said. ``Louisiana Tech gives us greater access to 
the Independence Bowl and Mobile. We hope in time we'll be able to 
take advantage of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Benson admitted the bowl links were big, he didn't want  
the expansion invitations viewed as strictly a football deal. 
Louisiana Tech is a premiere women's basketball power, and that 
also was a factor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there certainly was a need to address expansion in  
terms of what it could do for the future football success of the 
WAC,'' Benson said. ``But to say it's strictly a football decision 
would be an exaggeration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benson said that although Louisiana Tech is a football  
independent, trying to add the program next season would be too 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	As for football scheduling in a 10-team league, schools will  
play all rivals in their area and some from the other side. 
However, Benson was adamant that ``we're not looking at this as two 
five-team divisions under any circumstances.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Garrett Morris, one of the founding cast  
members of ``Saturday Night Live,'' says he found success in show 
business by imagining where he wanted to be in life. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris told Dillard University students Saturday they should  
spend 20 minutes each day picturing themselves with perfect, 4.0 
grade-point averages. But he said they'll also need a passionate 
drive to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagery is no excuse for not working,'' said Morris, a New  
Orleans native and 1958 Dillard graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris accepted one of the school's ``Excellence and Heritage''  
awards. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Browns Have Trouble Holding Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- With a low-risk passing game, the Cleveland  
Browns balanced the stat sheet at Jacksonville and even helped 
rookie quarterback Tim Couch break a 42-year-old club record. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cleveland's entire season has been a broken record: improve  
but lose, improve but lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's 24-7 defeat to the Jaguars marked the third straight  
week Cleveland had the lead at halftime but couldn't hold it. And 
once again, a game that for three quarters was winnable became 
another close loss as the Browns fell to 0-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things,'' fullback Marc Edwards said Monday.  
``We're like a little kid trying to ride a bike. You keep trying 
and trying, and eventually you just do it. That's how we have to 
approach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, at least the Browns have been able to take their training  
wheels off. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which has improved each week and looks nothing like  
the team beaten 43-0 by Pittsburgh in Week 1, played its best 
offensive game this season against the NFL's top-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns rushed for a season-high 113 yards and Couch,  
throwing shorter passes than usual, finished 18-of-23 for 161 yards 
and one TD. His 110.3 rating set a club rookie passing mark, 
eclipsing Milt Plum's 106.3 rating in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch went 12-of-14 in the first half, but the Browns' offense  
continually bogged down once it crossed midfield and Cleveland only 
led 7-6 at halftime despite outplaying the heavily favored Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the second half, and a familiar horror story for the  
Browns, who have been outscored 77-19 after halftime this year and 
37-3 in October by New England, Cincinnati and Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars made the necessary defensive adjustments, and when  
Cleveland running back Terry Kirby fumbled late in the third 
quarter, Jacksonville capitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what good teams do, a painful lesson the Browns are  
having drilled into them each week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always one or two plays each game where we can go back  
and if it was different, we would have won two or three games this 
year already,'' Couch said. ``We've got to get over that hump. And 
when something goes wrong, we've got to learn how to deal with 
adversity a little better. Not get so down when something bad 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So why can't the Browns put together four quarters of football?  
</P>
<P>
	One reason may be that teams are taking Cleveland lightly,  
thinking they can roll over the NFL's only winless team and not 
waking up until half. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is that teams are adjusting to the Browns better than  
the Browns are adjusting to their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe the bottom line is that the Browns just aren't good  
enough to put anyone away yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been winning at halftime the past couple of weeks and we  
have momentum going into the third quarter and then something 
happens where it kind of stops us,'' said rookie wideout Darrin 
Chiaverini, who had a breakout game with five receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer said it's simple why the Browns can't  
finish the job and get win No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Execution,'' he said. ``They (Jaguars) did the same thing in  
the second half that they did in the first half. The thing that was 
different was that we fumbled the ball and we got into some 
penalties and sacks that hurt us. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 40 minutes we were in pretty good shape, but it's the next  
18 that drove you nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a rookie head coach who endured a similar building  
process with a young team as an assistant in New England, said the 
losses are getting tougher to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a coach it hurts,'' he said. ``We're in a profession that  
you want to win. The fact that we're competing with teams like that 
(Jacksonville) is a positive sign but we're not in a business of 
just competing. We're in a business of trying to win football 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It won't get any easier for the Browns either. This week,  
they're at unbeaten St. Louis, a game that before the season 
started looked like a possible win. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rams have been drilling people all year long,'' Edwards  
said. ``They're on a real high. They're on a real streak. And who 
knows? Maybe we can go in there and steal one from them.''

<HEADLINE> Census Might Revise Poverty Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A panel of government agencies is studying how  
the nation measures poverty and whether that definition needs 
updating. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the Census Bureau issues annual poverty reports,  
calculating the number of families that fall below an income 
formula established decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Changing the formula -- and the things that are counted as income  
-- could greatly increase or reduce the number of people listed in 
poverty, a decision sure to draw political fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible new poverty definitions are under study by an  
interagency panel, headed by the Office of Management and Budget, 
the Census Bureau's Kathleen Short said. OMB established the 
current poverty measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Included on the panel are representatives from Census, the  
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Housing and Urban Development, 
Department of Agriculture and other agencies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their effort was prompted by a report by the National Academy of  
Sciences, said Edward Welniak, chief of income and poverty 
statistics at the Census Bureau. Welniak said the goal is to 
improve the measure of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to redefining the poverty threshold itself, which  
could increase the number of people considered poor, the Census 
Bureau has also studied for several years whether to include all or 
part of non-cash benefits as income for the poor, a change that 
could reduce the number in poverty. Among the non-cash benefits 
studied were housing assistance, food stamps and energy subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences recommended that in redefining  
poverty, family income be calculated by including the value of 
food, housing and energy assistance programs and subtracting 
work-related and childcare expenses, taking account of taxes and 
subtracting medical out-of-pocket expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Using this method would have raised the poverty rate to 14.6  
percent of families from the official 1998 rate of 12.7 percent. 
Using alternative methods of valuing child care could raise it even 
higher, to 15.2 percent in one case and 14.7 percent in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, the panel has found, considering in-kind benefits as  
income can substantially reduce the incidence of poverty, while 
accounting for expenses such as work-related child care can 
substantially increase the rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The current poverty formula was created during President Lyndon  
B. Johnson's administration and has not changed since 1965 except 
for inflation adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher poverty line would mean a rise in government spending  
to pay for benefits for the poor, such as food stamps.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Rail Warning Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Monday it will use the  
case of a man killed in a railroad crossing accident to clarify 
when railroads can be sued over allegedly inadequate warning 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision in the Tennessee case, expected by late June, could  
have far-ranging impact -- there are about 260,000 grade-level rail 
crossings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal by Norfolk Southern Railway Co. argues that federal  
law pre-empts state court lawsuits if a crossing sign was financed 
with federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts ordered the railroad to pay $430,765 to the widow  
of Eddie Shanklin, who was killed Oct. 3, 1993, when his car was 
struck by a train at a crossing in Gibson County, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The crossing had a reflectorized sign but no gates or flashing  
lights to signal a train's approach. Shanklin was driving at 20 
mph, and he apparently did not hear the train whistle because his 
windows were rolled up, the heater was on and the radio was 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedra Shanklin's lawsuit against Norfolk Southern invoked  
Tennessee law and said the railroad failed to install adequate 
warning devices. The railroad sought to have the case dismissed 
because the crossing warning sign was erected under a state project 
approved and financed by the Federal Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A state judge let the trial go forward, however, and a jury  
ordered the railroad to pay her $430,765 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that verdict. The  
appeals court said federal law pre-empts lawsuits over federally 
financed rail crossings only when Federal Highway Administration 
officials approved warning signs without gates or flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has provided money to the states to  
improve railroad crossings since 1973, and government figures show 
the number of fatalities in rail-crossing accidents dropped from 
about 1,500 in 1972 to 461 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the fact that a crossing sign was  
federally funded is not enough to pre-empt a lawsuit filed under 
state law, particularly because there is no right to sue under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said a finding that lawsuits are pre-empted  
would relieve the railroad ``of any responsibility for the types of 
warning devices at a particular crossing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal granted Supreme Court review, Norfolk Southern's  
lawyers said railroads should not be responsible for safety devices 
chosen by the state and funded by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad's lawyers said the federal government's  
authorization of money for warning signs without automatic gates 
and lights amounts to a decision that the signs are sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shanklin's lawyer said federal standards required automatic  
gates and flashing lights at crossings similar to the one where her 
husband's accident occurred.

<HEADLINE> Web Sites Offering Luxury Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shoppers are buying lots of books, videos and  
toys on the Internet these days, but are they ready to purchase 
diamond necklaces or designer suits online? 
</P>
<P>
	The test may come this holiday season. Dozens of Web sites --  
from traditional retailers to startups -- are flooding the 
marketplace with all sorts of luxury goods, including Prada 
pocketbooks and Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting people to actually click on the ``buy'' button --  
especially from e-tailers they've never heard of -- may be tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selling luxury goods online is nothing like selling most other  
things on the Web,'' said Michael May, an analyst at the Internet 
research firm Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got the issue of what is real and what is a knockoff  
... the issue of price, with some sites discounting and others that 
don't,'' he said. ``But that doesn't mean shoppers won't buy 
expensive stuff online. They just may proceed with caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The luxury goods market is already big business in the  
traditional retailing world. Sales last year totaled $133 billion 
as the robust economy and surging stock market helped encourage 
shoppers to buy expensive clothing and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Many expect luxury sales to eventually flourish on the Internet,  
given the potential for a vastly increased selection and the high 
incomes of those who buy online. About a quarter of the 38 million 
U.S. households that were online last year made more than $75,000 a 
year. That's about a third more than the average American 
household, according to Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	But demand for upscale products online so far has been fairly  
small. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is still new. When someone is first going online,  
they won't buy a diamond ring, but I think that as shoppers become 
more comfortable with the Web, they will be more willing to go for 
the higher-priced stuff,'' said Seema Williams, an analyst at 
Forrester Research, an Internet research firm in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Believing that the online luxury market will soon take off, many  
merchants have opened stores selling just high-end goods on the Web 
in the last year. This month alone, more than a dozen companies are 
launching new or redesigned Web sites, just in time for the start 
of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many see big profits since the markup on luxury goods is  
significant, which means they can make more on each item sold than 
those merchants selling smaller ticket items such as books or toys. 
</P>
<P>
	As the category expands, however, there is increasing concern  
about how the Internet will change the luxury business. Since 
shoppers can scour the Web for the best deals, many merchants and 
manufacturers worry how that will affect pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there is virtually no way to control counterfeit  
goods and it is sometimes hard to differentiate Web sites selling 
fakes from those offering legitimate products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough. You don't want someone selling a Prada pocketbook  
for next to nothing or selling a fake Prada,'' said May, the 
Jupiter analyst. ``When that happens, the notion of luxury becomes 
a commodity and the business model crumbles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Epstein, of Laguna Beach, Calif., says she buys expensive  
things online only at Web sites with reputable names. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be terrible if I spent lots of money on something  
like a Louis Vuitton purse, and it ended up not being real,'' she 
said. ``That makes me think twice before buying online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the luxury space getting more crowded, analysts point to a  
few sites that will give shoppers fair pricing and quality 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	One is neimanmarcus.com, which is expected to be launched by the  
venerable retailer Neiman Marcus on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers will find more than 500 items on neimanmarcus.com --  
from many top-of-the-line designers, including Gucci and Donna 
Karan -- and the inventory is expected to grow in the coming months. 
Live customer service is available on the site as is a unique 
merchandising service that helps shoppers match clothes and 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes neimanmarcus.com stand out is its link to its already  
reputable stores and catalog. Every item is guaranteed and 
returnable. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also laud Internet startup Ashford.com, which currently  
sells 10,000 different styles of watches, fragrances, leather 
accessories, sunglasses and writing instruments, including goods 
from Rolex, TAG Heuer and Cartier. On Monday, it is expected to 
announce it will begin selling designer jewelry and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchandise is discounted. Every item it sells is  
guaranteed to be authentic and there is a 30-day money back 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleasantly surprised at the experience I had at  
Ashford.com,'' said Dan George, of Carlsbad, Calif., who bought a 
Breitling watch on the site for nearly $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure what to expect. But they had more watches than  
any of the local jewelry stores, and everything, down to the box 
that the watch came in, was done absolutely right.''

<HEADLINE> Texan Tries To Ease Blood Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLING, Texas (AP) -- Halloween is two weeks away, and  
72-year-old Sylvan Miori is already wearing a tuxedo, cape and 
plastic Dracula fangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, it's the blood guy!'' a teen-ager says as the  
silver-haired vampire sweeps onto the campus of Boling High School, 
45 miles from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``How you doing?'' Miori sputters through the fake teeth. ``You  
old enough to give blood?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaking hands and slapping backs, the retired businessman and  
self-made millionaire works the teen-age crowd. By the time he 
reaches the door of the school's temporary blood-donation clinic, 
he has talked a few more students into rolling up their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	Miori is trying to ease the nation's blood shortage by getting  
young people in the habit of donating as regularly as his World War 
II generation did. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded a program called Teens Are People Savers, or TAPS,  
which encourages young people to donate blood by offering schools 
gift certificates that can be applied toward student activities, 
such as graduation parties. Certificates worth up to $1,000 at 
stores such as Wal-Mart are awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception five years ago at nearby Wharton High  
School, the blood program has spread across 10 Texas counties, 
producing more than 22,000 units of roughly a pint each. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're getting with these kids is our future -- a  
generation of new givers,'' Miori said. ``If we can keep that 
going, you'll always have a brand new bunch of people turning 17 
years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TAPS may be one solution to what some experts fear is an  
emerging national crisis. A study by the National Blood Data 
Resource Center predicted that demand for blood in the United 
States could outstrip supply as soon as next year. Those concerns 
have reached Washington, where a House subcommittee is to hold the 
last of three hearings Tuesday on the severity of the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts cite numerous pressures on the blood supply, including  
tougher donor-screening restrictions, an aging population that is 
becoming too ill to give blood, and the proliferation of medical 
advances that require substantial amounts of blood, such as organ 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a generation gap among donors: A poll Oct. 11 by  
America's Blood Centers, the national network that supplies about 
45 percent of the nation's blood, found that 70.5 percent of people 
ages 18 to 24 have never given blood to a blood bank. By 
comparison, only 40.5 percent of Americans 55 and over have never 
donated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals in the age group of 55 and up are more sensitive  
to the need for blood because of their experiences in World War II. 
Regrettably, as these folks age they become more susceptible to the 
diseases that preclude giving blood,'' said Bill T. Teague, 
president of Houston's Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it's so important younger people understand the  
need for blood, be educated about the donation process, get their 
fears addressed and get the opportunity to donate,'' he added. 
``And that's why TAPS is such a success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of Miori's visit to Boling High, the school earned  
$500 for its graduation festivities. Many students said the 
incentives helped get them in the door to donate, but they left 
with the satisfaction of knowing they may save lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just feels good, knowing you're helping people,'' said  
Julie Walker, 17, student blood drive chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Miori, a Navy veteran, created TAPS in 1995 after reading a  
newspaper article about the declining blood supply. The former auto 
parts dealer and beer distributor spoke to students at Wharton 
High, offering $1,000 toward their graduation party. He got 107 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Miori has spent thousands of his own dollars  
promoting the program. With financial support from foundations and 
corporate sponsors, TAPS has now donated more than $250,000 to 
about 50 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hell, I'm going to die,'' Miori said. ``They're going to lose  
a good blood donor when I die. So we need to get these young people 
started now.''

<HEADLINE> Reebok Admits Poor Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Reebok is blowing the whistle on itself for poor  
working conditions at its factories in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletic shoe company, known for giving out annual human  
rights awards, said an independent study found health and safety 
problems. It also said that many workers didn't understand their 
rights or workplace policies and that women aren't getting adequate 
opportunities for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers suffered rashes from harsh chemicals, and pregnant  
women had to stand or sit on uncomfortable stools with no back 
support. The women also had to work around chemicals that could 
cause nausea and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoughton-based Reebok International Ltd. said it ordered the  
report in an effort to improve working conditions at its factories 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that this will also break through and encourage more  
companies to do something like this,'' said Sharon Cohen, executive 
vice president for human rights. ``We have nothing to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reebok paid $35,000 for the report, which led to more than  
$500,000 in factory improvements, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reebok owns none of its own factories, relying instead on a  
network of subcontractors. Reebok is supplied by five factories in 
Indonesia, and it also buys products made in China, Thailand, 
Vietnam and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights activists have long worried about labor conditions  
in developing countries that make American clothing. Nike has come 
under attack for alleged abuses at its shoe factories. Activists 
have also charged that Kathi Lee Gifford's clothing line is 
produced in sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
	Medea Benjamin, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based labor  
rights group Global Exchange, said Reebok's report was more 
thorough and candid than a 1997 Nike report on alleged abuses at 
its foreign factories. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we've been asking the companies to do, be honest,  
be open and be public. I think it's great that Reebok did this,'' 
Ms. Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Nike report on Vietnamese factory conditions was  
conducted by former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, workers' rights 
advocates called the investigation a sham and a guided tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reebok report was prepared after a 14-month study of the  
factories by Insan Hitawasana Sejahtera, a Jakarta consulting firm. 
Researchers reviewed factory records, conducted surveys and 
confidential interviews, observed working procedures and inspected 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The study noted that workers at two Jakarta-area factories, run  
by the firms PT Dong Joe Indonesia and PT Tong Yang Indonesia, 
frequently were not fully informed about policies regarding wages, 
overtime and promotions. Although women made up more than 80 
percent of the work force, they were far less likely to hold 
supervisory positions.

<HEADLINE> Jets QB Lucas Out 3-4 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Ray Lucas, elevated to starting  
quarterback in Sunday's New York Jets game against Indianapolis, 
will be out three to four weeks with a sprained ankle sustained on 
the final play of the Colts' 16-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, who made his first NFL start in the game after appearing  
sporadically at the position in nine games since 1997, was sacked 
on the last play. He had to be carted off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets said X-rays showed no fracture.  
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mirer, who started four games after Vinny Testaverde tore  
his Achilles' tendon in the opener, will return to the No. 1 
quarterback position for Sunday's game in Oakland, coach Bill 
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells gambled by starting Lucas, generally a special teamer.  
After Lucas played well in the first half, he struggled in the 
second. Ray Burris' interception of Lucas' pass at the goal line in 
the fourth quarter set up the winning field goal.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dr. John G. Clark, a Harvard psychiatrist who  
raised awareness of the influence of religious sects, died Oct. 7. 
He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s, Clark studied newly emerging or unknown groups  
like the Unification Church, the Church of Scientology and the 
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. He also counseled 
over 500 former members of the groups and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The Church of Scientology objected to Clark's assertions, and  
the church and Clark battled in court. In 1988, he settled with the 
group for an undisclosed amount and agreed to never publicly talk

</P>
<P>
	For 42 years, de Tar was the organist and choirmaster at the  
Episcopal Church of the Ascension in New York's Greenwich Village,

programs of religious music from the Renaissance to the present. 
</P>
<P>
	He also taught at the Yale University Union Theological Seminary  
and the Juilliard School, teaching several generations of 
organists. He made a strong case for replacing bombastic 19th 
century hymns with more contemporary ones, as well as 16th-century 
works that had fallen out of use.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dockworkers Terminating Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The union representing Hawaii's dockworkers was  
to terminate its contract with four shipping companies Monday 
night, creating uncertainty for island residents almost totally 
dependent on ships to deliver food and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 142 gave  
notice Friday to the Hawaii Employers Council that it would 
terminate the current contract at 6 p.m. Monday, a move union 
leaders hoped would bring a sense of urgency to negotiations with 
four shipping companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one union stevedores on Maui voted unanimously Monday to  
authorize a strike, following the lead of 17 workers on Kauai who 
voted Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the earliest there could be a strike would be this  
weekend, after votes for the islands Oahu and Hawaii are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all dockworkers are on Oahu, and they are set to vote on  
Friday night. The union represents about 500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A dock strike could be very damaging to Hawaii, which depends on  
ships to deliver 90 percent of it goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract expired June 30, but was extended by both  
sides and could be terminated with 72 hours notice. 
</P>
<P>
	The ILWU chose to terminate the contract after a federal judge  
last week ordered the union to end a work slowdown that had nearly 
crippled unloading of freight and creating delays for distributors 
and suppliers of everything from fresh foods to cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The council represents four shipping companies -- Matson  
Terminals Inc., Hawaii Stevedores Inc., McCabe Hamilton &AMP; Renney 
Co., and HT&AMP;T Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The ILWU wants wage increases similar to the nearly 8 percent  
hike given to West Coast dockworkers last summer, Local 142 leader 
Eusebio Lepenia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermarkets reported brisk weekend business as people stocked  
up on food, toilet paper and other staples. Stores said they didn't 
anticipate shortages this week, but said it might get harder to 
find fresh fruit and vegetables. Several stores said they had extra 
stock on hand to meet expected increased demand for people 
concerned about possible problems relating to the Year 2000 bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurants and other businesses said they would have to fly in  
their supplies, which could lead to increased prices.

<HEADLINE> S. Calif. Agrees on Water Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Southern California water districts voted  
unanimously Monday to approve a landmark agreement on how to divide 
their allotment of Colorado River water, though it will still be 
years before the plan is in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is important because it was done on a consensual basis,''  
said David Hayes, acting deputy secretary of the Department of 
Interior. ``These districts have historically been like the 
Hatfields and the McCoys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for public meetings in agricultural areas,  
environmental impact reports on water transfers between districts, 
legal documents prepared by the negotiators and surpluses granted 
by the Department of Interior. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after those hurdles are cleared, the terms of the agreement  
aren't binding until the Imperial Irrigation District starts 
transferring conserved farm water to San Diego, likely in 2002, 
under a separate plan that still needs federal and state approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The six other Western states that draw from the river put  
pressure on Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to do something about 
California continually taking more than its share of water. He set 
a deadline of last week, threatening the loss of water surpluses if 
the districts didn't reach a tentative agreement on a way to stay 
within their allotment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the boards of the Imperial and Coachella water  
districts and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California voted unanimously to approve the agreement, capping 
months of negotiations led by Hayes and Tom Hannigan, director of 
California's Department of Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1922 agreement, California is assured 4.4 million  
acre-feet of water a year from the Colorado River. However, only 
550,000 acre-feet is budgeted for the heavily populated coastal 
strip and inland regions. 
</P>
<P>
	An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or enough water for a  
family of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past few years, Metropolitan, which owns the aqueduct  
that supplies water to 16 million people in Southern California, 
has been taking as much 5.2 million acre-feet to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still more work to do, but this is a significant first  
step in resolving a long dispute between California water 
agencies,'' said Tom Levy, Coachella Valley Water District general 
manager.

<HEADLINE> Kalamazoo College Students Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- A Kalamazoo College student killed his  
ex-girlfriend and then himself in his dorm room early Monday with a 
shotgun he had bought soon after the couple broke up a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus security discovered the bodies just after midnight in  
Neenef Odah's first-floor room. 
</P>
<P>
	Odah, 20, of Seattle, and Margaret Wardle, 19, of Plainwell,  
Mich., started dating last year but broke up about a month ago, 
college President James Jones Jr. said. Soon after that, Odah 
bought the gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings followed a late-night argument, Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he didn't know of any previous violence between the  
couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could anything have been done to prevent this? As I walked  
around campus, I've tried to answer that. I don't know how you root 
out this plague of violence, which seems to have descended on the 
most powerful society in the world,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours before the apparent murder-suicide, Odah  
seemed happy, fellow student Kirsten Fritch said. ``He danced with 
me at homecoming. He was smiling. Everything seemed fine,'' said 
Ms. Fritch, 19.

<P>
	All classes were canceled Monday at the 1,400-student liberal

<P>
	Ms. Wardle was a golfer who was described as friendly and  
outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Wilson, a sophomore, said he was good friends with Odah  
last year and often saw him and Ms. Wardle together. He said they 
had their quarrels, like any other couple, ``but I never saw 
violence.''

<HEADLINE> SLOC Sues Cyber Squatters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has  
filed a lawsuit to keep others from selling variations on the 
committee's Web site trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	One broker tried to sell an investigator working for the SLOC  
three of the Olympic Web site names for $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC filed the federal suit Friday against Branjack Inc., a  
defunct company with only a mail drop in Wilmington, Del., and 
apparent pseudonyms Brandon Walker and Regina Cephas. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are offering to sell five Internet domain names,  
all variations on Salt Lake, games and 2002. The names were 
approved by an Internet registrar that does not screen applications 
for trademark violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC hosts the Web site www.slc2002.org and owns 13 similar  
names, including ``2002 Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our simple intention is to prevent the improper infringement  
of our domain names. These electronic addresses are considered a 
valuable corporate asset,'' SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's lawsuit seeks a court order that would force the  
defendants to turn the counterfeit domain names over to the SLOC. 
The suit also seeks punitive damages of three times the profits the 
defendants earn hawking Olympic domain names or attorneys fees. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding the defendants won't be easy. Investigators traced  
only unoccupied offices, dead telephones and lapsed or nonexistent 
incorporation records. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigator who sent an e-mail to one of the Internet sites  
got a response from a ``John'' offering for $25,000 to sell the 
names saltlake2002.com, saltlakecitygames.com and 
saltlakecity2002.com. 
</P>
<P>
	A search of Internet domain names by The Associated Press on  
Monday turned up numerous other variations on SLOC's Web site 
address, including saltlake2002.org. The owner of that domain name 
didn't immediately return a call for comment.

<HEADLINE> White House Engaging Bush on Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House press secretary Joe Lockhart took  
a rhetorical detour during his daily briefing to inject Republican 
presidential front-runner George W. Bush into the budget debate 
between the Clinton administration and the GOP-led Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does he agree or disagree with what Congress is doing on  
education?'' Lockhart asked as the spending battle began to take 
shape late last month. ``And if he disagrees, I think a test of 
leadership is pointing out where you disagree and trying to 
influence your party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's more than a year before the election but, little by little,  
the White House is edging into presidential politics. 
Administration officials, even President Clinton himself, have 
singled Bush out for criticism and begun trying to draw him out on 
the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	These efforts are as much recognition of Bush's lead in the GOP  
field as they are an expression of Democrats' frustration that he 
has yet to face tough questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials don't intend daily attacks on the Texas  
governor, but they consider him fair game for criticism and are 
eager to pin him down on policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt University political scientist Erwin Hargrove sees  
the early focus on Bush as a symptom of a front-loaded political 
system. ``A lot of this verbiage today at this early date has to do 
with the early primaries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove also noted that past presidents have played relatively  
diminished roles in the campaigns of their vice presidents, who 
need to establish their independence. Ronald Reagan did little 
campaigning for Bush's father, George Bush. Richard Nixon froze 
Dwight Eisenhower out until the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be, and I think it is, that Clinton feels that (Vice  
President Al) Gore is part of his legacy; a continuing Democratic 
presidency is part of his legacy,'' Hargrove said. ``Add that to 
the increased competition, and that's where you're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Pfeifle, spokesman for the Republican National Committee,  
said the criticisms were an effort to overcome the fact that 
``voters are suffering from a terminal case of Clinton-Gore 
fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're desperate, and instead of working to get things done  
for the American people, they're spending their time playing petty 
partisan politics,'' Pfeifle said of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Democratic Leadership Council meeting in July, Clinton  
poked fun at Bush's ``compassionate conservatism,'' saying it was 
the equivalent of telling people that you'd like to help them, 
``but I can't, and I feel terrible about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush was struggling in August to not answer certain  
questions about his past, Clinton aides quickly answered reporters' 
queries about whether the president had ever used cocaine. While 
there was no reference to Bush's situation, the quick reply that 
Clinton had never indulged in the drug implicitly raised the 
question as to why Bush couldn't say the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The shots became more direct as the Republican-run Congress  
approved a $792 billion tax cut and Clinton vowed to veto it as a 
threat to the nation's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Lockhart challenged Bush on Sept. 23 to take a stand  
on proposed education cuts in a Senate bill, the president vetoed 
the tax cut and criticized Bush for promising better military pay 
and new weapons systems if he were elected in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a nice speech, but if I sign this tax bill he's for,  
there won't be any money for the promise he just made,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He extended his criticism to all the Republican candidates who  
had supported the tax cut. ``If I had signed it, it would have made 
a lie out of every campaign speech they're going to give,'' he 
said. ``They wouldn't have any money left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then in October, Bush took a stand against a GOP proposal to  
delay a tax credit for low-income families in order to pay for 
legislative initiatives, a move that drew criticism from within his 
own party. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bush's comments, Clinton offered some backhanded  
praise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Republican right is being too hard on Governor  
Bush,'' he said. He observed that Bush had supported the tax cut; 
that one of his advisers had organized a fund-raising breakfast 
with House leaders and health care officials just before the 
patients' bill of rights came to the floor, and that Bush ``stuck 
with them and the NRA on the gun issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I will say this: I personally appreciated what he said.  
Raising taxes on poor people is not the way to get out of this bind 
we're in,'' Clinton said with a slight grin. ``But I think they're 
being way too hard on him and unfair.''

<HEADLINE> Kodak Earnings Up; Job Cuts Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. said today it plans to  
cut about 1,000 more jobs although the photography company had a 16 
percent jump in operating profits in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's operating profits, which exclude one-time charges, came  
to $727 million, up from $629 million a year ago. The per-share 
operating profit of $1.45 beat Wall Street analysts' expectations 
of $1.43 a share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income, which includes a $350 million charge to cover 3,400  
layoffs, fell to $235 million, or 73 cents a share, down 41 percent 
from $398 million, or $1.21 a share, in the same quarter a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 6 percent to $3.58 billion from $3.39 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street appeared pleased with Kodak's results. The company's  
stock was up 25 cents at $71.13 in what was generally a down day on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak announced earlier it was cutting its payroll by 2,000 to  
2,500 jobs. In its news release today, it put the number of jobs to 
be eliminated at 3,400 and said the positions would come from 
manufacturing, photofinishing, selling, general and administrative 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Kodak began cutting around 20,000 jobs, or about  
one-fifth of its worldwide payroll, through the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its film revenues rose 7 percent in the United  
States and 8 percent worldwide during the quarter, with higher 
volumes more than offsetting lower prices. Kodak said it also 
benefited from robust sales of digital cameras and graphics 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak is in the midst of an aggressive cost-cutting plan to  
counter gains by rival Fuji Photo Film Co. Kodak's sales had fallen 
for eight quarters in a row before turning upward in the first 
three quarters of this year, buoyed by rising sales of consumer 
film in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses in digital photography, the recording of images on  
computer chips, narrowed to $26 million in the third quarter from 
$52 million a year ago. Digital sales jumped 44 percent to $541 
million -- about 15 percent of overall sales. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Kodak earned $917 million, or $2.84  
per share, down from $1.118 billion, or $3.41 per share, in the 
same period last year. Sales fell to $4.45 billion from $4.65 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Defense Deserts Bosox in 4th Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox have been deserted by their  
defense, and No. 1 glove man Nomar Garciaparra is the biggest 
culprit of all. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star shortstop's fourth error in the AL Championship  
Series helped New York take the lead with a two-run fourth inning 
Sunday night as the Yankees beat Boston 9-2 to take a 3-1 lead in 
the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Bret Saberhagen also committed an error in the fourth,  
and Boston made two more errors as New York put the game away with 
a six-run ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took advantage of a few things tonight, a couple of  
miscues -- one by me that cost us a run,'' Saberhagen said. ``I 
thought I make that play 10 out of 10 times, but I guess it's nine 
out of 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the four errors were blamed for three Yankees runs.  
Boston was 12th in the 14-team AL in fielding, committing 127 
errors during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make those types of mistakes, defensive mistakes,  
especially against this type of ballclub,'' Boston outfielder 
Darren Lewis said. ``They're going take advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Garciaparra's glove that made the first-round draft  
choice so attractive to the Red Sox. As he quickly rose through the 
farm system, the team thought his shiny fielding would make up for 
whatever hitting deficiencies he might have. 
</P>
<P>
	But Garciaparra was a star at the plate as well, batting .306  
with 30 homers and 98 RBIs to win the AL rookie of the year award 
in 1997. He topped that as a sophomore, hitting .323 with 35 homers 
and 122 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, all he did was lead the AL in batting with a .357  
average and hit 27 homers with 104 RBIs. And he cut down on his 
errors, committing a career-low 17 in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	But after playing flawless defense in the first round against  
Cleveland, Garciaparra committed two errors in Game 1 against New 
York. Neither led to any damage -- and Garciaparra also had two 
great catches to save three runs -- but the Yankees won 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, Garciaparra had an error in the ninth inning after  
Boston was already ahead 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Game 4, his defense finally hurt the Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it is'' uncharacteristic, Garciaparra said.  
</P>
<P>
	After Paul O'Neill struck out to lead off the fourth, Bernie  
Williams hit a grounder that Garciaparra picked up on his backhand 
but threw over first baseman Mike Stanley's head and into the 
Boston dugout. With the runner on second, Tino Martinez doubled to 
make it 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	After Darryl Strawberry was intentionally walked and Scott  
Brosius struck out, Chad Curtis hit a grounder to first. Stanley 
fielded the ball behind the base but Saberhagen couldn't handle the 
low but catchable throw, and as it rolled away Martinez scored to 
make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Jose Offerman made low throw to Garciaparra on a  
potential force at second to allow New York's fourth run to score. 
Right fielder Darren Lewis made Boston's fourth error of the game 
when his bouncing throw in the ninth eluded the relay man: 
Garciaparra. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played good baseball for eight innings,'' Saberhagen said.  
``We've got to put this behind us, and we've got to pick it up 
where we did against Cleveland.''

<HEADLINE> Spaniard Becomes EU Policy Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Fresh from leading NATO through the  
Kosovo conflict, Javier Solana took over Monday as the European 
Union's foreign policy chief and pledged to give the bloc a major 
voice in world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is high time for Europe to become a more active and  
influential global power,'' Solana said. ``The Union in the 21st 
century will have a common currency. It should also have an 
effective policy of foreign affairs, security and defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana immediately met with the EU's new external affairs  
commissioner, former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten, to calm fears 
the appointment of two such high-profile international figures 
could lead to a turf fight over who speaks for the 15-nation Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to ... work together,'' Solana said in a  
statement. ``There can be no doubts about the total coherence in 
our action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patten, a former British minister, also brushed aside questions  
over how they will divide responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a very big job to do. I'm looking forward to doing  
it with Javier Solana,'' he told reporters. ``We'll cooperate right 
across the board. I'm sure we will cooperate very well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU leaders chose Solana, a 57-year-old Spainard, for the new  
post in June amid acclaim for the way he held the NATO alliance 
together through the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, and 
successfully steered Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into 
NATO as the first new members from the old Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders hoped Solana's appointment would end years of  
confusion over who represents the Union internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	But the selection soon afterward of Patten as top foreign  
affairs official on the EU's executive Commission provoked doubts 
over how their roles would dovetail. 
</P>
<P>
	EU Commission President Romano Prodi, who also attended the  
meeting Monday, acknowledged the task of forging a common EU 
foreign and security policy ``will not be an easy job.'' But he 
said they had ``started well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solana will report directly to EU foreign ministers who meet at  
least once a month to review international issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to focus on strengthening the Europeans' defense  
capability within NATO and empowering Europe to respond quickly to 
regional crises like those in Bosnia and Kosovo, without having to 
depend on U.S. assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Patten will handle wider foreign policy issues and the EU's  
day-to-day diplomatic contacts.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Welcome Nyerere Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Tanzanians  
thronged the international airport today to welcome home the 
remains of late president Julius Nyerere, the African statesman 
considered to be Tanzania's founding father. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Tanzania jet carrying Nyerere's coffin from London  
landed just after 9 a.m. local time amid cheers and wailing from 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	People had begun arriving around dawn to await the body of their  
beloved leader, who died Oct. 14 in a London hospital. As the plane 
arrived, some in the crowd fainted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police wielding truncheons pushed people back as they surged  
towards Nyerere's coffin, draped in the green, blue, black and 
yellow Tanzanian flag. An honor guard fired a 21-gun salute, and 
guard members fixed their eyes on the ground in a sign of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to see the man who is for me still my president,''  
said Mansul Abdul. ``Because of Nyerere, our parents were able to 
raise us,'' he said, referring to Nyerere's goal of providing free 
basic education and health care to all Tanzanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere's coffin was to be placed on a gun carriage and pulled  
six miles through this Indian Ocean port. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral mass was scheduled at St. Joseph's cathedral Tuesday  
morning for Nyerere, who died at age 77 after a battle with 
leukemia. Afterwards, the body of the man everyone called 
``Mwalimu'' -- teacher in Kiswahili -- will be taken to the National 
Stadium, where it will lie in state until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	World figures, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, are to attend a state funeral 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former South African President Nelson Mandela, the only other  
Africa leader of Nyerere's international stature, was not expected 
to attend the funeral because he was traveling in the Middle East, 
but his wife, Graca Machel was already in Dar es Salaam today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere will be buried Saturday in his home village, Butiama.  
</P>
<P>
	A founder of the Organization of African Unity in 1963, Nyerere  
was a leading proponent of economic sanctions against the former 
apartheid regime in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the drive for the independence of his East African nation  
from British rule and became the first president of what was then 
Tanganyika in 1962. In 1964, Nyerere presided over the union of the 
Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar and Tanganyika, on the 
mainland, to form Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Nyerere stepped down in 1985 after 23 years in office  
to devote time to farming and diplomacy, he remained the major 
power broker in the East African nation. He also worked tirelessly 
to negotiate an end to the violence that has wracked central and 
southern Africa in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Release Gary Gaetti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs placed third baseman Gary Gaetti  
on waivers Monday, possibly ending a major league career that 
spanned nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Gaetti hit .204 with nine home runs and 46 RBIs  
in 113 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti also played in his 2,500th game this season, becoming  
only the 40th player in major league history to reach that 
milestone. He finished the season with 2,502 games, putting him 
third on the career list among third basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti ranks 46th in career home runs with 360 and his 1,340  
RBIs ranks him 52nd. He also has 2,280 hits. He has played in two 
All-Star games and won four Gold Gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti came to the Cubs during the 1998 season and his strong  
performance over the last six weeks of the season when he hit .320 
was one of the keys in the Cubs playoff run. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti began his major league career in Minnesota and helped the  
Twins win a World Series. He left the Twins after the 1990 season, 
playing with the California Angels, Kansas City Royals and St. 
Louis Cardinals before coming to the Cubs late in the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs on Monday also announced the purchase of left-handed  
pitcher Dan Serafini's contract from their Triple-A team in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Serafini, 25, spent most of the season with the Cubs and was 3-2  
with one save and a 6.93 ERA in 42 games before finishing the 
season at Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Venus Eyes Top Ranking in Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Venus Williams has big plans. And  
Martina Hingis might not like them. 
</P>
<P>
	By hammering her way past Hingis in the final of the Swisscom  
Challenge 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday, Williams believes she was serving the 
top-ranked Swiss star notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely will be No. 1, and probably next season,''  
Williams said. ``I have everything going for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of power. I'm capable. I'm a smart girl. I'm hard  
on myself, I have six titles this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having clashed five times already this season, the two  
19-year-olds have been locked in a fierce -- sometimes bitter -- 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's victory marked Williams' second consecutive win over  
the Swiss player, having defeated Hingis in the semifinals of the 
Grand Slam Cup just two weeks ago, before coming up short against 
sister Serena. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Swiss player still has an 8-5 win-loss record against  
the lanky American, Williams leads this season's head-to-heads 3-2, 
having also defeated Hingis in the semifinals of the Italian Open 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' only losses to Hingis came in the semifinals of the  
U.S. Open and the final in San Diego, when the Swiss player 
reclaimed her place atop the world rankings from American Lindsay 
Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to Williams, Hingis' lease on the top spot is  
nearly up. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that younger Serena was the first sister to win  
a Grand Slam title, defeating Hingis in the final of the U.S. Open, 
Williams still believes she'll be the one to replace the Swiss star 
from atop the world rankings next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no Grand Slams, so I have no major points to defend,''  
Williams said. ``I have nothing to lose and only one way to go: 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's final against Hingis, Williams' most potent weapon --  
her missile-like serve -- played as much against her as for her. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving up seven aces on the sluggish carpet, only 47 percent of  
Williams' first serves were good. Unwilling to risk a double fault, 
Williams' muscle was wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	But since losing to Hingis in the semifinals of the U.S. Open,  
Williams has been making a determined effort to master her serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Once she does, Williams says she'll be a force to reckon with.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be unbelievable,'' Williams said. ``You wait and see.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm practicing my consistency and placement and I'm really  
going for it,'' she said. ``When I get it just right you won't 
believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams might need more than just a strong serve to oust  
Hingis, the winner of 26 career titles, including five Grand Slams 
and nearly $11 million in career earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis has won seven titles this season, including the  
Australian Open. Four other of her titles this year came at Tier 1 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	She also reached the final of the U.S. and French Opens and has  
a 65-11 win-loss record this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some more physical training, I can beat her again,''  
shrugged a confident Hingis.

<HEADLINE> France Telecom Buying Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German utility groups Veba AG and RWE  
AG tentatively plan to sell their 60.25 percent stake in the E-Plus 
mobile telephone network to France Telecom SA for $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday depends on agreement from U.S. phone  
company BellSouth Corp. which owns 22.5 percent of E-Plus and has 
pre-emptive rights over the utilities' sale of their stakes in the 
mobile phone company, France Telecom said in a separate statement. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom said it hoped to reach a quick agreement with  
BellSouth, which is based in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Vodafone Airtouch PLC holds the remainder and is  
seeking a buyer, E-Plus said. 
</P>
<P>
	With 3.2 million customers, E-Plus is Germany's third-largest  
mobile telephone operator, with a market share of 16 percent. Sales 
in 1998 were $984 million. The firm, with 3,100 employees, will 
remain based in Duesseldorf, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-border competition has been heating up in Europe's  
recently liberalized telecommunications market. France Telecom said 
it intends to use E-Plus to branch out into the German telephone 
and Internet market. 
</P>
<P>
	The former French telephone monopoly said it will finance its  
E-Plus purchases by selling its stake in U.S.-based Sprint Corp., 
worth around $9.3 billion, and its 2 percent stake in Deutsche 
Telekom, which is worth about $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom's plan to form a global partnership with Deutsche  
Telekom was dealt a severe blow after the German carrier pursued an 
ill-fated attempt to merge with Telecom Italia in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakup of the French company's Global One joint venture with  
Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp. also has been expected since MCI 
Worldcom's announcement earlier this month that it would acquire 
Sprint for $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom also holds 10 percent of Sprint and is  
pondering what to do with its stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the sale price, $4.1 billion will go to Veba and $3.8 billion  
to RWE, Veba said.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler May Seek Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is in talks with both  
Italy's Fiat SpA and France's Peugeot SA on cooperating in the 
small car market, ranging from sharing parts to taking a stake in 
each other's companies, a German newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	An outright acquisition of either carmaker remains highly  
unlikely, according to the Handelsblatt business newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified DaimlerChrysler manager was quoted as saying a  
decision could be made at the next DaimlerChrysler supervisory 
board meeting Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has in the past confirmed being in negotiations  
with Peugeot without disclosing the nature of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation in the market has centered on possible cooperation  
to help boost DaimlerChrysler's struggling Smart micro-mini car, 
which is made in France. There has been talk that the company might 
use a Peugeot chassis in the next Smart model. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would not confirm that it is in talks with Fiat.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiat has repeatedly said it will not sell its passenger car  
business. The Italian automobile manufacturer is nevertheless a 
potential partner since it has recently been seeking ways to 
strengthen its business, including joint ventures and shareholdings 
with other car manufacturers, Handelsblatt said.

<HEADLINE> Mets, Braves Rest After Epic Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- At last, the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets  
rested. Who could blame them? 
</P>
<P>
	The teams dragged into Atlanta on Monday, still feeling the  
aftershocks of one of the greatest postseason games in baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	An NL Championship Series that looked like a blowout just a  
couple of days ago is now up for grabs. Sure, the Braves have a 3-2 
lead and the next two games at home, if needed. But New York is 
riding a wave of emotion after its 15-inning, 4-3 victory in Game 5 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team that obviously doesn't quit,'' said third baseman  
Robin Ventura, whose grand slam-single added at least two more days 
to the Mets season. ``It just seems like this team responds to dire 
situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team worked out Monday, choosing to rest up for Game 6  
Tuesday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Mets, it was a time to revel in their improbable victory  
the night before at Shea Stadium. For the Braves, it was a chance 
to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is too down, nobody is too up,'' insisted Kevin  
Millwood, who will start Game 6 for Atlanta. ``I think everybody is 
just preparing for tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were three outs from reaching the World Series for  
the first time since 1996 after Keith Lockhart's two-out, 
run-scoring triple in the top of the 15th broke a 2-2 tie. That was 
the first run scored in the game since the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets evened the score in their half when Kevin McGlinchy  
walked three batters, including Todd Pratt with the bases loaded. 
Then, Ventura hit a pitch over the right-field wall for an apparent 
grand slam that became a run-scoring single when he was mobbed by 
his teammates before reaching second base. 
</P>
<P>
	While New York rocked, the game seemed to awaken Atlanta's  
listless baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	There were about 6,000 empty seats for the first two games of  
the series, but a sellout is expected in Game 6. The Braves sold 
some 6,000 tickets following Game 5 and had only 3,000 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the longest LCS game by innings since the Mets needed 16  
to beat Houston in the deciding game of the 1986 NL series. It was 
the longest postseason game by time ever, surpassing the 5-hour, 
13-minute marathon between the New York Yankees and Seattle 
Mariners in Game 2 of a 1995 division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the final score was 7-3 or 4-3 didn't matter. New York  
became only the second team in playoff history to force a Game 6 
after losing the first three games of a series. 
</P>
<P>
	Take solace, Atlanta. The Braves were the first, mounting a  
comeback against San Diego in last year's NLCS and seeming -- like 
the Mets -- to have all the momentum on their side following a 7-6 
victory in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the game in which Padres ace Kevin Brown, working in  
relief, gave up a three-run homer to Michael Tucker in the eighth 
and Greg Maddux pitched the ninth for his first career save. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, the Braves returned to Turner Field before a  
raucous crowd and managed just two hits in a 5-0 loss that sent San 
Diego to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, for one, knows momentum is a fleeting thing in  
baseball. With a day to recoup, he thinks Game 5 will be a distant 
memory by Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if they were back-to-back (games), without having a  
day off, it would have an effect,'' he said. ``But I think with us 
having today off and being able to go home and get the game out of 
our head a little bit, I don't think it will be that big of an 
effect tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are other factors in Atlanta's favor:  
</P>
<P>
	--Millwood, who already has two wins and a save in the  
postseason, will pitch on five days rest. New York starter Al 
Leiter, who lost 1-0 on an unearned run in Game 3, will be pitching 
on three days rest for only the second time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Braves are 16-4 against the Mets at 3-year-old Turner  
Field, winning 13 of the last 14 meetings and seven in a row -- 
including the first two games of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, who needed to win the last four games of the regular  
season just to make the playoffs, will take any odds they can get. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just play another day,'' Ventura said. ``It seems like  
we've been saying that for about a month and a half now, but it's 
the truth. We can't lose another game. We're just happy to be 
playing another game.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Quake Uncovers New Fault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An earthquake that rocked California and  
the Southwest has propelled the U.S. Geological Survey to focus its 
attention on a fault line it previously had ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly coined Lavic Lake fault, named for a dry lake bed in  
the Mojave Desert that the quake tore a gash through, will now 
become one of the most studied in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of information about this quake, a ton,'' USGS  
geologist Ken Hudnut said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The temblor that struck at 2:46 a.m. Saturday near the remote  
desert town of Ludlow, caused minor injuries during a passenger 
train derailment. Light damage was reported elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude of the quake was put today at 7.1. It had been  
listed as a 7.0 quake, but the reading was upgraded after a review 
of data, said Robert Tindol, spokesman for seismologists at the 
California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake happened along a 25-mile-long fault geologists had  
only partly mapped, hadn't researched and hadn't yet named. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tasks were low priority because of the fault's location.  
Other faults, such as San Andreas, are constantly monitored because 
they are located near heavily populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't going to do a lot of research along a fault that  
would only bother a rattlesnake,'' said Lucy Jones, a USGS 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudnut said the more geologists can learn about the physics of  
earthquakes, the more they can do to advise planners to avoid 
building on active faults and keep buildings already on them safer 
during temblors. 
</P>
<P>
	Another thing they learned: The quake could be related to the  
magnitude 7.3 Landers quake of 1992. Preliminary analysis indicated 
the quake occurred in a region where stress was increased by that 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that the faults in this area are talking to each  
other,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Landers quake struck in the desert on June 28, 1992, and was  
followed within hours by a 6.5 jolt near Big Bear Lake in the San 
Bernardino Mountains. The Landers quake killed a boy, and both 
quakes caused 400 injuries and $100 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's quake is not considered an aftershock of Landers but  
scientists will be exploring the relationship, the USGS said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudnut, who flew over the area with two colleagues in a  
helicopter to inspect the fault, said they marveled at the giant 
fissure that moved a dry river bed 12 feet to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had wonderful surface rupture,'' he said. ``It was exciting  
for us. Most geologists study things that happened thousands of 
years ago. This is something that happened yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also was the first major event recorded on the TriNet  
quake data system, a network of 200 seismographic stations that 
measure quake intensity and other properties. The system and 
stations are linked by computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all this equipment in place,'' Jones said. ``We were  
looking for a model to test it. This was perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While geologists got down to business Sunday, the 50 residents  
of Ludlow near the quake's epicenter, had to fix mobile homes that 
slipped off foundations and broken glass and broken dishes that 
slowed service at the town's only diner. 
</P>
<P>
	The small town that heralded itself as ``famous for absolutely  
nothing'' is now known as the site of the strongest quake to hit 
California since Landers in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Play Inspired by Erotic Gum Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Gum,'' by playwright Karen Hartman, is based  
on a newspaper story about Egyptian university women becoming 
passionate after they chewed gum. Unfortunately, the news story is 
more interesting than the amateurish, over-histrionic play that 
opened Sunday at the off-Broadway Women's Project and Productions 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The news story from July 1996 relates that in Mansura, 81 miles  
from Cairo, warnings were broadcast over mosque loudspeakers 
warning young women that certain brands of chewing gum contained an 
erotic stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
	The play begins with Rahmi (Daphne Rubin-Vega) giving her sister  
Lina (Angel Desai) a detailed description of chewing gum and 
becoming aroused to have sex in a car. 
</P>
<P>
	A young perfume merchant (Firdous Bamji) wins Rahmi's hand in  
marriage, whereupon a young man (Juan Rivera-Lebron) pops up on the 
wall and relates his description of having sex with Rahmi in a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramhi is next seen walking with a cane. She has been  
circumcised, and bleeds to death on stage. Bamji then seeks to 
marry Lina, but her aunt refuses, saying Lina is a virgin and can 
do better. Then she sends Lina away. End of play. 
</P>
<P>
	What this all means never becomes clear during the 90 minutes of  
the play, among whose few saving graces is Bamji's understated 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta Greco directed. Elizabeth Hope Clancy designed costumes  
and Myung Hee Cho designed the set.

<HEADLINE> British Boxer Gets 18-Month Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British boxer Adrian Dodson was banned for 18  
months Monday for biting his opponent during a Commonwealth 
middleweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Boxing Board of Control cited Dodson for ``bringing  
the sport into disrepute.'' In addition to the ban, he was fined 
$1,600. 
</P>
<P>
	The board ruled that Dodson was guilty of biting Canada's Alain  
Bonnamie in the 12th and last round of their Oct. 5 bout in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodson said he would consider an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a fair hearing but the sentence is very harsh,'' the  
29-year-old Dodson said. ``Mike Tyson served only one year after 
chewing Evander Holyfield's ear. We will think about an appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 9, 1997, Tyson's boxing license was revoked by Nevada  
authorities. He was fined $3 million, with reinstatement possible 
after a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodson was five rounds ahead on referee John Keane's scorecard  
with just 50 seconds of the fight remaining at London's Royal 
National Hotel, when the fighters tangled on the ropes and Bonnamie 
emerged with bite marks to his midriff. Dodson was immediately 
disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference last week, Dodson apologized but denied  
biting his opponent. He said his mouthpiece remained in place and 
that he ``pinched'' Bonnamie with his mouth.

<HEADLINE> EU Hopefuls Face Wait To Join Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- East European nations hoping to join  
the European Union early next decade should wait at least another 
two years after their acceptance before they are allowed to swap 
their currencies for the euro, Pedro Solbes, the EU's new finance 
commissioner said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Solbes said the waiting period was needed to make sure the  
newcomers maintain a stable exchange rate against the EU's common 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he told the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary  
Affairs Committee he hoped all EU nations would eventually adopt 
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland, Hungary, Cyprus, Slovenia, Estonia and the Czech  
Republics are in formal membership negotiations with the EU. 
Frontrunners hope to join around 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	EU leaders are expected to add Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria,  
Latvia, Lithuania and Malta to the list at a mid-December summit in 
Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Solbes also warned that inflation is becoming a problem in three  
of the 11 euro-zone nations -- Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands. 
He said the European Central Bank which sets interest rates in the 
euro-zone ``will have to look closely at inflation this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New inflation figures for the bloc are scheduled for release  
Wednesday. Solbes said the EU was closely monitoring the impact of 
higher oil prices on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was launched Jan. 1 as the shared currency of 11 EU  
nations. Britain, Sweden and Denmark decided to stay out for the 
start, while Greece failed to meet targets of low inflation, debt 
and deficit set as conditions for joining the currency bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspiring euro-zone nations among the candidates for EU  
membership will also have to meet those conditions.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Narrows Bush Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has narrowed the gap with George W.  
Bush in a head-to-head matchup of presidential front-runners, but 
he still must convince people he has the leadership skills and 
personal qualities for the job, according to a poll out today. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president trailed Bush, the governor of Texas, 51  
percent to 44 percent, in a poll of registered voters by the Pew 
Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press. Gore was 11 points to 
15 points behind Bush in several recent Pew polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore benefits from increased support from women; 50 percent of  
women would vote for Gore today compared to 40 percent in 
September, while 45 percent of women in this poll said they back 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Gore remains unchanged among men at 37 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in firm command among Republican candidates with 63  
percent of the support of people expected to vote in GOP primaries. 
Former Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole and Arizona Sen. John McCain 
had 10 percent apiece. Gore led former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley 
60 percent to 31 percent among those likely to vote in Democratic 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,032 adults was taken Oct, 7-11 and has an error  
margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, larger for 
subgroups. 
</P>
<P>
	While the results were mixed for Gore, it was the first good  
poll news for him since his decision in late September to shake up 
his campaign staff and move his headquarters to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has taken a lead in several Northeastern states  
recently. A recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed Bradley 
trailing Gore nationally by 12 points, 51 percent to 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore has made progress among women, he has had trouble  
shaking Bush's advantage among men, says Andrew Kohut, director of 
the Pew Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``What struck me more than anything else is how steady the Bush  
lead is among men and how variable it is among women, they keep 
going back and forth,'' Kohut said. ``Women are less focused on 
Gore's personal shortcomings, but they seem more focused on his 
personal qualities and negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-seven percent cite Gore's personal traits as reasons for  
not supporting him in a head-to-head matchup with Bush, while 49 
percent cite his ties to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The poll does show a little progress for Gore,'' Kohut said.  
``There's still a lot of uncertainty. You will see ups and downs. 
We're still more than a year away and people don't have a lot of 
conviction on this.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Rocket Lifts Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian Soyuz rocket carried four U.S.  
communication satellites into orbit Monday after blasting off from 
a rented government launch pad in a former Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites, built by a New York-based telecommunications  
company, blasted off from the Baikonur launch pad in Kazakstan, the 
Interfax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globalstar satellites join a global mobile phone network.  
Four previous launches this year put 16 other Globalstar satellites 
into orbit. Two more launches were planned for later this year -- 
one from Baikonur and one from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites were built by Space Systems Loral, a subsidiary  
of Loral Space and Communications Ltd. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has not disclosed how much it charges for commercial  
launches, but media reports have put the figure at about $70 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow rents the Baikonur cosmodrome -- which was built while  
Kazakstan was still part of the Soviet Union -- to use it for 
staffed and commercial space launches.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Open Broadly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets opened the week broadly lower,  
losing ground today after investors in the region were rattled by a 
big drop on Wall Street on fears that U.S. share prices could slide 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's decline ``has certainly been the single biggest  
factor driving the market at the moment,'' said Toshihiko Matsuno, 
deputy manager of the investment advisory office at Tokyo's 
Yamatane Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street last week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, to close Friday at 10,019.71, 
largely on fear that emerging signs of inflation will force the 
U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Dow's worst week ever in terms of points lost, and  
the worst of the decade in terms of percentage. On Friday alone, 
the average lost 266.90 points, or 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall Friday was precipitated by comments late Thursday from  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who expressed concern 
about the stability of U.S. stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares were also hit by the announcement Friday that U.S.  
wholesale prices had risen 1.1 percent in September -- far above the 
market estimate of 0.5 percent. That raised fears of inflation in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, traders sold off Japanese shares following Wall  
Street's dive, pushing down the benchmark 225 issue Nikkei Stock 
Average to close 326.24 points lower today, at 17,275.33, down 1.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said government intervention to buy Japanese shares  
with taxpayer money was probably underway, which would keep the 
Tokyo market from dropping significantly more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something there supporting the Nikkei, and it can't  
be anything but public fund intervention,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, 
general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tokyo's fall, coupled with Wall Street's plunge last week,  
dragged down markets across Asia today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index tumbled 36.38  
points, or 4.2 percent, to close at 826.25. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market failed to narrow its losses in the afternoon  
because other overseas stock markets, such as Japan, were weak 
throughout the day,'' said Cho Duck-hyun, a senior strategist at 
Hanwha Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, the Australian Stock Exchange's All Ordinaries Index  
shed 65.5 points to close at 2,796.8, down 2.3 percent from 
Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way that our market could ignore a fall like  
that, even though it may have been a healthy correction to their 
market anyway,'' said Jack Moss, a broker at Australia's Shaw 
Stockbroking Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singapore market too was hobbled by Wall Street's losses, as  
the benchmark Straits Times Index breached the 2000-point 
psychological barrier, closing down 67.80 points, or 3.29 percent, 
at 1,993.45 today. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets in Hong Kong, a major financial center, were closed for  
a holiday. Traders said the Hang Seng was likely to follow the 
downward trend when it reopened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the sell-off in Asian shares, traders said the market  
was likely to be supported by investors interested in scooping up 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares in particular are seen as a sound investment at  
this stage, said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock 
division at Chuo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. and Japanese economies are at different stages, and  
their stock market environments are different,'' Ishikawa said. 
``With U.S. shares falling, this could be an opportunity to buy 
Japanese stocks.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers Sign Ulf Samuelsson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers signed unrestricted  
free agent defenseman Ulf Samuelsson to a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not released Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Samuelsson is entering his 16th NHL season,  
having played for Hartford, Pittsburgh, the New York Rangers and 
Detroit. He had four goals and eight assists in 71 games for the 
Rangers and Red Wings last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ulf is an aggressive, high energy, veteran defenseman who  
would be very good on the ice for our team and would provide some 
enthusiasm and leadership both on and off the ice,'' team president 
and general manager Bob Clarke said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very lucky to be part of an organization like the  
Flyers,'' Samuelsson said. ``They're off to a little bit of a slow 
start here'' but are still a contender this year. The Flyers are 
1-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 1-inch, 205-pound Samuelsson has scored 56 goals and  
273 assists in 1,031 NHL games. With 2,395 penalty minutes, he 
ranks 17th on the NHL's career list.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Hire Zuraw As Bonifay Ass't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates have hired George  
Zuraw, who spent 12 years with the Seattle Mariners, as an 
assistant to general manager Cam Bonifay. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuraw's hiring followed the departures of two Bonifay aides,  
assistant director of player development Bill Bryk and assistant 
scouting director Ron King. Bryk joined the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuraw had worked since 1988 as an assistant to former Seattle  
general manager Woody Woodward, who retired shortly before the 
season ended. He first worked for the Pirates as a scout 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuraw spent six years as a Pirates minor leaguer before becoming  
a scout in 1959. He left the Pirates to join the Cincinnati Reds in 
1967, and spent 21 seasons there before being hired by Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bonifay said all seven members of manager Gene  
Lamont's coaching staff will return next season: first base coach 
Joe Jones, third base coach Jack Lind, batting coach Lloyd 
McClendon, pitching coach Pete Vuckovich, bullpen coach Spin 
Williams, bench coach Rick Renick and field coordinator Jeff 
Banister. All signed one-year contracts.

<HEADLINE> Dell Issues Earnings Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. warned Monday that a  
higher-than-expected jump in the price of computer memory chips 
will likely affect its third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dell, which were down $1.50 to $41.31 1/4 in trading  
Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell to $37.37 1/2 in after-hours 
trading after the news was released. 
</P>
<P>
	An earthquake in Taiwan last month disrupted production at  
factories that produce between 12 percent and 15 percent of the 
world's random access memory, or RAM, chips. 
</P>
<P>
	RAM is important to a computer because it stores information  
that a processor might need at another point, allowing a user and 
the computer to more rapidly switch back and forth between tasks 
for everything from screensavers to spreadsheets to games. 
</P>
<P>
	During its fall analyst meeting held on Oct. 7, Dell said the  
``supply situation'' of memory chips was progressing well. Since 
then, however, Dell said prices had increased more sharply than 
expected, to as much as 25 percent higher than the previous price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are managing the memory situation carefully and are working  
to offset the cost increases with efficiencies in other parts of 
our business,'' said Thomas J. Meredith, Dell's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected  
Dell to earn 20 cents a share in the third quarter. Dell will 
report its results on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith said the company considers the effects of the  
memory-cost issue to be a short-term matter and should not affect 
the longer-term outlook for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In its second-quarter earnings report, Dell, the largest seller  
of computers directly to customers, earned $507 million, or 19 
cents per share. The results beat expectations by 2 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> White House Engaging Bush on Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House press secretary Joe Lockhart took  
a rhetorical detour during his daily briefing to inject Republican 
presidential front-runner George W. Bush into the budget debate 
between the Clinton administration and the GOP-led Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does he agree or disagree with what Congress is doing on  
education?'' Lockhart asked as the spending battle began to take 
shape late last month. ``And if he disagrees, I think a test of 
leadership is pointing out where you disagree and trying to 
influence your party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's more than a year before the election but, little by little,  
the White House is edging into presidential politics. 
Administration officials, even President Clinton himself, have 
singled Bush out for criticism and begun trying to draw him out on 
the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	These efforts are as much recognition of Bush's lead in the GOP  
field as they are an expression of Democrats' frustration that he 
has yet to face tough questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials don't intend daily attacks on the Texas  
governor, but they consider him fair game for criticism and are 
eager to pin him down on policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt University political scientist Erwin Hargrove sees  
the early focus on Bush as a symptom of a front-loaded political 
system. ``A lot of this verbiage today at this early date has to do 
with the early primaries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove also noted that past presidents have played relatively  
diminished roles in the campaigns of their vice presidents, who 
need to establish their independence. Ronald Reagan did little 
campaigning for Bush's father, George Bush. Richard Nixon froze 
Dwight Eisenhower out until the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be, and I think it is, that Clinton feels that (Vice  
President Al) Gore is part of his legacy; a continuing Democratic 
presidency is part of his legacy,'' Hargrove said. ``Add that to 
the increased competition, and that's where you're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Pfeifle, spokesman for the Republican National Committee,  
said the criticisms were an effort to overcome the fact that 
``voters are suffering from a terminal case of Clinton-Gore 
fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're desperate, and instead of working to get things done  
for the American people, they're spending their time playing petty 
partisan politics,'' Pfeifle said of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Democratic Leadership Council meeting in July, Clinton  
poked fun at Bush's ``compassionate conservatism,'' saying it was 
the equivalent of telling people that you'd like to help them, 
``but I can't, and I feel terrible about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush was struggling in August to not answer certain  
questions about his past, Clinton aides quickly answered reporters' 
queries about whether the president had ever used cocaine. While 
there was no reference to Bush's situation, the quick reply that 
Clinton had never indulged in the drug implicitly raised the 
question as to why Bush couldn't say the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The shots became more direct as the Republican-run Congress  
approved a $792 billion tax cut and Clinton vowed to veto it as a 
threat to the nation's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Lockhart challenged Bush on Sept. 23 to take a stand  
on proposed education cuts in a Senate bill, the president vetoed 
the tax cut and criticized Bush for promising better military pay 
and new weapons systems if he were elected in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a nice speech, but if I sign this tax bill he's for,  
there won't be any money for the promise he just made,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He extended his criticism to all the Republican candidates who  
had supported the tax cut. ``If I had signed it, it would have made 
a lie out of every campaign speech they're going to give,'' he 
said. ``They wouldn't have any money left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then in October, Bush took a stand against a GOP proposal to  
delay a tax credit for low-income families in order to pay for 
legislative initiatives, a move that drew criticism from within his 
own party. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bush's comments, Clinton offered some backhanded  
praise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Republican right is being too hard on Governor  
Bush,'' he said. He observed that Bush had supported the tax cut; 
that one of his advisers had organized a fund-raising breakfast 
with House leaders and health care officials just before the 
patients' bill of rights came to the floor, and that Bush ``stuck 
with them and the NRA on the gun issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I will say this: I personally appreciated what he said.  
Raising taxes on poor people is not the way to get out of this bind 
we're in,'' Clinton said with a slight grin. ``But I think they're 
being way too hard on him and unfair.''

<HEADLINE> Foreign Policy Goals Said Ambitious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two stunning setbacks by Congress will not  
deter President Clinton from asserting U.S. leadership in the world 
with ambitious foreign policy goals in the last year of his term, 
Sandy Berger, his national security adviser, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Denouncing Congress as miserly for cutting nearly $2 billion  
from the foreign aid bill and for killing the global test ban 
treaty, Berger pledged: ``We will not turn our backs on the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Berger said the $12.6  
billion in foreign aid voted by Congress in a bill Clinton vetoed 
Monday was ``inadequate for the U.S. to lead the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said cuts in helping Russia dispose of nuclear material, in  
aid to poor countries and in peacemaking in Kosovo were ``part of 
the same pattern of disregard for America's interests in the world 
that was reflected in the vote last week'' on the test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions that Clinton will be unable to secure a foreign  
policy legacy in his 15 remaining months and that the 
administration was out maneuvered by Congress rankle the White 
House, and Berger came swinging. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle between Clinton and Congress ``is about whether  
America meets its obligations to the world, whether we see our 
stake in the world or turn our backs on the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a defining moment in many ways,'' the White House  
official said. ``It's about whether the United States is going to 
follow the vision of the last 50 years in taking the lead in 
shaping the world or whether we follow a vision in which we are 
going to build a wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the setbacks, Berger said, ``we have extraordinary  
opportunities, starting in the Middle East,'' where three leaders, 
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, Palestinian Yasser Arafat and 
President Hafez Assad of Syria, want to achieve peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a long way to travel but they are all willing,''  
Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking optimistically also of a peace accord in Northern  
Ireland and an agreement with Russia that would enable the United 
States to build a missile defense against ``rogue'' states, Berger 
returned repeatedly to the theme that Congress was undermining a 
U.S. leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our strength and our power depend on our leadership,'' he  
said. ``It is not enhanced by what happened last week (with 
rejection of the test ban treaty) and in the miserly way they have 
handled our international accounts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the United States was having discussions with Russia  
on ways they could cooperate against ``rogue state threats.'' A 
U.S. offer to help Russia complete a large missile tracking radar 
is only one example, he said, declining to provide others that are 
classified. 
</P>
<P>
	And he rejected any suggestion the White House was outmaneuvered  
by senior Senate Republicans who declined to act on the test ban 
treaty for two years and then shortcut consideration of the pact in 
a way that ruled out amendments that might have won over milder 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they believe that we right now are in a position of  
superiority and therefore we should not enter into any 
international agreements that somehow will undermine our 
superiority,'' Berger said of the kind of thinking Clinton has 
denounced as ``new isolationism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What they fail to understand is that in a global world we can  
only maintain our superiority and strength if we are economically, 
politically and in other ways engaged with the world,'' Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, defended both the  
rejection of the test ban treaty and the foreign aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
	They have questioned whether the treaty's monitoring system was  
adequate to guard against illegal weapons tests by other nations 
and said the United States had to test to keep its nuclear arsenal 
up to date. 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign aid, Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., said the vetoed  
bill ``enhances America's key international priorities while 
remaining within the confines of a balanced budget agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's  
foreign operations subcommittee, vowed to ``continue to insist that 
foreign aid programs be subject to the same fiscal discipline 
demanded of domestic spending, and that highest priority be given 
to American taxpayers, not to foreign governments.''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Body Shots' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Body Shots'' professes to be a movie that defines a decade.  
However, it is far less profound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cool-looking but cliched, ``Body Shots'' takes us along on a  
drunken night with a group of twentysomethings in Los Angeles -- and 
the cotton-mouthed, puffy-eyed aftermath the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Four unnaturally attractive women and four impeccably dressed  
men with too much hair gel hook up at a trendy dance club. The 
music thumps, lights flash, bodies grind. It's lust at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
	About halfway through the movie, though, the focus shifts from  
being a lighthearted look at dating to a legal drama. The young men 
and women pair up in varying states of sobriety, but one couple's 
encounter is hazier than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonde actress Sara (Tara Reid) accuses Mike (Jerry O'Connell),  
an obnoxious rookie for the Oakland Raiders, of date rape. (Cliche 
No.1: the football player rapist.) Mike says Sara was all over him 
and was more than willing. At first, each of them is totally sure 
of the details from the previous night, even though both were 
hammered. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a young lawyer in each of the two groups, trying to  
find the truth. As Rick (Sean Patrick Flannery) fires questions at 
Mike, and Jane (Amanda Peet) picks apart Sara's story, it seems 
neither can remember exactly what happened. Did Mike rape Sara? Or 
was the sex consensual? This conflict, while unoriginal, is the 
most compelling part of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Our heroes, Jane and Rick, unfortunately are pretty bland. The  
most interesting characters are the ones with the fewest lines. 
There could have been a better, quirkier movie about Trent (Ron 
Livingston), who looks ridiculous bar-hopping in knickers and 
argyle socks after a round of golf, and Whitney (Emily Procter), 
who seems like a sweet Southern belle but has some kinky hobbies. 
Their scenes together are full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Michael Cristofer uses interesting storytelling  
techniques, though, one of which Steven Soderbergh featured 
recently in ``The Limey.'' A character looks into the camera to 
speak, then the film cuts to a shot of the character looking away 
silently, but we still hear that person's monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristofer also skillfully uses grainy slow motion to highlight a  
kiss or a glance across the dance floor. Then he ruins the moment 
by inserting other characters to gripe about the woes of dating. 
Example: Rick and Jane are smooching at a club, when all of a 
sudden Shawn (Brad Rowe), the only wholesome male character, pops 
up in a corner of the screen saying, ``Sex without love equals 
violence.'' Now the movie has shifted from a legal drama to an 
after-school special. 
</P>
<P>
	The film also falls short in its cliched depiction of Los  
Angeles. The main characters are people who whine about their new 
breast implants hurting and talk on the cell phone while showering 
at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the film's portrayal of the media is unrealistic. As Sara  
lies in a hospital bed answering detectives' questions, television 
reporters with boom mikes and Betacams clamor outside her door for 
an interview. Reporters can be insensitive, but this is ridiculous: 
There's no way they would be allowed inside the building, much less 
the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Body Shots'' is supposed to be a story of young people  
searching for love. After seeing this movie, there seems to be 
little hope of finding it. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Line Cinema Pictures release, ``Body Shots'' is rated R  
for language, sexual situations and a rape scene. It runs 99 
minutes.

	Utah is scheduled to open the season Nov. 2 against the Los  
Angeles Lakers, but a date for Malone's return has not yet been 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Malone has already missed so much practice, coach Jerry  
Sloan expects it will take time for him to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is in real good shape; he always is,'' Sloan said. ``But  
he'll need to play some basketball. I don't think there's any 
question about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, who signed a four-year, $67 million contract during the  
offseason, felt his lower back tighten two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the Jazz's four-day training camp in Boise, he  
began watching most of the two-a-day sessions from the sideline 
because of the injury. Malone participated in the team's 
intra-squad scrimmage Oct. 9 at the Delta Center, his last on-court 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone did not attend the Jazz's first two preseason games -- a  
98-86 win over Vancouver in Ogden and Friday's 102-96 loss to 
Seattle in Boise. That led to speculation that his injury might be 
more serious than the Jazz originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sloan downplayed that notion, saying, ``We expect him to be  
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's absence has pushed other team members to the forefront.  
</P>
<P>
	Free agent Rick Hughes replaced Malone in the starting lineup  
against Seattle, and scored a team-high 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's injury ``has given us a chance to play some other guys  
a little bit more,'' Sloan said. ``That might be one positive thing 
to come out of it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- At last, the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets  
rested. Who could blame them? 
</P>
<P>
	The teams dragged into Atlanta on Monday, still feeling the  
aftershocks of one of the greatest postseason games in baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	An NL Championship Series that looked like a blowout just a  
couple of days ago is now up for grabs. Sure, the Braves have a 3-2 
lead and the next two games at home, if needed. But New York is 
riding a wave of emotion after its 15-inning, 4-3 victory in Game 5 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to know we've gotten this far,'' catcher  
Mike Piazza said after the Mets arrived in Atlanta late Monday 
afternoon. ``If we can get through tomorrow, who knows? Things 
could get interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team worked out Monday, choosing to rest up for Game 6  
Tuesday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last night, the last thing they need is a workout,''  
Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were still relishing their improbable victory the night  
before at Shea Stadium. The Braves were trying to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is too down, nobody is too up,'' insisted Kevin  
Millwood, who will start Game 6 for Atlanta. ``I think everybody is 
just preparing for tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series will start in NL city Saturday night and either  
the Mets or Braves will play host to the New York Yankees, who beat 
Boston 6-1 Monday night to win the ALCS in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were three outs from reaching the World Series for  
the first time since 1996 after Keith Lockhart's two-out, 
run-scoring triple in the top of the 15th broke a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets evened the score in their half when rookie Kevin  
McGlinchy walked three batters, including Todd Pratt with the bases 
loaded. Then, Robin Ventura sent a drive over the right-field wall 
for an apparent grand slam that became a run-scoring single when he 
was mobbed by his teammates before reaching second base. No matter 
the scoring, it was still a game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	While New York rocked, the game seemed to awaken Atlanta's  
listless baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	There were about 6,000 empty seats for the first two games of  
the series, but a sellout is expected for Game 6. The Braves sold 
some 6,000 tickets following Sunday's game and had only 3,000 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the longest LCS game by innings since the Mets needed 16  
to beat Houston in the deciding game of the 1986 NL series. It was 
the longest postseason game by time ever, surpassing the 5-hour, 
13-minute marathon between the New York Yankees and Seattle 
Mariners in Game 2 of a 1995 AL division series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets also became just the second team in playoff history to  
force a Game 6 after losing the first three games of a series. 
</P>
<P>
	Take solace, Atlanta. The Braves were the first, mounting a  
comeback against San Diego in last year's NLCS and seeming -- like 
the Mets -- to have all the momentum on their side following a 7-6 
victory in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the game in which Padres ace Kevin Brown, working in  
relief, gave up a three-run homer to Michael Tucker in the eighth 
and Greg Maddux pitched the ninth for his first career save. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, the Braves returned to Turner Field before a  
raucous crowd and managed just two hits in a 5-0 loss that sent San 
Diego to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	With a day to recoup, Millwood thinks Game 5 will be a distant  
memory by Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if they were back-to-back (games), without having a  
day off, it would have an effect,'' he said. ``But I think with us 
having today off and being able to go home and get the game out of 
our head a little bit, I don't think it will be that big of an 
effect tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are other factors in Atlanta's favor:  
</P>
<P>
	--Millwood, who already has two wins and a save in the  
postseason, will pitch on five days' rest. New York starter Al 
Leiter, who lost 1-0 on an unearned run in Game 3, will be pitching 
on three days' rest for only the second time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Braves are 16-4 against the Mets at 3-year-old Turner  
Field, winning 13 of the last 14 meetings and seven straight -- 
including the first two games of this series. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Mets are hurting. Piazza's left arm and hand are aching (he  
sat out the final two innings Sunday) and outfielder Roger Cedeno 
is questionable because of a sore back that caused him to miss the 
last game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm little banged up,'' Piazza said. ``But I'm going to go out  
there and give it all I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, whose only other three-day start came in April 1994,  
said he's ready to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is 100 percent?'' he asked. ``If you're a major league  
pitcher, there's always times when you don't feel great. You deal 
with it. I have four pitches I can use to get hitters out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, who needed to win the last four games of the regular  
season just to make the playoffs, will take any odds they can get. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just happy to be playing another game,'' Ventura said.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Earnings Up; Job Cuts Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. said Monday it sold  
more film at lower prices in the third quarter, driving sales up 6 
percent and profits up 17 percent, but the photography company also 
planned to cut about 1,000 more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak reported profits excluding one-time charges of $466  
million, or $1.45 per share, up from $398 million, or $1.21 a 
share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.43 a  
share, according to First Call Corp. Kodak's stock fell 31 cents to 
$70.56 a share in a generally down day on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Including a one-time $350 million charge to cover 3,400 layoffs,  
Kodak's net income fell to $235 million, or 73 cents a share. Sales 
rose 6 percent to $3.58 billion from $3.39 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Kodak said it planned to eliminate 2,000 to 2,500 jobs  
over the next three years. On Monday, it raised that target to 
3,400. It said none of the newly announced layoffs in the 
manufacturing, photofinishing, selling, general and administrative 
ranks would occur in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 9 percent drop in film prices nationwide, Kodak said  
it boosted film revenues 7 percent by selling 18 percent more rolls 
of film. Worldwide, its film revenues jumped 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it also benefited from robust sales of digital  
cameras and graphics products. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses in digital photography, the recording of images on  
computer chips, narrowed to $26 million in the quarter from $52 
million a year ago. Digital sales jumped 44 percent to $541 million 
-- about 15 percent of overall sales. Kodak expects to pull in its 
first profit in that fast-growing field before long, potentially 
creating new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's revenues had fallen for two straight years before  
turning upward in the first three quarters of this year, buoyed by 
rising sales of consumer film in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak was caught off-guard in 1997 when Japanese rival Fuji  
slashed film prices. Its two-year plan to trim $1.2 billion in 
costs and some 20,000 jobs out of a worldwide payroll of 100,500 is 
now almost completed. The company says it has cut $1.07 billion in 
costs so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its share of the rolls of film sold in the  
United States has edged up 1.5 percentage points to nearly 69 
percent over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Kodak earned $917 million, or $2.84  
per share, down from $1.12 billion, or $3.41 per share, in the same 
period last year. Sales rose to $10.29 billion from $9.84 billion.

<HEADLINE> Organ Allocation Rules Clarified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping for peace in a bitter fight over organ  
transplant policy, the Clinton administration announced changes 
Monday in a regulation aimed at directing scarce organs to the 
nation's sickest patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the changes, the government retains ultimate  
control over how organs are distributed, and transplant officials 
said the revisions are not enough to end the fierce battle over the 
allocation of donated livers, hearts, kidneys, lungs and 
pancreases. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, released by the Department of Health and Human  
Services, reflect a host of concerns voiced by transplant surgeons 
and centers over the last year and a half. They make clear, for 
instance, that organs should not be wasted by shipping them coast 
to coast or futilely transplanting them into dying patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But the regulation still gives the HHS secretary ultimate power  
to approve or veto any allocation scheme and would still require an 
overhaul of the current system. 
</P>
<P>
	Transplant officials said they would continue to fight the  
regulation, despite some improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary continues to insist on having the final word on  
decisions relating to the allocation of organs,'' said a statement 
from Dr. Ronald W. Busuttil, president of the American Society of 
Transplant Surgeons. ``These are medical decisions ... The 
secretary should not be making medical decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organs are now allocated within arbitrary geographic lines,  
offering donated organs to patients within local communities, even 
if there are sicker patients elsewhere. The system helps ensure a 
reliable supply of organs, particularly livers, for transplant 
programs across the country, and programs across the country have 
rallied to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation requires that organs be allocated according to  
medical need, with the sickest patients getting first chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Transplant officials objected to both the details of the  
proposal, and to the secretary's prerogative to control the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, they feared it would mean one national list, with  
organs needlessly flying across the country. So Monday's revision 
makes it clear that the distribution should be ``over as broad a 
geographic area as feasible,'' and says all policies should be 
written ``in accordance with sound medical judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said Monday that the revisions were  
meant to clarify what the department wanted all along. ``Members of 
the transplant community read it one way when we actually thought 
we were pretty clear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the transplant  
system under an HHS contract, said it still has concerns with the 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, on its own, the network has moved closer to the HHS  
position. This year, for instance, it required that donated livers 
be given to the sickest patients within large regions, bypassing 
the local level. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that modest experiment demonstrated how tricky allocation  
policy can be in a nation where some 66,000 patients await 
transplants and nearly 5,000 die each year waiting. In this case, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota objected to 
sharing their livers with Illinois, fearing Chicago's large 
hospitals would grab all the available livers because they have so 
many of the sickest patients. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS issued the initial regulation last year, but it was put on  
hold by Congress for one year. That moratorium expires next week, 
though it may be extended. Meanwhile, Congress is considering a 
complete overhaul of transplant law that would strip HHS of 
virtually all power over substantive policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised rule is set to take effect in about 30 days.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, in line with July recommendations from the prestigious  
Institute of Medicine, the new regulations no longer require the 
allocation system to consider the amount of time a patient has been 
waiting for a transplant. And they establish an expert advisory 
committee to help guide HHS policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recommendations include safeguards to ensure that  
hospitals are not unfairly listing their patients as sicker than 
they actually are in order to get organs quicker.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Millwood Confidence Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- During the playoffs a year ago, Kevin Millwood  
was the forgotten man. No more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves' right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.68 ERA during  
the season. And he has been a key in the postseason on a rotation 
featuring NL Cy Young award winners Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and 
John Smoltz. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood beat the New York Mets 4-3 in Game 2 of the National  
League Championship Series. On Tuesday night, he can win the series 
clincher at Turner Field. He will be facing Al Leiter, a 1-0 loser 
in Game 3 to Tom Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence is about as high as it's been,'' Millwood said.  
``I think the last game I pitched here against New York probably 
gave me more confidence than the game I pitched against Houston, 
for the simple fact that I didn't have my best stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2 against New York, Millwood went 7 1-3 innings, giving  
up five hits, three runs, two of them earned. He walked one and 
struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2 of the division playoff against Houston, the  
24-year-old pitcher threw a one-hitter as Atlanta took that 
best-of-5 series in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood was 1-0 with a 1.20 ERA in 15 innings against the Mets  
during the season. He's not about to start experimenting at this 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they'll do anything different or not. I'm not  
going to do anything different until they make me,'' he said. ``And 
I think I've pretty much pitched the same way all year long against 
these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood pitched pretty well last season, too, winning 17 games  
in his first full season as the No. 5 starter. But when the 
postseason came he was shunted to the bullpen behind Maddux, 
Glavine, Smoltz and Denny Neagle. He never pitched as the Braves 
won three straight from Chicago in the division series and lost the 
NLCS in six games to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys had the experience. I think everybody expected them  
to start,'' he said. ``We went with the guys that had been pitching 
out of the pen all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York has come back after dropping the first three games of  
the best-of-7 series to win the last two, including Sunday's 4-3 
win in 15 innings. They are attempting to become the first team to 
win a postseason series after losing the first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, however, will be facing a hot pitcher and playing in a  
stadium where they have lost seven in a row and are 1-13 the last 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood won his last six decisions during the season. In  
addition to his one-hitter against the Astros, he also saved Game 4 
with a hitless ninth as the Braves advanced to the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he can send the Braves to the World Series.  
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely don't want it to go to a seventh game,'' he  
said. ``But on the other hand, if we do, we still like our 
chances.''

<HEADLINE>  Habibie Determined To Win Election </HEADLINE>

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Despite widespread criticism of his  
government, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said today he is 
determined to win this week's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told students to stop staging violent, anti-government  
protests. Thousands of students have taken to the streets in a 
series of demonstrations over the past week, protesting everything 
from Habibie's presidential candidacy to Australia's role in the 
East Timor crisis.

country's highest legislative body, will decide who will be 
Indonesia's leader for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say goodbye. I don't want to bid farewell,''  
Habibie said in an emotional speech to several hundred soldiers and 
police at a national monument in central Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that as Indonesia's commander-in-chief, he expects  
the security forces to prevent protesters from storming parliament 
or closing the city's business district, no matter what the outcome 
of the election. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after he spoke, about 5,000 students demanding the  
election of Habibie's main rival, opposition leader Megawati 
Sukarnoputri, filled a main traffic circle in Jakarta, protesting 
noisily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be here until Mega becomes president. If she isn't  
elected, we will start a revolution,'' said Zaenal Surrahman, one 
of many students wearing red, the color of Megawati's party. Other 
students waved red banners. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate demonstration in the city's business district,  
about 1,000 white-collar workers gathered to protest against 
Habibie. 
</P>
<P>
	At a third site, 500 soldiers closed Jakarta's main road,  
pushing about 100 protesters near Atmajaya University down a side 
street. Last week, students threw Molotov cocktails in this same 
spot in a clash with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie is one of three candidates for the presidency.  
Appointed, not elected, he took over 16 months ago when his 
authoritarian predecessor and mentor, President Suharto, was forced 
by protests and riots to quit after 32 years of iron-fisted rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie introduced basic democratic changes, but his popularity  
has sunk because of his close ties to Suharto and his handling of 
the East Timor crisis. He has also been criticized for a banking 
corruption scandal linked to his inner circle and Indonesia's huge 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, in his last speech to the legislators before  
Wednesday's vote, Habibie insisted that many of Indonesia's 
problems were the legacy of past dictatorial leaders. Nevertheless, 
he admitted he had made mistakes in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, Habibie made a required ``accountability''  
speech that outlined the achievements of his administration. It was 
widely criticized by the legislators in a lively, free-speech 
debate that never would have been allowed by Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice last week, police and soldiers had to fire tear gas and  
plastic bullets to disperse large, anti-Habibie demonstrations 
outside parliament and in the business district. Dozens of people 
were hospitalized or arrested in the clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Megawati -- daughter of Sukarno, the country's  
first president -- Habibie is expected to face one other candidate 
Wednesday: Abdurrahman Wahid, founder of the Muslim-oriented 
National Awakening Party and leader of Indonesia's largest Islamic 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie's ruling Golkar Party still could withdraw his  
nomination if the legislators reject the content of his 
accountability speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's party and three others have said they will reject it.  
They control just under half the assembly seats. Golkar and the 
assembly's military faction, which controls 27 percent, and other

<HEADLINE>  Habibie Determined To Win Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Despite widespread criticism of his  
government, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said today he is 
determined to win this week's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told students to stop staging violent, anti-government  
protests. Thousands of students have taken to the streets in a 
series of demonstrations over the past week, protesting everything 
from Habibie's presidential candidacy to Australia's role in the 
East Timor crisis.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Support for Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans are confident in their nation's  
military, but they are divided over whether U.S. troops should be 
used as peacekeepers in distant lands, an Associated Press poll 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two-thirds, 64 percent, of the people in a poll conducted  
for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa., said they had a good deal of 
confidence in the U.S. military, and an additional 28 percent 
expressed some confidence. Only 7 percent had little or no 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	While defense officials fear the American public may be  
experiencing a ``disconnect'' with the military, the poll suggests 
a big question in people's minds is how the forces should be used. 
</P>
<P>
	About half in the poll, 49 percent, said they supported the use  
of U.S. troops as peacekeepers in such places as Bosnia and East 
Timor, while 42 percent opposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to keep peace or we'll all be at war,'' said Sheila  
Hudson, 50, of Tulsa, Okla. But, like many others, 51-year-old 
machinist Ira Smith of Jacksonville, Fla., doubted whether 
peacekeeping in faroff lands is an appropriate role for American 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I oppose using troops as peacekeepers,'' said Smith. ``I don't  
think the United States should be the world police. Our tax money 
should be used for protecting our own citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,011 people suggested that those 65 and older were  
most likely to oppose the peacekeeper role, with only one-third 
thinking that was a good idea. Democrats were more likely than 
Republicans, 58 percent to 39 percent, to support the peacekeeping 
missions that President Clinton has ordered several times. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted Sept. 17-24 and has an error margin of  
plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen has suggested the American  
public may feel a ``disconnect'' with the armed forces and he fears 
that may be undermining support for those in uniform. The culture 
gap, some say, isolates the military from the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, Cohen began a campaign to ``reconnect'' America  
to its military, an effort he felt was needed to boost 
understanding of and support for the 1.4 million men and women on 
active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the public appears to be supportive of spending as much  
or more on defense as the country now spends. 
</P>
<P>
	In the AP poll, 47 percent said defense spending should be kept  
about the same, 34 percent wanted higher spending and 12 percent 
wanted less. Defense spending for the current budget year is set at 
$270 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a strong military,'' says Bruce Morrison, a  
52-year-old former member of the Army Reserve who served six months 
on active duty during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison, interviewed while working at a roadside stand near  
Blaine, Wash., said he thought the military enjoys strong public 
support and has become more closely linked to civilian society 
since it became all-volunteer a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ira Smith, who was a Vietnam War protester in his youth, said  
his confidence in the military is based on the belief that U.S. 
military technology is more advanced than that of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Thursday signed a defense spending bill  
that included a pay raise, which nearly four out of five in the 
poll said they support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support it, I know what they go through -- the mental stress  
alone,'' said Gale Ensey, a Texas housewife who says friends of 
hers have served in the military. ``They deserve all the benefits 
they get afterwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent across-the-board raise is effective Jan. 1 and a  
change in pay scales takes place next July, representing the 
biggest increase in compensation in a generation, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll asked whether people would support a son or daughter's  
plan to enter the military. Sixty-six percent said they would be 
supportive, and 29 percent said they would suggest a different line 
of work. Five percent didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would have supported them, but probably not  
enthusiastically,'' said retired St. Louis dentist Ted Lingo, whose 
grown children didn't choose to serve in the military. ``I think I 
raised them to make good decisions.''

<HEADLINE> Moody's Skeptical About Asia Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Sovereign credit ratings in Malaysia, Thailand  
and Indonesia won't return to single-A status anytime soon because 
of weak prospects for sustainable economic growth, an official from 
Moody's Investors Service said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings agency is ``generally positive'' about sovereign  
credit in the region but ``remains skeptical in the medium term'' 
about economic prospects, said Kenneth Pinkes, Moody's chief U.S. 
credit officer. He spoke at a seminar at the East Asia Economic 
Summit being held here. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's currently rates Malaysia Baa3 with a positive outlook.  
Indonesia is rated B3 stable, and Thailand stands at Ba1 with a 
positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acute phase of the crisis has passed . . . and the  
immediate risks of default have declined substantially,'' Pinkes 
said. But he added that there were questions about future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a sustained economic recovery in Japan is unlikely if  
the government's massive fiscal stimulus measures aren't 
accompanied by industrial restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, sooner rather than later, the Japanese  
government will have to rein in expenditure,'' Pinkes added. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is concern that a downturn in the United States will  
have widespread global ramifications. Although inter-regional trade 
is important, Asia is highly dependent on trade flows to and from 
the United States, Japan and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Downward Spiral Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The dazed looks on their faces didn't  
completely disappear one day after their latest painful defeat. The 
New York Jets are 1-5 and sinking, and they can't get a good grip 
on what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's the time of the season -- the approach of Halloween --  
that had some players blaming the metaphysical for their woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of bad things this year,'' said nose tackle  
Jason Ferguson, a victim of one of those bad things, a sprained 
ankle that cost him three games. ``There was a lot of good last 
year. It's like there's a cloud over us. There's definitely a cloud 
over this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bizarre,'' added cornerback Aaron Glenn.  
</P>
<P>
	Labeled a Super Bowl favorite heading into the season after  
making the AFC title game in 1998, the Jets have been ravaged by 
injuries. They've also been plagued by poor decisions on and off 
the field, by players and coaches. In six games, they've made as 
many mental and physical errors, from Parcells down to the rookie 
special-teamers, as they did all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once, in a second-week loss to Buffalo, have they been  
dominated. But they can't make the key play that turns games in 
their favor, and even when things are going well -- as they did in 
the first half of Sunday's 16-13 loss to Indianapolis -- the Jets 
self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
	At no time did they fall apart worse than against the Colts. In  
position to break a 13-13 tie, they moved from midfield to the 
Indianapolis 3 on runs by Curtis Martin. Then Parcells opted for a 
pass by untested Ray Lucas, in his first start, to the left corner. 
Cornerback Jeff Burris stepped in front of Keyshawn Johnson for the 
interception and sprinted 55 yards. Indianapolis moved downfield 
for a winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The few players who made themselves available Monday still  
seemed stunned by that play; by Parcells' decision to start Lucas 
over Rick Mirer -- he didn't let the players know until 2 1/2 hours 
before gametime; and by yet another injury, this time Lucas 
spraining his left ankle on the final play of the game. He's out 
3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each loss we get, we lose a player,'' safety Victor Green  
said. ``It's unbelievable the way we continue to lose players, 
whether it's for one, two, three games or the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Glenn: ``It's bizarre because of the way we're having the  
injuries. Ray on the last play. Kevin Williams ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was placed on the reserve, non-football injury list  
with a severe case of strep throat that sent him to the hospital. 
He is done for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Add that to losing quarterback Vinny Testaverde (torn Achilles'  
tendon), running back-kick returner Leon Johnson, linebacker Chad 
Cascadden (torn knee ligaments) and cornerback Otis Smith (broken 
collarbone), all gone for the season. And wideout Wayne Chrebet, 
who returned against Indianapolis after missing five games with a 
broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever seen it like this,'' said  
punter-quarterback Tom Tupa, who, with Lucas out, could wind up 
starting if Parcells refuses to go back to the sputtering Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said Monday he expects to start Mirer in Oakland this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing after another, it seems every week something  
happens,'' he said. ``You go into the game with the mindset of 
winning, not thinking of the next guy going down. There's been a 
lot of hard luck this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my 12th in the league and it's probably the most I've  
seen. This is particularly a lot for any club.''

<HEADLINE> J.P. Morgan Profits Almost Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With profits almost tripling in the third  
quarter, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. said Monday it would purchase up to $3 
billion of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan posted net income of $442 million, or $2.22 a share,  
beating analysts' estimates by 7 cents a share. The results were 
far better than the $156 million, or 75 cents a share, J.P. Morgan 
earned in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based commercial and investment bank had a 53  
percent jump in revenues to $1.99 billion from $1.3 billion in the 
year-ago period. Expenses fell $330 million in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our performance this year marks an important milestone in our  
strategic shift toward a less capital intensive business model,'' 
Douglas A. Warner III, company chairman, said in a statement. ``The 
earnings engine we have built in our core business, combined with 
our focus on capital and expense productivity, allows us to return 
significant capital to shareholders and, importantly, retain more 
than enough to pursue significant future growth opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan said it would buy back about 27 million of its  
shares, based on current prices, over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Stock repurchase programs improve a company's earnings per share, 
and thus its stock price, by reducing the number of shares 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has almost completed the $750 million stock buyback  
program announced last December, but the effects were offset by the 
stock options issued to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, J.P. Morgan plans to increase its quarterly  
dividend by 1 penny to $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors liked the news, and sent the company's shares up  
$7.31 1/4 to $113 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, J.P. Morgan reported net income of  
$1.55 billion, or $7.76 a share, vs. $874 million, or $4.28 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $6.67 billion, up from $5.45 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Iran Still a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Despite President Mohammad Khatami's  
efforts to modernize Iran, the country continues to sponsor 
terrorism and remains a threat to its neighbors, U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who arrived in this Persian Gulf island-state Monday,  
told reporters that the Iranian policies are hindering the 
establishment of normal relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been encouraged ... by President Khatami's attempts to  
modernize Iran to appeal to a younger group of people who want to 
see changes in Iran,'' Cohen said. ``We would like to establish a 
better relationship with Iran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made several overtures to indicate we would like to  
see that relationships become normal, but only if they meet three 
conditions,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions are that Iran should stop terrorist activities,  
stop undermining the Mideast peace process and stop trying to 
acquire weapons of mass destruction. Iran rejects the U.S. 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not seen any evidence of improvement in those three  
areas,'' said Cohen, who is on a 9-day tour of eight countries in 
the region including Egypt and Israel. He is expected to fly to 
Doha, Qatar on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a U.S. State Department official said that the  
United States wants to hold talks with Iran ``on the basis of 
equality and mutual respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Iran rejected the proposal Saturday, saying America's  
``hostile measures'' cannot be corrected or compensated with words. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations when the  
1979 Islamic revolution overthrew the pro-U.S. shah of Iran and 
installed the clerical government still in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes of a rapprochement grew after Khatami, a moderate cleric,  
came to power in August 1997 and spoke of warmer relations with 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the optimism faded as Khatami became embroiled in a power  
struggle with hard-line clerics, who reject any contact with the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Reeves Cracks Down on Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Six games into a miserable season, Atlanta  
Falcons coach Dan Reeves has let each player know everyone's job is 
on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to evaluate every single situation on our  
football team,'' Reeves said Monday. ``As I said, some of them, we 
don't have the ability to make any changes. Some of them, we will 
look at and we probably will have some changes or give people more 
playing time to see if they can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, who play at Pittsburgh on Monday night, fell to 1-5  
with an embarrassing 41-13 loss to St. Louis on Sunday. They 
committed three turnovers, 10 penalties and rushed for 41 yards as 
the Rams beat Atlanta this year by a combined score of 76-20. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons now have the worst record in the NFC, the conference  
they represented in the Super Bowl in January. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now virtually impossible that Atlanta, which fell 4 1/2 games  
behind the Rams (5-0), can win the NFC West. In their 33 previous 
years, the Falcons have never had consecutive winning seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anytime you come into a game with that much  
significance in it, you would like to come out and play well -- in 
particular when you had lost to this team early in the year,'' 
Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are usually four or five plays that make a difference in  
a game. We have now increased it to about 10 to 12 plays because we 
are making mistakes on that many plays that are really giving the 
other team an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day following every game, the Falcons customarily hold a  
brief team meeting and watch film of the special teams' play. 
Players spend the majority of the time with their position coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves decided Monday to keep the entire team together and watch  
film from Sunday's debacle. It marked the first time in his 2 1/2 
years in Atlanta he made such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want them to understand the problems,'' he said. ``A  
lot of times you play defensively and think the offense was at 
fault. The offense thinks the defense was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want everybody to see, because if we don't see it, they  
don't know. They see it on the sideline during the game, but you 
don't get an appreciation for it -- how close you may be or how far 
away you are from being a pretty good football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive tackle Bob Whitfield, a starter in the Falcons' last  
102 games, insisted the veterans must work hard to ensure the team 
doesn't give up with 10 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to curse people out,'' Whitfield said. ``We've  
got to lead by example. I don't think anybody needs to 
finger-point. We're not here just to collect a paycheck. We're here 
to win.''

<HEADLINE> China Nuke Plant Resumes Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese nuclear power plant has resumed  
operations and reached full power following an overhaul to correct 
problems that had caused damage to its fuel rods, the official 
newspaper China Daily reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems at the Qinshan nuclear plant, in Zhejiang province  
50 miles south of Shanghai, were detected after operators shut the 
reactor down in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese engineers found bits of nuts, bolts, and tubing at the  
bottom of the reactor vessel, as well as extensive damage to some 
instruments and supports, possibly caused by the broken nuts and 
bolts flying around in flows of coolant, according to a U.S. 
official who visited the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Daily report said that a minute part of the fuel rods  
were damaged, but that there was no risk of radiation leaking out 
because the reactor was protected by several ``safe, strong and 
impenetrable shields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After trying to fix the damage themselves, China asked  
U.S.-based Westinghouse Electric Co. to do the repairs. The 
newspaper report said specialists had redesigned and replaced the 
failed components and made modifications to the whole plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem was a mechanical hitch and we have solved it,'' it  
quoted Lin Deshun, the plant's general manager, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Qinshan, which went into operation two years behind schedule in  
1991, is touted as China's first domestically designed and built 
nuclear power plant. It is one of two Chinese nuclear power 
facilities. The other, a twin-plant facility at Daya Bay in 
southern Guangdong province, was built with French assistance. 
Another eight commercial plants are under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	China's nuclear facilities have been ordered to conduct  
inspections of all equipment, operational procedures and employees 
following an accident at a nuclear fuel processing plant in 
Tokaimura, Japan, last month that exposed about 70 people to high 
levels of radiation.

<HEADLINE> Texas To Sue Over Sweepstakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas became the ninth state to sue  
Publishers Clearing House over its sweepstakes Monday, saying its 
advertising was deceptive and primarily duped senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed in Travis County asks for damages and an  
injunction against the Port Washington, N.Y.-based company. Texas 
Attorney General John Cornyn called the company's mailings ``letter 
bombs, filled with deceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state accuses the company of creating a false sense of  
urgency; inflating the likelihood of winning by sending people 
simulated checks, deposit slips and tax forms; and asking people to 
return a map telling the Prize Patrol how to get to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers Clearing House spokesman Chris Irving called the  
claims ``completely inaccurate and 100 percent untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irving said the company has done what it can to fight  
misperceptions about the sweepstakes. He also said company 
officials were disappointed because they had reached ``a handshake 
agreement'' on a settlement with the attorney general last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn said he decided not to settle with the company because  
``every time we pin them down and get them to stop one particular 
type of deceptive act what they do is try to wire around it and 
find some exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri,  
Washington and Wisconsin are also suing Publishers Clearing House.

<HEADLINE> Real Income Rises in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Bank of Mexico's successful fight against  
inflation has given workers a substantial boost in real income this 
year. But next year may be a different story. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say the farther inflation expectations fall, the less  
likely it is that wage hikes for the year 2000 will outstrip 
consumer prices as they did in 1999. While increases in unionized 
wage contracts averaged 17.5 percent this year, consumer prices are 
estimated to have risen 13 percent or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Even minimum-wage earners appear to have come out ahead with the  
14 percent increase the were granted in December 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers still have substantially less purchasing power than they  
did in 1994, when the peso was sharply devalued and a resulting 
recession cut average wages by about 50 percent in real terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased real wages are expected to help boost consumption  
next year and contribute to a 5 percent growth in gross domestic 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	But workers are unlikely to see that much real wage growth next  
year, mostly because of the Bank of Mexico's newfound credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's ``nominal wage increases were so high because the  
private sector did not believe the 13 percent official inflation 
target,'' Hector Chavez, Mexico economist for Santander Investment, 
noted in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
	Helped by a favorable international environment, currency  
stability and even climatic factors, the Bank of Mexico is now seen 
likely to beat this year's forecast and meet next year's, which 
private economists are forecasting at 11.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray Newman, Mexican economist for Merrill Lynch, said the  
central bank would like wage increases follow the same trends as 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If workers try to keep wages above levels the central bank is  
aiming for, the central bank will have to hike rates further to get 
expectations down. And that hurts workers and employment growth,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ismael Gonzalez, an economist at ING Barings in Mexico City,  
said there's no danger of wage-driven inflation. Manufacturing 
wages, he said, represent only 20 percent of the economy. And while 
``real salaries are growing this year, we still have an important 
lag.''

<HEADLINE> Huard Likely To Start for Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino is still complaining about a pain  
in the neck, and he doesn't mean coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's availability this week is in doubt because of a bone  
spur in his lower neck discovered Monday. Backup quarterback Damon 
Huard will likely make his first NFL start Sunday for the Miami 
Dolphins against the Philadelphia Eagles, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the switch at quarterback is ironic because  
Johnson threatened two weeks ago to bench Marino. The future Hall 
of Famer went to the sideline in the first quarter Sunday at New 
England, but only because shoulder spasms hindered the velocity and 
distance of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard rallied the Dolphins to a 31-30 victory, boosting them  
ahead of the Patriots into first place in the AFC East at 4-1. The 
win left Johnson in a buoyant mood Monday, in sharp contrast to 
last week after his feud with Marino erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to stir up anything,'' Johnson said. ``But for  
anybody that would listen -- and I don't think the media listen 
sometimes -- Damon is an outstanding quarterback who will win a lot 
of games in this league. I've said that for the past two years, and 
no one has noticed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huard, 26, is a third-year pro who had thrown just nine passes  
in the NFL before Sunday. He overcame a Miami-record nine sacks 
against New England, completing 24 of 42 passes for 240 yards and 
two touchdowns, including the game-winner with 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, 38, underwent an extensive examination Monday, including  
an MRI and a C-T scan, and team physician Dr. John Uribe found a 
small bone spur on the right side of the lower neck. Uribe said the 
spur is the apparent source of spasms and muscle weakness between 
the neck and shoulder that began bothering Marino last week. The 
bone spur won't require surgery after the season, the Dolphins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who has started 49 consecutive games since undergoing  
ankle surgery in 1996, received an epidural injection and will 
continue taking anti-inflammatory medication. He'll sit out 
practice until at least Thursday and may try to throw then. 
</P>
<P>
	Players had Monday off and were unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``In all probability Damon will start against Philadelphia,''  
Johnson said. ``We'll just have to see what Dan can do. There's not 
a lot of pain, but he doesn't have any strength throwing the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson denied that a quarterback controversy is brewing and  
said Marino remains No. 1. But Marino won't return to the lineup 
until he's 100 percent, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan is going to want to play even if he's got no arms,''  
Johnson said. ``That doesn't mean he's the right one to win games 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was delighted by the increased mobility Huard gave  
Miami. He out-rushed the Patriots, gaining 54 yards on the ground, 
and scrambled several times before making big completions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots blitzed relentlessly, and Johnson blamed their nine  
sacks on Huard's inexperience and injuries in the offensive line. 
The Dolphins will add some rollouts to the game plan if Huard 
starts Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get out of the pocket,'' Johnson said. ``When  
they don't know where you're going to be standing, it makes it 
difficult to blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have it covered and the protection breaks down, Damon  
will scramble. Doug Flutie has made a living on this thing. He's 
not Flutie, because he throws the ball a lot better than Flutie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And how does Johnson compare Huard and Marino? Stay tuned.

<HEADLINE> Elarton To Undergo Shoulder Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros pitcher Scott Elarton will undergo  
shoulder surgery, but the team is unsure where or when that will 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Gerry Hunsicker said Monday a second medical  
opinion showed Elarton's rotator cuff was partially torn, and the 
club was deciding when and where to schedule the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first full season in the majors, the 6-foot-7  
right-hander went 9-5 with a 3.48 ERA over 42 games. In 15 starts, 
Elarton was 4-3 with a 3.83 ERA. In relief, he was 5-2 with a 2.75 
ERA and one save. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Elarton made a team-high 27 appearances from the  
bullpen over the first half of the season before moving into the 
starting rotation on July 3. He made two relief appearances against 
the Atlanta Braves in the National League division series. 
</P>
<P>
	The team expects Elarton to be completely healed by the start of  
spring training.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today vetoed a $12.6 billion  
foreign aid bill as inadequate and called on Republican 
congressional leaders to join the administration in seeking a 
solution to the budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to sit down and do it together,'' the president told  
reporters in the Cabinet Room. He said he would sign another 
emergency spending measure to keep the government running beyond 
Thursday, but that it should be a short-term measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to put politics aside and seek common ground,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to make tough choices and we're going to  
have to make them together,'' Clinton said. ``Inaction is not an 
option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said Republicans were shortchanging spending needs  
on education, the environment and foreign policy affairs, including 
U.S. obligations under the Wye River Mideast peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton will refuse to  
sign other spending bills passed by Republicans, but instead would 
would invite congressional leaders to White House for a meeting 
this week ``to figure out a way to get out of the box created by 
appropriators to date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the congressional leadership will join me,'' the president  
said, ``we can make this a season of real progress for our 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign aid bill passed over loud opposition from Democrats  
and the White House, who claim it shortchanges important American 
foreign policy interests such as furthering the Mideast peace deal 
known as Wye River. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't meet the president's priorities,'' Lockhart said.  
``Wye River is certainly an important element to that, and it is an 
important part of continuing to exercise U.S. leadership around the 
world. We can't expect nations in troubled parts of the world, like 
the Middle East, to move forward with their peace process when we 
won't meet the commitments we've made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said a veto of the defense spending bill may be on the  
way. ``That is under consideration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is beyond what the president requested, and there are  
also a number of gimmicks in it. They make operations and 
maintenance an emergency. The Pentagon is a pretty big building, 
but I don't know if you can go over there ... and find one person 
who considers the operations and maintenance of armed forces an 
emergency,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's foreign aid veto, the 28th of his presidency, will  
likely stand. The bill only narrowly cleared the House with a vote 
of 214-211, and the Senate with a vote of 51-49. A two-thirds vote 
in both houses is needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, in a statement prepared in  
anticipation of Clinton's veto, said that the extra money Clinton 
wants can only be obtained by raiding the Social Security trust 
fund. He called that ``wrong and irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will not use Social Security as a pot of gold to fund  
foreign aid,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, chairman of the House Foreign Operations  
subcommittee, said Republicans Congress have sent a consistent 
message that ``we will not raid Social Security, nor will we agree 
to raise taxes, to pay for increased foreign aid spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As passed by Congress, the aid bill provides $2 billion less  
than Clinton sought and none of the $500 million down payment he 
had sought to help Israel and the Palestinians carry out the peace 
accord negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. In all, Clinton has 
pledged $1.8 billion in U.S. support for the Mideast peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides significantly less money than Clinton  
requested for international debt relief, the Peace Corps and for 
efforts to reduce the nuclear threat from North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When the possibility of a veto was first voiced earlier in the  
month, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations panel on foreign operations, said it could shut off 
$735 million in aid to former Soviet Republics, $285 million in 
narcotics-fighting assistance and $180 million to combat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	However, foreign aid likely would continue to flow at current  
levels as part of stopgap spending legislation that covers agencies 
and departments for which there has been no appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also had complained that the legislation cuts  
many economic assistance programs, including those for poor 
countries in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	And it eliminated a $241 million State Department program to  
help find work for former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists in an 
attempt to make sure they do not sell their services to rogue 
states attempting to develop nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Boston Papers Rip Unruliness, Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Newspapers reacted angrily today to blown calls by  
umpires and unruly fan behavior during the New York Yankees' 9-2 
defeat of the Red Sox in Game 4 of the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robbed again,'' read the banner headline in the Boston Herald,  
accompanied by a photo showing Yankees second baseman Chuck 
Knoblauch missing the tag on Boston's Jose Offerman in the bottom 
of the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpire Tim Tschida called Offerman out, ending a Red Sox rally  
and marking the beginning of the team's deeper descent to its third 
loss in the best-of-7 series. Tschida later admitted he made a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very integrity of major league baseball is now in  
question, because it has detailed a six-man umpiring crew for the 
ALCS that a) can't get its calls right, and b) has lost control of 
what's happening on the field,'' wrote Steve Buckley of the Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe focused on the Fenway fans' response to another  
questionable call in the bottom of the ninth, when Nomar 
Garciaparra led off with a grounder to third baseman Scott Brosius 
and first-base umpire Dale Scott called Garciaparra out. Replays 
showed he beat the throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Red Sox -- and fans -- lose it,'' read a front-page headline.  
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams was ejected after running onto the  
field to protest and throwing his cap. Play was halted while more 
than a dozen police and security staff took the field after fans 
pelted the outfield with trash, including bottles and a batting 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	John Harrington, the team's chief operating officer, said today  
that such behavior is not tolerated at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``A very small group in a crowd of more than 33,000 people  
behaved outrageously, inappropriately and uncharacteristically for 
Red Sox fans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe ran a front-page photo of Williams turning away in  
disgust from Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre called the fan reaction  
``disgraceful.'' Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino issued a statement 
today apologizing for the ``inappropriate behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herald columnist Michael Gee said the fan conduct was ``a  
disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A certain number of the 33,596 fans at Fenway Park couldn't  
hold their liquor. Or maybe they were born pigs,'' he wrote. ``Each 
and every person reading this should be ashamed for what some of 
his neighbors did last night. If you love sports, you should be 
sickened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Globe sports writer Dan Shaughnessy described the game as ``a  
hail of errors, bad umpiring, and worse conduct by Boston fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary,'' he wrote. ``Police were unable to stop dozens  
of unruly spectators from tossing things and the reigning world 
champion Yankees cleared the field while officials weighed the 
merits of resuming the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that Babe Ruth's 82-year-old daughter was  
scheduled to throw out the first pitch tonight ``assuming she feels 
safe enough.''

<HEADLINE> New Technology May Automate Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSWELL, Ga. (AP) -- No more waiting around to have the gas or  
electricity turned on. No more uniformed meter readers traipsing 
through your prized roses. And soda machines that can let their 
owners at headquarters know when they're empty. 
</P>
<P>
	A suburban Atlanta company is marketing Israeli radio technology  
that would automate hundreds of functions that could make these and 
other possibilities a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep coming up with new applications for this, and I just  
don't see an end to it,'' said Ron Sewell, president of Automated 
Network Solutions. ``It will work with anything that counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology is actually owned by Nexus, an Israeli company  
that originally developed it for military use. 
</P>
<P>
	Unregulated radio frequencies transmit short-range signals  
across a network consisting of 5-foot-high receiving antennas. 
Other companies such as wireless telephone company Nextel 
Communications Inc. are using similar technology for two-way 
communication, but ANS is bringing it to machines instead of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sewell, the former Commissioner of Public Works in Lexington,  
Ky., said the fit between the technology and utilities was a 
natural. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way, we can continuously monitor usage and predict peak  
usage much more accurately,'' Sewell said. ``And any utility can 
buy into creating the network, and thereby create a revenue stream 
by letting other people use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, ANS and Nexus installed a pilot project for  
Atlanta Gas Light Co. in Marietta and in southwest Atlanta, 
mounting devices about the size of a deck of cards onto existing 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	One receiver had a range of nine miles, while the information  
received as frequently as every second is much more detailed than 
anything that can be collected by a human meter reader. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AGL people have tried to bring our system to its knees and  
they still can't,'' said Sewell, describing the vigorous testing. 
</P>
<P>
	ANS is considering installing networks in Atlanta, Columbia,  
S.C., Memphis, Tenn., Baltimore and Washington, D.C. A typical 
network costs about $2 million, compared with cellular networks 
which can cost 25 times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	Sewell said the devices on the meters can be made to turn on and  
off gas, electricity, cable television, water or anything else from 
another location, while helping technicians pinpoint trouble spots 
more accurately. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to utilities, Sewell said the technology can be used  
to monitor and control anything from soda machines to home security 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	ANS has yet to sign up a full-time customer.  
</P>
<P>
	A test project for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. found one vending  
machine was four sodas short after a delivery, Sewell said. The 
Coca-Cola worker then pulled the sodas out of her bag and said she 
had bought them on the way over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Gordon, CEO of Ifleet, Inc., said his client PepsiCo Inc.  
was equally impressed, especially since most soda trucks bring back 
an average of 50 percent of their stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can get real-time updates of which machines have what in  
stock, and load their trucks appropriately and increase 
productivity tenfold,'' said Gordon, whose Alpharetta company

	GOP Leaders To Meet Clinton on Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders accepted  
President Clinton's White House invitation to hold budget talks 
tomorrow following his veto of a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill as 
inadequate. GOP leaders said they would insist that no taxes are 
raised and that using Social Security's surpluses to pay for 
remaining fiscal 2000 spending bills is ruled out. House Majority 
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Republicans consider the surpluses 
issue ``the highest goal of our budget season.''

	Albright Urges Sierra Leone Peace  
</P>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright called on political leaders in Sierra Leone today to stick 
by a peace agreement negotiated after an eight-year civil war in 
which anti-government rebels committed widespread atrocities. 
During her several-hour stop, Albright also witnessed the effects 
of the war firsthand by visiting a camp where 516 wounded Sierra 
Leoneans are being treated. All lost limbs during the conflict, 
mostly the result of machete-weilding insurgents.

	Irene Rain Likely To Flood N.C.  
</P>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- The nearly 1 foot of rain dropped by  
Hurricane Irene is all but guaranteed to bring another round of 
flooding to North Carolina later this week, with people still 
reeling from Hurricane Floyd a month ago. Barely hurricane 
strength, Irene soaked North Carolina's soggy coastal plain 
yesterday with up to 11 inches of rain before veering out into the 
Atlantic without ever coming ashore. By late day, Irene was 200 
miles south-southeast of Cape Sable, Nova Scotia.

	Ray Vows To Wrap Clinton Case Quickly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Career prosecutor Robert Ray was sworn in  
today to replace Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, vowing to 
finish the five-year $40 million-plus investigation of President 
Clinton and the first lady in a ``prompt, responsible and 
cost-effective manner.'' Ray thanked Starr for his personal 
sacrifice and said his office would carry on the investigation with 
the same professionalism. One of the appointing judges pleaded with 
him to act with ``deliberate speed.''

	Charity Disclosure Debuts on Web  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The public disclosure forms that more than  
200,000 charities fill out each year made their Internet debut 
today, offering an instant look into spending patterns, executive 
pay and other tidbits. The so-called Form 990 that the Internal 
Revenue Service requires non-profit agencies to submit was 
available previously on paper only. Requests can take a month or 
two to fulfill and often cost money for copying and other 
administrative costs. Researchers hope more people will take time 
to learn about charities they give to via the electronic images.

	Mrs. Clinton Opposes Island Bomb Site  
</P>
<P>
	KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called today for an  
immediate and permanent end to the use of a Puerto Rican island as 
a Navy target range. The first lady's comments as came the same day 
that a Pentagon panel, working at the direction of her husband, 
recommended that Navy bombing be allowed to resume on Vieques 
Island, but that use of the facility be phased out over five years.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys remained the most  
popular vehicles among thieves last year, but high-end light trucks 
gained ground as popular targets for pilfering, the National 
Insurance Crime Bureau said today. Accords and Camrys were followed 
by the Chevrolet C/K pickup truck, Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee 
sport utility vehicles, Honda Civic, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Ford 
F-series pickup, Ford Mustang, Dodge Caravan and Toyota Corolla.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, careening through a  
volatile session marked by continued worries about rising interest 
rates and inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 
96.57 at 10,116.28. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,963-1,113. 
Technology stocks fell sharply, bearing the brunt of investors' 
pessimism. The Nasdaq slipped 42.68 to 2,689.15.

	Vikings Troubled Despite Changes  
</P>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota was once a team with Super  
Bowl ambitions. Now, a fourth loss in five weeks has Randy Moss 
wondering whether the Vikings can even reach the playoffs. At 2-4, 
they're heading into a difficult stretch against San Francisco, 
Denver and Dallas without running back Robert Smith, who flew to 
Tampa today for a hernia operation that will sideline him up to six 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Pitt Makes Another QB Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- It's beginning to sound like a double-play  
combination: Priestley to Turman to Priestley. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third time in seven weeks, Pitt coach Walt Harris is  
changing quarterbacks, with opening-day starter David Priestley 
back in the lineup Saturday at Rutgers and former starter John 
Turman back on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who dislikes the two-quarterback system that is sweeping  
Division I-A but can't seem to get away from it, said Priestley had 
earned the right to start after successfully coming off the bench 
the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Priestley took over for Turman with Pittsburgh trailing Syracuse  
24-0 on Oct. 7 and led a 17-point second-half comeback that saw the 
Panthers twice threaten to tie or take the lead in the final 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Priestley, a transfer from Ohio State, replaced Turman again  
Saturday in a 20-16 loss at Boston College and was 20-of-30 for 291 
yards and a touchdown. Priestley has thrown for 424 yards and a 
touchdown in the two games, compared to Turman's 64 yards and no 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our last game, we finally had a quarterback execute within  
the system,'' said Harris, a former NFL assistant coach who doubles 
as the coordinator of a pro-style offense. ``It was executed the 
way he was told to execute it. It was better than it has been all 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turman took over for Priestley in the second quarter of the  
opener against Bowling Green and started the next five games, 
although he didn't make it past halftime of the last two. 
</P>
<P>
	For the season, Priestley is 33-of-63 for 456 yards, one  
touchdown and one interception. Turman is 59-of-107 for 793 yards, 
seven touchdowns and four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, we had guys get us in the end zone but they weren't  
executing the scheme,'' Harris said Monday. ``I thought John 
improved, too, but John had 30 plays against Boston College and put 
nothing on the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turman will play against Rutgers (0-6) only if he has a good  
week of practice, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Priestley, a redshirt sophomore, is displaying more confidence  
and a better throwing arm since being lifted early against Bowling 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest change is within David himself,'' Harris said.  
``He throws it accurately, and he's gotten a lot tougher mentally. 
He's showing the ability to throw the ball quickly and 
accurately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Priestley and Turman, a junior, are underclassmen, so Harris  
would prefer to select one and let him develop within his offense 
for several years. Among the former NFL quarterbacks who once 
played under Harris are Boomer Esiason, Tony Eason and Pete 
Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for a guy who will buy into our system,'' Harris  
said. ``When a guy does, you see guys go on and have good 
careers.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 78.20 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose in early trading today,  
but continuing fears of higher interest rates prevented investors 
from snapping up bargains in the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 78.20 at 10,097.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 0.33 at 1,247.74, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 23.93 at 2,707.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expected investors to seek out buying  
opportunities in the battered market today. Last week, the Dow fell 
630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, in its worst performance in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the factors that drove stocks lower last week  
haven't been resolved. Investors continue to await the latest 
indications of whether inflation is increasing and giving the 
Federal Reserve another reason to raise interest rates for the 
third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomorrow, the Consumer Price Index will provide the next gauge  
of price pressures, and analysts expect trading to remain light 
until that report is released. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, news of strong profit growth lifted several Dow  
stocks. Citigroup rose 7/8 to 43 3/8 after reporting a 229 percent jump 
in profits for the third quarter. The nation's largest financial 
company earned $2.4 billion, or 70 cents a share, beating Wall 
Street's forecast by two cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan soared 3 3/8 to 109 7/8 after saying its third-quarter  
profits nearly tripled. The brokerage earned $2.22 per share, 
beating analysts' estimates by 7 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe that widespread strength in corporate earnings  
could be the catalyst that snaps the market's recent decline. The 
companies that comprise the S&AMP;P 500 are expected to post average 
profit growth of at least 19 percent from last year's third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 94.4 million 
shares, well behind Friday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.96 to 412.74.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower, feeding on last week's  
troubles on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.9 
percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.8 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.9 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was down 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Victories Give Denver Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After a forgettable four weeks that turned the  
defending Super Bowl champions into playoff long shots, the Denver 
Broncos are halfway back to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	Consecutive victories over Oakland and Green Bay have helped the  
Broncos (2-4) regain some of the confidence sapped by the 0-4 
start. Reservations for the Super Bowl in Atlanta, however, remain 
presumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel that our backs are against the wall,'' defensive  
end Harald Hasselbach said Monday. ``We dug a deep hole, and we're 
trying to scratch our way out. We're not out yet. We're coming 
back, and we're getting stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver took a major step Sunday against the Packers, who entered  
the game with the NFL's top offense but dropped to sixth after 
gaining only 133 yards against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	The dominating performance was hardly indicative of a team  
deemed to be ``finished'' after the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here, turmoil seems to just do good things for  
this team,'' defensive end Alfred Williams said. ``You hate to 
resort to turmoil. I wish we would have had turmoil in the 
preseason, so we could have got off to a great start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inexplicably, the Broncos are 2-0 since MVP running back Terrell  
Davis' season-ending knee injury and 1-0 since All-Pro tight end 
Shannon Sharpe broke his left collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Their respective replacements, rookie Olandis Gary and Byron  
Chamberlain accounted for 247 of Denver's 514 yards Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys around here seem to be gritty, and I like that,''  
Williams said. ``I like that a bunch. It's one thing to have 
talent, but it's another thing to have people with talent wanting 
to play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elevated from third-string to starter in a matter of three days,  
Gary has caused a running back controversy. Derek Loville, Davis' 
original backup, has not played the past two weeks because of a 
strained hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Loville may return to practice Wednesday, but there is no  
guarantee he will start Sunday at New England (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for quarterback Bubby Brister, who was demoted in  
preseason and then promoted after Brian Griese struggled through 
the first four weeks. A muscle strain prevented Brister from taking 
over the offense, and Griese has led Denver to two straight 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	While reluctant to name his starting quarterback Monday, coach  
Mike Shanahan made one thing clear. Sentiment will not play a 
factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about everybody's feelings,'' Shanahan said.  
``I've got to do what I think is best for the football team. If 
they can't live with those decisions, then they tell me, and I'll 
let them go to another team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he will name a starting quarterback and running  
back Wednesday. His decision will be easier if Brister and Loville 
are still hampered by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a proponent of anyone losing their job because of  
injury,'' said Gary, who had 124 yards on 37 carries against the 
Packers. ``I still have a lot to learn, and I still want to learn 
from Derek.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Major US Banks See Higher Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three major U.S. banks posted profits for the  
third quarter that beat Wall Street's expectations as the strong 
economy boosted mortgage loans, credit card purchases and fees from 
mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. all  
reported healthy earnings and revenue growth, while also trimming 
expenses over the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common theme is cost cutting, combined with pretty decent  
fee revenue,'' said Michael Ancell, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
Plus, he added, ``customers are still paying off there loans. 
That's made for a pretty good quarter for the big banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at their results:  

</P>
<P>
                            *Citigroup    	
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup reported a 229 percent jump in profits for the third  
quarter as the nation's largest financial company saw business boom 
in its global and investment banking units, which had suffered the 
most during last year's market tumoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup posted net income of $2.4 billion, or 70 cents a  
share, beating Wall Street's forecast by 2 cents a share. The New 
York-based company had net income of $729 million, or 20 cents a 
share in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Citigroup appears to be delivering on the promised  
synergies of the merger between Citibank and Travelers insurance 
group last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citigroup is also well on the way to meeting its goal of  
doubling earnings every five years,'' Richard K. Strauss, an 
analyst for Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's global corporate and investment bank division showed  
a strong rebound for the quarter from the loss in the 1998 period 
that resulted from severe global economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global corporate banking income totaled $461 million vs. a  
loss of $2 million in the third quarter period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney, the company's investment bank, reported  
income of $432 million, a complete turnaround from the $396 million 
loss in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Income from the Citibank's lending operations increased 65  
percent to $604 million. Income from the bank's credit card 
business, one of the largest in country, grew 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, international income grew by about one-third to $270  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors liked the numbers, and bid up Citigroup shares by  
$1.56 1/4 to $43.68 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Citigroup earned $7.25  
billion, or $2.07 a share, a 41 percent jump from $5.13 billion, or 
$1.43 a share, in the year-ago period. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Bank of America    	
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica reported a nearly sixfold increase in third-quarter  
profits as the nation's second-largest bank continued to cut costs 
and reap the benefits of its acquisition by NationsBank last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte, N.C.-based company posted earnings of $2.15  
billion, or $1.23 a share, topping Wall Street's expectations by 
two cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America earned $374 million, or 21 cents a share, during  
the same period a year ago, including a one-time, pre-tax charge of 
$725 million for the cost of integration with NationsBank. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charge, earnings a year ago were $893 million, or  
50 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsBank acquired San Francisco-based BankAmerica in a $43  
billion deal completed September 1998. The merger created a 
coast-to-coast bank with 30 million customer households and $621 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say the bank still has some work to do to combine  
its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsBank was successful in converting BankAmerica's branches  
in Arizona and New Mexico this year, but postponed the rest of the 
conversion to avoid any year-2000 computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to tell,'' said Andrew Collins, an analyst at  
ING Barings. ``The real work to be done has not yet been done,'' 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's noninterest income increased 55 percent to $3.73  
billion in the third quarter on better results in its credit card, 
investment banking and mortgage banking businesses. Fee income grew 
45 percent to $3.28 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared pleased with the bottom line improvement, and  
sent BankAmerica's stock up $1.37 1/2 to $49.56 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, net income was 49 percent  
higher. It totaled $5.98 billion, or $3.37 a share, compared with 
$4 billion, or $2.24 a share, for the same period a year ago. 

</P>
<P>
                            *J.P. Morgan    	
</P>
<P>
	With profits almost tripling in the third quarter, J.P. Morgan &AMP;  
Co. surprised investors Monday by announcing it would purchase up 
to $3 billion of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan posted net income of $442 million, or $2.22 a share,  
beating analysts' estimates by 7 cents a share. The results were 
far better than the $156 million, or 75 cents a share, J.P. Morgan 
earned in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based commercial and investment bank had a 53  
percent jump in revenues to $1.99 billion from $1.3 billion in the 
year-ago period. Expenses fell $330 million in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan's tradional lending business is now overshadowed by  
investment banking business, including stock and bond underwriting, 
money management services, and fees from advising companies on 
mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are almost exiting the more traditional lines of business  
to increasingly focus on investment banking and asset management,'' 
said Collins, the ING Barings analyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan said it would buy back between 14 percent and 15  
percent of its shares over the next 12 to 18 months. Stock 
repurchase programs improve a company's earnings per share, and 
thus its stock price, by reducing the number of shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a huge number,'' Collins said. ``It dwarfs most other  
share repurchases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan has almost completed the $750 million stock buyback  
program announced last December, but the effects were offset by the 
stock options issued to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, J.P. Morgan plans to increase its quarterly  
dividend by 1 penny to $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered the news, and sent the company's shares up  
$7.31 1/4 to $113 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, J.P. Morgan reported net income of  
$1.55 billion, or $7.76 a share, vs. $874 million, or $4.28 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $6.67 billion, up from $5.45 billion.

<HEADLINE> Molinari Leaves Bush for McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just a few months ago, former Rep. Guy Molinari  
called Texas Gov. George W. Bush ``the best candidate the 
Republican Party can put forward for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday, Molinari threw his support to Sen. John McCain of  
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have continued to support Governor Bush,'' said  
Molinari, borough president of Staten Island. ``... But sometimes 
you just have to stand up and say -- despite all the odds -- that my 
overwhelming respect for a candidate like John McCain demands that 
I rise to endorse him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari, a prominent member of the GOP in New York, ran the  
state campaign to elect Bush's father as president in 1988. But 
Molinari was not in line to run George W. Bush's New York effort 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican sources have said Charles Gargano, chairman of the  
Empire State Development Corp., a state business agency, was 
expected to head the Texas governor's New York operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargano is also close to Gov. George Pataki, who has feuded with  
Molinari in the past. But Molinari said his relationship with 
Pataki ``played no role'' in his switch to McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what happens in politics,'' Bush said at an Arizona  
campaign stop when asked about Molinari's endorsement of McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's press secretary, Mindy Tucker, said: ``We hope to have  
Guy Molinari's support when Governor Bush becomes the Republican 
presidential nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said he would not ``bad mouth George Bush during the  
course of this campaign. I have enormous respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, accepted  
Molinari's endorsement at the Vietnam Memorial in Lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident of victory. I am very cognizant of the odds.  
With the support of Guy Molinari, we can win the state of New 
York,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's standing in the polls has been rising, but remains in  
single digits nationally and below 25 percent in New York and New 
Hampshire, far behind Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``John McCain has faced far greater obstacles in the past,''  
Molinari said. ``Those odds don't discourage him and they don't 
discourage me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said that while McCain might not be able to match  
Bush's cash, he'll be trying to generate grass-roots support, 
especially among veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would anticipate doing veterans' halls, and things of that  
nature, very modest fund raising,'' Molinari said. ``You're raising 
some money, maybe not much, but you're also getting a lot of 
support. ... It's going to be a people's campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said his daughter, former U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, and  
her husband, former U.S. Rep. Bill Paxon, remain Bush supporters.

<HEADLINE> Irene Likely To Cause N.C. Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- The nearly one foot of rain dropped by  
Hurricane Irene is all but guaranteed to bring another round of 
flooding to North Carolina later this week, demoralizing people 
still reeling from Hurricane Floyd a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get lifted up and the next thing you know, something else  
happens,'' said Karen Mabry, who was flooded out of her mobile home 
by Floyd and was kept out by Irene on Monday. She has been staying 
in an apartment supplied by the Red Cross but has had trouble 
sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep waking up and looking out the window to make sure  
nothing else is happening,'' she said. ``It's just terrible. It's 
horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barely hurricane strength, Irene soaked North Carolina's soggy  
coastal plain Sunday with up to 11 inches of rain before veering 
out into the Atlantic without ever coming ashore. At 11 p.m. EDT, 
Irene was 350 miles southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland, moving 
east-northeast at about 63 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene was blamed for one death in North Carolina, a motorist  
whose vehicle skidded into a tree. At least eight other people died 
as a result of the storm, five of them in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The rains once again sent streams from their banks and promised  
to produce more serious flooding later this week as runoff drains 
into the Tar, Neuse and Cape Fear rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two months, it has been one thing after another in  
eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	First there was Hurricane Dennis, which battered the coast for a  
week before coming inland and dumping up to 8 inches of rain. Two 
weeks later, Floyd poured 20 inches of rain on the region, causing 
49 deaths here and the worst flooding in state history. Eight more 
inches fell less than two weeks after that. Irene came next. 
</P>
<P>
	To help flood victims cope, the Red Cross has sent 244 mental  
health workers to eastern North Carolina -- more than for any other 
disaster except the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are overwhelmed right now by the fact that they have to  
clean up after the storms and be a mom and a dad and an employee,'' 
Red Cross spokeswoman Gina Giarronardo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Farrar, a Red Cross mental health counselor in Tarboro,  
said Monday that many people have become ``hypervigilant'' -- 
nervously mindful of every change of weather, every rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarboro, at the center of Floyd's flooding Sept. 16, the Tar  
River is expected to crest Wednesday 4 feet above its 19-foot flood 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that it gets better soon,'' said Casheila Draughn,  
43, who was at a Red Cross recovery center with her 88-year-old 
grandmother, Liza Staton, and her daughter Tawanna, 22. 
``Obviously, it can't be as bad as it was the last time, but I'm 
just hoping for life to get close to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Pinetops, which was devastated by Floyd's floodwaters,  
Leroy Johnson watched the waters rising on a Tar River tributary 
and said it didn't worry him much: ``People are at ease now because 
this time they have nothing to lose,'' he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Seven Springs, which saw record flooding from  
Floyd, the Neuse is expected to crest Wednesday 9 feet above its 
14-foot flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Town Commissioner Elizabeth Quinn, who has been living in a  
camper since Floyd flooded her home, said she and the four other 
town commissioners decided to proceed with the annual Christmas 
parade, whatever comes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might not have pretty houses and pretty yards, but we've  
got to keep our spirits up,'' she said. Still, she said, all the 
rain was ``enough to keep you worried to death all the time. The 
ground is saturated, and it wouldn't take much to blow a tree 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A signed taped to the front of the trailer that now serves as  
the town hall read: ``Remember the Alamo. Remember Seven Springs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, about 190,000 people were still without power, three  
days after Irene drenched the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people were already keeping watch on the next potential  
menace: Tropical Storm Jose, far away in the Atlantic. Jose was 185 
miles east of Barbados but was strengthening and expected to become 
a hurricane in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were uncertain of its track but said it could  
threaten the United States.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Losses Cut Deep for Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONETOE, N.C. (AP) -- The Harrell clan's big pickup trucks and  
farmyard full of equipment only thinly mask the terrible calamity 
that has befallen their 5,000-acre farm, flooded by Hurricane Floyd 
and now full of blackened crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The illusion of prosperity evaporates as the family describes  
their estimated $1.36 million loss and the long years of recovery 
that lie ahead. The effects of Hurricane Irene have yet to be 
assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Floyd floods, Wayne Harrell and his brother-in-law,  
Willie Owens each was worth nearly $1 million. In the time it took 
more than 15 inches of rain to swallow 5,000 acres, their net worth 
is now less than half that but will hardly cover what they owe. The 
losses continue to mount, bills wait to be paid, and the chances of 
a profit are fading. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about a weather event that took all that net  
worth away,'' said Harrell, 43. ``There's not anything we could 
have done to prevent it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the partners was responsible for about $500,000 in debt  
before the flood. Now, Owens, a burly man who said he has been 
crying a lot lately, jokes grimly that he is ``worth more dead than 
alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across flood-stricken eastern North Carolina, many farmers are  
in the same stomach-knotting predicament. And the rains kept 
falling Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take 10 years to get better. We don't need  
loans. We need grants to get up on our feet again,'' said Owens, 
40, whose home and his share of the crops were ruined by the Tar 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who now lives with his father-in-law, said his  
homeowner's insurance paid $1,040, about half for spoiled food in a 
freezer. He had no flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I just lost my house, that would be one thing. But I've  
lost my way of making money to rebuild my house,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrell and his family have opened their financial records in an  
effort to persuade Congress and anyone else who will listen that 
farmers need cash grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Unaccustomed to asking for help or lobbying government  
officials, Harrell and his partners are big men in jeans and work 
boots equally at ease on a tractor or dealing in millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Harrell is learning a fast lesson in seeking out  
politicians to give them financial information to make the case for 
his family and all the others hurt by Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping we can find a way to get out of operating expense  
for this year,'' said Don Brake, 42, a neighbor and partner with 
the Harrells on a new, $1.3 million produce storage warehouse that 
won't have many sweet potatoes or other vegetables in it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm's cotton plants are black instead of showing white  
puffs of cotton fiber peeking from the boll. Gone -- besides most of 
the sweet potatoes that were to bring $310,000 in profit this year 
-- are the peanut plants. The floodwaters turned them into a lumpy, 
black mess. While much of the farm's tobacco was harvested before 
the flood, tobacco won't be enough to pull them through. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harrell farm is in Edgecombe County, where other farmers  
have suffered as well. Losses countywide have soared above 80 
percent in peanuts, corn and cotton and 50 percent for soybeans, 
much of it uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	The three farmers complain that other people who suffered flood  
damage are getting better treatment than farmers. A person with a 
non-farm job who lost a mobile home can get a government-provided 
trailer and be back at work in a week or two, they said. That won't 
work for farmers, who are tied to their land by long-term debt and 
whose spending supports other community businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina officials say the state's farmers need more than  
$1 billion in direct assistance. That might put most of them back 
on the precarious footing they occupied before the flood, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't ever get ahead'' after the flood, Owens said, his  
massive fists clenching.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Veto Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will veto a $12.6 billion  
foreign aid bill, his spokesman said today, and will refuse to sign 
other spending bills passed by the Republican-led Congress despite 
a budget deadline looming this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is adopting a tough stance on spending, accusing  
congressional Republicans of accounting gimmickry. A temporary 
budget bill that has kept the government running since the start of 
the fiscal year on Oct. 1 will expire on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was meeting with Cabinet officers this morning to talk  
budget strategy. He also plans to invite congressional leaders to 
White House for a meeting this week ``to figure out a way to get 
out of the box created by appropriators to date,'' press secretary 
Joe Lockhart said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign aid bill passed over loud opposition from Democrats  
and the White House, who claim it shortchanges important American 
foreign policy interests such as furthering the Mideast peace deal 
known as Wye River. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't meet the president's priorities,'' Lockhart said.  
``Wye River is certainly an important element to that, and it is an 
important part of continuing to exercise U.S. leadership around the 
world. We can't expect nations in troubled parts of the world, like 
the Middle East, to move forward with their peace process when we 
won't meet the commitments we've made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said a veto of the defense spending bill may be on the  
way. ``That is under consideration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is beyond what the president requested, and there are  
also a number of gimmicks in it. They make operations and 
maintenance an emergency. The Pentagon is a pretty big building, 
but I don't know if you can go over there ... and find one person 
who considers the operations and maintenance of armed forces an 
emergency,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's foreign aid veto today, the 28th of his presidency,  
will likely stand. The bill only narrowly cleared the House with a 
vote of 214-211, and the Senate with a vote of 51-49. A two-thirds 
vote in both houses is needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, in a statement prepared in  
anticipation of Clinton's veto, said that the extra money Clinton 
wants can only be obtained by raiding the Social Security trust 
fund. He called that ``wrong and irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will not use Social Security as a pot of gold to fund  
foreign aid,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, chairman of the House Foreign Operations  
subcommittee, said Republicans Congress have sent a consistent 
message that ``we will not raid Social Security, nor will we agree 
to raise taxes, to pay for increased foreign aid spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As passed by Congress, the aid bill provides $2 billion less  
than Clinton sought and none of the $500 million down payment he 
had sought to help Israel and the Palestinians carry out the peace 
accord negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. In all, Clinton has 
pledged $1.8 billion in U.S. support for the Mideast peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides significantly less money than Clinton  
requested for international debt relief, the Peace Corps and for 
efforts to reduce the nuclear threat from North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When the possibility of a veto was first voiced earlier in the  
month, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations panel on foreign operations, said it could shut off 
$735 million in aid to former Soviet Republics, $285 million in 
narcotics-fighting assistance and $180 million to combat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	However, foreign aid likely would continue to flow at current  
levels as part of stopgap spending legislation that covers agencies 
and departments for which there has been no appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also had complained that the legislation cuts  
many economic assistance programs, including those for poor 
countries in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	And it eliminated a $241 million State Department program to  
help find work for former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists in an 
attempt to make sure they do not sell their services to rogue 
states attempting to develop nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Radar Faulted in Plane Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A radar system that is supposed to warn  
low-flying planes of nearby obstacles was plagued with problems and 
fixed nationwide only after a 1997 fatal airplane crash in Guam, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, programming errors caused the Minimum  
Safe-Altitude Warning system not to operate over wide areas, 
including near busy airports such as those in Chicago and 
Dallas-Ft. Worth. In other cases, false alarms were so numerous 
that air traffic controllers put cardboard over warning speakers to 
silence the noise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration was warned about the trouble  
after a business jet crashed outside Washington in 1994, but it did 
not take decisive action to resolve it until after a Korean Air 
jumbo jet slammed into a hill on approach to Guam in August 1997, 
killing 228, said USA Today, which reported about the problems on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, which will hold a  
final hearing about the Korean Air crash on Nov. 2, is expected to 
recommend that the FAA acknowledge that system problems contributed 
to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have found plenty of blame for the crew: It  
appears they did not follow charts outlining a step-down approach 
procedure to the airport. Tapes also show there was cockpit 
confusion about whether another landing system using radio waves to 
outline the proper approach path was operational. It was not -- as 
some crew members acknowledged on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said in response to the story that it would have had  
difficulty correcting the problems until it got new computer 
database-management tools in 1997. The agency has since 
standardized the operation of the system, inspects it monthly and 
checks each airport site with test aircraft every 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the agency also said the system is ``a tool'' and  
pilots have the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the proper 
altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 20/20 hindsight, we wish we could have done a better job  
prior to the (Guam) accident, but now the system is being managed 
in a uniform way rather than as a number of individual entities,'' 
said FAA spokesman Les Dorr. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Minimum Safe-Altitude Warning systems were installed  
in 1977 in an effort to curb ground collisions, a vexing problem 
known within the industry as ``controlled flight into terrain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The systems divide the area around an airport into a grid and  
are programmed with the highest point in each square. When radar 
detects a plane descending within 500 feet of one of those points, 
an alarm sounds in the air traffic center and radar screens flash 
with a sign saying ``LA'' or ``LOW ALT.'' The controller is then 
supposed to warn the pilot by radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The systems are now installed in 193 air traffic control  
facilities and monitor airspace around almost every airport with 
commercial traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB investigators blamed the 1994 crash outside Washington on  
the flight crew, but they also found that an incorrect compass 
heading was entered into the altitude-warning system, preventing an 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board warned the FAA about the problem, and the  
agency replied that it had checked the remaining systems. Three 
more fatal crashes followed. Each was blamed on the pilots, and in 
each case the system produced alerts that were either not seen or 
heard by controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Guam crash, though, the FAA assembled a team of top  
computer experts to reanalyze the system. The team soon found that 
repairs were needed at nearly half of the 130 smaller airports that 
had the system. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, incorrect obstacle heights were entered into the  
database. In the case of the Chicago and Texas airports, errors led 
computers to calculate planes were hundreds of feet higher that 
they actually were, effectively blocking alarms in wide areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Guam, a programmer disabled the system for all  
but a 1-mile band encircling the airport some 55 miles out at sea.

<HEADLINE> Robert Ray Formally Replaces Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a judge's admonition to wrap up his work  
with ``all deliberate speed,'' career prosecutor Robert Ray 
replaced Kenneth Starr on Monday and took over the long-running 
independent counsel investigation that could still affect the 
political plans of Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr bid farewell in a letter that stated his resignation was  
prompted by the ``intense politicization'' of his work. Starr 
disclosed he tried unsuccessfully to turn over the remainder of his 
investigation to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wiser course, I believe, is for another individual to head  
the investigation,'' Starr wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In front of the courthouse where he was sworn in, Ray promised  
his prosecutors would operate in ``a prompt, responsible and 
cost-effective manner,'' while being ``thorough and fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the judges who appointed him called for a speedy end to  
an investigation that polls show the public is tired of. ``There 
can be no more vital consideration now than closure with all 
deliberate speed,'' said Richard D. Cudahy of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray has two investigative matters remaining that the Justice  
Department declined to accept because of potential conflicts of 
interest: 
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt by Maryland developer and Democratic Party  
supporter Nathan Landow to influence the testimony of presidential 
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of the White House travel office just after the 
start of her husband's term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's biggest task could turn out to be the requirement that he  
write a final report on the wide-ranging Starr investigation that 
has delved into fraudulent land deals in Arkansas, including a 
development south of Little Rock called Castle Grande on which Mrs. 
Clinton engaged in legal work. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators concluded the development owned by Mrs.  
Clinton's Whitewater partner, Jim McDougal, led to losses for his 
failing savings and loan, which eventually was taken over by the 
federal government for insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was part of the legal team that obtained a felony plea from  
Webster Hubbell, the former law partner of Mrs. Clinton and at one 
time the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, on a charge of 
concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's work on the real estate project, 
Castle Grande. Hubbell says he knows of no wrongdoing by Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of any final report would deal in part with Castle  
Grande, which could cause political trouble for the first lady in 
her run for the U.S. Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges who appointed Ray again displayed the tension  
among them over the five-year duration of Starr's portion of the 
six-year Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Cudahy, who said in August it was time for Starr to close  
up shop, stated that the search for a successor to Starr was 
limited to senior members of his staff because delays would result 
if an outsider were chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges Peter Fay of Miami and David Sentelle of Washington  
issued an order that did not refer to a time frame for Ray's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reading a statement outside the courthouse after his  
swearing-in, Ray credited his controversial predecessor with 
``extraordinary service to the country at great personal sacrifice 
over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave a lot,'' Ray said of Starr, who will return to work  
full-time at his private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Clinton White House suggested Ray is a  
politically motivated prosecutor, noting that before going to 
Starr's office, he spent several years working for Independent 
Counsel Donald Smaltz in the investigation of former Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's family disputed the White House suggestion.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bob believes strongly in public service, he believes that  
people should be held accountable, but he is not politically 
motivated in his job; that's simply not true,'' said Ray's father, 
a retired Army colonel who served two tours of duty in the Vietnam 
War and who came to the courthouse for his son's swearing-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Until January 1998, Ray was a registered Democrat in New York  
City. Ray ran twice for the school board in New York City in 
nonpartisan elections, losing both times. He now is a registered 
voter in New Jersey unaffiliated with any political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray in recent years made four donations totaling $90 in support  
of Republicans -- three to then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and one to the 
Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	While at Princeton University in 1982, young Ray chose the  
Kennedy administration's Peace Corps as the topic for his senior 
history thesis, offering extensive praise for the late president. 
</P>
<P>
	The 196-page document said Peace Corps volunteers ``brought the  
spirit of America'' to Third World countries.

<HEADLINE> California Wildfire's Path Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Dying winds helped firefighters today  
contain a 25,900-acre wildfire in Northern California that engulfed 
dozens of homes and forced thousands of people to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people fighting the fire in Shasta County had it  
85 percent surrounded by fire lines by midmorning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although higher-than-average temperatures and low humidity were  
expected for the next few days, decreasing winds have aided 
firefighters, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-moving fire began at 4:15 a.m. Saturday and was fanned  
by winds gusting to 40 mph. But the winds moderated Sunday 
afternoon, and thousands of residents forced to flee their homes 
were allowed to return by late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 structures had been destroyed and losses were  
estimated at $6 million. The precise number of homes lost was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's people calling who I've known for 20 years, calling to  
see if their houses are OK,'' said fire Capt. Jan Gross. ``I don't 
have the heart to tell them they've lost it.'' 
</P>

	Bella Vista resident Anna Dunn returned to her 2,000-square-foot  
home to find only ashes and most of her 18 cats were missing. She 
fled the home with her husband and son Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just thank the Lord we're OK,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Karen Jane Savage, 44, a volunteer firefighter from Junction  
City, Calif., died after she was hit by a fire truck near the 
blaze, said Rose Wyckoff of the California Department of Forestry.

<P>
	Temporary shelters held only a dozen or so evacuees Sunday  
evening, down from a peak of around 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire spokeswoman Edna Petersen said investigators believe that  
blaze may have been sparked by ``a campfire or from some machinery, 
maybe even a car exhaust.'' Arson has been ruled out, she said.

<P>
	Meanwhile, a fire about 50 miles northwest of Sacramento that  
started Saturday had burned more than 42,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	One home was lost, and some 430 firefighters, along with a dozen  
bulldozers, five helicopters and six air tankers, fought over the 
weekend to keep the flames away from other homes in a vacation area 
near Lake Berryessa. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yuba County, about 50 miles north of Sacramento, a fire that  
charred 9,000 acres was about 50 percent contained this morning. It 
had threatened about 500 structures in the Dobbins and Challenge 
areas, which were evacuated Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinity County, a fire that began two months ago burned  
111,000 acres. Along California's central coast, meanwhile, two 
fires in the Los Padres National Forest continued to burn after 
scorching more than 85,000 acres.

<HEADLINE> Key Matters in Starr's Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fourteen people have been convicted in Kenneth Starr's five-year  
investigation of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe by Starr and his predecessor, Robert Fiske, has cost  
more than $50 million. Among matters investigated: 
</P>
<P>
	--The death of Vincent Foster, which Starr concluded was a  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	--The handling by presidential aides of Foster's Whitewater  
papers from his White House office after the deputy White House 
counsel's death. 
</P>
<P>
	--The investments of the Clintons and savings and loan operators  
Jim and Susan McDougal in the Whitewater real estate venture. The 
McDougals were convicted of fraud. Then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy 
Tucker also was convicted of two felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Clinton White House's collecting of hundreds of FBI  
background files of appointees from Republican administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mrs. Clinton's role in firings in the White House travel  
office. Pending. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allegations of obstruction and perjury by President Clinton  
regarding his intimate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton 
was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible violations of federal currency reporting laws stemming  
from Clinton's 1990 re-election campaign in Arkansas. The case of 
two Arkansas bankers ended in a mistrial. Longtime Clinton aide 
Bruce Lindsey was named an unindicted co-conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton confidant Webster Hubbell's theft of $400,000 from his  
Little Rock law firm and its clients; and payments of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to Hubbell from friends of the president at a 
time when Hubbell was under investigation by Starr's office. 
Hubbell pleaded guilty to tax evasion and mail fraud in 1994. On 
June 30, he pleaded guilty to a felony of concealing his and Mrs. 
Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. Pending. 
He also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a tax evasion case, a 
matter which the prosecutor is appealing to the Supreme Court. 
Starr has agreed to seek dismissal of the case if the Supreme Court 
rules against him on the use of Hubbell's financial records in the 
case.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid CEO Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP)-- Rite Aid chairman and chief executive  
officer Martin Grass, whose father founded the nation's 
third-largest drug store chain, resigned Monday amid a company 
struggle to overcome a mountain of debt accumulated through rapid 
expansion in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass, who took over the company in 1995, has also faced  
questions that he held stakes in several suppliers and real estate 
interests that do business with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid's stock has slipped more than 80 percent this year, as  
the company has repeatedly had to restate downward its previous 
years' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board of directors named Timothy J. Noonan, 57,  
the company's current president and chief operating officer, as 
interim CEO. The company's board also created a new executive 
committee composed of four outside directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid also said it obtained an agreement with its banks for a  
one-year extension of its loans, which were scheduled to expire at 
the end of this month. Also, Leonard Green &AMP; Partners, an 
investment banking firm, will invest $300 million in Rite Aid, in 
exchange for a 9.7 stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass, 45, who also is giving up his position as a Rite Aid  
director, led the company through a major acquisition campaign in 
recent years but has acknowledged in recent months that it was 
overly ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
	To slash its nearly $5.1 billion in debt, Rite Aid is trying to  
sell dozens of its West Coast stores and has signaled a willingness 
to sell at least part of its interest in pharmacy-benefits manager 
PCS Health Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's announcement came a week after the Camp Hill-based  
company reported a second-quarter loss of $67.9 million, which it 
blamed on costs associated with closing stores and acquiring PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid closed or moved 106 stores during the quarter. Also  
hurting the results was a $49 million increase in interest costs 
related to financing for the January acquisition of PCS, the 
retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after the market closed; Rite Aid's stock  
closed at $9.62 1/2, up 6 1/4 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	It also announced its restated financial results for the past  
three fiscal years will result in about $500 million drop in prior 
years' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, which ranks third in sales behind Walgreen and CVS,  
operates about 3,900 stores in 30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Grass took Rite Aid's reins from his dad, Alex, in 1995.  
A year later the company bought Thrifty PayLess (with more than 
1,000 stores) for about $2.3 billion. The deal took the company 
into new western territory. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1998 Rite Aid bought competitor PCS Health Systems, a  
giant pharmacy benefits manager, from drugmaker Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. for 
$1.5 billion. But Rite Aid recently said it was exploring selling 
PCS in part to pay back its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	After revising three years of earnings, in June, Rite Aid  
announced that its CFO, Frank Bergonzi, will retire before year's 
end.

<HEADLINE> NATO Trains Serbs, Ethnic Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- It was an unusual sight in Kosovo:  
Serbs and ethnic Albanians joining together to pursue a common goal 
-- training to handle civil security and crisis management. 
</P>
<P>
	A 16-man team of members of the new Kosovo Protection Corps and  
a handful of Serbs boarded a plane Monday for a NATO-organized 
3 1/2-week study trip to France. The alliance hoped that training the 
multiethnic group would dispel doubts among the Serbs that the 
corps is merely the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in a new guise. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, made up of 10 ethnic Albanians, three Serbs, two  
Bosnian Muslims and a Kosovo Turk, will participate in 
firefighting, emergency rescue and other training provided by the 
French Civil Securities, said Maj. Gen. Jean-Claude Thomann of the 
NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	The training is a ``trust-building exercise,'' Thomann said.  
``We want to encourage them to talk to each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Kosovo's dwindling Serb minority, meanwhile,  
decided on Monday to form their own protection force, the 
independent Beta news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb leaders meeting Monday at the Gracanica monastery, some  
three miles south of the capital, Pristina, also said they would 
impose self-rule in enclaves of the province where Serbs are 
predominant, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions indicated that Serbs continue to feel threatened in  
Kosovo despite NATO promises to protect them and safeguard their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	International officials in Kosovo have rejected earlier Serb  
proposals for establishment of the enclaves and a separate force, 
arguing that such moves would violate multiethnic principles 
intended for the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomann said the Serbs within the group that left for France had  
been picked by the Serb leadership in Kosovska Mitrovica, a 
bitterly divided city in northern Kosovo. More than 100 people were 
hurt there last week after ethnic Albanians attacked NATO troops 
and French and Italian police in an attempt to cross into the 
Serb-held side of the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomann said the idea was to provide the Serbs in the group with  
``information on our real and true intent when we created the 
Kosovo Protection Corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since most prospective members of the corps are former KLA  
fighters, the Serbs are suspicious of the new organization. NATO 
and the United Nations, however, say the corps is only meant to 
assist in civil emergencies and other nonmilitary duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomann conceded that it would be difficult for Serbs and ethnic  
Albanians to serve together in the aftermath of the 18-month Serb 
crackdown on ethnic Albanians and the NATO bombing campaign that 
forced Serb troops to leave Kosovo in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Miodrag Ralic, one of the three Serbs boarding a French military  
transport for the flight to France, agreed it was unrealistic to 
talk of a joint ethnic Albanian-Serb Kosovo protection force. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tensions are just too big,'' he told reporters. ``Maybe in  
the future, if the hatred and tension becomes much, much lower, and 
we can work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Kosovo on Monday, a Norwegian junior officer  
received superficial thigh wounds when shots were fired toward a 
patrol of peacekeepers in southwestern Kosovo Polje, said Maj. 
Roland Lavoie, a NATO spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the patrol located two men in brown camouflage clothes  
and returned fire, probably injuring one. The men managed to 
escape. The officer was taken to a Norwegian field hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, two children were killed and one was seriously  
injured Sunday in a field in Mala Krusa, six miles north of the 
southern city of Prizren, Lavoie said. It appeared that one of the 
children set off a small bomb. No other details were immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, a pre-dawn fire broke out Monday in a compound used  
by NATO peacekeepers, destroying Kosovo's television building. 
Three NATO soldiers were slightly injured, NATO spokesmen said. The 
fire's cause was apparently electrical.

<HEADLINE> Israel Outpost Evacuations To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel is set to act on its plan to evacuate 12  
illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a step toward meeting 
Palestinian demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation of the West Bank outposts was to begin within 24  
hours, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first outposts to be dismantled were to be those that are  
uninhabited, Barak spokeswoman Merav Parsi-Tsadok said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak announced plans last week to uproot the 12 settlements as  
part of a compromise agreement with settler leaders. Peace 
activists had advised Barak to remove 42 such settlements, and 
Palestinian leaders accused him of bowing to settler pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has revived the peace process with the Palestinians, and  
they have demanded he begin removing settlements as a sign of good 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians hope to establish a state in the West bank and Gaza  
Strip and regard settlements in those lands as an obstacle to 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	According to settler leaders, the first outpost to be dismantled  
would be the uninhabited Shvut Rahel II, north of the West Bank 
town of Ramallah.

<HEADLINE> Task Force Meets on Ramsey Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The prosecutor in the JonBenet Ramsey case met  
with the governor and a special task force for four hours Monday to 
review the investigation into the girl's death and decide if a 
special prosecutor is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting ended at 9 p.m., Gov. Bill Owens' chief of  
staff said the group may meet again. Owens said it could be some 
time before he makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens convened a task force to take a second look at the case  
after the grand jury failed to issue any indictments following a 
13-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups met at the state Capitol in a Senate hearing room  
with Boulder County prosecutor Alex Hunter and his team on one side 
of the conference table and Owens and his task force on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would comment before the session began.  
</P>
<P>
	After the grand jury was dismissed last week, police said that  
JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under an 
``umbrella of suspicion'' in the 1996 slaying of JonBenet, 6, at 
their Boulder home. Hunter said Thursday they have not been 
eliminated from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys have insisted they are innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Patsy Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference to discuss the decision not to indict,  
Hunter said he would work with Owens to decide if an independent 
investigation is warranted.

<HEADLINE> Brown Named Cards' New QB Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Jake Plummer has played with numerous  
injuries this season, but a broken right ring finger will sideline 
the Arizona Cardinals quarterback for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, who took the Cardinals to the playoffs in his first  
full year as a starter last season, will be replaced by former New 
York Giants starter Dave Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jake is our franchise quarterback, and he's the guy that's  
going to lead us to the playoffs and the Super Bowl,'' coach Vince 
Tobin said Monday. ``Him not being there is certainly a shock to a 
lot of people. But, as I told our team, we're fortunate to have a 
guy that's won in this league and this division. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Dave Brown is going to be The Man.''  
</P>
<P>
	Brown was far from spectacular in the second half of a 24-10  
loss to the Washington Redskins on Sunday. He was 8-of-21 for 117 
yards, a touchdown and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he joined the Cardinals as a free agent prior to last  
season, Brown started 53 of 57 games for the Giants from 1992-97, 
including a career-high 2,814 yards in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he must succeed in order to keep alive Arizona's hopes of  
another postseason berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is 19-of-40 in 1 1/2 years with the Cardinals, and his  
10-yard scoring pass to Rob Moore with 6:59 left in the game was 
his first scoring toss in just over two years. He has two weeks to 
shake off the rust because Arizona has a bye this week. After that, 
the Cardinals (2-4), who are 0-2 against AFC teams, play New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	The big knock against Brown is his lack of mobility.  
</P>
<P>
	But Plummer, who sustained a hip pointer in a 14-3 win over the  
Giants the previous week, wasn't very agile against Washington, 
either. One of his two interceptions was thrown after he decided 
not to run for a first down with an open field ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to replace him, but I just have to go  
out there and play my game,'' Brown said. ``I'm not going to play 
the way he can, because no one else can play like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means a lot of waiting in the pocket created by Arizona's  
shaky offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was injured on a freakish accident when blitzing  
linebacker Shawn Barber took advantage of a botched call on the 
line and came through a hole almost untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hit was nothing, but I got my finger caught in his face  
mask,'' Plummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said he may bring in another quarterback to back up Brown  
and rookie Chris Greisen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody that you bring in at this point is not going to be  
familiar with your system,'' Tobin said. ``(Competition) obviously 
depends on how good the guy is and what happens once he gets here, 
but our intention is that Chris will be our backup and this guy 
will be our third-string quarterback.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Raises Bioengineered Food Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency that ensures genetically  
engineered foods are safe will hold unusual meetings around the 
country this fall to hear what Americans think about bioengineered 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. scientists have been surprised by growing public resistance  
abroad to bioengineered foods. Critics in Britain deride them as 
``Frankenfoods''; Thailand on Monday banned importation of 
genetically engineered food seeds; parts of Europe demand 
bioengineered foods be labeled as such so consumers can choose to 
avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by that backlash, U.S. critics have increased demands  
that bioengineered foods be labeled here as well, and two U.S. 
baby-food makers even announced they no longer would use biotech 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts insist biotech foods now sold are safe. They  
already are used widely, from the soybeans and corn of tortilla 
chips and soft drinks to tomatoes stewed into spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although people have enthusiastically accepted new drugs made  
from biotechnology, some consumers have concerns about the use of 
this technology in foods,'' said Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. ``We need to ask why those concerns exist, 
and how we can address them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the Food and Drug Administration begins unusual public  
meetings next month to explain how it determines a genetically 
engineered food is safe, and to get the public's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants can tell FDA whether they want its food-safety  
policy strengthened or bioengineered foods labeled. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings will be in Chicago on Nov. 18, Washington on Nov. 30  
and in Oakland, Calif., on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents insist genetic engineering is similar to traditional  
breeding, where plants are cross-pollinated to produce hardier 
varieties by sharing genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic engineering is more precise, allowing a single gene to  
be spliced from one organism into another. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA closely guards against bioengineering likely to cause  
allergic reactions. Food makers would not be allowed to put a gene 
from nuts into beans, for instance, because too many people have 
life-threatening nut allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	But some critics say genetic engineering might have unforeseen  
reactions, and FDA's policy of regulating biotech foods similarly 
to regular foods is not strict enough. 
</P>
<P>
	While scientists look forward one day to bioengineering foods to  
be healthier, with a greater number of vitamins or other nutrients, 
crops have been genetically engineered so far mostly to make them 
hardier. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn can be engineered to produce a natural pesticide called Bt,  
one of the best natural pesticides organic farmers use. But it 
sparked environmental worries last spring when a study suggested 
pollen from such corn can spread onto nearby milkweed plants and 
kill the larvae of monarch butterflies, which feed on milkweed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today vetoed a $12.6 billion  
foreign aid bill as inadequate and called on Republican 
congressional leaders to join the administration in seeking a 
solution to the budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to sit down and do it together,'' the president told  
reporters in the Cabinet Room. He said he would sign another 
emergency spending measure to keep the government running beyond 
Thursday, but that it should be a short-term measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to put politics aside and seek common ground,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to make tough choices and we're going to  
have to make them together,'' Clinton said. ``Inaction is not an 
option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said Republicans were shortchanging spending needs  
on education, the environment and foreign policy affairs, including 
U.S. obligations under the Wye River Mideast peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton will refuse to  
sign other spending bills passed by Republicans, but instead has 
invited congressional leaders to a White House meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the congressional leadership will join me,'' the president  
said, ``we can make this a season of real progress for our 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders said they would attend the session, but they  
emphasized they would not consider using Social Security surpluses 
to help pay for spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not agree to a summit that would try to find secret  
ways to spend the Social Security surplus,'' House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign aid bill passed over loud opposition from Democrats  
and the White House, who claim it shortchanges important American 
foreign policy interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't meet the president's priorities,'' Lockhart said.  
``Wye River is certainly an important element to that, and it is an 
important part of continuing to exercise U.S. leadership around the 
world. We can't expect nations in troubled parts of the world, like 
the Middle East, to move forward with their peace process when we 
won't meet the commitments we've made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said a veto of the defense spending bill may be on the  
way. ``That is under consideration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is beyond what the president requested, and there are  
also a number of gimmicks in it. They make operations and 
maintenance an emergency. The Pentagon is a pretty big building, 
but I don't know if you can go over there ... and find one person 
who considers the operations and maintenance of armed forces an 
emergency,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's foreign aid veto, the 28th of his presidency, will  
likely stand. The bill only narrowly cleared the House with a vote 
of 214-211, and the Senate with a vote of 51-49. A two-thirds vote 
in both houses is needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, in a statement prepared in  
anticipation of Clinton's veto, said that the extra money Clinton 
wants can only be obtained by raiding the Social Security trust 
fund. He called that ``wrong and irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will not use Social Security as a pot of gold to fund  
foreign aid,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, chairman of the House Foreign Operations  
subcommittee, said Republicans Congress have sent a consistent 
message that ``we will not raid Social Security, nor will we agree 
to raise taxes, to pay for increased foreign aid spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As passed by Congress, the aid bill provides $2 billion less  
than Clinton sought and none of the $500 million down payment he 
had sought to help Israel and the Palestinians carry out the peace 
accord negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. In all, Clinton has 
pledged $1.8 billion in U.S. support for the Mideast peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides significantly less money than Clinton  
requested for international debt relief, the Peace Corps and for 
efforts to reduce the nuclear threat from North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When the possibility of a veto was first voiced earlier in the  
month, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations panel on foreign operations, said it could shut off 
$735 million in aid to former Soviet Republics, $285 million in 
narcotics-fighting assistance and $180 million to combat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	However, foreign aid likely would continue to flow at current  
levels as part of stopgap spending legislation that covers agencies 
and departments for which there has been no appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also had complained that the legislation cuts  
many economic assistance programs, including those for poor 
countries in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	And it eliminated a $241 million State Department program to  
help find work for former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists in an 
attempt to make sure they do not sell their services to rogue 
states attempting to develop nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Huard Likely To Start for Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino has a bone spur in his neck, and  
Dolphins backup quarterback Damon Huard probably will make his 
first NFL start next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard replaced the ailing Marino in the first quarter Sunday and  
rallied Miami to a 31-30 victory at New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino underwent an extensive examination Monday, including an  
MRI and a CAT scan, and team physician Dr. John Uribe found a small 
bone spur on the right side of the lower neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The spur is the apparent source of spasms and muscle weakness  
between the neck and shoulder that began bothering Marino last 
week, Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino received an epidural injection and will continue taking  
anti-inflammatory medication. He'll sit out practice until at least 
Thursday and may try to throw then. 
</P>
<P>
	The bone spur won't require surgery after the season, the  
Dolphins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all probably Damon will start against Philadelphia,'' coach  
Jimmy Johnson said. ``We'll just have to see what Dan can do. 
There's not a lot of pain, but he doesn't have any strength 
throwing the ball.''

<HEADLINE> HCFA Absolves Hospitals of Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associated Press Write    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has decided to end  
attempts to recover millions of dollars from hospitals it had 
accused of overstating the amount of money the government owed them 
for providing care for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became obvious that confusion regarding the issue was  
pervasive,'' Chris Peacock, a spokesman for the Health Care 
Financing Administration, which administers the payments, said 
Monday. ``This was the fairest thing to do for these hospitals 
which treat some of the nation's most vulnerable patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been conducting a nationwide  
investigation of hospitals that receive so-called disproportionate 
share payments through the Medicare program because they treat 
large numbers of poor patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The review has focused on whether the hospitals had properly  
adhered to federal guidelines when counting patients for purposes 
of calculating their claims to the poverty payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals in some states had already been asked to begin  
repaying huge sums for alleged overpayments going back as far as a 
decade. Hospitals in New York, for example, were estimated to owe 
an estimated $1 billion, Pennsylvania hospitals $250 million and 
New Jersey hospitals $288 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In dozens of other states, hospitals were still under  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's reversal came after members of Congress  
from affected states protested, saying that the payment rules were 
not clear and that hospitals should not be penalized for past 
errors resulting from confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential candidate  
in the 2000 race for a New York's Senate seat, has said she 
believes hospitals caring for the poor deserve more federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials began notifying lawmakers last week  
that hospitals that have already returned some money will get it 
back and that no further repayments will be required. The 
administration will also clarify the eligibility rules for the 
poverty payments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically at issue is whether hospitals can count patients  
qualifying for state public assistance programs but not the 
national Medicaid health insurance program for the poor.

<HEADLINE> Holtz's Wife Wants To Attend Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina coach Lou Holtz has someone  
who badly wants to get back into the middle of things at 
Williams-Brice Stadium -- his wife, Beth. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two weeks after successful surgery to remove growths  
found on her adrenal gland and ovary, she has asked to come to the 
Vanderbilt game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to come badly,'' Holtz said Monday. ``She's on  
injured reserve. She'll be on injured reserve for a while. I've got 
to weigh that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Holtz is recuperating at the family's home in Orlando,  
Fla., after her Oct. 4 operation at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	She is expected to need as long as six months to rehabilitate,  
her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said spoke with his wife a couple of times Monday before  
his weekly media briefing. And while he would be heartened by her 
visit, he said he did not want to set back her recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see her. I miss her deeply,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said his wife's doctor warned that she would want to do  
too much once she felt better. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot let her overdo it,'' Holtz remembered the doctor  
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple will return to the Mayo Clinic next month for tests.  
</P>
<P>
	Holtz is working all hours to revamp and revive the Gamecocks,  
who hold the country's longest losing streak at 17 straight games. 
Having his wife of 38 years beside him would make things easier, 
Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very hard to go through by yourself,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Beth Holtz, 60, has gotten cards and letters from fans and  
well-wishers throughout the country. She had helped convince Holtz 
to return to coaching at South Carolina and was a main reason her 
son, Skip, left Connecticut to become his father's offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's doing well. Her attitude is marvelous,'' Holtz  
said. ``She's a special person, she really is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she feels that way about me right now,'' he  
joked, ``but I feel that way about her.''

<HEADLINE> More Questionable Calls in ALCS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two more questionable calls against the Red Sox on  
Sunday night had fans flinging debris onto the field and Boston 
manager Jimy Williams getting ejected after throwing his cap. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought to three the number of umpires' decisions that have  
gone against the Red Sox. And two of the umpires admitted later 
they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's being taken away from us, but we don't know  
why,'' Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees beat Boston 9-2 Sunday night and took a 3-1  
lead in the best-of-7 AL Championship Series. They can win it 
Monday night at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, trailing 3-2, had a runner on first and one out in  
the bottom of the eighth Sunday when John Valentin hit a grounder 
to Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch took a swipe at Jose Offerman on his way to second.  
Second-base umpire Tim Tschida called Offerman out, and Knoblauch 
threw to first to complete the inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams argued the call, and fans watching the instant replay  
on mounted televisions booed wildly and directed obscenities at the 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make the right call,'' Tschida said. ``I couldn't get  
into a position where I could see daylight between the glove and 
the runner. The only position I ever got to see that daylight came 
when I got to the dressing room and saw it on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch said he had ``no idea'' if he tagged Offerman. ``I  
didn't know what was going on after I threw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tschida ``just said he (Knoblauch) tagged me,'' Offerman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams didn't go to the interview room and issued a statement  
saying, ``It's the first one to win four (games), and it's not over 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees added six runs in the ninth, before first-base  
umpire Dale Scott made the second questionable call in the bottom 
of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra led off with a grounder to third baseman Scott  
Brosius and Scott called Garciaparra out. Replays showed he beat 
the throw. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway Park erupted with booing. Williams ran onto the field to  
protest, chopping his hand through the air and throwing his cap in 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	Trash streamed onto the outfield -- bottles, cups, a batting  
helmet. Yankees fled the field and their bullpen and ran to the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Play was halted while more than a dozen police and security  
staff took the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens. What are you going to do?'' Garciaparra said of  
the call. 
</P>
<P>
	And the fans?  
</P>
<P>
	``Fans doing that, we can't control,'' he said. ``Obviously,  
they have feelings. They're pretty emotional, too. That stuff 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first incorrect call against Boston came at a critical  
moment in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	With Offerman at first and the score tied 3-3 in the top of the  
10th, Valentin hit a grounder to Brosius. The throw was dropped by 
Knoblauch, but second base umpire Rick Reed ruled that Knoblauch 
dropped the ball while transferring it to his throwing hand. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Reed admitted he was wrong, that Knoblauch never  
had possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you want is to get the benefit of the doubt and to get  
respect,'' Lewis said. ``I'm not saying we don't have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He shrugged when told it may seem that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``What can you do, man?'' Lewis asked.

<HEADLINE> Master P Nets 8 in Exhibition Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Millionaire rapper Percy Miller, known  
as Master P., scored eight points for the Toronto Raptors in a 
preseason win over the Vancouver Grizzlies on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, invited to the Raptors' training camp, was inserted into  
the lineup in the fourth quarter with his team well ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	After committing a turnover and having two of his shots blocked,  
Miller made two 3-pointers and a layup. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapper played the final two minutes of Toronto's previous  
preseason game, but was 0-for-2 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's said to be worth about $400 million, Miller had to  
carry the bags of some of the veterans during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old has parlayed his rap records into a flourishing  
business with his own label, No Limit Records, and a financial 
interest in a sports agent business, No Limit Sports. His company 
represents NFL rookie Ricky Williams, and NBA players Ron Mercer 
and Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	An all-state high school player in Louisiana, Miller's  
collegiate career at Houston was brief. He was waived by the 
Charlotte Hornets during camp last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before signing with the Hornets, he was with the CBA's Fort  
Wayne Fury. Miller is an acquaintance of Toronto coach Butch 
Carter. He'll likely be released next week.

<HEADLINE> Quarterback Injury Blitz Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dan Marino, the NFL's best old quarterback, had to leave on  
Miami's second series in New England with a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the NFL's best young quarterbacks -- Arizona's Jake  
Plummer, Detroit's Charlie Batch and Jacksonville's Mark Brunell -- 
were lost with injuries of varying severity. 
</P>
<P>
	And Brett Favre, the NFL's best 30-year-old quarterback, has  
been playing all season with a painful thumb injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the carnage ever end?  
</P>
<P>
	A third of the way into the season, 14 of the 31 quarterbacks  
who were supposed to be their team's starters have missed time with 
injuries. They range from a possible career-ending concussion 
(Steve Young) and a season-ending Achilles' injury (Vinny 
Testaverde) to Batch's bruised right arm, which might not cost him 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Favre.  
</P>
<P>
	In a 31-10 loss to Denver which, without John Elway, knows all  
about quarterback problems, Favre was just 7-for-23 for 120 yards 
with three interceptions, his worst day as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't blame the thumb injury that he ignored through three  
game-winning drives, but it sure looked like it hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to play like this,'' said Favre, the  
three-time league MVP. ``I didn't expect to lose like this. Games 
like this happen. It was ugly. This is a character check. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thumb has been bothering me all year, but it is not an  
excuse. I don't want it to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's casualties were of varying degrees.  
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, having a bad year in part because of various nagging  
injuries, broke a finger on his throwing hand and will be gone a 
while. Marino has a bruised shoulder and will undergo an MRI today 
-- who knows what that will find? 
</P>
<P>
	Batch seems less serious, a bruised upper arm.  
</P>
<P>
	And Brunell has bruised ribs and should be back when  
Jacksonville plays again in two weeks. In fact, when he left on 
Sunday, the Jaguars trailed the Browns 7-6. His backup, journeyman 
Jay Fiedler, went 11-of-13 and Jacksonville won 21-7 and left the 
field to cries of ``Fiedler! Fiedler! Fiedler!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only backup hero.  
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard, who replaced Marino, threw an interception for a  
touchdown on his first pass but rallied the Dolphins to a 31-30 
victory with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Stanley Pritchett with 23 
seconds left. The same thing happened on Oct. 10, 1993, when Marino 
tore an Achilles', Scott Mitchell threw an interception for a TD on 
his first pass as his replacement, then rallied the Dolphins to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kurt Warner has thrown 15 TD passes in five games as the  
replacement for Trent Green, who was supposed to be the starter in 
St. Louis but tore up a knee in the third exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the emergence of new stars (and Mitchell has since submerged  
again) isn't much consolation for the quarterbacks who are hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Or for the game.  
</P>
<P>
	One last thing.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Parcells, still looking for a quarterback to replace  
Testaverde with the Jets, benched Rick Mirer Sunday and started his 
unconventional favorite, Ray Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final play of the game, Lucas sprained an ankle trying to  
throw a desperation and had to be carted off. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it ever end?

<HEADLINE> Poll: No Dominant Campaign Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans say the issues they most want to  
hear discussed during the 2000 presidential campaign are health 
insurance, the proper use of U.S. troops and the future of Social 
Security and Medicare, a new poll said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of one dominant issue gives the personal qualities  
of the candidates increased importance in the 2000 presidential 
campaign, the poll suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	That appears to have hampered Al Gore in head-to-head matchups  
with GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who had been running 11 to 15 
points ahead of the vice president. Gore narrowed that gap to 7 
points, 51-44, in the poll by the Pew Research Center for the 
People &AMP; the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president benefits from increased support from women;  
50 percent of women would vote for Gore today compared to 40 
percent in September, while 45 percent of women in this poll said 
they back Bush. Support for Gore remains unchanged among men at 37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, noted ``how  
steady the Bush lead is among men and how variable it is among 
women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Women seem to be less focused on Gore's personal  
shortcomings,'' Kohut said, ``but men seem more focused on his 
personal qualities as negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of those who opposed Gore, about half cited his close ties to  
President Clinton as a reason for not supporting him, while more 
than a third said it was his personality and leadership abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Various polls this year have indicated most people think Gore  
has integrity and is intelligent, but many also describe him as 
boring and not a leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,032 adults was taken Oct. 7-11 and has an error  
margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, plus or minus 4 
percent for registered voters, and slightly larger for subgroups 
such as Democratic or Republican primary voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Gore had substantial leads in the race for their own  
parties' nominations in this poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Though their interest was spread over a wide range of issues,  
those surveyed were most likely, 62 percent, to show a high level 
of interest in discussion of how the poor and uninsured can get 
health insurance. Those most inclined to say they wanted to hear 
about health insurance were female, black and had incomes under 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost a fourth of the public have closely followed proposals by  
presidential candidates to expand health coverage by the poor, more 
than the 17 percent who follow campaign news in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and his Democratic presidential rival, former New Jersey  
Sen. Bill Bradley, have offered comprehensive proposals on 
expanding health care for the uninsured. Gore's plan focuses on 
children while Bradley has suggested a plan that ensures access to 
affordable coverage for children and adults in low and 
middle-income families. Republican candidates, including Bush, 
suggest various combinations of expanded medical savings accounts 
and tax incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the beginning of the campaign it was clear that health  
insurance, both access to and the ability to pay for it, have been 
central concerns for voters across the country,'' said Bradley 
spokesman Eric Hauser, who said his candidate's approach was the 
most comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority in the poll, 56 percent, said they're very interested  
in hearing about whether U.S. troops should be sent into countries 
to stop the killing of innocent civilians in a civil war. Those 
most likely to want to hear more about those issues were men and 
those with some college education. 
</P>
<P>
	Half said their top priority for campaign discussion was keeping  
Medicare financially sound, and almost that many, 46 percent, said 
they wanted to hear discussion of investing Social Security funds 
in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those most likely to want to hear about Medicare were women,  
those with a high school education or less, and those who make less 
than $30,000 a year and not surprisingly, older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	While the poll ``does show a little progress for Gore, there's  
still a lot of uncertainty here,'' said Kohut, noting the election 
was more than a year away. ``We will see a lot of ups and downs. 
People don't have a lot of conviction about this.''

<HEADLINE> 'El Duque' Is Mr. Cool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fenway's fans didn't scare El Duque and neither  
did the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	When you've fled Cuba -- by raft or yacht, it doesn't matter --  
nothing intimidates you. 
</P>
<P>
	On a night many degrees removed from his island homeland in  
temperature and locale, Hernandez wrapped up the New York Yankees' 
record 36th American League pennant in his typical Mr. Cool 
fashion. The MVP pitched them past the Red Sox 6-1 Monday night to 
win the AL Championship Series 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 1/2 years after making his major league debut, he's 4-0  
in postseason play with a 0.97 ERA, nearly halfway to Whitey Ford's 
Yankees record of 10 postseason wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Think that's impressive?  
</P>
<P>
	Toying with major league hitters as if they were kids on  
sandlots, he's allowed four earned runs in 37 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing seems to rattle him.  
</P>
<P>
	Not the taunts of Red Sox fans or the threat of debris flying on  
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Not falling behind 3-0 in the count. He's just setting up the  
batter -- with more windups than most teams have pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not questions about his age - is he 30 or 34? He answers only to  
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Not the debate over whether he left Cuba on a raft or in a  
luxury boat. His answers are as hard to figure as his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	On a staff that struggled for consistency at times, he became  
the anchor, never going more than three starts without a win after 
mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the concern about Roger Clemens' legs, Andy Pettitte's  
mind, David Cone's arm and Hideki Irabu's gut, Hernandez was the 
constant: Just give him the ball and let him pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were shivering at Fenway Park as Boston completed its  
81st consecutive season without a World Series title. If El Duque 
was cold, it was hard to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed just five hits in seven-plus innings -- just one from

pitches.

	The Red Sox had first and third with no outs in their first time  
up, and he got out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	They had first and second with two outs the inning after that,  
and he got out of it again.

<P>
	They got a runner to third with one out in the sixth, still  
trailing by just 2-0, and he escaped.

<P>
	Jason Varitek's leadoff homer in the eighth was the only run he  
allowed. By then, New York had built a 4-0 lead.

<P>
	Last year he was the savior, starting against Cleveland with the  
Yankees' season suddenly starting to slip away and beating the 
Indians to even the AL championship series 2-all.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Train Again in Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A presidential panel recommended Monday that  
the Navy be allowed to resume practice bombing on the Puerto Rican 
island of Vieques -- over the objections of the local population and 
the Puerto Rican government -- but that it prepare to abandon the 
island within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation drew immediate protest in Puerto Rico, where  
sentiment against the Navy has been growing since a civilian 
security guard was killed in a bombing accident in April. 
Protesters have been camping out on the bombing range since then, 
but the Navy is eager to resume using it. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, who was traveling in the Middle  
East, issued a written statement calling the report balanced. But 
he also asked the panel members to hold additional talks with the 
Puerto Ricans and the Navy before he makes a final recommendation 
to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear from the panel's report there are serious concerns  
among the residents of Vieques which need and deserve the careful 
attention of the Navy and the Department of Defense,'' Cohen wrote. 
Without suggesting any particular solution, Cohen said he believed 
more discussions would be productive. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Cohen acts, the Navy apparently will continue its  
moratorium on live-fire training on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Vieques, activists reacted swiftly to news of the panel's  
recommendation, which includes steps to immediately reduce the 
amount of training on Vieques and improve safety for the island's 
9,300 residents. The report also recommended the return of some 
Navy land on Vieques to Puerto Rico, including an ammunition 
storage area and 110 acres to be used for a runway extension at the 
Vieques commercial airport. The Navy owns about two-thirds of the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a way to give the Navy time to find allies,''  
said Carlos Ventura, president of the Fishermen's Association of 
Southern Vieques, which has set up a protest camp on the bombing 
range at the eastern tip of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it is unacceptable that the Navy start exercises  
again,'' Ventura said. ``We are going to stay there and continue 
our civil disobedience. They will have to arrest us, and when that 
happens there will be many more people who will come out and join 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Ricans raise a host of environmental, health and other  
objections to the practice bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sila Calderon, San Juan mayor and front-runner in the 2000  
gubernatorial race, said, ``The Puerto Rican people have to remain 
unequivocally firm that we do not want military exercises to begin 
again in Vieques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Live-firing training, including air-to-ground bombing, naval  
gunfire and artillery, ceased after the April 19 fatality. Military 
leaders say the halt to training is chipping away at the combat 
readiness of naval forces who deploy from the East Coast, including 
aircraft carrier battle groups and Marine units. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future of Vieques Island as a training facility must  
transcend the emotion of the April 19th tragedy,'' Adm. Jay 
Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said in a written statement 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said he was pleased the  
presidential panel agreed with the Navy's view that there is no 
viable short-term alternative to Vieques as a combined arms 
training facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge the people of Puerto Rico -- some 6,000 of whose  
residents serve in the Navy and Marine Corps -- to accept this 
judgment,'' Danzig said. He said he accepts the panel's 
recommendation that the Navy place a higher priority on improving 
its relationship with the Puerto Rican people. To that end, Danzig 
said he was authorizing the assignment of a two-star admiral to 
Puerto Rico with the specific task of building a better 
relationship with Puerto Rico and with Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the seriousness of the dispute is a behind-the-scenes  
concern in the Pentagon that if the Puerto Ricans succeed in 
ousting the Navy from Vieques, they will indirectly energize 
similar efforts by activists opposed to the military's training 
presence elsewhere in America and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps, for example, has battled opposition to its  
training in Okinawa for years. Anti-military sentiment erupted in 
Italy last year when a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler aircraft severed 
a ski lift cable in the Italian Alps, killing 20 people, while on a 
training run from Aviano Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential panel is headed by Francis Rush of the Defense  
Department's Force Management Policy Office. Other panel members 
are former Rep. Lee Hamilton, a former chairman of the House 
Foreign Relations Committee; retired Marine Corps Gen. Richard 
Neal; and retired Navy Vice Adm. Diego Hernandez, a former 
commander of the Navy's Third Fleet.

	Robert Ray Formally Replaces Starr  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three federal appeals court judges today  
formally replaced Kenneth Starr, leaving the investigation of 
President Clinton and the first lady in the hands of career 
prosecutor Robert Ray. ``There can be no more vital consideration 
now than closure with all deliberate speed,'' one of the judges, 
Richard Cudahy wrote. ``Our selection of Robert Ray carries much 
promise.'' Ray took the oath as independent counsel at the federal 
courthouse and vowed to wrap up the five-year, $40 million-plus 
investigation in a ``prompt, responsible and cost-effective 
manner.''

	Indonesia To Vote on East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Lawmakers vote this week for a new  
president and whether to accept East Timor's overwhelming vote for 
independence -- key steps in Indonesia's difficult transition to 
democracy. The 700-member People's Consultative Assembly decides 
Wednesday who will be Indonesia's leader for the next five years, 
but embattled President B.J. Habibie may not make it that far. His 
political future hinges on a parliamentary vote tomorrow on whether 
to accept a recent ``accountability'' speech about his 
administration's successes and failures. If they don't, Habibie's 
Golkar Party may replace him as its presidential nominee -- a 
last-minute move that could change the vote's outcome.

	Cyclone Kills 16 in Eastern India

<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Packing 120 mph winds, uprooting trees  
and toppling houses, a cyclone killed 16 people in the eastern 
Indian state of Orissa today, a domestic news agency said. The 
cyclone, coming from the Bay of Bengal, crossed the coast after 
midnight and caused widespread damage, Press Trust of India said. 
State chief minister Giridhar Gamag, who made an aerial survey of 
hard-hit areas, said 10 of the 16 victims were killed in Berhampur 
town, which was inundated, while two deaths each were reported from 
Khurda, Puri and Gopalpur.

after the first of the year,'' she told reporters, after saying

solution to the budget impasse. ``We need to sit down and do it

three-year spending plan announced today is expected to bring 
upgraded Web access to about 35 million homes, or 80 percent of 
SBC's customers, including those from the just-completed purchase 
of Ameritech, the local phone company in the Midwest. SBC's other 
units are Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell in California, Nevada

straight World Series tonight when Orlando Hernandez faces Kent 
Mercker of the Boston Red Sox in Game 5 of the AL Championship 
Series. Last night's 9-2 win gave New York a 3-1 lead in the series 
and moved them within a win of a record 36th American League 
pennant. Boston must win the next two to give the ball back to 
Pedro Martinez, who stopped the Yankees' 12-game postseason winning 
streak with seven shutout innings in Saturday's 13-1 rout of Roger 
Clemens.

seeking to win the White House. ``No one can help anyone else in a 
campaign beyond a certain point,'' Clinton said. The president told 
reporters he agrees with Gore, who told The Washington Post last 
week that his bid for the Democratic nomination is a ``very

	MIAMI (AP) -- A weather system brewing in the Atlantic became  
Tropical Storm Jose early today and was expected to strengthen into 
a hurricane in the next few days, forecasters said. ``In 24 to 48 
hours it could reach hurricane status,'' said Jack Bevin, a 
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. At 
8 a.m. EDT, the center of Jose was about 430 miles east-southeast

not before dumping nearly a foot of rain in parts of eastern North

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel pledged today to stop a practice that  
Jerusalem's Palestinian residents have decried as harassment -- the 
revocation of residency permits for Palestinians who have been 
absent from the city. Under a 1967 law, Israel can revoke the 
residency rights of Palestinians who have lived outside Jerusalem 
for seven years. Israel has used the law to revoke residency 
permits for 5,906 Palestinians, mostly in the last four years, when 
it began implementing the law in earnest, the Israeli human rights 
group Betselem said.

The Russian troops are entrenched to the north and west of the 
capital Grozny, and are close enough to shell the city. But the 
Russians have not yet launched a ground attack on the city, and say 
the main aims are to build a security zone around Chechnya, and 
then root out Islamic militants.

to get in shape despite his Parkinson's disease that has slowed his

<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel pledged today to stop a practice that  
Jerusalem's Palestinian residents have decried as harassment -- the 
revocation of residency permits for Palestinians who have been 
absent from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1967 law, Israel can revoke the residency rights of  
Palestinians who have lived outside Jerusalem for seven years. 
Israel has used the law to revoke residency permits for 5,906 
Palestinians, mostly in the last four years, when it began 
implementing the law in earnest, the Israeli human rights group 
Betselem said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday, Interior Minister Natan Sharansky said Israel  
will not ``use the excuse of them not being here to revoke their 
residence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Interior Ministry will not ask (a Palestinian) to bring  
all kinds of water and electricity bills for the last 10 years to 
check'' if he was in Jerusalem, Sharansky told Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians have complained that the permit revocations are an  
attempt to limit the Palestinian population in the disputed city. 
The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem -- captured by Israel from 
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war -- as a future capital of a 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	Those stripped of their Jerusalem identity card usually manage  
to enter the city, but are no longer able to get health care or 
send their children to Jerusalem schools. Their movements are also 
limited, as they fear passing through Israeli army checkpoints 
between Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharansky has pledged sweeping reforms in the ministry, which in  
the past has been accused of harassing Palestinians and new 
immigrants suspected of not being Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	Betselem welcomed the changes in policy but said Israel must  
also rescind the residency law. Otherwise, Betselem spokesman Tomer 
Feffer said, ``there is nothing to prevent the next interior 
minister from enforcing the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Supreme Court is considering a petition to end the  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians want to establish the capital of a future state  
in east Jerusalem. Israel says it will never relinquish control of 
the entire city, home to 430,000 Jews and 200,000 Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel also distributed hundreds of travel permits today to  
Palestinians in preparation for the twice-delayed opening of a land 
link between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Israel and the Palestinians still failed to agree on a  
date for opening the so-called safe passage which will allow 
Palestinians for the first time to move relatively freely between 
the two areas that lie on either side of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The route, using existing roads in Israel, was to have opened  
Oct. 3, but there are still disagreements over operating it. Among 
the issues yet to be resolved are crossing procedures for 
Palestinians who live outside the self-rule areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has approved 800 travel permits, and began distributing  
500 of them today through Palestinian Authority officials.

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Decide Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that  
she won't make her final decision about running for the Senate from 
New York until sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady also had kind words for former Sen. Bill Bradley,  
who is battling Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
Polls show Bradley running stronger in New York than the vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Mrs. Clinton said that while she favors campaign finance  
reform, she won't ``unilaterally eliminate any potential 
fund-raising means'' in her quest for the Senate, other than not 
accepting tobacco money. Her fund-raising team hopes to raise $25 
million for the race that is expected to pit her against Republican 
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief, hallway encounter with reporters, Mrs. Clinton said  
a proposal to put an Indian-run casino in the Catskills is ``really 
worth considering'' because of the potential benefits it could 
bring the economically struggling area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am looking toward after the first of the year to make a  
final decision'' about running, Mrs. Clinton said following a forum 
on pensions and economic security held at a community center in 
Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton gave every indication her candidacy is a go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be doing interviews after the first of the year,'' she  
told reporters just a few minutes after saying at the forum that 
she would begin doing one-on-one interviews with the news media 
``when I become a candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While both the first lady and Giuliani have begun raising money  
for the Senate race, neither has formally declared their 
candidacies. The Clintons have purchased a five-bedroom home in 
suburban Westchester County that will allow Mrs. Clinton to 
establish residency in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bradley, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she is ``very  
committed'' to Gore's candidacy. Nonetheless, she also said she had 
``a lot of respect and admiration for Senator Bradley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased that both of them have come forward with  
important ideas and positions for this campaign ... It's an 
important debate that I think the two of them will have in the 
weeks ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent statewide polls have shown Bradley, a former New York  
Knicks star and former senator from neighboring New Jersey, running 
stronger in New York than Gore against the Republican front-runner, 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent pollster Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's  
Institute for Public opinion, said Mrs. Clinton's kind words for 
Bradley ``makes good New York sense'' given his level of support in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something to be said for Clinton fatigue and the  
combination of Al Gore and Hillary Clinton certainly contributes to 
that in New York,'' the pollster said.

<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- Two-time refugee Herbert Person Jr.  
knows his long-running nightmare is beyond control, but he's still 
frustrated and angry by Hurricane Floyd, and now Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting to the point where I can't take it any more,''  
said Person, one of about 300 other refugees from Princeville, 
Tarboro and Rocky Mount, the eastern towns hardest hit by Floyd 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Person and many others had moved into vacation-style campers  
provided by the government a few weeks ago after water from the Tar 
River reached the roofs of their homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	They were evacuated again to a Rocky Mount school over the  
weekend before Hurricane Irene dumped more rain because their 
trailers are not designed to withstand strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked hard all my life and paid taxes and now I feel  
like I have nothing,'' said Person, who during Floyd lost his 
Princeville home, which was nearly paid for. ``I can't work because 
I have to take care of business. But if I don't work I'm afraid the 
bank will take my truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so stressed out I don't know what to do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross reported that about 700 people were  
staying at shelters Sunday across eastern North Carolina. Most were 
expected to be able to go home today after Hurricane Irene headed 
out into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Those among the 170 people at the D.S. Johnson School on Sunday  
were more philosophical than Person about their plight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fear the next step we're going to make is in the ground,''  
Fannie Lewis said glumly as heavy rain drummed on a corrugated 
plastic roof over the walkway at the school. ``You can run, but you 
can't hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 37, isn't a complainer. But sleeping on a gymnasium floor  
again is not what the doctor recommended for her bad back. She's on 
disability after undergoing three operations for a ruptured disc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to hold on because where there's a will there's a  
way,'' she said. ``But this is sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haywood Sherrod, 50, suffers from high blood pressure and  
diabetes. His medication is back in his camper trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came by around 6:30 p.m. last night and told us we had to  
leave because they were concerned about the high winds,'' he said 
Sunday. ``I just said, 'Oh, no. Not again.' It's hard to run 
again.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ford Earns $1.11B in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Ford Motor Co. kept on trucking last  
quarter, kicking its earnings up 11 percent to $1.11 billion 
through hot sales of sport utility vehicles and pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker earned 90 cents a share for the  
three months ending in September, compared with $1 billion, or 80 
cents a share, for the same period of 1998. Sales totaled $38 
billion, up 16 percent from $32.6 billion a year ago, thanks in 
part to the acquisition of Swedish carmaker Volvo AB. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, a record for the quarter, beat Wall Street  
analysts' expectations of 85 cents a share, according to a survey 
of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. Ford's shares rose 
$1.50 to $52.06 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The results ``were out of the ballpark,'' said analyst Rod Lache  
of Deutsche Bank Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's results came a few days after General Motors Corp.  
reported a $877 million profit for the quarter, also due in large 
part to strong North American sales. DaimlerChrysler AG is 
scheduled to report its earnings next week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 14th straight quarter of improved earnings for Ford,  
which has taken advantage of the industry's record-setting year for 
car and truck sales. The company also reached a contract agreement 
with the United Auto Workers earlier this month without a costly 
work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continued our strong earnings momentum, despite very  
competitive markets worldwide, by building our brands, leveraging 
the synergies offered by our global scale and maintaining a 
rigorous cost discipline,'' said Ford president and CEO Jac Nasser. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's earnings would have been higher, but the company took a  
$125 million, one-time profit reduction related to higher costs for 
retiree healthcare and life insurance at Ford's parts division, 
Visteon Automotive Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Ford earned $5.4 billion, or  
$4.39 a share, up from $4.9 billion in the first nine months of 
1998, excluding a gain of $16 billion from the sale of Associates 
First Capital, a finance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits in North America and cost-cutting offset Ford losses in  
Europe and South America. The company said it had cut costs $300 
million in the quarter, and had squeezed out $700 million in cost 
cuts so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, Ford earned $1 billion, up 12 percent from the  
third quarter of 1998. Ford said a firm job market and low 
borrowing costs contributed to strong sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Through September, Ford's U.S. light vehicle sales were up 5  
percent, excluding Jaguar and Volvo. Lache said Ford was doing well 
thanks to surging sales in high-profit trucks and sport utility 
vehicles; Ford's truck sales were up 7 percent through September. 
</P>
<P>
	Lache also said Ford had profited from new car models -- the  
Lincoln LS and Jaguar S-Type luxury sedans and the Ford Focus, the 
replacement for the Escort. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, the company lost $171 million, compared with a loss  
of $273 million last year. Ford said lower sales of its Mondeo and 
Fiesta cars were partially offset by cost cuts, improvements in 
Jaguar sales and the addition of Volvo AB, which Ford bought last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses increased in South America to $72 million, from $44  
million last year. A weak economy in Brazil and work stoppages 
there hurt earnings, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Osmond Depressed After Giving Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bout of postpartum depression caused Marie  
Osmond to abandon her husband and seven children this summer, 
planning never to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Osmond became depressed after the birth of her son Matthew  
on July 6, while she was on hiatus from her daytime variety show 
``Donny &AMP; Marie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically gave the baby to the babysitter, gave her the  
credit card, got in my car and just really felt that my kids would 
be better off if they did not have a mother,'' Ms. Osmond said in 
the Oct. 23 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just left, never thinking I would come back, not really  
knowing where I was going or what I was doing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Osmond, who had moved from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles,  
drove up the California coast until her husband, Brian Blosil, 
reached her on her cellular phone and convinced her to check into a 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
	She was treated for depression.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am still going through it,'' she said. ``It is such an  
incredibly dark place.''

<HEADLINE> TV Stations Discuss Columbine H.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- When the three executives responsible for  
what most Americans saw on TV in the horrifying hours after the 
Columbine High School massacre share their stories, what's most 
striking is what they leave out. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little boasting, no talk about who had the best camera  
angles, whose news helicopter was first on the scene or who was 
quickest to divulge the names of the two boys who killed 13 people 
and themselves this spring in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they're more apt to talk about what didn't make the  
air. Or why a psychologist was secretly sent to speak to reporters. 
Or why three people who live to beat each other on stories actually 
met to plan coverage together when Columbine reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	The lessons that news directors of KCNC-TV, KMGH-TV and KUSA-TV  
in Denver offer today have more to do with sensitivity than speed 
in telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, we sort of put the competitive situation  
behind because we all wanted to see this come out the right way,'' 
said Angie Kucharski of KCNC at a recent panel run by the Radio and 
Television News Directors Association in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the stations covered the developing story live on April  
20, and their reports were fed to the world via cable news stations 
and broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
	By no means was the coverage perfect. KUSA goofed by putting on  
the air in a live feed a young man who said he was a student 
calling on a cell phone from within Columbine. He turned out to be 
an impostor, but if it had been real, it was a situation that could 
have put him or others in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations aired helicopter footage of SWAT teams moving in and  
students fleeing in panic -- risky pictures if the gunmen were still 
alive and had access to television. 
</P>
<P>
	But two experts who went back and reviewed the coverage praised  
how the local stations handled it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they did a remarkably good job, considering the  
situation, considering the stress and the kind of pressure they 
were under with live television,'' said Alicia Shepard of American 
Journalism Review, who is devoting a chapter to Columbine in a 
journalism textbook she is writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were tremendously sensitive to the culture and the  
audience,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Steele, an ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute in  
Florida, said that despite some mistakes, the coverage held up well 
compared to similar major breaking stories. The local journalists 
were appropriately aggressive and thorough, yet were respectful to 
people caught up in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the stations held back reporting the names of victims  
and assailants, in some cases for hours, until they were confirmed 
by authorities. Some reporters who interviewed students urged them 
not to identify who they saw in school. Cameras were often left 
behind when students were approached for interviews, or they 
weren't approached at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The news directors said it was important not to fill air time  
with speculation for fear of terrifying parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magnitude of the story forces you to take that step back  
and say, `We don't need to be wrong on this,''' Kucharski said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first day, the news directors -- aware of community  
resentment against national reporters -- met to plan coverage for 
when Columbine students returned. The news executives also watched 
the emotional health of their employees; Diane Mulligan of KMGH-TV 
brought cookies and coffee to the scene and arranged for 
post-trauma counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I have is what would have happened in Los Angeles  
or New York City?'' Shepard said. ``Would the same thing have 
happened or would the competitiveness have gotten in the way of 
sensitivity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's also striking when watching the three news directors  
discuss their coverage is that each of them -- Kucharski, Mulligan 
and Patti Ann Dennis -- is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing whether that has anything to do with their story  
coverage is, in itself, a sensitive issue. Kucharski's back seemed 
to stiffen when she was asked about it, as if guarding against an 
oncoming professional slight. Her decisions were in the service of 
journalism, not gender, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To Shepard, the question is not out of line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they were very solid journalistically and the  
fact that they were women may have enhanced their sensitivity,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele noted that there has been some academic research into the  
question of a masculine and feminine approach to decision-making 
and moral reasoning. Neither approach is always connected to 
gender, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that these were three women news directors may have  
had something to do with the quality of the coverage and the 
sensitivity that the stations brought to it,'' he said. ``They were 
good leaders and decision-makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, how a television station performs when tested by a  
breaking story of this magnitude has much to do with the staff's 
experiences and grounding as journalists, and the direction set 
from the top. There's only so much that can be done in advance, 
Kucharski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the scanner goes off,'' she said, ``I have yet to see a  
newsroom where they open up their drawers and get their binders out 
to look at a plan.'' 
</P>

in Mulhouse, France. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, the supersonic Concorde made its first landing in New  
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, the stock market crashed as the Dow Jones Industrial  
Average plunged 508 points, or 22.6 percent in value. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The Senate rejected a proposed constitutional  
amendment barring desecration of the American flag. Camilo Jose 
Cela of Spain received the Nobel Prize for literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Twenty-two people were killed as a terrorist  
bomb shattered a bus in the heart of Tel Aviv's shopping district. 
Entertainer Martha Raye died in Los Angeles at age 78. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Health Clubs Expect Senior Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rock 'n' roll music and rock-hard biceps might  
inspire health club workouts among the under-35 crowd. But what 
about their parents and grandparents? 
</P>
<P>
	With America starting to undergo a major population shift in  
which old will be in, the atmosphere at a typical health club may 
soon change. 
</P>
<P>
	As the first baby boomers close in on retirement, the $9.6  
billion-a-year fitness industry is slowly but surely starting to 
plan for a seniors' fitness boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Still largely an afterthought for most clubs, older Americans  
are living longer than ever and have more money than the 18- to 
35-year-olds targeted most often. The number of people 55 and older 
who exercise frequently soared 75 percent from 1987 to 1996, to 
14.2 million, according to a report by American Sports Data 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tremendous difference now,'' said Jack LaLanne, the  
original TV exercise guru, interviewed at a national fitness 
industry convention in Chicago last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many more people from older generations are working out,''  
said LaLanne, who still has 15-inch biceps and can do fingertip 
pushups at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
	But while seniors are a potentially lucrative market for  
commercial fitness clubs, they remain a mostly untapped market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more awareness of the senior market,'' said Terence  
Moffatt, editor-in-chief of Club Industry, a fitness industry trade 
magazine. ``The challenge is how to integrate a softer, toned-down 
setting for seniors into an existing club with a traditional 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: The iron-pumping, body-beautiful scene intimidates  
seniors whose goals might be as simple as to become fit enough to 
lift a grandchild or climb a staircase without getting out of 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
	Ly Hotchkin, 75, and two older friends from the Chicago suburb  
of Burr Ridge, Ill., exercise together at a community center to the 
sounds of Glenn Miller. They quickly dismissed the notion of 
working out at a traditional fitness center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to go into a club where girls in their little  
bikinis are working out. It's very discouraging to see those young 
bodies,'' she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health clubs have opened separate areas for 50-and-overs  
where easy-listening music is played softly and the atmosphere is 
less aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	A small handful of suppliers market equipment for seniors,  
including strength training gear that uses pneumatic cylinders for 
resistance instead of iron weights that some find hard to lift. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the economy flourishing and the industry prospering,  
most clubs are content to cater to the traditional clientele for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident at the Chicago convention, where pounding rock  
'n' roll sounded from numerous booths and svelte young fitness 
buffs plugged high-tech, high-energy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a couple of companies in the vast hall focused their sales  
pitches on the aging, including Fresno, Calif.-based Keiser Corp. 
and Ann Arbor, Mich.-based NuStep Inc., which used Hotchkin and her 
friends to demonstrate workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to change the mindset that this is an industry for  
the young,'' said Colin Milner, vice president of Keiser, a pioneer 
in providing equipment exclusively for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	A health club can fare well these days just by succeeding with  
the under-35 group, Milner acknowledged. But those who ignore the 
population trend will be left behind, he contended, noting that by 
2010 the number of 55- to 74-year-olds will outnumber 25- to 
34-year-olds by 18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do is look at the demographics,'' he said.  
``There's this whole wave coming at you, and either you learn to 
swim in it or you get swept away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moffatt, the editor, said that if traditional clubs don't  
embrace the seniors market soon, a slew of seniors-only facilities 
will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	That's fine with Hotchkin and her friends. They only know that  
they are determined to work out somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The elderly are different from the days when people used to  
sit around in rocking chairs,'' explained Mary Scott, 84, who wore 
a bright blue workout suit. ``Now we live longer and we like to 
travel, and you've got to be in good shape to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our generation,'' she said, ``is getting into it.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Signed Before Irvin Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin signed  
a six-year contract extension before he was sidelined with a spine 
injury, but team officials said Irvin had already reached 
incentives that give him the option of becoming a free agent at the 
end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Jerry Jones said Monday that Irvin received an unspecified  
signing bonus when the deal was made earlier in the regular season. 
Jones told KDFW-TV the extension was part of an effort to clear 
room under the NFL's salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to demonstrate that we're interested in the  
future,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin sustained a swollen spine and a herniated disc in the  
Cowboys' 13-10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 10. He is 
still wearing a neck brace and was inactive for the team's game 
against the New York Giants on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Endicott, Irvin's agent, said the All-Pro wide receiver  
agreed to help the Cowboys with their salary cap woes in order to 
get more money up front. Endicott declined to comment on the 
details of the extension or the incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really a simple deal,'' he said. ``But it's all null  
and void now.''

	UN: More E. Timorese Return Home  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Between 5,000 and 6,000 East Timorese who  
fled their homes following an independence referendum that sparked 
weeks of fighting are walking home from neighboring West Timor, a 
U.N. spokesman said Monday. The Indonesian government says 260,000 
East Timorese fled to the western half of the island after an Aug. 
30 vote for independence sparked a violent backlash from 
pro-Indonesia militias and Indonesian troops, but U.N. officials 
say the figure may be higher.

	U.N. Rights Envoy Chides Cambodia  
</P>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodia could be using recent  
political stability as a chance to make progress on human rights, a 
U.N. envoy said Monday. With negotiations for a genocide tribunal 
for the Khmer Rouge stalled, U.N. human rights envoy Thomas 
Hammarberg urged the government to make positive use of the recent 
calm. Political strife in 1997 and 1998 coincided with a dramatic 
increase in human rights violations documented by U.N. workers, 
including the killings of about 100 royalist supporters in the wake 
of Prime Minister Hun Sen's 1997 coup.

ended the West African country's savage civil war, according to the 
final draft of a U.N. Security Council resolution circulated 
Monday. The council is expected to approve the resolution Friday, 
authorizing the peacekeepers to establish a presence at key 
locations across the country to help disarm and demobilize the 
combatants.

	Clinton, GOP Leaders To Hold Budget Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid rising tension over President Clinton's  
veto of a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill, the president and 
Republican congressional leaders agreed today to hold budget talks 
at the White House tomorrow. The Republicans said they would insist 
that no taxes are raised and that using Social Security's surpluses 
to pay for remaining spending bills is ruled out. House Majority 
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Republicans consider the surpluses 
issue ``the highest goal of our budget season.''

	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Residents of rural Northern  
California who lost dozens of homes to a weekend wildfire say they

<HEADLINE>  Tanzanians Welcome Nyerere Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Tanzanians  
thronged the international airport today to welcome home the 
remains of late president Julius Nyerere, the African statesman 
considered to be Tanzania's founding father. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Tanzania jet carrying Nyerere's coffin from London  
landed just after 9 a.m. local time amid cheers and wailing from 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	People had begun arriving around dawn to await the body of their  
beloved leader, who died Oct. 14 in a London hospital. As the plane 
arrived, some in the crowd fainted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police wielding truncheons pushed people back as they surged  
towards Nyerere's coffin, draped in the green, blue, black and 
yellow Tanzanian flag. An honor guard fired a 21-gun salute, and 
guard members fixed their eyes on the ground in a sign of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to see the man who is for me still my president,''  
said Mansul Abdul. ``Because of Nyerere, our parents were able to 
raise us,'' he said, referring to Nyerere's goal of providing free 
basic education and health care to all Tanzanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere's coffin was to be placed on a gun carriage and pulled  
six miles through this Indian Ocean port. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral mass was scheduled at St. Joseph's cathedral Tuesday  
morning for Nyerere, who died at age 77 after a battle with 
leukemia. Afterwards, the body of the man everyone called 
``Mwalimu'' -- teacher in Kiswahili -- will be taken to the National 
Stadium, where it will lie in state until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	World figures, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, are to attend a state funeral 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former South African President Nelson Mandela, the only other  
Africa leader of Nyerere's international stature, was not expected 
to attend the funeral because he was traveling in the Middle East, 
but his wife, Graca Machel was already in Dar es Salaam today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere will be buried Saturday in his home village, Butiama.  
</P>
<P>
	A founder of the Organization of African Unity in 1963, Nyerere  
was a leading proponent of economic sanctions against the former 
apartheid regime in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the drive for the independence of his East African nation  
from British rule and became the first president of what was then 
Tanganyika in 1962. In 1964, Nyerere presided over the union of the 
Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar and Tanganyika, on the 
mainland, to form Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Nyerere stepped down in 1985 after 23 years in office  
to devote time to farming and diplomacy, he remained the major 
power broker in the East African nation. He also worked tirelessly 
to negotiate an end to the violence that has wracked central and 
southern Africa in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Offended by Gore Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is not  
offended that Vice President Al Gore doesn't want his help in 
seeking to win the White House. ``No one can help anyone else in a 
campaign beyond a certain point,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president told reporters he agrees with Gore, who told The  
Washington Post last week that his bid for the Democratic 
nomination is a ``very personal quest'' and that he might ask 
Clinton not to help his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a decision he ought to make at an appropriate  
time,'' Clinton said following a meeting with his economic 
advisers. ``I agree with what he said about it. It won't matter who 
said it as much as it matters what is said. I just want the 
American people to make this judgment based on what's best for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said while he has not decided whether he would turn down  
Clinton's help, ``I may do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that is fine. ``The candidates will be the major  
players. Everybody else, to a greater or lesser degree, is in a 
subordinate role,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> SBC To Upgrade Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications, the nation's largest local  
phone company, plans to spend $6 billion in a bid to become the top 
provider of high-capacity, always-connected Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year spending plan announced today is expected to  
bring upgraded Web access to about 35 million homes, or 80 percent 
of SBC's customers, including those from the just-competed purchase 
of Ameritech, the local phone company in the Midwest. SBC's other 
units are Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell in California, Nevada 
Bell, and SNET in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment comes as the Baby Bell monopolies race to defend  
their markets against new threats from cable television and 
wireless communications. The new rivals are not only introducing 
improved Web service, but television and local and long-distance 
calling as well. 
</P>
<P>
	A big part of SBC's initiative will be to extend its fiber-optic  
networks farther into neighborhoods in major metropolitan and 
suburban areas, digging up streets to replace slower copper cables. 
</P>
<P>
	More rural parts of SBC's territories, however, would be  
upgraded later. Overall, about 12,000 miles of fiber-optic cable is 
to be installed under SBC's new spending program. 
</P>
<P>
	By bringing fiber-optic cables closer to each home, phone  
companies can provide more robust Internet access through a 
technology called DSL, or digital subscriber line. 
</P>
<P>
	While DSL can feature transmission speeds 5-to-60 times faster  
than the top computer modem using analog signals, the digital 
signal can only travel a few miles before fading. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from speed, DSL's other big advantage over conventional  
modems is that it provides a live, continuous link without having 
to dial up an access number. DSL also enables a person to use the 
same line for both Web access and a phone call at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC plans to provide minimum download speeds of 1.5 megabits per  
second, or more than 25 times faster than with a 56k modem. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL typically costs $40 to $60 a month for basic service, not  
including one-time installation and equipment charges of $200 to 
$300 or the monthly fee charged by Internet service providers such 
as America Online. Faster DSL speeds are often available for an 
additional monthly charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The $6 billion spending plan does not include spending in the 30  
new markets where SBC has pledged to introduce telephone and 
Internet services as a condition of winning government clearance 
for the Ameritech merger. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, which currently provides local service in 20 of the  
nation's top markets located in 13 states, plans to enter 12 of the 
new markets over the next 18 months and the rest within three 
years. The new markets include New York City, northern New Jersey, 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Denver, Minneapolis, 
Phoenix, and Portland, Ore.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Sued by Former Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya's onetime business manager  
is suing the former welterweight champ, claiming breach of contract 
for failure to honor a five-year contract signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hernandez alleged in a Superior Court suit filed Oct. 14  
that he was fired because De La Hoya ``decided to take over his own 
affairs,'' attorney Mark Polan said. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya was surprised to learn about the suit, according to  
his lawyers, Bert Fields and Robert Chapman. Both sides had been 
discussing resolution of claims in informal discussions, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, who said De La Hoya never signed the contract, said the  
fighter will now file a countersuit against Hernandez.

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Save Honolulu Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A group of Honolulu newspaper readers asked  
a federal appeals court Monday to uphold a judge's order keeping 
the Honolulu Star-Bulletin alive past its scheduled Oct. 30 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the 117-year-old afternoon newspaper agreed last month  
with Gannett Co., owner of the morning Honolulu Advertiser, to end 
their joint operating agreement and close the Star-Bulletin. 
Liberty Newspapers, owner of the Star-Bulletin, is to receive $26.5 
million in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of Hawaii filed an antitrust suit and won an  
injunction last Wednesday from U.S. District Judge Alan Kay 
blocking the closure until the suit is resolved. He cited the 
public interest in keeping separate editorial voices. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of both papers have asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals in San Francisco to lift Kay's order, arguing that their 
transaction is allowed by federal law and protected by freedom of 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a group called Save Our Star-Bulletin weighed in  
against the owners. Readers are ``vitally concerned about the loss 
of competition,'' the group's lawyer, Ernest Gellhorn, said in 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the publishers' claim of an emergency surrounding the  
Oct. 30 deadline ``is about money and nothing more. Liberty is 
concerned that it will not get its money on Oct. 30 ... and Gannett 
Pacific is concerned it will not get its newspaper monopoly on 
Oahu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honululu's city government has sought an antitrust investigation  
by the Justice Department, which last week removed boxes of 
documents from the newspapers' joint publishing agency.

<HEADLINE> Rescued Doctor Returns to Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Ohio (AP) -- The sister-in-law of the doctor rescued from  
the South Pole says having her family nearby will be as important 
as any medical procedure during treatment for a lump on her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Cahill said Sunday that her husband, Eric, and his  
brother, Scott, traveled to New Zealand to be reunited with their 
sister, Dr. Jerri Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen was rescued Saturday from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole  
Research Station, where she had been treating herself for the lump 
for months. Flights to and from the pole are impossible for much of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distance between she and the family, to not be able to  
physically comfort her, has been hard,'' Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Bob Bullock of Stratton Air National Guard in Scotia, N.Y.,  
would not say today whether Nielsen has returned to the United 
States yet. He would say only that his agency's mission ended 
Saturday morning when the second of the two planes landed at 
Christchurch, New Zealand, bringing Nielsen that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sick and would like to go the hospital and learn my  
fate,'' Nielsen said in an e-mail exchange with Newsweek shortly 
before her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am waiting to get off the Ice and find out what is going on.  
We are isolated here, as you know,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Communication with Nielsen was limited to e-mail and calls  
through ham radio operators when she was at the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, 47, of Youngstown, discovered the lump in June. She had  
been treating herself with chemotherapy since July, when medical 
supplies were dropped to her in another risky flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical supplies allowed her to perform her own biopsy and  
begin self-treatment with chemotherapy. She then e-mailed 
photographs of slide samples of the tumor to doctors in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	At her request, authorities have not released details of her  
diagnosis or condition. Newsweek, citing a National Science 
Foundation source, reported that after Nielsen completed the first 
round of chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. 
</P>
<P>
	She was rescued by a special military plane that made the flight  
to the domed station. The flight was made possible by an easing in 
the Antarctic winter temperature to 58 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her illness, Cahill said Nielsen kept busy with her  
duties up until she left the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't have time to focus on her condition at all. She's a  
very giving person,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gun Lobbying Costs Up 467 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeing a chance for a rare legislative  
victory, the leading gun-control group has increased lobbying 
spending almost fivefold over 1998 levels and recruited 
entertainers Susan Sarandon and Rosie O'Donnell for an advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Success on Capitol Hill, however, remains elusive, thanks in  
part to an aggressive counteroffensive by the National Rifle 
Association. The NRA also has spent more as it tries to stymie 
gun-control advocates who hope that this year's spate of deadly 
school shootings had sufficiently bolstered their case. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high and the issue remains alive despite months  
of gridlock on gun-control proposals that House and Senate 
negotiators are considering as part of juvenile-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders believe agreement is near on provisions to bar  
minors from possessing assault weapons, ban certain large-scale 
ammunition clips and require ``reasonable'' mandatory background 
checks for purchases, including those at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of legislative gains led the largest gun-control  
organization, Handgun Control, to spend $340,000 on lobbying 
between January and June, compared with $60,000 during the same 
period in 1998, according to reports filed with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	It still did not keep pace with the NRA, the country's  
best-known advocate of gun owner's rights. The group reported that 
it poured $850,000 into its lobbying effort during the first six 
months of 1999, compared with $750,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity stems from congressional action on gun  
control that took center stage after the April shooting at 
Columbine High School outside Denver left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	By one vote, the Senate passed legislation that included  
mandatory background checks on all firearms buyers at gun shows and 
required dealers to provide safety devices with all handguns. A 
month later, the House deleted the gun measures from the 
juvenile-crime bill after some Republicans argued they were too 
strong and some Democrats asserted they were too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	That has left it to a House-Senate conference to resolve the  
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	For Handgun Control, there finally is a bill that gun-control  
advocates can use to pressure lawmakers, spokeswoman Naomi Paiss 
said. Contributions also rose, and helped finance more lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun control had been stymied for many years,'' Ms. Paiss said.  
``We finally got something on the floor that people understood was 
critically important to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals 
and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, acknowledging the important fight, hired two new  
outside lobbying firms to buttress the efforts of the group's 
staff, including one headed by Randall Scheunemann, a former top 
aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could have found 15 more people who were particularly  
effective, I would have hired them too,'' said James Baker, the 
NRA's chief lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the NRA urged its members to contact lawmakers  
involved in the gun-control talks as well as their own members of 
Congress. ``It is critical that you call ... to ensure that no 
anti-gun language is included in the final conference committee's 
'compromise' legislation,'' the NRA said in a fax message. 
</P>
<P>
	Handgun Control spent $100,000 on television ads last month in  
Washington, D.C., and 10 congressional districts. They including 
those represented by Reps. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn. and Anne Northup, 
R-Ky., which both went President Clinton in 1992 and 1996; 
conservative Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C.; and Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla., chairman of the House Judiciary crime subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Performers O'Donnell and Sarandon each narrated a commercial,  
which included scenes of shootings at Columbine and a Jewish 
community center in Los Angeles in August, as well as the 1998 
killings of five people in Jonesboro, Ark., shot as they left 
school during a fire alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough. No more excuses,'' O'Donnell and Sarandon  
said in separate ads. ``Call Congress and tell them to close the 
loopholes that give children and criminals easy access to 
firearms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA quickly answered with its own $50,000 ad campaign,  
citing a study that found the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms is sending fewer gun-related cases to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need tougher gun laws,'' the narrator says in a  
message that mirrors what NRA lobbyists carry to Capitol Hill. ``We 
need to get tougher on violent criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the prosecution is a very salient point,'' Baker  
said. ``It's one we're trying to put across in every venue 
possible.''

	Fire Destroys Kosovo TV Building  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In what was apparently Kosovo's  
worst case of arson since the NATO-led peacekeeping force arrived, 
a blaze gutted a store and spread to a nearby television building 
today, destroying the structure. Three NATO soldiers were slightly 
injured in the intentionally set fire in Pristina, Kosovo's 
provincial capital, NATO spokesmen said. NATO and U.N. firefighters 
combating the blaze said they believe people were in the television 
building when flames spread to it just after 2 a.m. today. But a 
NATO spokesman, Maj. Steven Noble, said the only people hurt were 
the three peacekeepers, who sustained cuts while breaking windows 
to escape.

	China Nuke Plant Resumes Operation  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese nuclear power plant has resumed  
operations and reached full power following an overhaul to correct 
problems that had caused damage to its fuel rods, the official 
newspaper China Daily reported today. The problems at the Qinshan 
nuclear plant, in Zhejiang province 50 miles south of Shanghai, 
were detected after operators shut the reactor down in July 1998. 
Chinese engineers found bits of nuts, bolts, and tubing at the 
bottom of the reactor vessel, as well as extensive damage to some 
instruments and supports, possibly caused by the broken nuts and 
bolts flying around in flows of coolant, according to a U.S. 
official who visited the plant.

	Hurricane Irene Moves Out to Sea  
</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene raced out to sea today,  
but not before dumping more than a half-foot of rain across eastern 
North Carolina and rekindling fears of residents displaced by 
Hurricane Floyd a month ago. North Carolina's third hurricane in 
two months churned through Florida during the weekend and up the 
southeast U.S. coast toward the Carolinas. Late yesterday, it 
turned northeast and away from land. With Irene's maximum sustained 
winds near 85 mph and accelerating movement out into the Atlantic, 
tropical storm warnings still in effect along the North Carolina 
coast could be removed later today.

	Move Into Timor Enclave Planned

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- International peacekeepers said today  
they plan to move into the last unsecured part of East Timor -- a 
small, isolated enclave where human rights abuses have been 
reported. The peacekeepers will be moving into the Oecussi enclave 
to provide security there, said Col. Mark Kelly, chief of staff of 
the Australian-led multinational force. But he did not say how soon 
the move would come. He implied that it might not happen until the 
peacekeeping force -- now 7,000 strong -- reaches its full complement 
of about 8,000 troops.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets opened the week broadly lower,

big drop on Wall Street on fears U.S. share prices could slide 
further. Across Asia, ``morning activities centered on selling 
across the board after New York's fall,'' said Toshihiko Matsuno, 
deputy manager of the investment advisory office at Yamatane

	U.S., Russia Review Nuclear Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials hope the lure of American  
assistance with radar technology will get Russia to agree to amend 
a landmark anti-nuclear treaty so that both nations can develop 
limited systems to defend against potential threats from Iran and 
North Korea. U.S. negotiators have proposed that the Americans help 
Russia finish a major radar installation near Irkutsk, Siberia, 
oriented across Russia's vast southeastern coast to keep watch on 
North Korea, among other nations. In exchange, Moscow would agree 
to alter the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty so that both 
countries could establish national missile defense systems.

Rangers a 4-1 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers last night.

scoring three goals in the third period to defeat the winless 
Buffalo Sabres 5-2 last night. Eric Lindros and Valeri Zelepukin 
scored 21 seconds apart in the third period before Eric Desjardins 
netted his first goal of the year to end Philadelphia's 
franchise-worst 0-5-1 start.

<HEADLINE> France Telecom-German Utilities Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- France Telecom SA is establishing a  
presence in the valuable German telecommunications market, 
announcing Monday it plans to buy a majority stake in the E-Plus 
mobile telephone network. 
</P>
<P>
	German utility groups Veba AG and RWE AG said they will sell  
their 60.25 percent stake in E-Plus to France Telecom for 
approximately $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With cross-border competition heating up in Europe's recently  
liberalized telecommunications market, France Telecom said it 
intends to use E-Plus to branch out into the German telephone and 
Internet market. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom's plan to form a global partnership with Deutsche  
Telekom was dealt a severe blow after the giant German 
communications company's unsuccessful attempt to take control of 
Telecom Italia in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were allied with Deutsche Telekom, we didn't need to  
expand into the German market, because (Deutsche Telekom) was 
already there,'' France Telecom's chief executive officer, Michel 
Bon, said in an interview to be published Tuesday in the French 
daily La Croix. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the partnership doesn't exist anymore, we need to  
branch out into each others' countries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	E-Plus is Germany's third-largest mobile telephone operator,  
holding a 16 percent market share with its 3.2 million customers. 
Sales in 1998 were nearly $1 billion. E-Plus, with 3,100 employees, 
will remain based in Duesseldorf, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former French telephone monopoly said it will finance the  
E-Plus purchase by selling its stake in U.S.-based Sprint Corp., 
worth around $9.4 billion, and its 2 percent stake in Deutsche 
Telekom, worth about $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakup of the French company's Global One joint venture with  
Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp. also has been expected since MCI 
Worldcom Inc.'s announcement earlier this month that it would 
acquire Sprint for $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom also holds 10 percent of Sprint and is studying  
what to do with its stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The E-Plus deal depends not only on regulatory approval but also  
on the consent of U.S. phone company BellSouth Corp. to waive its 
pre-emptive rights, according to France Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom said it hoped to reach a quick agreement with  
BellSouth, which holds 22.5 percent of E-Plus. BellSouth spokesman 
Jeff Battcher said the Atlanta-based company is still studying its 
options,. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Vodafone Airtouch PLC holds the remainder of E-plus  
and is seeking a buyer, E-Plus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the sale price, $4.1 billion will go to Veba and $3.9 billion  
to RWE, Veba said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Releases First Major TV Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Details from the first major television ad by Vice President Al  
Gore's presidential campaign, airing at a cost of about $440,000 
for three weeks in New Hampshire and Iowa, and in a limited 
national run on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Title: ``Bio.''  
</P>
<P>
	Time: 60 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Producer: Century Media Group.  
</P>
<P>
	Text: (Male announcer) ``He saw his father defeated for the  
Senate because of his support of civil rights and gun control. And 
he came home from Vietnam doubting politics could make a 
difference. He studied religion at Vanderbilt, started a family, 
and worked as a reporter exposing corruption. Al Gore was only 28, 
but he'd seen a lot about what could go wrong in America -- and he 
decided to fight back. He won a seat in Congress and became a 
national leader on the environment. Stood against the tide opposing 
the Reagan budget cuts in health, education and help for the poor. 
As vice president, he defied the gun lobby and cast the 
tie-breaking vote to keep guns away from criminals. His cause is 
working families, improved health care for every American, 
affordable prescription drugs, revolutionary improvements in 
education so our test scores will be the highest in the world. The 
young man who decided to fight for principle is still leading the 
way. Al Gore. Change that works for working families. 
</P>
<P>
	Key images: Black-and-white footage of a young, uniformed and  
anguished Al Gore at his father's knee; a snapshot of Gore, in the 
Army fatigues of his tour in Vietnam; Gore at a typewriter during 
his reporter days, followed by flashes of headlines from his 
stories on a Tennessee bribery scandal; a newspaper headline from 
Watergate fast-cuts into footage from the fatal shooting of four 
antiwar demonstrators by the National Guard at Kent State 
University, and then into a scene of police turning fire hoses on 
civil rights activists; Gore and his wife, Tipper, cuddling one of 
their newborn children; Congressman Gore talking with a worker on a 
factory floor; Vice President Gore thundering from a lectern on the 
South Lawn of the White House before the image dissolves into a 
shot of a handgun and the National Rifle Association logo; Gore 
crouching beside some anonymous children and their chalk drawings 
on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goal: To introduce the vice president as a family man who put  
aside his Vietnam-era disillusionment, entered politics as a 
selfless act, and ``is still leading the way.'' This last point, 
coupled with the mention of Gore's opposition to President Reagan's 
budget cuts, are meant to stand in criticism of Gore's Democratic 
primary rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, who supported the cuts as 
a way of controlling huge deficits and later left Washington after 
proclaiming the system ``broken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysis: Gore's campaign, not quite relocated to Nashville,  
Tenn., is trying to minimize his image as a politician-for-life, 
Washington insider. As such, the brief sketch of his resume omits 
his time in law school and casts his entry into politics as 
reluctant and selfless. At the same time, the campaign wants to 
show him as presidential. The South Lawn shot begins at the White 
House residence's Truman balcony before zooming in on Gore, and 
keeps in the frame just enough of the lectern's presidential seal 
as to make clear that Gore is already at home at the White House 
and has the stuff to be president.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Agree to IMF Loan Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will agree this week to new loan terms laid  
down by the International Monetary Fund, First Deputy Prime 
Minister Viktor Khristenko said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Central Bank Chairman Viktor  
Gerashchenko will sign a letter agreeing to four new loan 
conditions from the IMF, Khristenko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions on Russia's $4.5 billion loan program, which runs  
through the end of next year, were set by finance ministers of the 
Group of Seven leading industrial nations in the run-up to last 
month's annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The new terms included quarterly audits of the Central Bank's  
reserve operations, removal of part of the Central Bank's reserves 
from its five European subsidiary banks, a Central Bank promise to 
sell its European subsidiary banks and a schedule for the Central 
Bank and commercial banks to adopt internationally accepted 
accounting principles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerashchenko had previously said the new loan conditions would  
mean the bank would have to do a quarterly ``striptease'' before 
the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	A $640 million loan installment from the IMF has been held up  
since September, following allegations of money laundering in 
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Irish Booster Freed From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A former Notre Dame football booster who  
showered football players with gifts and sparked an NCAA 
investigation left prison Monday after serving her sentence for 
embezzling more than $1.4 million from a former employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Dunbar walked out a back door to the Atterbury  
Correctional Unit south of Indianapolis partially shielded by 
Department of Correction vans lined up to block journalists' access 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was seen embracing an unidentified woman and a man who had  
driven up behind the vans in a car and then sped off with her 
inside. The man was later identified by prison officials as Jarvis 
Edison, a former Notre Dame football player with whom Dunbar has a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	The university awaits word from the NCAA on whether Dunbar's  
relationship with up to a dozen players will result in the school's 
first major rules violation. The NCAA's Committee on Infractions 
heard arguments from Notre Dame in June, but its enforcement staff 
has not yet issued a ruling that was expected months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA official, who asked not to be identified, said the  
enforcement staff was looking at possible new rules violations 
reported by the school last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes allegations that a part-time tutor wrote a  
paper for a student-athlete, that a student-athlete allegedly 
misused complimentary tickets and that that same student-athlete 
received extra benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the committee would consider all of the  
allegations before deciding whether to penalize the football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar, who was sentenced to four years in prison, was released  
after serving just more than a year. She earned credits for good 
behavior and for earning an associate's degree from Indiana 
University. She will remain on probation until Sept. 28, 2014. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar pleaded guilty last year to embezzling money from  
Dominiack Mechanical Inc. between 1991 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	She has returned nearly $100,000 in cash and merchandise she  
purchased with the stolen money to Jerry Dominiack, who owns the 
heating and cooling business. She remains under orders to pay 
restitution to pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominiack, however, feels Dunbar got off too easily.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem fair,'' he told the South Bend Tribune. ``One  
and a half million for a year's worth of time; that's pretty good 
wages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dominiack still has a civil suit pending against several former  
Notre Dame players, including Edison, Ray Zellars, Kinnon Tatum and 
Lee Becton, to recoup some of the money Dunbar stole. Former Irish 
receiver Derrick Mayes paid less than $10,000 in August to settle 
his part of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil suit seeks $4.3 million from the remaining players and  
Dunbar's mother and sister.

<HEADLINE> Penney's Sells Credit-Card Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. Inc. will sell its  
credit-card receivables operation to GE Capital in a deal that will 
help cut the troubled retailer's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal announced Monday were not disclosed, but  
Penney said that it expected the proceeds to reduce its debt by 
about $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	GE Capital also entered into a 10-year agreement to provide  
private label credit card services to Penney. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was expected since May, when Penney announced it was  
looking to sell the credit-card business in an attempt to boost its 
bottom line and prepare for a stock offering of its Eckerd 
drugstore business. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered Monday's deal, sending Penney's stock up  
$1.18 3/4 to $31.18 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Penney's credit-card portfolio will become part of GE Card  
Services, which provides credit-card related financial services for 
retailers and consumers and has more than 70 million accounts. 
Stamford, Conn.-based GE Capital is a subsidiary of General 
Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Penney had credit-card sales of $7.8 billion and 35 million  
accounts in 1998. The company has 11 credit facilities, with 
approximately 2,800 employees, in 10 U.S. cities and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	GE Capital will evaluate the need for job cuts or the closing of  
any credit facilities after the deal is closed, which is expected 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides reducing its debt, Penney said it will use the money  
from the deal for its new Eckerd stock initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to create a tracking stock for Eckerd, which  
has been outperforming the rest of Penney's portfolio. The new 
stock will specifically reflect Eckerd's financial results and will 
not include Penney's other businesses, such as its moderately 
priced department stores.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Earnings Down 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. said today that, as expected,  
its third-quarter profit fell 11 percent as theresult of lower 
productivity from its reorganized sales force and pricing pressures 
from competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The office machine manufacturer also said the factors that  
depressed its results are expected to continue into the fourth 
quarter and the first half of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the just-ended quarter fell to $339 million, or  
47 cents per share, compared with earnings of $381 million, or 53 
cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, which the company had forecast Oct. 8, came on  
revenues of $4.63 billion, essentially unchanged from third-quarter 
revenues of $4.61 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the lowered expectations of Wall Street  
analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Xerox stock 
was off $3.75 at $23.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock had plunged 25 percent after the company  
warned that its earnings would be disappointing. Before that 
announcement, analysts expected Xerox to earn 58 cents a share for 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox said weakness in a joint venture with Fuji and the  
economic decline in Brazil also hurt its results. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results are totally unacceptable. Our shareholders have  
a right to expect better execution at a time when the competitive 
environment has intensified,'' president and chief executive 
officer Rick Thoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman said he is confident that the company's strategy to  
broaden its distribution channels and expand its product and 
services mix will eventually accelerate revenue and earnings 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales force reorganization, which continues to pressure  
earnings, will also eventually foster growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced earlier this year it was reorganizing its  
14,000-person sales force to boost sales of ``bundled'' services to 
corporate customers -- integrating fax machines, printers, copiers 
and personal computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it planned to move its sales force away from  
geographical coverage toward coverage of specific industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue growth slowed to 6 percent in the United States and 3

<HEADLINE> Steelers Slog to Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Finally, the Pittsburgh Steelers got their  
running game going, perhaps because Jerome Bettis is healthy for 
the first time all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, about that passing game ...  
</P>
<P>
	They slogged to a 17-3 victory Sunday over the Cincinnati  
Bengals -- the NFL's worst team during the 1990s -- that was far more 
educational to the Steelers (3-3) than it was entertaining to their 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, they learned they can run the ball productively  
and consistently without All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson, who 
missed his first significant playing time in years with a hamstring 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson, who left late in the first quarter, has started 170  
consecutive games, the second-longest streak in the NFL. He doesn't 
plan on missing Monday night's game against the Atlanta Falcons 
(1-5). 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's that serious,'' coach Bill Cowher said.  
``He wants to play Monday night -- badly. I don't think it will be 
anything long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, then Dawson's injury layoff will be much  
like the Steelers' passing game: short and not all that bothersome. 
</P>
<P>
	Kordell Stewart's numbers looked good -- 17-of-29 -- but he threw  
for only 134 yards against what was the NFL's 24th-worst pass 
defense. And, after going nearly all season without his receivers 
consistently getting open downfield, Stewart had open men but 
couldn't hit them. 
</P>
<P>
	He twice overthrew Hines Ward on potential touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
	The only difference from the previous three weeks: the Steelers  
won. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't pretty and it wasn't artistic, but we did find a way  
to get it done,'' Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	They got it done the way the Steelers have done it so many times  
before, with a physical running game and an equally physical 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerbacks Chad Scott and Dewayne Washington neutralized  
receivers Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott, with Pickens making four 
catches -- nine fewer than he had against the Steelers in Cincinnati 
last season -- and Scott having one catch for 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of pride in our defense,'' Washington said.  
``Last week, we didn't play our best ball in Buffalo, and we were 
determined not to let it happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Bengals rookie quarterback Akili Smith unable to throw  
deep, the Steelers ganged up on AFC rushing leader Corey Dillon, 
holding him to 78 yards. The Bengals' inability to sustain drives 
helped the Steelers do so behind Bettis, who gained 111 yards in 
his first 100-yard game since the regular season finale against 
Jacksonville in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that game, Bettis has had two arthroscopic knee surgeries  
and a calf injury, and Cowher said he didn't begin running like the 
Bettis of old until last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis rushed for more than 4,200 yards the last three seasons,  
but had only 256 yards -- and no 100-yard games -- in his first five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to speculation that, because of the injuries and the  
Steelers' decision to not re-sign his best friend and lead blocker, 
fullback Tim Lester, Bettis wasn't the back he was before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't run from my doubters,'' Bettis said. ``I'm not the  
sleekest guy, not the shiniest guy out there. But I run hard and I 
get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher said, ``Anybody who watched could tell it was his best  
week of practice. This is the best he's felt. It didn't surprise me 
he had the game he had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Steelers don't know is what kind of game they will get  
from the Falcons, who lost at home Sunday to St. Louis 41-13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers do have history on their side. They haven't lost to  
the Falcons in nearly 29 years -- a 27-16 defeat on Dec. 13, 1970. 
They have won eight straight over Atlanta, the last coming 20-17 on 
Oct. 27, 1996, and are 10-1 against the Falcons.

<HEADLINE> Russia Fears Renewed Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is warning that the world could be pushed  
into a new nuclear arms race because the United States wants to 
change a key agreement that has helped control nuclear weapons for 
the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. proposal has alarmed and outraged Russian political and  
military leaders, who claim that Washington wants to acquire 
nuclear invincibility at a time when Russia's nuclear forces are in 
shambles. Moscow may have to build new atomic weapons to counter 
what it sees as a major threat, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	If Washington persists with its proposal, Russian officials say,  
it could endanger the whole framework of nuclear agreements on 
limiting or scrapping nuclear weapons that took decades to 
construct. 
</P>
<P>
	``All agreements that have been signed or are being prepared,  
will come under threat -- namely, START I, START II and 
consultations on START III,'' said Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, 
commander of Russia's strategic rocket forces. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the Russian fears are a U.S. proposal to amend  
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty so that both countries could 
build missile defense systems to protect themselves against limited 
nuclear attacks. The bedrock treaty was key to starting arms 
control pacts during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	After denouncing Washington's ABM proposal when it was announced  
this summer, Moscow was furious after the U.S. Senate's Oct. 13 
rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The vote made the 
United States the first nuclear power to reject the 154-nation 
agreement on ending nuclear weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was ``disillusioned and seriously concerned'' by the  
vote, the Foreign Ministry said, calling the Senate's decision part 
of a trend that indicates the United States is trying to 
``destabilize the foundations of international relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says it wants to amend the ABM treaty so that both  
countries can defend themselves against nuclear attacks by rogue 
nations such as North Korea. It has tried to allay Moscow's fears 
by offering to help build a Russian defense system -- a proposal 
Moscow has yet to respond to. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow says the United States is exaggerating the threat from  
minor nuclear states. Instead, Russian officials fear, Washington 
wants to develop an ABM defense that could defeat a major missile 
attack. This would make Moscow's nuclear arsenal useless and leave 
Russia vulnerable because it does not have the resources to build a 
defense system of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian may be forced to abandon arm control pacts to ensure  
their nuclear forces remain effective, officials say. One option is 
rebuilding multi-warhead land-based ballistic missiles, which have 
been banned by arms control deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. approach might destabilize the international  
situation and call into question all existing arms treaties between 
the two countries,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a prominent military 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say the defense system they want to build would  
only be effective against a minor attack, and Russia, with its huge 
nuclear arsenal, has nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials say breaking the ABM treaty could mean the end  
of all nuclear control agreements, including the long-stalled START 
II nuclear arms reduction treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, would  
halve U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads 
each. But its passage has been blocked by Communists and 
nationalists in the Russian lower chamber of parliament, the Duma, 
who say the treaty would hurt Russia's security. 
</P>
<P>
	START II's passage would clear the way for START III, which  
would reduce both sides' nuclear arsenals to as few as 2,000 
warheads each. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will fully withdraw from all inspection agreements and will  
not let anyone close to our arms. Russia will not know what is 
going on in the United States. Americans will not know what is 
going on in Russia,'' warned Yakovlev, the rocket force chief.	   The Duma's refusal to pass START II reflects the deterioration 
in U.S.-Russian relations. The positive relations that followed the 
end of the Cold War have been overshadowed by growing 
disagreements, including Moscow's strong opposition to NATO's 
attacks on Yugoslavia, a Russian ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government believes it can persuade Russia that a  
limited change in the ABM treaty makes sense, but acknowledges the 
idea has created strong resentment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's unfortunate that many Russians hold this opinion  
about the United States ... (but) I think that we can rebuild the 
relationship to where it needs to be,'' U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said during a recent visit to Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today vetoed a $12.6 billion  
foreign aid bill as inadequate and called on Republican 
congressional leaders to join the administration in seeking a 
solution to the budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to sit down and do it together,'' the president told  
reporters in the Cabinet Room. He said he would sign another 
emergency spending measure to keep the government running beyond 
Thursday, but that it should be a short-term measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to put politics aside and seek common ground,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to make tough choices and we're going to  
have to make them together,'' Clinton said. ``Inaction is not an 
option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said Republicans were shortchanging spending needs  
on education, the environment and foreign policy affairs, including 
U.S. obligations under the Wye River Mideast peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton will refuse to  
sign other spending bills passed by Republicans, but instead would 
would invite congressional leaders to White House for a meeting 
this week ``to figure out a way to get out of the box created by 
appropriators to date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the congressional leadership will join me,'' the president  
said, ``we can make this a season of real progress for our 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign aid bill passed over loud opposition from Democrats  
and the White House, who claim it shortchanges important American 
foreign policy interests such as furthering the Mideast peace deal 
known as Wye River. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't meet the president's priorities,'' Lockhart said.  
``Wye River is certainly an important element to that, and it is an 
important part of continuing to exercise U.S. leadership around the 
world. We can't expect nations in troubled parts of the world, like 
the Middle East, to move forward with their peace process when we 
won't meet the commitments we've made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said a veto of the defense spending bill may be on the  
way. ``That is under consideration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill is beyond what the president requested, and there are  
also a number of gimmicks in it. They make operations and 
maintenance an emergency. The Pentagon is a pretty big building, 
but I don't know if you can go over there ... and find one person 
who considers the operations and maintenance of armed forces an 
emergency,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's foreign aid veto, the 28th of his presidency, will  
likely stand. The bill only narrowly cleared the House with a vote 
of 214-211, and the Senate with a vote of 51-49. A two-thirds vote 
in both houses is needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, in a statement prepared in  
anticipation of Clinton's veto, said that the extra money Clinton 
wants can only be obtained by raiding the Social Security trust 
fund. He called that ``wrong and irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will not use Social Security as a pot of gold to fund  
foreign aid,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, chairman of the House Foreign Operations  
subcommittee, said Republicans Congress have sent a consistent 
message that ``we will not raid Social Security, nor will we agree 
to raise taxes, to pay for increased foreign aid spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As passed by Congress, the aid bill provides $2 billion less  
than Clinton sought and none of the $500 million down payment he 
had sought to help Israel and the Palestinians carry out the peace 
accord negotiated last year at Wye River, Md. In all, Clinton has 
pledged $1.8 billion in U.S. support for the Mideast peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also provides significantly less money than Clinton  
requested for international debt relief, the Peace Corps and for 
efforts to reduce the nuclear threat from North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When the possibility of a veto was first voiced earlier in the  
month, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations panel on foreign operations, said it could shut off 
$735 million in aid to former Soviet Republics, $285 million in 
narcotics-fighting assistance and $180 million to combat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	However, foreign aid likely would continue to flow at current  
levels as part of stopgap spending legislation that covers agencies 
and departments for which there has been no appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also had complained that the legislation cuts  
many economic assistance programs, including those for poor 
countries in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	And it eliminated a $241 million State Department program to  
help find work for former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists in an 
attempt to make sure they do not sell their services to rogue 
states attempting to develop nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Friends, Family Recall Wilt's Humor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain,  
who the public knew for scoring 100 points in a single game, was 
remembered by friends and family more for his curiosity, intellect 
and quiet generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	Laughter punctuated the 1 1/2-hour memorial service Saturday at  
City of Angels Church of Religious Science, where about 800 people 
celebrated his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain died Tuesday of apparent heart failure. He was 63.  
His body was cremated. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Wilt's life, there were no sad songs. He lived his to the  
fullest,'' said Meadowlark Lemon, a Chamberlain teammate on the 
Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Others attending included Bill Russell, whose Boston Celtics  
teams twice beat Chamberlain's teams in the NBA finals; Alex 
Hannum, who coached Chamberlain and the Philadelphia 76ers to the 
NBA title in 1967; NBA greats Elgin Baylor, Connie Hawkins, Bob 
Lanier, Nate Thurmond, Bill Walton and Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, also a Hall of Fame center, recalled his intense  
showdowns with Chamberlain, who was 3 inches taller and 50 pounds 
heavier. Although Russell's Celtics had a 29-20 edge in 
regular-season games, Chamberlain averaged 25.7 points and 28 
rebounds to Russell's 14.9 points and 24.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sent me through hell so many nights, but it was not a  
rivalry, it was a competition,'' Russell said. '' 
</P>
<P>
	As we got older, the more we liked each other because we knew,  
basically, we were joined at the hips. ... I knew how good he was 
and he knew that I knew how good he was,'' Russell said, drawing 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just say that as far as I'm concerned, he and I will be  
friends through eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two photos graced the church's stage: the famous black and white  
shot of the 7-foot-1 Chamberlain holding a piece of paper with 
``100'' on it after he scored that many points in a game and a 
color photo of him smiling in his Los Angeles Lakers jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one speaker made a passing reference to Chamberlain's  
incredible statistics, including the 100-point game, the 55-rebound 
game (against Russell) and the five seasons averaging at least 40 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the memories focused on Chamberlain off the court,  
including his habit of phoning friends and family at 3 a.m. to quiz 
them about geography or history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want to be a basketball player, he wanted to be the  
man for all seasons, and I think he was,'' said Sy Goldberg, 
Chamberlain's attorney and friend of 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said Chamberlain's tough exterior hid a softer side.  
</P>
<P>
	``He would give money to almost anyone who needed it,'' Goldberg  
said. ``The important thing was you were to keep your mouth shut 
about it. No one could publicize his philanthropy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Shaw co-wrote Chamberlain's first autobiography, which  
Chamberlain insisted on titling: ``Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot 
Black Millionaire who Lives Next Door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw recalled being with Chamberlain and three others 20 years  
ago in a boat that pulled up 4 feet short of the dock on the San 
Francisco Bay. Chamberlain planted his left foot on the dock, his 
right foot in the boat and lifted his four companions like sacks of 
flour. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I remembered most was not the feat of strength, but the  
determination to overcome any obstacle, the determination to help 
his friends and his ability to laugh at the absurdity of any 
situation,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain, nicknamed ``Stilt'' and ``The Big Dipper'' during  
his career, loved to talk and friends often found themselves doing 
most of the listening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine he's up in heaven now right next to the other Big  
Dipper looking God straight in the eye -- somebody bigger than him 
finally -- making some outlandish statement or other,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the NBA, Chamberlain played volleyball and  
ran marathons. He wrote books, did some acting and honed his 
investment abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so busy doing, I'm not surprised he had a tired  
heart,'' said Barbara O. Lewis, one of Chamberlain's four sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled Chamberlain as a 5-year-old sneaking outside at 5  
a.m. in his native Philadelphia to help the men who delivered ice 
and milk. 
</P>
<P>
	When his mother asked what he was doing, Chamberlain replied,  
``I'm strong, Mom, and I'm smart. I'm going to make me a lot of 
money one day and I can't stay in the bed. I got things I got to 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Quake Uncovers New Active Fault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A magnitude-7.0 earthquake that rocked  
California and the Southwest has propelled the U.S. Geological 
Survey to focus its attention on a fault line it previously had 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly coined Lavic Lake fault, named for a dry lake bed near  
the Mojave Desert through which it broke ground, will now become 
one of the most studied in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of information about this quake, a ton,'' USGS  
geologist Ken Hudnut said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The temblor that struck at 2:46 a.m. Saturday near the remote  
desert town of Ludlow, caused minor injuries during a passenger 
train derailment. Light damage was reported elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake occurred along a 25-mile-long fault geologists had  
partly mapped, hadn't researched and hadn't yet named. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tasks were low priority because of the fault's location.  
Other faults, such as San Andreas, are constantly monitored because 
they are located near heavily populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't going to do a lot of research along a fault that  
would only bother a rattlesnake,'' said Lucy Jones, a USGS 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudnut said the more geologists can learn about the physics of  
earthquakes, the more they can do to advise planners to avoid 
building on active faults and keep buildings already on them safer 
during temblors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other things they learned: The deadly 1992 Landers earthquake  
that hit the area near Big Bear Lake had a large effect on the 
Lavic Lake fault and could have hastened Saturday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudnut, who flew over the area with two colleagues in a  
helicopter to inspect the fault, said they marveled at the giant 
fissure that moved a dry river bed 12 feet to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had wonderful surface rupture,'' he said. ``It was exciting  
for us. Most geologists study things that happened thousands of 
years ago. This is something that happened yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also was the first major event recorded on the TriNet  
quake data system, a network of 200 seismographic stations that 
measure quake intensity and other properties. The system and 
stations are linked by computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all this equipment in place,'' Jones said. ``We were  
looking for a model to test it. This was perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While geologists got down to business Sunday, the 50 residents  
of Ludlow near the quake's epicenter, had to fix mobile homes that 
slipped off foundations and broken glass and broken dishes that 
slowed service at the town's only diner. 
</P>
<P>
	The small town that heralded itself as ``famous for absolutely  
nothing'' is now known as the site of the strongest quake to hit 
California since Landers in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Pederson Has Winning Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Before Doug Pederson became a starting  
quarterback, he was an NFL third-stringer, a World League outcast, 
even a FedEx driver. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading the Philadelphia Eagles on their first two-game  
winning streak in three years, Pederson finally has a response for 
fans who wanted him stamped ``extremely urgent'' and shipped out of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole starting thing is new, or was new at the time,''  
said Pederson, who led the Eagles (2-4) to their second straight 
victory Sunday, 20-16 over the Chicago Bears. ``I think a part of 
me really didn't know how to handle that. And by not being able to 
handle it, the pressure built on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I've had to do the last two weeks: Back off, allow  
the guys around me to work and have fun doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a long time since football has been fun in  
Philadelphia. Even coach Andy Reid admitted Monday that the team's 
two victories after an 0-4 start ``weren't Picassos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, two games, two victories! Even for fans of this team,  
it's hard to argue with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``That brings the fun back into it,'' said Pederson, the target  
of incessant criticism by fans who want to see rookie Donovan 
McNabb get a chance to play. ``Now you can go out and just have fun 
and cut it loose on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson put up Brett Favre-like numbers in the first half  
Sunday, going 16-of-22 for 207 yards. Suddenly, Reid's decision to 
let Pederson play until McNabb is ready doesn't look like such a 
dumb idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that shows that Andy's not giving in to the fans,''  
Pederson said. ``He's not giving in to the media that's talking 
about Donovan. He's going about his long-term plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Reid, ``It surely can't hurt his confidence.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pederson is well acquainted with being benched, cut and  
generally regarded as inadequate. He was released seven times by 
the Miami Dolphins, saw most of his pro action in the World League 
and drove a FedEx truck in 1995 before signing with the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than overnight delivery, Pederson's greatest professional  
accomplishment before this season was helping Don Shula earn his 
NFL-record 325th coaching victory in 1993. With Dan Marino and 
Scott Mitchell both injured, Pederson rallied the Dolphins to a 
19-14 victory over the Eagles at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson recalls bobbling the snap on a failed extra point in  
the first half of that game, making it 14-13 Philadelphia at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, on the first play of the third quarter, Scott Mitchell  
goes down with a separated shoulder,'' Pederson said. ``And I'm 
thinking, `Oh, no, here we go.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Dellenbach, the center for the Dolphins and now Pederson's  
teammate in Philadelphia, recalled how nervous Pederson was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into the huddle all wide-eyed and delayed a little bit  
calling the play,'' Pederson said. ``And he said, `Call the play, 
call the play. We're OK.' That was really the first chance that I 
had to play extensively in a regular season game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson all but benched himself after his fourth straight poor  
performance in a 16-15 loss to the New York Giants on Oct. 3, 
saying a change of quarterbacks might help the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was down, especially after the Giants game,'' Pederson said.  
``I thought something was going to be done there. My confidence was 
kind of shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, Pederson's position coach in Green Bay, had a long talk  
with him the morning after that game and made the unpopular 
decision of sticking with him as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `Relax. You put too much pressure on yourself to  
do well,''' Pederson said. ``He said, `There's no sense to push 
anything. You know this offense, I've seen you execute this offense 
perfectly in regular season games as a backup in Green Bay. Get 
back to that. Get back to having fun.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Beset by Blown Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- So these are baseball's best umpires, huh?  
</P>
<P>
	Hard to believe it, especially after seeing yet another blown  
call go against the Boston Red Sox in a key spot of the AL 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than shouting ``Out!'' or ``Stee-rike!'' this is what  
umps are now sputtering too often: ``I blew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Reed admitted his error on a dropped throw in Game 1. It  
was Tim Tschida's turn on a missed tag in Game 4 Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make the right call,'' Tschida said. ``That's a  
frustrating thing for an umpire, because we like to call everything 
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when a third close play went against the Red Sox, fans at  
Fenway Park littered the field with debris, forcing the New York 
Yankees to flee for safety in their 9-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made mistakes that umpires make and they're man enough to  
admit it,'' said Marty Springstead, the AL's executive director of 
umpiring. ``They missed a couple calls. It doesn't mean that you're 
a bad umpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said commissioner Bud Selig on Monday: ``I think the umpires  
themselves have made the appropriate comments. I don't want to say 
anything other than we have some of our finest umpires involved in 
this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the timing could not have been worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Not after all the acrimony this year that resulted in 22 umpires  
losing their jobs. Not after veteran NL umpire Frank Pulli was 
chastised for using a television replay -- a big no-no in the majors 
-- to get a call correct. Not after baseball stressed it uses a 
merit system to pick the postseason crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``The postseason is a harsh historian and some of these are not  
easily forgotten,'' said Sandy Alderson, the majors' executive vice 
president of baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very good group of umpires,'' he said. ``Tim Tschida  
and Rick Reed are very highly rated. Their rotation doesn't come 
into play. These guys are quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, Tschida rated eighth and Reed ranked 14th among 32 AL  
umpires in an offseason survey done by players. But after problems 
in last year's ALCS -- a couple of missed calls, plus Jim McKean 
being hit by a catcher's throw on a steal attempt -- this has not 
looked pretty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's being taken away from us, but we don't know  
why,'' Boston outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees led the best-of-7 series by 3-1 going into Monday  
night's game. Umpires were booed, one-by-one, as they were 
introduced before Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The NLCS umpires, meanwhile, have mostly stayed out of trouble.  
They had trouble figuring out the final score in the New York Mets' 
4-3 win Sunday in 15 innings, but the wild ending against Atlanta 
left a lot of people wondering. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's contract with umpires says, ``League presidents shall  
have full discretion in the assignment of umpires to special 
events.'' Those are defined as postseason games and the All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two other factors in the selection process: Umpires  
cannot work the World Series in consecutive years, and they can do 
only one ``special event'' per season. There's one exception -- an 
umpire can work the first round of the playoffs and the World 
Series in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to that 1991 contract, umpires got to work those big games  
on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said baseball might try to get rid of all restrictions  
during negotiations this winter. He did not see a future for 
instant replay in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a consideration at this time,'' he said. ``It's being  
used in other sports, but we're more of a traditional sport and we 
move a little slower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the umpires' union office in Philadelphia was flooded  
with phone calls from angry fans, many of them Red Sox rooters. 
</P>
<P>
	A banner headline in the Boston Herald read: ``Robbed Again.''  
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino issued a statement apologizing for 
the ``inappropriate behavior'' by the Fenway fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went crazy after Boston manager Jimy Williams threw  
his hat and was ejected while arguing with first-base umpire Dale 
Scott in the bottom of the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottles came flying out of the stands, and umpires waved the  
Yankees off the field during an eight-minute delay. Yankees owner 
George Steinbrenner blamed Williams for the bedlam, charging, ``He 
incited it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never worried about Georgie Porgie,'' Williams responded  
Monday. ``I didn't incite it. The calls on the field incited it, 
not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston players were frustrated, too, but did not take it out on  
the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sure the umpires don't want to play a part in the  
outcome of the ballgame,'' third baseman John Valentin said. ``It's 
just too bad it turned out that way.''

<HEADLINE> American Home Increases Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising sales of its estrogen replacement and  
arthritis drugs helped American Home Products Corp. post a 2 
percent increase in third-quarter earnings. The results do not 
reflect $3.29 billion in charges mostly related to the company's 
proposed national diet drug settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home said Monday it earned $633.46 million, or 48 cent  
per share, compared to earnings of $618.99 million, or 46 cents a 
share, in the same quarter a year ago. Results beat analysts' 
forecasts by a penny, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 3 percent to $3.32 billion from $3.22 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Including $3.29 billion in previously disclosed charges related  
to the company's proposed settlement of fen-phen diet drug 
litigation and some other issues, American Home had a net loss of 
$2.87 billion in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, the fifth-largest U.S. drug maker, said the net  
loss amounted to $2.20 per share, and also included after-tax 
charges of $220 million for restructuring of the company's poor 
performing Cyanamid crop-protection business and buybacks of 
herbicide products. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.,-based American Home on Oct. 7 announced it had  
agreed to pay $4.83 billion over a period of up to 16 years as part 
of a national settlement of thousands of fen-phen liability 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, which must be approved by a federal  
judge in Philadelphia, the company would set up two funds to pay 
for medical checkups and injury claims for all patients who took 
its diet drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine), and chemical cousin Redux 
(dexfenfluramine) before the medicines were recalled in 1997 after 
being linked to heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, which markets the Premarin female hormone  
replacement drugs and rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, said its 
drug sales increased 10 percent in the third quarter to $2.58 
billion. Premarin is the mostly widely prescribed drug in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the company's consumer health division, including  
over-the-counter products such as the painkiller Advil and Centrum 
vitamins, rose 7 percent to $606.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's agricultural products sales dropped 57 percent to  
$130.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special charges, profits for the first nine months of  
1999 decreased 3 percent to $1.74 billion, or $1.33 per share, from 
$1.79 billion, or $1.34 per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Including charges, the company had a nine-month net loss of  
$1.82 billion, or $1.39 per share, compared to profits of $2.12 
billion, or $1.59 per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were flat at $10.08 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dell Issues Earnings Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. warned Monday that a  
higher-than-expected jump in the price of computer memory chips 
will likely affect its third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dell, which were down $1.50 to $41.31 1/4 in trading  
Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell to $37.37 1/2 in after-hours 
trading after the news was released. 
</P>
<P>
	An earthquake in Taiwan last month disrupted production at  
factories that produce between 12 percent and 15 percent of the 
world's random access memory, or RAM, chips. 
</P>
<P>
	RAM is important to a computer because it stores information  
that a processor might need at another point, allowing a user and 
the computer to more rapidly switch back and forth between tasks 
for everything from screensavers to spreadsheets to games. 
</P>
<P>
	During its fall analyst meeting held on Oct. 7, Dell said the  
``supply situation'' of memory chips was progressing well. Since 
then, however, Dell said prices had increased more sharply than 
expected, to as much as 25 percent higher than the previous price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are managing the memory situation carefully and are working  
to offset the cost increases with efficiencies in other parts of 
our business,'' said Thomas J. Meredith, Dell's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected  
Dell to earn 20 cents a share in the third quarter. Dell will 
report its results on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith said the company considers the effects of the  
memory-cost issue to be a short-term matter and should not affect 
the longer-term outlook for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In its second-quarter earnings report, Dell, the largest seller  
of computers directly to customers, earned $507 million, or 19 
cents per share. The results beat expectations by 2 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> USS NJ Begins Final Canal Crossing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIRAFLORES LOCK, The Panama Canal (AP) -- The battleship USS New  
Jersey -- the Navy's most decorated ship -- began its 10th and final 
crossing through the Panama Canal on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decommissioned New Jersey is bound for its namesake state,  
where it will become a floating museum -- either at Bayonne or 
Camden. The site hasn't been determined yet. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was on hand as the ship  
made its final journey through the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship was first launched at the Pennsylvania Navy Shipyards  
in 1942 and made its first crossing through the canal at the height 
of World War II, heading into the Pacific Ocean to join U.S. forces 
in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the ship accumulated stars, pennants and awards  
through three major wars. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 veterans who served on the ship were on board when the  
New Jersey cast off under sunny skies early Monday from Balboa, the 
Pacific port a few miles away from Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman stayed on board until the ship reached Miraflores, one  
of the canal's three locks. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey, which no longer has engines, was being towed by  
powerful tugboats. The ship is so big and wide that any false move 
could cause her to scrape the canal's sides. Traveling through the 
canal was expected to take four days, instead of the usual 10 to 12 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship's last voyage from Bremerton, Wash., where it was  
decommissioned, to New Jersey will cover some 5,800 miles.

<HEADLINE> Quarterback Injury Blitz Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dan Marino, the NFL's best old quarterback, had to leave on  
Miami's second series in New England with a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the NFL's best young quarterbacks -- Arizona's Jake  
Plummer, Detroit's Charlie Batch and Jacksonville's Mark Brunell -- 
were lost with injuries of varying severity. 
</P>
<P>
	And Brett Favre, the NFL's best 30-year-old quarterback, has  
been playing all season with a painful thumb injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the carnage ever end?  
</P>
<P>
	A third of the way into the season, 14 of the 31 quarterbacks  
who were supposed to be their team's starters have missed time with 
injuries. They range from a possible career-ending concussion 
(Steve Young) and a season-ending Achilles' injury (Vinny 
Testaverde) to Batch's bruised right arm, which might not cost him 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Favre.  
</P>
<P>
	In a 31-10 loss to Denver which, without John Elway, knows all  
about quarterback problems, Favre was just 7-for-23 for 120 yards 
with three interceptions, his worst day as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't blame the thumb injury that he ignored through three  
game-winning drives, but it sure looked like it hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to play like this,'' said Favre, the  
three-time league MVP. ``I didn't expect to lose like this. Games 
like this happen. It was ugly. This is a character check. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thumb has been bothering me all year, but it is not an  
excuse. I don't want it to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's casualties were of varying degrees.  
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, having a bad year in part because of various nagging  
injuries, broke a finger on his throwing hand and will be gone a 
while. Marino has a bruised shoulder and will undergo an MRI today 
-- who knows what that will find? 
</P>
<P>
	Batch seems less serious, a bruised upper arm.  
</P>
<P>
	And Brunell has bruised ribs and should be back when  
Jacksonville plays again in two weeks. In fact, when he left on 
Sunday, the Jaguars trailed the Browns 7-6. His backup, journeyman 
Jay Fiedler, went 11-of-13 and Jacksonville won 21-7 and left the 
field to cries of ``Fiedler! Fiedler! Fiedler!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only backup hero.  
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard, who replaced Marino, threw an interception for a  
touchdown on his first pass but rallied the Dolphins to a 31-30 
victory with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Stanley Pritchett with 23 
seconds left. The same thing happened on Oct. 10, 1993, when Marino 
tore an Achilles', Scott Mitchell threw an interception for a TD on 
his first pass as his replacement, then rallied the Dolphins to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kurt Warner has thrown 15 TD passes in five games as the  
replacement for Trent Green, who was supposed to be the starter in 
St. Louis but tore up a knee in the third exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the emergence of new stars (and Mitchell has since submerged  
again) isn't much consolation for the quarterbacks who are hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Or for the game.  
</P>
<P>
	One last thing.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Parcells, still looking for a quarterback to replace  
Testaverde with the Jets, benched Rick Mirer Sunday and started his 
unconventional favorite, Ray Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final play of the game, Lucas sprained an ankle trying to  
throw a desperation and had to be carted off. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it ever end?

<HEADLINE> Crime Down for 7th Straight Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Murder and robbery rates dropped to the lowest  
levels in three decades in 1998 as serious reported crimes declined 
for the seventh straight year, but officials and experts warn 
against complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies  
and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest level 
since 556 in 1985, just before an epidemic of crack cocaine emerged 
to send it soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also showed the use of guns in homicides and  
robberies is decreasing, and one of the most terrifying crimes that 
rose with the crack epidemic -- murder by a stranger -- dropped below 
half of all slayings for only the second time during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and others warned against complacency,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good news for America's families, and it shows we can  
indeed turn the tide on crime,'' Clinton said in a statement. But, 
he added, ``even as crime falls, we must not let down our guard. 
That is why we must redouble our efforts to build on what works 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said that as a Florida prosecutor,  
she saw constituents lose interest in crime issues after rates fell 
for several years. ``If we continue our efforts, we can have a 
substantial impact on violence and make it permanent,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno attributed gains so far to ``more police officers on the  
street, greater partnerships between law enforcement agencies, 
continued efforts to keep guns away from criminals and a balanced 
approach that includes prevention, intervention, punishment and 
supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also expressed surprise at the decline in crime among those  
in the 15-24 age group. ``The number of young people is increasing 
in America, and we thought that there would be a higher crime rate 
some time ago because of that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are watching the crime rate go down, although the  
adolescent population has increased,'' she said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans credited their legislation encouraging longer prison  
sentences for the drop in crimes. Criminologists also cited the 
aging of baby boomers past crime-prone years and the decline of 
crack markets. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, the violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and  
aggravated assault and the far more numerous property crimes -- 
burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft -- all dropped in number and 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The violent crime rate was down 7.3 percent, led by an 11.3  
percent drop for robbery and a 7.4 decline for murder. The 
aggravated assault rate was down 5.7 percent to the lowest level in 
a decade. The rape rate declined 4.2 percent to the lowest in 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The property crime rate fell 6.2 percent -- down 9.3 percent for  
auto theft, 6.2 percent for burglary and 5.7 percent for 
larceny-theft. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder rate of 6.3 per 100,000 residents was the lowest in  
31 years. As in 1997, it was the lowest since 6.2 in 1967. The 
robbery rate of 165.2 was the lowest in 29 years, since 148.4 in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Firearms were used in 64.9 percent of murders, down from 67.8  
percent in 1997, with the drop accounting for the overall murder 
decline. The percentage of robberies with guns dipped from 39.7 to 
38.2. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie-Mellon University in  
Pittsburgh credited big-city police departments with stepping up 
searches for guns, tracing guns to illegal sellers and even paying 
bounties to turn in guns -- as well as background checks to prevent 
sales to felons. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminologists said the national figures obscure a lingering  
problem: Although teen-age killings have been cut in half since 
their 1993 peak, they remain nearly twice as high as in 1984 -- 
before crack gangs began arming some youths, and their schoolmates 
got guns to copy them or for protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crack epidemic has subsided, but we haven't taken all the  
guns out of the hands of youths,'' said James Alan Fox, professor 
of criminal justice at Boston's Northeastern University. ``Youth 
crime is down but not out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Police have adopted smarter strategies, focusing on guns and  
high-risk juveniles, taking a preventive approach rather than 
waiting in squad cars for 911 to ring,'' Fox continued. 
``Communities are involved as never before; corporations have made 
jobs available; clergy have taken their ministry to the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we spend too much time celebrating and let our guard  
down, the problem could resurface with a vengeance, because every 
year for the next couple decades we're going to have a record 
number of black and Latino teen-agers, and they live in the most 
at-risk situations,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, rural areas, the last places reached by the crack  
gangs, finally joined in the decline in crime volumes and rates 
that cities have seen for several years. Crime dropped in every 
region: 7 percent in the Northeast and West, 5 percent in the South 
and 4 percent in the Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Ford Appeals Web Site Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is going back to court to force a  
Mustang enthusiast to stop putting confidential company information 
on his Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	But the enthusiast, Robert Lane, has fired back with a $15  
million counterclaim against Ford, claiming the company tampered 
with his site and illegally tried to silence him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford lost an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds  
in September. The automaker wanted to ban Lane, a 32-year-old 
Dearborn nursing student, from using, copying or disclosing company 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane testified he has 112 Ford documents received from anonymous  
sources, including blueprints and production schedules. He had 
posted some of them on his Internet site, www.BlueOvalNews.com, and 
wrote stories about others over the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford sued Lane in August, claiming he violated laws against  
disclosing trade secrets when he posted the documents on his 
Internet site. A different judge ordered Lane to remove the 
documents and any material copyrighted by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edmunds said that while Ford had a strong case, blocking  
Lane from putting the documents on the Internet would be an illegal 
prior restraint of speech. The judge did order Lane to preserve any 
Ford documents he might have, to not violate Ford copyrights and to 
not solicit information from Ford employees. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the ruling, Ford said it was pleased with  
Edmunds' ruling. But earlier this month, Ford filed a notice to 
appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Ford 
spokesman Jim Cain said the company believes Lane is still 
publishing copyrighted material and trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the September ruling, Lane has posted several articles on  
Ford's future engine plans, including specifications for a new line 
of diesel truck engines. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Mark Pickrell, the Nashville attorney handling Lane's case,  
said he was surprised by Ford's decision to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything else Ford requested, Ford won,'' Pickrell said.  
``The one part of the preliminary injunction they lost they're 
appealing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickrell said Lane filed his counterclaim against Ford earlier  
this month. The lawyer said Ford's lawsuit against Lane amounts to 
a SLAPP -- strategic lawsuit against public participation -- action, 
and Lane is entitled to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	No court dates have been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Stock Market Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's stock market rebounded  
Monday, responding to the new military ruler's promise to try to 
restore investor confidence in the beleaguered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who seized power last week by  
overthrowing Nawaz Sharif's unpopular government, pledged in a 
speech Sunday to act against tax evaders and bank loan defaulters 
and to adopt consistent economic policies to revive the country's 
battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped by 21.21  
points, or 1.87 percent, to 1,150.38 points in Monday's opening 
session. By the end of the trading day, the stock index was up five 
points, closing at 1,134.20. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has opened on a firm note,'' Karachi Stock Exchange  
chairman Yaseen Lakhani said of Monday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Tariq Mahmood, an analyst at UBS Securities, said the  
index rose on institutional buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't last for long. The market will move in a narrow band  
until the country's economic fundamentals improve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's industrialists and businessmen have defaulted on the  
repayments of bank loans totaling roughly $5 billion. Only 1.1 
million people out of the country's 140 million pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Majyd Aziz, the chairman of Karachi's leading SITE Association  
of Industry, said corrupt politicians systematically destroyed 
Pakistan's economy. The previous government only paid lip-service 
to these causes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan was at the brink of defaulting on repayments of foreign  
debt worth $32 billion after world powers imposed sanctions to 
punish it for conducting underground nuclear explosions in May 
1998. But the United States eased sanctions, paving the way for a 
bailout package worth $1.6 billion from the International Monetary 
Fund and a rescheduling of $7.7 billion of foreign debt from 
lending countries and commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IMF delayed a $280 million installment from its bailout  
package in May because Sharif's government failed to carry out 
speedy economic reforms. To add to the uncertainty, the IMF warned 
Pakistan it may lose its aid if democracy is not restored.

<HEADLINE> 'Fight Club' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Fight Club'' took the weekend box-office  
title from ``Double Jeopardy'' as the film about men beating one 
another senseless debuted with an $11 million purse, according to 
industry figures Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio estimates Sunday had put ``Double Jeopardy'' on top of  
the box office, with ``The Story of Us'' a close second and ``Fight 
Club'' just behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Final numbers for the weekend had ``Double Jeopardy'' in second  
place with $10.2 million and ``Story of Us'' in third with $9.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Fight Club,'' Brad Pitt and Edward Norton organize a band  
of frustrated men who find ritual satisfaction in bare-knuckle 
brawls. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox, estimated Sunday the  
film took in $10.3 million over the weekend, $700,000 below its 
actual take. ``Fight Club'' did better business Sunday than the 
studio expected, said Tom Sherak, head of distribution for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Reiner's ``Story of Us,'' which debuted Friday, is a  
romantic comedy with Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis as a couple 
on the brink of divorce. ``Double Jeopardy'' stars Ashley Judd and 
Tommy Lee Jones in a thriller about a woman seeking revenge against 
her double-crossing husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramount had estimated ``Double Jeopardy's'' weekend gross at  
$10.5 million, about $300,000 above Monday's actual figures. 
Universal estimated ``Story of Us'' at $10.4 million, about 
$700,000 more than it actually took in. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios covet the No. 1 spot at the box-office so they can  
promote a film as the top-grossing movie. Paramount and Universal 
said Monday they did not inflate their estimates to grab first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our best guess for Sunday's business,'' said Nikki  
Rocco, head of distribution for Universal. ``I don't overestimate 
my numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Friedman, vice chairman for Paramount Motion Picture Group,  
said the studio's estimate was off only slightly. ``Double 
Jeopardy'' had been the top-grossing movie the previous three 
weekends, but Paramount did not jockey numbers to claim the top 
spot again, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had said it was a three-way tie it would be fine by  
us,'' Friedman said.

<HEADLINE> 'El Duque' Is Mr. Cool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fenway's fans didn't scare El Duque and neither  
did the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	When you've fled Cuba -- by raft or yacht, it doesn't matter --  
nothing intimidates you. 
</P>
<P>
	On a night many degrees removed from his island homeland in  
temperature and locale, Hernandez wrapped up the New York Yankees' 
record 36th American League pennant in his typical Mr. Cool 
fashion. He pitched them past the Red Sox 6-1 Monday night to win 
the AL Championship Series 4-1 and earn the Most Valuable Player 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought this beautiful moment would happen to me,''  
Hernandez said through a translator. ``I would like to thank my 
teammates for all their support the last two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 1/2 years after making his major league debut, he's 4-0  
in postseason play with a 0.97 ERA, nearly halfway to Whitey Ford's 
Yankees record of 10 postseason wins. And he has an MVP trophy, 
matching the ones his half-brother, Livan, got with Florida during 
the 1997 NLCS and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Think that's impressive?  
</P>
<P>
	Toying with major league hitters as if they were kids on  
sandlots, he's allowed four earned runs in 37 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really likes his pressure situations,'' Yankees catcher  
Jorge Posada said. ``It's a lot of fun to see a guy so intense, so 
aggressive. He wants the ball, he wants to be the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing seems to rattle Hernandez.  
</P>
<P>
	Not the taunts of Red Sox fans or the threat of debris flying on  
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Not falling behind 3-0 in the count. He's just setting up the  
batter -- with more windups than most teams have pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not questions about his age -- is he 30 or 34? He answers only to  
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Not the debate over whether he left Cuba on a raft or in a  
luxury boat. His answers are as hard to figure as his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	On a staff that struggled for consistency at times, he became  
the anchor, never going more than three starts without a win after 
mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the concern about Roger Clemens' legs, Andy Pettitte's  
mind, David Cone's arm and Hideki Irabu's gut, Hernandez was the 
constant: Just give him the ball and let him pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said, ``like 100 years  
ago when I saw him in spring training of '98 and watched him throw 
on the side -- Wow! that big leg kick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were shivering at Fenway Park as Boston completed its  
81st consecutive season without a World Series title. If El Duque 
was cold, it was hard to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed just five hits in seven-plus innings -- just one from  
the second through the seventh -- and struck out nine, making 138 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox had first and third with no outs in their first time  
up, and he got out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out, everything was up in the zone,'' he said. ``I  
was falling to the first base side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made an adjustment, but the Red Sox put runners on first and  
second with two outs in the second before Hernandez got out of it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	They got a runner to third with one out in the sixth, still  
trailing by just 2-0, and he escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Varitek's leadoff homer in the eighth was the only run he  
allowed. By then, New York had built a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``His fastball was jumping out of his hand,'' Posada said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year Hernandez was the savior, starting against Cleveland  
with the Yankees' season suddenly starting to slip away and beating 
the Indians to even the ALCS 2-all. 
</P>
<P>
	``To watch him grow -- ever since then, he dared people to beat  
him,'' Torre said. ``Tonight was just another example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After last year, pitching with the Yankees ahead 3-1 must have  
seemed easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since that day,'' Posada said, ``he has stepped up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Last year was guts, this was glory.

<HEADLINE> Ga. County Worried by Documentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Renee Hansen hopes to keep an open mind when  
she sits down tonight with her 15-year-old daughter to watch a 
controversial television documentary detailing the sex lives of 
local teens. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 45-year-old, who stays at home with her children, says  
it will be hard with what she's heard about the latest edition of 
the PBS series ``Frontline,'' entitled ``The Lost Children of 
Rockdale County.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm upset that they chose here to do it,'' said Mrs. Hansen,  
who had not seen the program as of Monday. ``I understand that the 
point is that it could happen anywhere, but it could have been 
Conyers, California and not here. This does not represent Conyers 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airing tonight, the documentary centers on a 1996 syphilis  
outbreak that infected 17 Rockdale County teen-agers and forced 250 
others to get medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary features interviews with teens who claim they've  
had as many as 100 sexual partners or joined in group sex parties. 
Some report becoming sexually active as young as age 12. 
</P>
<P>
	While most Rockdale residents have yet to see the documentary,  
reports of its contents have upset local leaders and parents. The 
county is one of the wealthiest in the Atlanta area. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is happy about it, even if we know that we're being  
used as an example of what's going on everywhere. No one likes to 
be slammed in front of the whole country,'' said Bill Hughey, 
director of the Rockdale Coalition, a nonprofit youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the focus of the show, just to have our dirty  
laundry aired is going to turn some people off from coming here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the program, three teen-age girls use stuffed animals to  
depict how classmates participate in multiple-partner sex. Other 
teens recount group sex parties at upper middle-class homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak Goodman, who co-produced the program with his wife, Rachel  
Dretzin Goodman, said it is not intended to make Rockdale County 
seem aberrant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show that this behavior is really just flags or  
indicators that something much more profound is afflicting our kids 
everywhere,'' Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time that something negative has put  
Conyers in the national spotlight. A school shooting in at Heritage 
High School in May wounded six students; T.J. Solomon, the 
classmate accused of the school assault, is awaiting trial on adult 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Foster, another stay-at-home mom, had a daughter in her  
senior year at Rockdale County High School when the syphilis 
outbreak occurred, and has another 18-year old daughter currently 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to watch the show as well, if not with her daughter.  
But she doesn't understand why the show focuses solely on Rockdale 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	``These problems exist all over the metro Atlanta area, not just  
here,'' Mrs. Foster said. ``There's a lot of positive things going 
on around here, but that's not what the country will see, and that 
is upsetting.''

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Arrives for Pro Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- For different reasons, a trip to West  
Virginia is a fresh start for Tonya Harding and her godmother and 
inseparable friend, Linda Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding makes her pro skating debut tonight in Huntington, more  
than five years since her last competition. She was banished from 
the amateur ranks for her role in the 1994 attack on rival skater 
Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a new beginning for me,'' Harding said. ``I'm  
seeing all my friends for the first time in years. It's such a good 
feeling to me to be able to see them all again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Lewis, whom Harding refers to as ``mom,'' the trip from  
Vancouver, Wash., gives her the chance to close a difficult chapter 
in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Harding started skating at an early age and became  
estranged from her own mother, Lewis grew up in a show business 
family and did not see her father for 25 years after he moved away. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' father, a Huntington resident, died last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I never got to come here to see him,'' Lewis said. ``I'm  
hoping to be able to visit his grave while I'm here. 
</P>
<P>
	``So this is a really unusual experience with me. Of all the  
strange things to be here. Of all the places that we thought for 
her first comeback. It's kind of putting closure to her past and 
putting closure to my past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the years, Lewis has been a mentor, defender and  
collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
	She served as voice coach during Harding's public singing debut  
at a 1995 muscular dystrophy fundraiser in Portland, Ore. When the 
crowd booed and threw plastic bottles at Harding, Lewis jumped 
onstage to admonish them. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Harding and Lewis stopped at a suburban Portland  
bar to play video poker. Inside, an 81-year-old woman collapsed and 
stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis began administering CPR while Harding called 911, then  
took over for Lewis. The woman was revived and released from a 
hospital the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1997, after Harding contended she was abducted at  
knifepoint by a stranger, Lewis offered a $1,500 reward for 
information leading to an arrest and conviction. No one was ever 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the pair shared a pizza and soft drinks at 1:30 a.m.  
in a Huntington hotel room at the end of a 20-hour day that 
included stops in Chicago and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	During her afternoon skate, Harding stopped her routine every  
few seconds to talk to Lewis at rinkside. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know how to do this,'' Lewis said after Harding fell twice  
during warmup jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, beautiful triple toe loop!'' Lewis said, responding to a  
solid jump. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Harding's first competition since the 1994  
Lillehammer Olympics has her feeling like the new kid at practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very nervous. It's the first time stepping out in front of  
everybody, and I'm just like, `Oh gosh!''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She will compete against four other women in the Pro Skating  
Championships. The technical program will be tonight and the 
artistic program Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Other competitors include Surya Bonaly, Elizabeth Manley, Tonia  
Kwiatkowski and Rory Burghart, the latter a replacement for Pasha 
Grischuk, who was injured in practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will feature competition for men, dance and pairs.  
</P>
<P>
	The show is not expected to be a sellout at the 5,780-seat  
Huntington Civic Arena. It will be broadcast on ESPN on Oct. 25, 
Nov. 1 and Nov. 8.

<HEADLINE> Group Calls Low-Carb Diet Unhealthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Pork rinds, beef jerky and hot dogs sound more  
like the diet of a junk-food junkie than that of someone determined 
to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	But this latest fad diet promises you can shed the pounds fast  
while eating all the meat, cheese, eggs and fat you want. The trick 
is to lay off the carbohydrates and sugars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Glasgow, a 39-year-old computer support technician from  
Cumming, said he went from 425 to 330 pounds in 11 months, while 
continuing his lifestyle as a ``big-eater.'' A typical breakfast 
for him while on the diet consists of a three-egg omelet and a 
12-ounce package of bacon or a half-pound of ham. 
</P>
<P>
	Many dietitians and health experts -- 10,000 of whom will be in  
Atlanta this week for the American Dietetic Association's annual 
meeting -- insist the diet is unhealthy and the weight loss is 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-protien, no-carb plan is ``a nightmare of a diet,''  
said Kathleen Zelman, a registered dietitian and ADA spokesperson. 
``At first, it sounds so alluring. You get the green light to eat 
these foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the monotony soon gets old. Sure, you get the  
hamburger, but no bun or fries. You can eat a big steak, but forget 
the baked potato and tossed salad. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, it's just unhealthy, nutritionists say. Along with the  
risk of increasing cholesterol levels, the diet could cause kidney 
problems or possibly a loss of calcium in the bones, Ms. Zelman 
said. Limiting the intake of carbohydrates to such a dramatically 
low level starves the body of needed nutrients and causes an 
artificial metabolic state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of it on a global perspective -- the world at large  
survives on grains,'' Ms. Zelman said. ``If we didn't have 
carbohydrates, we would not be able to survive. Bread is the staff 
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Glasgow said the diet allows him to lose weight and continue  
to be a ``big eater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of some of the opponents, but for me right now, it  
seems to be working,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow said he lost 100 pounds once before on a low-fat, high  
exercise diet, but he couldn't stay on it. While on that diet, he 
said he took a two-month leave of absence from his job and 
exercised between 6 and 8 hours a day. When he returned to a more 
reasonable exercise schedule, the weight stopped coming off and he 
went back to his old ways. 
</P>
<P>
	With studies showing that more than half of all adults are  
overweight and that exercise is at an all-time low, Americans are 
constantly searching for a way to slim down without drastically 
changing their lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	The increasing number of unhealthy and overweight adults and  
children is one issue of particular concern for the ADA at its 
four-day meeting that starts today. Like other health 
organizations, the ADA maintains the only way to lose weight is 
through a healthy, well-balanced diet and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to weight loss, the ADA will hold discussions this  
week on issues such as food safety, children's health and reducing 
the risks of heart disease and colon cancer through diet. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-carb diet was first touted by Dr. Robert Atkins more  
than 20 years ago. Its popularity in the '90s has been attributed 
to his latest book ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,'' currently 
the best-selling mass market paperback in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the reason for the resurgence is that Americans are  
getting fatter and there's a greater desperation than there's ever 
been,'' Ms. Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins has dismissed criticism of the diet as ``dietitian talk''  
and points out that many people have maintained their weight loss 
for years and lowered their cholesterol by following his diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow and others who've lost weight following the Atkins plan  
will probably gain it back, Ms. Zelman says. The initial weight 
loss occurs because without carbohydrates, the body is forced to 
burn fat and protein for fuel -- but that creates fatigue. Also, the 
monotony of the diet gets some people to eat less. 
</P>
<P>
	Sooner or later, the dieter will have to go back to at least  
moderate carbohydrate consumption. When they do, the weight will 
likely return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly don't want to bust anyone's bubble who's having  
success because it's so hard to come by,'' Ms. Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice for anyone who considers going on the diet is to  
consult their doctor, drink plenty of fluids and take a 
multivitamin, mineral supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realize it's a short-term fix,'' she said. ``Ultimately, you  
will have to face reality of weight management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow has not had his cholesterol levels checked since  
starting the diet, but said he isn't too worried about it. He said 
the diet ``seems to work best for big-eaters'' and he will 
eventually add more carbs back into his meals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't plan on eating just meat the rest of my life,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Ford Earns $1.11 Billion in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Ford Motor Co. said today that a  
healthy U.S. economy and strong sales of trucks boosted its third 
quarter earnings to $1.11 billion, up 11 percent over last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker earned 90 cents a share for the  
three months ending in September, compared with $1 billion, or 80 
cents a share, for the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $38 billion, up 16 percent from $32.6 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of 85 cents  
a share, according to a survey of 13 analysts by First Call/Thomson 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's earnings were cut $125 million by a one-time profit  
reduction related to higher costs for retiree healthcare and life 
insurance at Ford's parts division, Visteon Automotive Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 14th straight quarter of improved earnings and a  
record for the third quarter for Ford, which has enjoyed a 
record-setting year for car and truck sales. The company also 
reached a contract agreement with the United Auto Workers earlier 
this month without a costly work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continued our strong earnings momentum, despite very  
competitive markets worldwide, by building our brands, leveraging 
the synergies offered by our global scale and maintaining a 
rigorous cost discipline,'' said Ford president and CEO Jac Nasser. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Ford earned $5.4 billion, or  
$4.39 a share, up from $4.9 billion in the first nine months of 
1998, excluding a gain of $16 billion from the sale of Associates 
First Capital, a finance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its automotive cash climbed to $25.7 billion,  
up from $22.9 billion a year ago. Minus outstanding debt, the 
company had $12.9 billion, down from $13.1 billion last year. Ford 
said spending on acquisitions was offset by a strong cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings in Ford's automotive operations totaled $690 million, a  
gain of 7 percent over $646 million last year. Revenue from auto 
operations was up 18 percent, from $26.5 billion to $31.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits in North America and cost-cutting offset Ford losses in  
Europe and South America. The company said it had cut costs $300 
million in the quarter, and had squeezed out $700 million in cost 
cuts so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, Ford earned $1 billion, up 12 percent from the  
third quarter of 1998. Ford said a firm job market and low 
borrowing costs contributed to strong sales; through September, 
Ford's U.S. light vehicle sales were up 5 percent, excluding Jaguar 
and Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, the company lost $171 million, compared with a loss  
of $273 million last year. Ford said lower sales of its Mondeo and 
Fiesta cars were partially offset by cost cuts, improvements in 
Jaguar sales and the addition of Volvo AB, which Ford bought last 
year. Ford said it did not expect to improve its earnings in Europe 
over last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses increased in South America to $72 million, from $44  
million last year. A weak economy in Brazil and work stoppages 
there hurt earnings, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's other divisions reported higher profits. Visteon earned  
$155 million, including the adjustment for retiree benefits, a gain 
of $7 million, or 5 percent, over a year ago. Ford is considering a 
spin-off or sale of Visteon, and said the division had won $1.7 
billion in new contracts so far this year, and that 36 percent was 
from customers other than Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Credit earned $317 million, up 16 percent or $45 million  
from a year ago. The company said higher costs due to employee 
separation programs were offset by more financing. Ford's Hertz 
rental-car unit earned a record $139 million, up 17 percent from 
$119 a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Reno Plot Has No Merit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An immigration appeals court has found no  
merit to secret evidence that has kept a Palestinian man jailed for 
19 months on suspicion that he plotted to kill Attorney General 
Janet Reno, the man's lawyers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen remained in custody, however, pending a  
ruling on a request by the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
to keep him behind bars while it decides whether to ask Reno to 
review the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line here is that every judge in the immigration  
service who has looked at this evidence has found that it does not 
support the charges that he is a threat to national security,'' 
said one of the lawyers, David Cole. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-0 decision Friday by a panel of the U.S. Board of  
Immigration Appeals granted Kiareldeen permanent resident status, 
Cole said. The INS has asked for a stay of that ruling until Oct. 
29 so it can consider whether to petition Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling upheld a decision in April by an immigration judge  
who saw the secret evidence, said it was not convincing and ordered 
Kiareldeen released on $1,500 bail. The INS obtained a stay from 
the appeals board and he stayed in federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left after business hours Monday for INS spokesmen were  
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the INS and five immigration judges have seen the evidence,  
compiled by the FBI. The use of secret evidence is permitted in 
immigration proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen, 31, was arrested by the INS in March 1998 and  
accused of overstaying his student visa, the only charge against 
him. He has maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Summaries of secret FBI evidence given to the judge said  
Kiareldeen plotted to kill Reno because of her role in prosecuting 
the terrorists responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, 
that he was a suspected member of an unnamed terrorist organization 
and that he made a threat against Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen lawyers blamed the allegations on a ``disgruntled''  
ex-wife, who testified against Kiareldeen last year, but refused to 
say whether she was an FBI source.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Malone Is Staying in Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone isn't letting a sore lower  
back disrupt his workout schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Manley, agent for the Utah Jazz forward said Monday that  
Malone, suffering from a lower back strain, has been doing 
exercises that don't involve his back. He said Malone is down to 
249 pounds -- seven fewer than his listed playing weight -- and eager 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Manley said the injury has made all-star forward and the  
Jazz cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a $3 million Ferrari in the garage along with a  
$10,000 Dodge, you're going to be more careful if you have a 
problem with the Ferrari,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, 36, signed a four-year, $67 million contract two months  
ago. He suffered a lower back strain during a drill on Oct. 6, the 
second day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Malone once popped a dislocated finger back into place  
and returned to play during an exhibition game in Albuquerque, the 
back strain has fueled speculation that it's worse than reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley denied it.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about pain,'' Manley said. ``It's a physical  
ailment. They're just being extremely cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz said Malone's back will prevent him from playing in  
this week's exhibition games, starting Monday night at the Delta 
Center against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone wasn't expected to travel for games against the Boston  
Celtics Wednesday in Nashville, Tenn., Friday in Indiana and 
Saturday night in Lexington, Ky., against the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	He also missed two exhibition games last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Manley said Malone is optimistic about playing in the last two  
preseason games, Oct. 25 against visiting Indiana and Oct. 28 in 
Anaheim, Calif., against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said he's confident Malone will be ready  
to play when the Los Angeles Lakers visit in the regular-season 
opener Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait and see,'' Sloan said. ``I doubt if anyone will  
mention when the regular season starts the number of exhibition 
games he missed. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley denied that Malone is skipping the preseason.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's training harder than ever, but he has a swollen disc in  
his back,'' the agent. ``It's something if you aggravate when its 
inflamed, you can make it worse.''

<HEADLINE> Court Overturns W. Va. Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today overturned the murder  
conviction of a West Virginia minister accused of killing his wife 
in 1996, shortly after taking out a $100,000 insurance policy on 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a unanimous and unsigned decision, threw out the  
Rev. James Flippo's conviction because evidence used at his 1997 
trial might have been obtained unlawfully by police. His case now 
will head back to the West Virginia Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Flippo had been sentenced to life in prison without parole for  
the 1996 bludgeoning death of his wife, Cheryl, at a Babcock State 
Park cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Flippo was trying to cash in on the life  
insurance policy he had taken out on his wife about a month before 
her death. Flippo told police an unidentified man who had been 
stalking them for several weeks broke into the cabin and knocked 
him unconscious before killing his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	After sealing off the cabin as a crime scene, police opened a  
briefcase that had been on a table inside. In the briefcase, they 
found photographs introduced as evidence at Flippo's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographs, according to court records, included several of  
a man who appears to be taking off his pants. The man was 
identified as a member of Flippo's Church of God congregation in 
Nitro, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the photographs were evidence of a homosexual  
relationship between Flippo and that man, and that Mrs. Flippo's 
displeasure with the relationship may have been one of the reasons 
Flippo decided to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Flippo had sought to suppress the photographs as evidence,  
contending that police unlawfully opened the briefcase without 
first obtaining a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	A state trial judge allowed the photographs to be used as  
evidence after ruling that they were discovered during a lawful 
search of a ``homicide crime scene.'' After Flippo's conviction, 
the West Virginia Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	But in today's ruling, the justices said warrantless searches of  
homocide crime scenes were banned by a 1978 decision of the 
nation's highest court. ``A warrantless search by the police is 
invalid unless it falls within one of the narrow and 
well-delineated exceptions ... none of which the trial court 
invoked here,'' the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It simply found that after the homicide crime scene was  
secured for investigation, a search of anything and everything 
found within the crime scene area was within the law,'' the court 
said. That conflicts with their 1978 ruling, the justices added. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors, in opposing Flippo's Supreme Court appeal,  
argued that because Flippo had summoned police to the cabin in a 
911 call he had given his consent to search the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We express no opinion on whether the search here might be  
justified as consensual,'' the justices said, leaving that matter 
--and other possible reasons to allow the photographs as evidence -- 
to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether today's ruling would have any immediate  
effect on efforts by one of Flippo's son, James II, to cash in his 
mother's life insurance policy. American States Life Insurance has 
sued Rev. Flippo, claiming he had his wife obtain the policy with 
the intent of killing her and collecting the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on today is Flippo vs. West Virginia, 98-8770.

<HEADLINE> Umpires' Union Lawyers To Sit Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- While umpires keep blowing calls on the field,  
their lawyers keep maneuvering in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the umpires' union, dissident umpires and owners  
will meet Wednesday with the National Labor Relations Board on the 
petition to get rid of Richie Phillips and form a new union. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissident umpires filed a petition with the NLRB last week,  
demanding an election to decertify the current union and form a new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Silverman, the NLRB's New York regional director,  
originally scheduled a hearing for Oct. 22 before staff lawyer 
Stephen Appell. But Silverman said Monday the hearing wouldn't take 
place until Oct. 29 at the earliest, and perhaps not until Nov. 3 
or 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting is to clarify the issues, to see whether or not  
the parties agree there should be an election and, if so, who 
should vote,'' Silverman said by telephone from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, 30 percent of eligible union members are  
needed to file a petition to decertify their union of form a new 
one. The dissidents, led by AL umps Joe Brinkman, John Hirschbeck 
and Dave Phillips -- who is not related to the union leader -- said 
they filed signatures of more than 30 percent of the 93 major 
league umps. 
</P>
<P>
	If an election is held, it would be decided by majority vote.  
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents, angry with the failed strategy of mass  
resignations that cost 22 umps their jobs last month, want to 
replace Phillips, the union head since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The current union has filed a grievance in an attempt to regain  
the jobs of the 22, but no date has been set for the start of that 
hearing, which will be before arbitrator Alan Symonette. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have been criticized in the past week for blown calls  
during the AL Championship Series, most of them in favor of the New 
York Yankees.

<TEXT>
<P>
	RAY BROOK, N.Y. (AP) -- John A. ``Junior'' Gotti arrived by  
taxicab at a federal prison Monday to begin serving nearly 6 1/2 years 
for bribery, extortion, gambling and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, the 35-year-old son of convicted Mafia boss John J.  
Gotti, showed up alone at the Correctional Institution at Ray 
Brook, near Lake Placid in upstate New York, said Associate Warden 
Dave Chapman. Gotti apparently flew to a nearby airport, then took 
a cab in the cold rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, who prosecutors say succeeded his imprisoned father,  
``Dapper Don'' John J. Gotti, as boss of the Gambino crime family, 
was sentenced last month to 77 months in prison after pleading 
guilty on the eve of trial. Many of the charges stemmed from a 
scheme to take control of a New York topless club. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti could be freed by Sept. 8, 2004, subtracting time already  
spent in jail and if he serves his time with good behavior, prison 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be permitted visits from his family -- except his father,  
who is imprisoned for life at another federal prison in Marion, 
Ill.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Train Again in Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A presidential panel recommended Monday that  
the Navy be allowed to resume practice bombing on the Puerto Rican 
island of Vieques -- over the objections of the local population and 
the Puerto Rican government -- but that it prepare to abandon the 
island within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation drew immediate protest in Puerto Rico, where  
sentiment against the Navy has been growing since a civilian 
security guard was killed in a bombing accident in April. 
Protesters have been camping out on the bombing range since then, 
but the Navy is eager to resume using it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the political sensitivity of the controversy, Hillary  
Rodham Clinton called for a permanent end to using Vieques as a 
bombing range. The first lady, who is courting Hispanic political 
support in her exploratory campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New 
York, urged the Navy to find an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be an immediate and permanent end to the  
bombing,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a written statement. ``Use of live 
fire on the island has put the people of Vieques at risk, degraded 
the environment and hampered economic development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's political  
committee, said her position on Vieques was not politically 
motivated. ``This decision is made on the merits,'' Wolfson said, 
adding that New York Sens. Charles Schumer and Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan shared the first lady's views on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, who was traveling in the Middle  
East, issued a written statement calling the panel's report 
balanced. But he also asked the panel members to hold additional 
talks with the Puerto Ricans and the Navy before he makes a final 
recommendation to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear from the panel's report there are serious concerns  
among the residents of Vieques which need and deserve the careful 
attention of the Navy and the Department of Defense,'' Cohen wrote. 
Without suggesting any particular solution, Cohen said he believed 
more discussions would be productive. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in Newark, N.J., for a Democratic  
fund-raising event, said he hadn't had a chance to review the 
report, but he endorsed Cohen's plan to seek further discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	He lamented that island leaders ``feel estranged'' from the  
military now. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the best of all worlds we would not only reach a good  
result, but reach a good result in a positive way,'' Clinton said. 
``We would have a process which would restore a sense of trust and 
partnership between Puerto Rico and the Pentagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Cohen acts, the Navy apparently will continue its  
moratorium on live-fire training on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Vieques, activists reacted swiftly to news of the panel's  
recommendation, which includes steps to immediately reduce the 
amount of training on Vieques and improve safety for the island's 
9,300 residents. The report also recommended the return of some 
Navy land on Vieques to Puerto Rico, including an ammunition 
storage area and 110 acres to be used for a runway extension at the 
Vieques commercial airport. The Navy owns about two-thirds of the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a way to give the Navy time to find allies,''  
said Carlos Ventura, president of the Fishermen's Association of 
Southern Vieques, which has set up a protest camp on the bombing 
range at the eastern tip of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it is unacceptable that the Navy start exercises  
again,'' Ventura said. ``We are going to stay there and continue 
our civil disobedience. They will have to arrest us, and when that 
happens there will be many more people who will come out and join 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Ricans raise a host of environmental, health and other  
objections to the practice bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sila Calderon, San Juan mayor and front-runner in the 2000  
gubernatorial race, said, ``The Puerto Rican people have to remain 
unequivocally firm that we do not want military exercises to begin 
again in Vieques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Live-firing training, including air-to-ground bombing, naval  
gunfire and artillery, ceased after the April 19 fatality. Military 
leaders say the halt to training is chipping away at the combat 
readiness of naval forces who deploy from the East Coast, including 
aircraft carrier battle groups and Marine units. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future of Vieques Island as a training facility must  
transcend the emotion of the April 19th tragedy,'' Adm. Jay 
Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said in a written statement 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said he was pleased the  
presidential panel agreed with the Navy's view that there is no 
viable short-term alternative to Vieques as a combined arms 
training facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge the people of Puerto Rico -- some 6,000 of whose  
residents serve in the Navy and Marine Corps -- to accept this 
judgment,'' Danzig said. He said he accepts the panel's 
recommendation that the Navy place a higher priority on improving 
its relationship with the Puerto Rican people. To that end, Danzig 
said he was authorizing the assignment of a two-star admiral to 
Puerto Rico with the specific task of building a better 
relationship with Puerto Rico and with Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the seriousness of the dispute is a behind-the-scenes  
concern in the Pentagon that if the Puerto Ricans succeed in 
ousting the Navy from Vieques, they will indirectly energize 
similar efforts by activists opposed to the military's training 
presence elsewhere in America and around the world.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Ohio Judge Selection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge  
to how Ohio's eight largest counties elect judges, turning away 
arguments that the at-large elections illegally dilute black 
voters' political influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lower courts upheld the at-large elections.  
</P>
<P>
	Twelve black Ohio voters, including five current or former state  
legislators, sued the state in 1995, alleging that electing 20 
trial and appellate judges from the state's eight most populous 
counties in jurisdiction-wide voting hurts black voting power. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks would be more successful in electing candidates of their  
choice if the voting were conducted on a district-by-district 
basis, the lawsuit contended. All 12 challengers are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawsuit said failure to provide district-by-district  
elections violated the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, which 
bars election systems that dilute minority voters' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Smith, who conducted a 1997 trial,  
ruled that the challengers ``failed to prove that African-Americans 
were denied an equal opportunity to elect judges of their choice.'' 
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his ruling last April. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the challengers' lawyers argued,  
among other things, that the lower courts wrongly ignored Ohio's 
past discrimination against black voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal noted that blacks comprise 10.6 percent of Ohio's  
population but that only 4.6 percent of elected state judges are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said at-large voting has had a ``chilling effect ...  
to discourage participation by minority candidates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Mallory vs. Ohio, 99-261.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Rises 96.57 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Monday, careening through a  
volatile session marked by continued concern about rising interest 
rates and inflation. Technology stocks fell sharply, bearing the 
brunt of investors' pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 96.57 to close at  
10,116.28. Most of the gain occurred in the final 30 minutes of 
trading. Earlier in the session, the Dow was up as much as 108 
points and down as much as 43 points from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 6.72 to  
1,254.13, and the Nasdaq composite fell 42.68 to 2,689.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that after driving the blue chips down last week,  
investors were ready to focus their worries on the Nasdaq's 
technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nasdaq is where the average investor is,'' said Barry Hyman,  
senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. 
``Most people today have Intel, Microsoft, Dell in their 
portfolios, and their losses are piling up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel fell 1 1/2 to 69 3/8, Microsoft slipped 3/16 to 87 7/8 and Dell  
fell 1 1/2 to 41 5/16. The Nasdaq's highflying Internet stocks posted 
mixed results, with eBay off 4 5/8 at 129 1/2 and Yahoo! up 3/4 at 170 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the Nasdaq was ready for a fall after outperforming  
the Dow in recent weeks. At the close of trading Monday, the Nasdaq 
was still up 22.6 percent so far this year, while the Dow was up 
just 10.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq is off 7.7 percent from the record close it reached  
just last week, while the Dow is 10.7 percent below its Aug. 25 
record close. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts had expected investors to seek out buying  
opportunities following the Dow's loss of 630.05 points, or 5.9 
percent, last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the factors that drove stocks lower last week  
haven't been resolved. Investors are waiting for the latest 
indications of whether rising inflation is giving the Federal 
Reserve another reason to raise interest rates for the third time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Consumer Price Index will provide the next gauge  
of inflation pressures. Any signs that price pressures are 
escalating are expected to send stocks lower again. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan was the Dow's biggest gainer Monday, rising 6 1/2 to  
113 after saying its third-quarter profits nearly tripled. The 
brokerage earned $2.22 per share, beating analysts' estimates by 7 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup rose 1 3/16 to 43 11/16 after reporting a 229 percent  
jump in profits for the third quarter. The nation's largest 
financial company earned $2.4 billion, or 70 cents a share, beating 
Wall Street's forecast by 2 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe continued strength in corporate earnings could  
be the catalyst that snaps the market's recent decline. The 
companies that comprise the S&AMP;P 500 are expected to post average 
profit growth of at least 19 percent from last year's third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But corporate earnings could be threatened if interest rates  
continue to rise. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, 
making it more costly to finance growth. That's particularly true 
for technology stocks, which trade at very high prices on the 
promise of strong earnings in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox became the latest company to disappoint investors with its  
earnings report. Shares fell 3 5/8 to 23 13/16 after the company said 
its third-quarter profit fell 11 percent from the same period of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $339 million, or 47 cents per share, matching  
analysts' predictions that had been lowered earlier this month, 
after Xerox first indicated its profits would fall short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	An optimistic forecast from Abby Joseph Cohen, chief market  
strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., helped the Dow rally. A longtime 
bull, Cohen told clients Monday that the market's recent 
skittishness is unwarranted, especially in light of potentially 
strong profit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But rising bond yields added to the pressure on stocks, as bonds  
now offer their highest returns since October 1997. Late Monday, 
the 30-year Treasury bond offered a yield of 6.32 percent, high 
enough to attract some investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, twice as many stocks fell 
as those that gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Composite volume totaled 986.29 million shares, down from 1.08  
billion on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies dropped 5.80 to  
408.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower, feeding on last week's  
troubles on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.9 
percent. Germany's DAX index fell 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.6 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> College Football Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The 300 Club is a week away from welcoming another member --  
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Penn State coach Joe Paterno joined the exclusive  
group of coaches with 300 career victories. On Saturday, Bowden 
gets his first chance to be mentioned in the same breath as Bear 
Bryant, Pop Warner, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike any other coach in the history of college football,  
Bowden will have to beat his son Tommy's team -- Clemson -- on 
Saturday. It's the first father vs. son coaching matchup in major 
college football. 
</P>
<P>
	If Poppa Bowden wins, he says ``it will be a dream; it'll be a  
nightmare if we don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Father knows his son will be cooking up a few surprises for No.  
1 Florida State (7-0, 3-0 ACC). Clemson (3-3, 3-1) is coming off a 
42-30 win over Maryland, a game in which quarterback Woodrow 
Danzler totaled 435 yards -- 252 passing, 183 running. 
</P>
<P>
	``We better be sharp next week or we'll get whipped,'' Bobby  
Bowden said following his team's less-than-impressive 30-10 win 
over Wake Forest on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss would not only delay No. 300, it would severely damage  
Florida State's run at a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone knows who we're playing,'' Danzler said after  
his second start since replacing the injured Brandon Streeter. ``We 
just have to go out and prepare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup might seem one-sided, but Tommy's Tigers have a  
chance. Clemson has the ability to score -- 26.3 points per game -- 
and averages 395 yards. The question is whether the Tigers' porous 
defense -- 23.8 points and 355 yards per game -- and can slow Florida 
State's offense, fourth in the nation in scoring at 40.1 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Warrick, the Seminoles' star receiver, remains suspended  
because of his legal problems. Ron Dugans, now the team's top 
receiver, left Saturday's game with a bruised sternum and may not 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden said it would be a dream if the Seminoles win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a nightmare if we don't,'' he said. Then, referring  
to his wife, Ann, he said: ``We got to go up there and play Ann's 
boy, not mine, but Ann's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several other games with national title implications are set for  
next Saturday: No. 2 Penn State at No. 16 Purdue; No. 3 Nebraska at 
No. 18 Texas; and No. 5 Tennessee at No. 10 Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	In results of other Top 25 games Saturday, it was: No. 2 Penn  
State 23, No. 18 Ohio State 10: No. 4 Virginia Tech 62, Syracuse 0; 
No. 6 Florida 32, Auburn 14; No. 7 Kansas State 40, Utah State 0; 
No. 8 Georgia Tech 38, Duke 31; and No. 10 Alabama 30, No. 25 
Mississippi 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it was: No. 16 Purdue 52, No. 11 Michigan State 28; No. 13  
Texas A&AMP;M 34, Kansas 17; No. 14 Georgia 27, Vanderbilt 17; No. 17 
Wisconsin 59, Indiana 0; No. 19 BYU 31, New Mexico 7; and No. 21 
Southern Mississippi 24, Army 0.

</P>
<P>
                *No. 16 Purdue 52, No. 11 Michigan State 28    	
</P>
<P>
	At West Lafayette, Ind., the Spartans (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten) saw  
their title dreams shattered by Drew Brees, who threw for 509 yards 
and five first-half TDs and added a scoring run in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Daniels, the league's leading pass catcher, set Big Ten  
records with 21 receptions for 301 yards for the Boilermakers (5-2, 
2-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very humbling game,'' said Michigan State coach Nick  
Saban, whose team ended Ohio State's perfect season bid last 
season. ``We got slammed. I wasn't pleased with the way we played 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In I-AA, Appalachian State (4-2) upset top-ranked Georgia  
Southern (5-2) 17-16; and Richmond surprised Hofstra, ranked No. 3, 
31-21.

</P>
<P>
	At Blacksburg, Va., the Hokies (6-0, 2-0 Big East) improved to  
their best start since 1967 and showed they are a national title 
contender in handing the Orangemen (5-2, 2-1) their worst loss in 
77 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The dominating win -- Syracuse had 120 total yards -- led coach  
Frank Beamer to boast, ``We have the ability right now to get you 
in every way. I don't think we have a weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He might be right. Michael Vick threw for 135 yards and one TD,  
Shyrone Stith ran for 140 yards and two TDs, and the defense scored 
twice on a fumble and interception returns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest shutout loss by a ranked team in the  
63-year-old history of the AP poll. The previous largest was No. 1 
Army's 61-0 win over No. 6 Penn State in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 17 Wisconsin 59, Indiana 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Madison, Wis., Ron Dayne ran for 167 of the Badgers'  
school-record 705 total yards, and the running back became just the 
fourth player in Division I to record four 1,000-yard rushing 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin (5-2, 3-1 Big Ten) led 38-0 by halftime, and Dayne sat  
out the second half.

	At Alliance, Ohio, Mount Union now owns the longest winning  
streak in college football history at 48 games after Saturday's 
44-20 win over Otterbein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purple Raiders, shooting for a fourth consecutive Division  
III national title, broke Oklahoma's 47-game streak set 42 years 
ago under coach Bud Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games, that's what you like to play for,'' quarterback  
Gary Smeck said after throwing for 282 yards and three TDs. ``But 
I'm glad it's over. Now we'll get back in our routine. No more 
press conferences on Tuesdays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A record crowd of 7,132 showed up at the 5,000-seat Mount Union  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	At State College, Pa., Eric McCoo ran for a career-best 211  
yards and Penn State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) held Ohio State (4-3, 1-2) 
to 143 total yards and sacked Steve Bellisari eight times in an 
easy 23-10 win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions gave Joe Paterno career win No. 314, tying him  
for third place with Stagg for most victories among major college 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	At Oxford, Miss., Shaun Alexander ran for 214 yards and three  
TDs as Alabama (5-1, 4-0 SEC) held off Mississippi (5-2, 2-2) 
30-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Jabari Holloway recovered Jarious Jackson's fumble in the  
end zone with 2:40 left to cap a 22-point comeback in Notre Dame's 
25-24 win over USC. ... As a light snow fell, Steve Smith caught 
two TD passes and returned a punt 61 yards for another score in 
Utah's 21-15 upset of Air Force. ... Brian Allen scored on 37- and 
20-yard runs in the fourth quarter as Stanford (4-2, 4-0 Pac-10) 
edged Oregon State (3-3-3, 0-3) 21-17. Stanford is 4-0 in the 
league for the first time since 1970. ... Ryan Kealy threw for 194 
yards and two TDs as Arizona State (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) topped 
Washington (3-3, 2-1) 28-7. ... Arizona (5-2) won, too, as Ortege 
Jenkins threw for one TD and ran for another and Trung Canidate ran 
for 202 yards in a 34-21 victory over UTEP. ... Arkansas beat South

<HEADLINE> Court Eyes Prisoner Release Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether federal judges who send ex-convicts back to prison for 
violating conditions of their supervised release always can add a 
new supervised-release term to the time behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will use a Tennessee case to decide  
whether new terms of supervised release unlawfully subject some 
ex-convicts to retroactive punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornell Johnson was convicted in Tennessee on federal  
counterfeiting charges in early 1994 and sentenced to two years and 
one month in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of 
supervised release. 
</P>
<P>
	His supervisory release was revoked in 1998 after he admitted to  
having committed several crimes in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge sentenced Johnson to 18 months in prison,  
followed by a year of supervised release. Johnson challenged the 
new supervised-release portion of his sentence, saying the judge 
had no authority to impose it. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1994 -- after Johnson's original conviction and sentence  
but before he violated the terms of his supervised release -- 
Congress enacted a law that clearly gives federal judges the 
authority to tack on new terms of supervised release to defendants 
re-imprisoned after violating terms of their original supervised 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether that law can be applied to those defendants  
who, like Johnson, committed their crimes before the law was 
enacted. Federal appeals courts have split on that issue, but the 
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Johnson's case that 
applying the law to him did not violate his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers had urged the nation's highest court  
to reject Johnson's appeal. They said the case ``is of limited 
prospective significance'' because the only people affected are 
those who committed crimes between late 1987 and late 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Johnson vs. U.S., 99-5153.

<HEADLINE> Tower Climber Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A woman was sentenced Monday to serve 10 days in  
jail for climbing an electrical tower, where she spouted flames and 
danced topless to the amazement of drivers on nearby Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Ara Tripp climbed the 180-foot tower on the morning of Sept. 8  
as a stunt to protest discrimination against women and laws that 
allow men to take their shirts off but not women. Tripp was a man 
before undergoing a sex-change operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Atop the tower, she took off her shirt and began dancing,  
occasionally taking swigs from a vodka bottle, spitting out the 
liquor and setting it aflame. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic on a nearby interstate bridge over the Lake Washington  
Ship Canal slowed to a near-standstill during the hour or so Tripp 
remained on the tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp, 38, pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment and  
second-degree criminal trespass at a hearing in Seattle Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	She must also perform 100 hours of community service under an  
agreement with the City Attorney's office, said spokeswoman Ruth 
LaRocque.

<HEADLINE> A Perspective on the Marketplace / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When crises pile day by day and the mood of  
investors turns sour, it may be good for your health and smart for 
your pocketbook to get some perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is some:  
</P>
<P>
	--Since the bull market in stocks, which some say began in 1982,  
sharp market reversals -- or corrections -- have been happening 
faster and with greater downward force than in the previous two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the corrections have lasted much shorter -- one month to  
three months -- than in the earlier period. And post-correction 
recoveries have remained substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, while the market has been more apt to take a dive, it  
has been decidedly less inclined to remain submerged; instead, it 
soon pops to the surface and resumes its climb. 
</P>
<P>
	--Economic expansions have become longer, and recessions shorter,  
since World War II. Stated differently, the U.S. economy has become 
less cyclical, less perilous, more manageable. 
</P>
<P>
	We have both assertions on good authority. First, the stock  
market: 
</P>
<P>
	The securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette found the norm  
for Dow Jones industrial average corrections was nine months for 
the entire period 1960-1999, but only three months during 
1983-1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In partial explanation, a report in its Portfolio Manager's  
Weekly suggests companies in today's techno-service economy are 
able to stabilize earnings by adapting more quickly to changes in 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	It also expresses faith that the combination of excess capacity,  
mergers and the Internet will keep inflation low and price-earnings 
ratioshigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist David Wyss of Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI presents the case  
for a more manageable economy -- one less prone to the wrenching 
old-fashioned cycles of expansion and recession. 
</P>
<P>
	His contention, which becomes graphically clear on charts he has  
assembled back to 1857, is that the U.S. economy has become 
inherently less cyclical. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the current expansion, he says, the average length of  
a postwar U.S. expansion has been 49.9 months. Before World War II, 
the average expansion lasted only 26.3 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more impressive, he says, has been the short duration of  
recessions. ``The economy has gotten even better at getting out of 
recessions than falling into them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In support of this assertion, Wyss found that before the Great  
Depression of the 1930s, the average recession lasted 20.5 months, 
but that since World War II the longest has been just 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	He offers two probable explanations.  
</P>
<P>
	First, the economy has become less dependent on cyclical  
industries such as manufacturing, construction and mining that 
typically go through their own up-down cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, the Federal Reserve has become more competent at  
managing the business cycle. He contends it has been responsibly 
vigilant in restraining growth from exceeding the economy's 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Okay, he concedes, ``we have also had a lot of luck in this  
expansion,'' especially in being the only major economy enjoying 
strong growth. This, he says, has meant less pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	He expresses confidence that the combination of a techno-service  
economy, a wise Fed and a little bit of luck will support us in the 
future as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that today's expansion may not simply break the old  
record,'' he says, ``but smash it as thoroughly as Mark McGwire did 
Roger Maris' home run mark.''

<HEADLINE> Pele Unharmed in Robbery Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The new Mercedes Benz stopped at a  
traffic light presented a nearly irresistible target for an armed 
robber. But when the gunman spotted soccer legend Pele inside, he 
put his gun down, apologized and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele's office on Monday confirmed press reports that on Oct. 1,  
he and his wife, Assyria, escaped unharmed from an attempted holdup 
when their chauffeur-driven Mercedes stopped at a red light in Sao 
Paulo's Itaim Bibi district. 
</P>
<P>
	Before recognizing his victim, the holdup man demanded that the  
car's occupants turn over their money and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when he realized he was holding up Pele, he simply said he  
was sorry and quickly disappeared without taking anything,'' said 
an employee at Pele's office who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele did not report the incident to the police.  
</P>
<P>
	Holdups in traffic have become daily occurrences in Sao Paulo.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Vows Toughness in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- During a swearing-in  
ceremony Monday, NATO's new commander in Bosnia promised to 
aggressively safeguard law and order and fight corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ronald Adams, who took over command of 31,000  
NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia, said NATO will continue to path the 
way for the return of refugees after a 3 1/2-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to establish an environment ``where crime and  
corruption cannot succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams takes over from U.S. Gen. Montgomery Meigs, who guided the  
peacekeepers in Bosnia through the delicate period of NATO bombing 
of neighboring Yugoslavia. The bombing raised tension and increased 
the danger of retaliation against NATO peacekeepers in the 
Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	No major attacks occurred on the troops in Bosnia, in part  
because of Meigs' determination to keep the lid on any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the challenges for Adams will be overseeing the reduction  
of NATO's presence in Bosnia by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	After the change of command ceremony in the Sarajevo suburb of  
Ilidza, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, the overall NATO commander in 
Europe, visited some of the 6,200 American soldiers at Eagle Base 
in the northern city of Tuzla. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Bosnians to keep the hatred that drove them to war in  
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people that want ethnic division of this country need to  
leave or get out of power, because that's not the way it is going 
to be,'' Clark said. ``It's going to be a multiethnic society ... 
Let's get the refugees returned home.''

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Sickens 7 in Okla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Seven people have fallen ill from an  
outbreak of E. coli poisoning in Oklahoma, most of them children, 
health authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the confirmed cases were traced to unpasteurized apple  
cider marketed in the Tulsa area, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five children fell ill last week, and two cases have since been  
confirmed, said Dr. Mike Crutcher, state epidemiologist with the 
Oklahoma Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
	One was an adult who drank cider from Livesay Orchards, as did  
five children who became ill, authorities said. The other was a 
13-year-old girl, and authorities are unsure how she may have been 
poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	She remained hospitalized Monday in fair condition, as did a  
4-year-old girl in serious condition with kidney failure, an 
11-year-old boy in serious condition and a 6-year-old boy in fair 
condition. Authorities did not release any information on the 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	The dangerous strain of E. coli is usually found in the  
intestines or manure of cattle. People who ingest it can suffer 
severe cramps, bloody diarrhea and, in extreme cases, kidney 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Livesay, co-owner of Livesay Orchards, said last week that  
the outbreak is the first suspicion of any problem in nearly 20 
years of making cider.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Investors Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- About 2,000 people stormed a railway station and  
lay down on the tracks in the southwest Chinese city of Chongqing 
on Monday to protest plans to close illegal investment companies, a 
Hong Kong-based rights group reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of police officers pulled protesters off the tracks,  
but it took them three hours to clear the station, the Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. 
At least three protesters suffered injuries from police beatings 
and 10 were arrested, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chongqing newspapers announced Sunday that the government was  
about to clean up the illegal investment companies and funds. 
Protesters were furious because the firms had lured customers with 
high interest rates and with claims of connections to high-level 
government officials that made them appear sound places to invest, 
the Information Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests continued late Monday and had grown to some 5,000  
people, the Information Center estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about the protests could not be immediately confirmed.  
</P>
<P>
	The government announced that in many cases, investors would get  
only 70 percent of their investments back and would have to wait up 
to three years, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	China has had other protests over investment schemes gone awry.  
Railways, a key form of transportation in China, are a popular 
staging ground.

<HEADLINE> Ali's 'Comeback' Down for the Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Call it a punch line from Muhammad Ali.  
</P>
<P>
	Ali, who retired 18 years ago, loved to whimsically announce his  
retirements and comebacks during his reign as heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, he's still at it. The 57-year-old boxing great, afflicted  
by Parkinson's syndrome, says his latest comeback claim should be 
taken lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry, folks, not this time,'' he said in a statement Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	His publicists said he was not serious when he wrote in the  
current issue of Newsweek magazine that he planned a return to the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just me being me,'' the statement said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the article, the former three-time champion said he wanted to  
fight again and he planed to get in shape despite his slowed speech 
and movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm fighting Parkinson's disease. But I don't let it stop  
me. I still travel, attend to my business, do interviews,'' Ali 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``And let me tell you something that'll shock the Earth. I'm  
going to train and get in really good shape, lose 35 pounds and do 
an exhibition in Madison Square Garden with two or three 
contenders,'' he added. ``I'll dance for 15 rounds, and whup 'em. I 
haven't forgotten. I'll be weighing in at 210 pounds. I'll just 
say, `I am returned. Get the contract.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ali backed off that in an open letter to his fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Although my interview with Newsweek was a serious one, my  
claim to return to the ring was said in jest,'' he said. ``It is 
exciting that I can still get this kind of response from the press 
and public with the prospect of my returning to the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali last fought professionally on Dec. 11, 1981, a 10-round loss  
to Trevor Berbick. He finished with a 56-5 record and 37 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali travels with his wife, Lonnie, who speaks on his behalf. His  
speech is limited by a degenerative nerve disease. His walk is a 
little slower, but his intellect is unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali's daughter, Laila, one of his eight children, won her first  
professional fight on Oct. 8 with her father in attendance. She 
plans on fighting again. 
</P>
<P>
	In Newsweek, Ali called his fight with Joe Frazier in 1975, the  
``Thrilla in Manila,'' his greatest bout. He also said the greatest 
thing he ever did was refusing induction in the Army during the 
Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Rejects Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's  
government today rejected opposition demands for early elections, 
saying rebuilding Yugoslavia after NATO's bombing campaign must 
take first priority. 
</P>
<P>
	All major opposition parties last week demanded early  
parliamentary and presidential elections by the end of this year. 
In a rare show of unity, they set a series of conditions for a free 
and fair vote, including foreign monitoring and freeing of the 
media, which are under tight government control. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milovan Bojic, a leading government official, called such  
opposition demands ``funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Such demands are a sign of opposition's helplessness to  
achieve anything,'' Bojic told the private Palma Plus TV. The 
opposition ``is stunned by the fascinating results in the 
reconstruction of the country'' conducted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's coalition of ultra-nationalists and neo-communists  
has branded opposition leaders and their supporters as ``Western 
stooges'' and ``NATO allies'' who want to undermine government 
efforts to rebuild the country after allied intervention to stop 
the crackdown against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Goran Svilanovic, a leader of the opposition Alliance for  
Change, said the government is ``afraid of the elections because 
they know they will lose them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vojislav Seselj, leader of the ultra-nationalists, predicted  
there will be no elections by March. Regular elections are to be 
held at an unspecified time next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of presidential and parliamentary elections, Milosevic  
soon may call for local elections because Serbia's biggest 
municipalities are ruled by the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milan Bozic, a leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, said  
any ``partial holding of elections is out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During nearly a month of opposition rallies against Milosevic  
throughout Serbia, police and civilians armed with sticks -- 
believed to be recruited by ruling parties -- have beaten 
protesters. Top opposition leader Vuk Draskovic claimed he was the 
victim of an assassination attempt by a hit-and-run driver earlier 
this month, and a hand grenade exploded early Sunday in front of 
the home of a Democratic Party activist.

<HEADLINE> 13-Year-Old's Murder Trial Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Seventy-five potential jurors in the murder trial  
of a 13-year-old boy were dismissed Monday after two of them made 
negative remarks about encounters they had with the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Abraham, one of the nation's youngest murder suspects,  
is accused of shooting a stranger outside a store in Pontiac in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Nathaniel -- then just 11 and 4-foot-9 and 65  
pounds -- fired at Ronnie Green Jr., 18, with a stolen rifle from 
300 feet away. The boy allegedly had bragged about planning to 
shoot someone. He was arrested in his classroom, his face painted 
for a Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
	The pool of 75 potential jurors was sent home after two made  
negative comments about Nathaniel within earshot of others at the 
courthouse in Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the prospects spoke of an encounter with Nathaniel in a  
neighborhood where the two once lived, the other of a contact with 
him in a youth home after the boy's 1997 arrest, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The panel was definitely tainted,'' defense attorney William  
Lansat said, without elaborating about what specifically was said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection later resumed, and attorneys said a panel of 12  
could be seated within days. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's lawyers insist he was aiming at trees and shot Green  
accidentally. They also contend he is a slow learner who could not 
have understood his rights at the time of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan law allows prosecutors to charge children under 14 as  
adults for certain crimes.

<HEADLINE> Iron Eagle Back at Grand Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The eagle has landed.  
</P>
<P>
	A 1.5-ton, cast-iron eagle was returned to a perch above the  
entrance to Grand Central Terminal's new indoor food market Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird, with its 14-foot wingspread, was one of perhaps a  
dozen that graced the corner towers of Grand Central when Cornelius 
Vanderbilt's original railroad depot was expanded in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
	The eagles were carted away when the original building was torn  
down for a larger terminal a dozen years later. Their fate wasn't 
known until 1950, when a Daily News photographer took a picture of 
one at a railroad station in suburban Tarrytown and asked readers 
if they knew of others. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to the finding of 10 more -- all within 50 miles of New  
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The one restored to its perch on Monday came from the Bronxville  
yard of Paul Grand Pre and Laurie Hawkes, who found it in the 
bushes when they bought the property in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	How it got there remains unknown, said David Morrison, a retired  
Long Island Rail Road branch manager who has researched and written 
a historical monograph on the Grand Central eagles. He said the 
eagles' sculptor and the foundry that cast them also are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	The eagle, now painted russet-brown with a silver head and gold  
leaf, stands on its ball-perch above an entrance to the recently 
renovated Grand Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hawkes said it was proper for the eagle to be returned home.  
``It came from here, and it speaks to the whole redevelopment, to 
old New York,'' she said.

Web site to find out just how much time you have. 
</P>
<P>
	If you enter your birth date and gender at www.deathclock.com,  
you will get your projected date of death. If you were born, say, 
on March 16, 1969, and male, you will die on Dec. 26, 2042, based 
on average lifespan. That's less than 1.4 billion seconds away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Death Clock bills itself as ``the Internet's friendly  
reminder that life is slipping away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of the seven worst Web sites identified in the  
upcoming issue of P.O.V. magazine, which hits newsstands Tuesday. 
The magazine describes the sites as ``so achingly baa-aad that they 
are actually good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Death Clock is not exactly scientific -- it does not consider  
family history, smoking habits and other factors that actuaries 
take into account -- or even foolproof. Some combinations offer 
this: ``I am sorry, but your time has expired! Have a nice day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	P.O.V., a monthly targeting young male professionals, also  
picked 100 good sites. No. 1 is www.broadcast.com, which offers Web 
simulcasts of radio and TV stations from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Top (or bottom) on the magazine's ``Unmagnificent Seven'' is a  
site that provides the address of a female prisoner for $4.95. 
Another bad Web site, www.hamsterdance.com, features animated 
rodents doing ``the hamster dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the service used by 18 million subscribers,  
earned a mention for a home page, www.aol.com, that was deemed 
overly simple. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a porn site that traps visitors and forces them to  
other porn sites if they try to leave.

<HEADLINE> 76ers' Ratliff Out With Fracture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia 76ers power forward Theo  
Ratliff is out at least three weeks with a stress fracture in his 
left leg after taking a nasty tumble in a preseason game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratliff, who got tangled up with Charlie Ward of the Knicks as  
both fell out of bounds last Tuesday, had the foot immobilized in a 
boot Monday after an MRI revealed the stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers brought in free-agent center Stanley Roberts for a  
workout and could sign him as early as Tuesday, general manager 
Billy King said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is something you have to deal with at times,''  
said Ratliff, who was hobbled by a thigh bruise in the playoffs 
last season and sat out the fourth and final game of the 
second-round series against Indiana. ``I've been injured before, 
but never to this extent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers already are hindered by a rash of injuries. Matt  
Geiger is out with a sore left knee, and Tyrone Hill is out with a 
fractured left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Roberts is one of the most injury-prone big men  
in the NBA. He's had two ruptured Achilles' tendons, back surgery 
and is coming off shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the kid,'' coach Larry Brown said. ``I want him in our  
league. If this is a good situation for him, good. But that's up to 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who said he weighs 315 pounds, went through a light  
workout Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very impressive,'' King said. ``On cardiovascular, he's not  
where he wants to be. But he's a great post-up player. He can score 
on the block.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts had the best year of his career with the Clippers in  
1991-92, when Brown was the coach. The Sixers tried to get him last 
year, but he signed with Houston. After Philadelphia, he has trips 
planned for Miami and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how things go here whether I'll complete that  
trip or not,'' said Roberts, who would get the veteran's minimum of 
$760,000.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler May Seek Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is in talks with both  
Italy's Fiat SpA and France's Peugeot SA on cooperating in the 
small car market, ranging from sharing parts to taking a stake in 
each other's companies, a German newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	An outright acquisition of either carmaker remains highly  
unlikely, according to the Handelsblatt business newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified DaimlerChrysler manager was quoted as saying a  
decision could be made at the next DaimlerChrysler supervisory 
board meeting Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has in the past confirmed being in negotiations  
with Peugeot without disclosing the nature of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation in the market has centered on possible cooperation  
to help boost DaimlerChrysler's struggling Smart micro-mini car, 
which is made in France. There has been talk that the company might 
use a Peugeot chassis in the next Smart model. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would not confirm that it is in talks with Fiat.  
</P>
<P>
	Fiat has repeatedly said it will not sell its passenger car  
business. The Italian automobile manufacturer is nevertheless a 
potential partner since it has recently been seeking ways to 
strengthen its business, including joint ventures and shareholdings 
with other car manufacturers, Handelsblatt said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `The Straight Story' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The camera pans over the fields of a seemingly sleepy rural  
American Midwest populated only -- or so it first appears -- by 
scampering dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Zooming in one particular house, it proceeds to introduce us to  
Dorothy (Jane Galloway Heitz), a rather lumpen woman with an eye 
patch who is waddling in and out with food. The woman suggests a 
true eccentric at best, trouble -- or more than that -- at worst. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, so ``Blue Velvet,'' the defining David Lynch film from  
1986 that located the hell that lies beneath America. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real shock of Lynch's lovely new film, ``The Straight  
Story,'' is how direct it is. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually every other Lynch tale, from ``Eraserhead'' and ``The  
Elephant Man'' through to the overripe ``Wild at Heart,'' occupies 
a vaguely hallucinatory world where nothing is what it seems and 
human behavior is more often than not, well, horrific. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he's entered the realm of the G-rated, where G could  
stand for gentle, in addition to the notable absence of two Lynch 
mainstays -- sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Has the new movie been offered up in atonement? Whatever Lynch's  
reasons for making it, one fact is clear: This portrait of a 
73-year-old man who has embarked upon the odyssey of his life 
represents the kind of poignantly reflective journey you never 
expected this filmmaker to undertake. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Lynch scenarios, Dorothy might well emerge as an  
incipient psychopath. In ``The Straight Story,'' she merely 
anticipates our introduction to Alvin Straight (Richard 
Farnsworth), a man possessed of a mission -- and the lawnmower to 
achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Alvin is in any condition to drive a used John Deere  
mower 300 miles across state lines in order to visit his estranged 
elder brother, Lyle, who is suffering from a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Troubled with emphysema, his hips so bad he can barely stand,  
Alvin won't submit to medical tests, an operation or the use of a 
walker. Two canes mark his only concession to age. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not dead yet,'' he tells daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek),  
with whom he lives, before setting off on the five-week trek from 
Laurens, Iowa, to Mt. Zion, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Alvin's decision mad or gallant? A mixture, clearly, of both,  
though John Roach and Mary Sweeney's screenplay is too graceful to 
pass judgment on a character who exerts his own unexplained 
fascination. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it's a measure of the film's method that Alvin's actions  
are never questioned, except by the viewer. In the world of ``The 
Straight Story,'' a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the film consists of the journey itself, though  
anyone expecting conventional road-movie theatrics should think 
again. (A septuagenarian driving a cantankerous garden implement 
isn't exactly ``Thelma and Louise.'') 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the mower won't start; at other times, it moves all  
too hurtlingly well -- the result of a faulty drive belt. Keeping 
his hat in place, too, proves a constant challenge for Alvin, since 
passing trucks tend to whip it from his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Then come the people Alvin encounters, who turn out to be a most  
un-Lynchian collective of what one might call good, decent folk. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are decidedly quirky -- a set of bickering twins, a woman  
with an unfortunate habit of driving into deer. 
</P>
<P>
	More often, however, Alvin is met with unforced compassion, not  
least when a priest walks across the land on which Alvin has 
trespassed in order to deliver up mashed potatoes and meat loaf. 
</P>
<P>
	In tone, the film somewhat recalls Paul Mazursky's picaresque  
``Harry and Tonto'' of several decades ago, which won a deserved 
Academy Award for the late Art Carney. There's more than a trace of 
the earlier film's aging wanderer in Alvin's remark that ``the 
worst part about being old is remembering when you was young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The role of Alvin is an absolute glory, and veteran character  
actor Farnsworth (a 1977 Oscar nominee for ``Comes a Horseman'') 
inhabits it gloriously in what amounts to a one-man show studded 
with vivid cameos. Only Spacek seems wasted in a teary supporting 
role she may have accepted because the movie's able production 
designer is her husband, Jack Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the film is a little too ``straight'' for its own  
good, with one or two scenes making overly explicit themes or 
emotions better left unamplified. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether Farnsworth's kindly yet grizzled Alvin is trading  
war stories during a rest stop in a bar or merely traveling 
silently on his way, ``The Straight Story'' finds a rare majesty in 
a determination that has its own quietly dazzling -- and 
unsentimental -- payoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Straight Story'' is a Walt Disney Pictures release, though  
few of the items in the G-rated Disney back catalogue ever had the 
resonance of this one. The producers are Mary Sweeney and Neal 
Edelstein. It runs 111 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Helms May Block Moseley-Braun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman  
Jesse Helms erected a road block today to the ambassadorial 
nomination of a former colleague with whom he'd tangled, Illinois 
Democrat Carol Moseley-Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun, who served one term as the first black woman  
senator but lost her re-election bid in 1996, was nominated earlier 
this month by President Clinton to be ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said through a spokesman that Moseley-Braun's nomination  
to be ambassador was under a cloud, suggesting his panel would 
closely scrutinize it. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, Marc Thiessen, said Helms would issue a statement  
on the controversy later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, meanwhile, urged Helms not to block the appointment.  
``I hope he won't do that,'' the president told reporters. ``There 
has been an unprecedented amount of playing politics with 
ambassadorships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And again, it sends a statement to the rest of the world that  
there is a new isolationism in this country, that we don't really 
care whether we have ambassadors in some of these places,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a White House official suggested Helms was acting on a  
six-year-old grudge dating from a quarrel on the Senate floor about 
the Confederate battle flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Constitution was not written to provide individual  
senators with a way to even the score,'' said White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Roll Call, a twice-weekly newspaper on Capitol Hill, quoted  
Helms as saying, ``I don't think she (should) hold her breath until 
she becomes an ambassador. She better look for another line of 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms was a leader in the conservative effort that resulted last  
week in the Senate defeat of a landmark international test ban 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he single-handedly scuttled the nomination of former  
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be 
ambassador to Mexico, by simply refusing to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun lost her re-election bid in 1996 to Republican  
Peter Fitzgerald, who attacked her on several controversies that 
had surrounded her during her term. She was heavily criticized for 
a 1996 visit to a Nigerian dictator and never-proved allegations 
that she used 1993 campaign funds to pay for personal luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms and Moseley-Braun clashed during her one term, most  
memorably a battle on the Senate floor in 1993 over the use of the 
Confederate battle flag. 
</P>
<P>
	She led a successful effort by the Senate to reject an amendment  
by Helms to Clinton's national service legislation that would have 
granted the United Daughters of the Confederacy a renewed patent on 
an insignia featuring the Confederate battle flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun called it a cruel reminder that blacks were once  
``human chattel'' in America. 
</P>
<P>
	She later recounted a meeting in a Senate elevator between  
herself, Helms and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. She said when she got 
on, Helms started to sing the song ``Dixie'' and told Hatch: ``I'm 
going to sing 'Dixie' to her until she cries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Helms and Hatch portrayed the episode as a  
good-natured exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, the White House spokesman, accused the Republican-led  
Senate of a ``certain cavalier attitude'' toward its constitutional 
advise and consent responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested Helms was behaving immaturely, out of annoyance  
with Moseley-Braun over their six-year old disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if this is truly Sen. Helms' belief, that he would  
block anyone he does not like, he has an obligation to articulate 
how that squares with his constitutional responsibilities,'' 
Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Troubled Despite Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota was once a team with Super  
Bowl ambitions. Now, a fourth loss in five weeks has Randy Moss 
wondering whether the Vikings can even reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really been in this situation in my whole life,  
playing basketball, football, baseball, anything,'' Moss said. ``So 
I can't really tell you if we're going to make the playoffs or not. 
Hopefully we can, but if not, bite your tongue and look for next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are reeling. At 2-4, they're heading into a  
difficult stretch against San Francisco, Denver and Dallas without 
running back Robert Smith, who flew to Tampa on Monday for a hernia 
operation that will sideline him up to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	His backup, Leroy Hoard, has a mouthful of stitches after biting  
through his bottom lip Sunday. He'll need plastic surgery and might 
not be able to practice much this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike so many of their fans, the Vikings aren't ready to  
give up on their season, not with the NFC Central so unsettled and 
not with a quarterback change providing optimism for a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff George replaced Randall Cunningham with Detroit ahead 19-0  
at halftime Sunday and led a comeback that was rendered futile when 
Jason Hanson's last-second field goal lifted the Lions to a 25-23 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the end of the road, there's 10 games left and the  
way the division and the league's going right now, everybody's 
getting beat,'' George said. ``All it takes is one win to get this 
thing turned around and get the confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George, a 10-year veteran who signed a one-year, $400,000  
contract, produced more points in one half than the Vikings had 
managed in any full game this season under Cunningham, whose 
five-year, $28 million deal he signed last December spurred the now 
regrettable trading of Brad Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	George was 10-of-12 for 214 yards and two touchdowns, providing  
the spark that was missing all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk about the fire in the Vikings' eyes and that second  
half we had that fire, we came back,'' Moss said. ``That field goal 
... it was like they put it out with a fire extinguisher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that led to some fuming in the Vikings locker room, where  
Moss criticized the coaches' decision to play the percentages and 
settle for a field goal that put them ahead 23-22 with 1:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss wanted George to throw into the end zone on third-and-7  
from the Lions 12 with 1:51 remaining, but coach Dennis Green and 
offensive coordinator Ray Sherman called for another run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's team went for everything,'' Moss fumed.  
</P>
<P>
	Soothing many of Moss' concerns, however, was the promotion of  
George. 
</P>
<P>
	George has worn out his welcome everywhere he's played, but his  
reputation as a talented troublemaker more concerned about himself 
than his team hasn't followed him to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said the same thing about Randall Cunningham,'' Green  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cunningham said he's George's biggest fan now.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pulling for him to do well, not only for us as a team but  
also I know what he's been through. I'd love to see him have a lot 
of joy in his life,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings can still save their season, but George called for  
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have one goal in mind, and that's get this thing turned  
around and ultimately get to the big one,'' George said. ``It's not 
something that's going to happen overnight. I'm not this Houdini 
that's going to come in here and do tricks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But restoring a little bit of last year's magic would go a long  
way toward returning the swagger around Winter Park.

<HEADLINE> Poll: No Dominant Campaign Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voters say the issues they most want to hear  
discussed during the 2000 presidential campaign are health 
insurance, the proper use of U.S. troops and the future of Social 
Security and Medicare, a new poll said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of one dominant issue gives the personal qualities  
of the candidates increased importance in the 2000 presidential 
campaign, the poll suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	That appears to have hampered Al Gore in head-to-head matchups  
with GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who had been running 11 to 15 
points ahead of the vice president. Gore narrowed that gap to 7 
points, 51-44, in the poll by the Pew Research Center for the 
People &AMP; the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president benefits from increased support from women;  
50 percent of women would vote for Gore today compared to 40 
percent in September, while 45 percent of women in this poll said 
they back Bush. Support for Gore remains unchanged among men at 37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, noted ``how  
steady the Bush lead is among men and how variable it is among 
women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Women seem to be less focused on Gore's personal  
shortcomings,'' Kohut said, ``but men seem more focused on his 
personal qualities as negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of those who opposed Gore, about half cited his close ties to  
President Clinton as a reason for not supporting him, while more 
than a third said it was his personality and leadership abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,032 adults was taken Oct. 7-11 and has an error  
margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, plus or minus 4 
percent for registered voters, and slightly larger for subgroups 
such as Democratic or Republican primary voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Gore had substantial leads in the race for their own  
parties' nominations in this poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Though their interest was spread over a wide range of issues,  
those surveyed were most likely, 62 percent, to show a high level 
of interest in discussion of how the poor and uninsured can get 
health insurance. Those most inclined to say they wanted to hear 
about health insurance were female, black and had incomes under 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost a fourth of the public have closely followed proposals by  
presidential candidates to expand health coverage by the poor, more 
than the 17 percent who follow campaign news in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and his Democratic presidential rival, former New Jersey  
Sen. Bill Bradley, have offered comprehensive proposals on 
expanding health care for the uninsured. Gore's plan focuses on 
children while Bradley has suggested a plan that ensures access to 
affordable coverage for children and adults in low and 
middle-income families. Republican candidates, including Bush, 
suggest various combinations of expanded medical savings accounts 
and tax incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority in the poll, 56 percent, said they're very interested  
in hearing about whether U.S. troops should be sent into countries 
to stop the killing of innocent civilians in a civil war. Those 
most likely to want to hear more about those issues were men and 
those with some college education. 
</P>
<P>
	Half said their top priority for campaign discussion was keeping  
Medicare financially sound, and almost that many, 46 percent, said 
they wanted to hear discussion of investing Social Security funds 
in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those most likely to want to hear about Medicare were women,  
those with a high school education or less, and those who make less 
than $30,000 a year and not surprisingly, older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	While the poll ``does show a little progress for Gore, there's  
still a lot of uncertainty here,'' said Kohut, noting the election 
was more than a year away. ``We will see a lot of ups and downs. 
People don't have a lot of conviction about this.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Appeals Web Site Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is going back to court to force a  
Mustang enthusiast to stop putting confidential company information 
on his Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	But the enthusiast, Robert Lane, has fired back with a $15  
million counterclaim against Ford, claiming the company tampered 
with his site and illegally tried to silence him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford lost an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds  
in September. The automaker wanted to ban Lane, a 32-year-old 
Dearborn nursing student, from using, copying or disclosing company 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane testified he has 112 Ford documents received from anonymous  
sources, including blueprints and production schedules. He had 
posted some of them on his Internet site, www.BlueOvalNews.com, and 
wrote stories about others over the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford sued Lane in August, claiming he violated laws against  
disclosing trade secrets when he posted the documents on his 
Internet site. A different judge ordered Lane to remove the 
documents and any material copyrighted by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edmunds said that while Ford had a strong case, blocking  
Lane from putting the documents on the Internet would be an illegal 
prior restraint of speech. The judge did order Lane to preserve any 
Ford documents he might have, to not violate Ford copyrights and to 
not solicit information from Ford employees. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the ruling, Ford said it was pleased with  
Edmunds' ruling. But earlier this month, Ford filed a notice to 
appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Ford 
spokesman Jim Cain said the company believes Lane is still 
publishing copyrighted material and trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the September ruling, Lane has posted several articles on  
Ford's future engine plans, including specifications for a new line 
of diesel truck engines. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Mark Pickrell, the Nashville attorney handling Lane's case,  
said he was surprised by Ford's decision to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything else Ford requested, Ford won,'' Pickrell said.  
``The one part of the preliminary injunction they lost they're 
appealing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickrell said Lane filed his counterclaim against Ford earlier  
this month. The lawyer said Ford's lawsuit against Lane amounts to 
a SLAPP -- strategic lawsuit against public participation -- action, 
and Lane is entitled to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	No court dates have been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Quake's Magnitude Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The earthquake that rocked Southern  
California over the weekend may have triggered several moderate 
quakes near the San Andreas Fault, seismologists said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Hector Mine earthquake tore a 25-mile-long gash  
from a dry lake through the Mojave Desert, displacing dirt roads 
and creek beds. Scientists upgraded the quake's magnitude from 7.0 
to 7.1 Monday -- a 25 percent increase in shaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's temblor, which struck at 2:46 a.m. in a sparsely  
populated stretch of desert, caused minor injuries on an Amtrak 
train that derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of the quake, some seismologists were alarmed by a  
series of earthquakes as powerful as 4.0 that struck 120 miles away 
near the Salton Sea, a few miles from the massive San Andreas 
Fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear that the faults in this area are talking to  
each other,'' U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones said. 
``It's not clear what exactly that pattern is,'' so scientists 
can't predict another quake resulting from this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most seismologists say there is no connection among the  
large quakes that have occurred recently around the world, some 
experts are considering links between the Hector quake and a 
7.5-magnitude temblor that killed 27 people in Mexico last month, 
said Kate Hutton of the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a small minority who believe there may be a  
connection,'' she said. Hutton said she found the link between the 
Salton Sea and Hector quakes ``more likely,'' considering the close 
distance between them. 
</P>
<P>
	While most temblors trigger other quakes in the immediate  
vicinity, large earthquakes can have far-reaching effects, Jones 
said. In 1992, a 7.3-magnitude quake in Landers, Calif., was 
responsible for quakes as far away as Yellowstone National Park in 
Wyoming, she said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Turn Higher on Stock Worries / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell sharply Monday, weighed down by  
ongoing fears that inflation is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/16 point, or  
$8.13 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 6.32 percent from Friday's 6.26 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys received a rare boost on Friday following the release  
of a key inflationary gauge which revealed that producer prices had 
risen in September. The news sent shock waves through the stock 
market, driving the Dow Jones industrial average down 266 points 
and causing investors to seek shelter in government backed bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices have been slipping for weeks, driving the yield of  
the benchmark 30-year bond to the highest levels in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor wariness returned to the bond market on Monday, one day  
ahead of the release of the consumer price index, another important 
barometer for inflation. If the numbers show prices are on the 
rise, analysts believe Federal Reserve Board policy makers will 
almost certainly raise interest rates at their next meeting on Nov. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 3/32 point to 1/8  
point while intermediate maturities rose 5/16 point to 17/32 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.15 percent as the  
discount rose 0.10 percentage point from Friday to 5.01 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.21 percent, as the discount rose 0.05 to 
5.00 percent. One-year yields were 5.41 percent as the discount 
rose 0.03 percentage point to 5.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate fell to 5.19 percent from 5.31 percent  
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 109 1/16 from 109 15/32 late Friday. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 6.10 from 6.06 percent on 
Friday.

	Asian Markets Sag on Wall St. Woes  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets opened the week broadly lower,  
losing ground today after investors in the region were rattled by a 
big drop on Wall Street on fears that U.S. share prices could slide 
further. On Wall Street last week, the Dow Jones industrial average 
fell 630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, to close Friday at 10,019.71, 
largely on fear that emerging signs of inflation will force the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this 
year. It was the Dow's worst week ever in terms of points lost, and 
the worst of the decade in terms of percentage. On Friday alone, 
the average lost 266.90 points, or 2.6 percent.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen and Tokyo share

The dollar bought 105.02 yen in late trading in Tokyo, down 0.76 
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late Friday level in 
New York of 105.42 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average closed down 326.24 
points, or 1.85 percent, to 17,275.33. On Friday, the index shed 
178.69 points, or 1 percent.

<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Ford Motor Co. said today that a  
healthy U.S. economy and strong sales of trucks boosted its third 
quarter earnings to $1.11 billion, up 11 percent over last year. 
The world's No. 2 automaker earned 90 cents a share for the three 
months ending in September, compared with $1 billion, or 80 cents a 
share, for the same period of 1998. Sales totaled $38 billion, up 
16 percent from $32.6 billion a year ago. The results beat Wall 
Street analysts' expectations of 85 cents a share, according to a 
survey of 13 analysts by First Call/Thomson Corp.

	Strike Threat Looms for GM Canada  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers will strike General  
Motors Corp. this week unless the company withdraws its proposal to 
outsource hundreds of jobs at five plants, union President Buzz 
Hargrove said. The union's strike deadline is midnight tomorrow. 
The automaker has reduced the number of jobs it wants to eliminate 
by shifting them to outside suppliers from more than 1,000 to about 
700, Hargrove said yesterday. But he said the CAW will not accept 
any outsourcing at a time when more than 1,500 workers are on 
layoff from GM's Canadian plants.

will shut down three assembly plants and slash 21,000 jobs in an 
attempt to become more competitive, the company announced today. '' 
... Nissan is in bad shape,'' Chief Operating Officer Carlos Ghosn 
said. The former Renault executive took over at Nissan in July, 
promising to revive the ailing manufacturer. Under the three-year 
restructuring plan drawn up with partner Renault SA of France, the 
company will cut its worldwide work force 14 percent, to 127,000 by 
the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2002.

	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- NiSource Inc. has upped its offer for  
Columbia Energy Group by 9 percent, or $6 a share, to try to 
persuade Columbia to drop its vigorous, months-long efforts to fend 
off the bid. NiSource, facing a deadline today to announce the 
results of a $68 a share offer initially made in June, said 
yesterday it would pay $74 a share for the Virginia company. The 
increase would boost the value of the deal to $6.1 billion from 
$5.7 billion. The sweetened bid offers shareholders a 22 percent 
premium over Columbia's Friday's closing price of $60.50 on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

Seok-hyun has evaded $2.11 million in business and inheritance

Hong could face at least five years in prison. His newspaper, The 
JoongAng Ilbo, was not implicated.

small car market, ranging from sharing parts to taking a stake in 
each other's companies. An outright acquisition of either carmaker 
remains highly unlikely, according to Germany's Handelsblatt

possible cooperation to help boost DaimlerChrysler's struggling 
Smart micro-mini car, which is made in France.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Wildfire Victims Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Residents of rural Northern  
California who lost dozens of homes to a weekend wildfire say they 
will rebuild -- even if they have to resort to old-fashioned barn 
raisings to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	In unincorporated Jones Valley, people have offered to help and  
backed it up with their checkbooks, fire Capt. Jan Gross said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already had donations: cash, checks and cookies,'' Ms.  
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents will need all that help and more. A wildfire that  
started about 4 a.m. Saturday swept across 25,900 acres in Shasta 
County, destroying 70 to 90 homes and about 200 other structures. 
More than 2,000 people helped fight the fire about 180 miles north 
of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, fanned by winds gusting to 40 mph, caused at least $6  
million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was 85 percent contained by Monday, and firefighters  
expected to finish digging a trench around it by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials think it may have been caused by a campfire, though  
the investigation was continuing, said California Department of 
Forestry spokesman Henri Brachais. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones Valley's 15-member volunteer fire department was the first  
to respond. Now the fire hall, built with volunteer labor from the 
community, has become the spot for information and moral support, 
though that's nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bridge club meets here, the poker club meets here.  
Everyone has keys to the place and can come in when they need 
anything,'' says Ms. Gross, whose department gets about $8,000 a 
year -- most of it from donations -- to protect more than 300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gross said people have volunteered to help rebuild the homes  
even if they have to pound the nails themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles south of Jones Valley in Bella Vista, all that was  
left of the Cross Roads Baptist Church was the sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to rebuild bigger and better and keep on doing  
what we do,'' said Pastor Ken Landers, sifting through the pile of 
smoldering ashes. Among the few identifiable items was a hymnal 
opened to ``Trust Only Him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several churches have offered assistance and one collected more  
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If the damage estimates hold, the Shasta County fire will be one  
of the season's most destructive blazes, said state forestry 
spokesman Rex Buthmann. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 miles northwest of Sacramento, investigators blamed  
arson for a fire that burned more than 42,000 acres. At least one 
house was burned, and hundreds of firefighters sought to keep it 
from damaging more property. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinity County, a fire that began two months ago has so far  
burned 117,000 acres. And along the Central Coast, two fires in the 
Los Padres National Forest continued to burn after scorching more 
than 85,000 acres.

<HEADLINE> Ryan White Foundation To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Unable to continue its AIDS education  
programs because of dwindling donations, the Ryan White Foundation 
will shut down at the end of October, its founder said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne White-Ginder, the mother of the foundation's namesake,  
said she will join forces with the advocacy group AIDS Action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be up to me to bring in all the money now,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White-Ginder will lead the Washington-based group's Ryan White  
Project, a new effort to bolster AIDS education among young people 
and to lobby for continued federal funding for AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwindling donations forced the Indianapolis-based Ryan White  
Foundation to lay off its full-time staff this year. White-Ginder 
started the foundation in 1990, the year her 18-year-old son died 
from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, a hemophiliac, contracted the virus through tainted  
blood-clotting products. He attracted national attention during his 
battle to attend school after being diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Foundation leaders attributed the drop in funds to a growing  
sense the AIDS epidemic is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the AIDS epidemic is in the midst of one of its worst  
crises yet -- the crisis of complacency,'' said Mark Maddox, 
chairman of the foundation's board.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Lobbying Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Columbine High shootings, supporters  
of gun control saw a rare opportunity to win more restrictive laws. 
Seizing the moment, they poured five times as much money into 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet their chief opponent -- the National Rifle Association --  
still spent far more on its lobbying against tighter gun laws, 
according to reports for the first half of the year. The issue 
remains alive in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading gun-control group, Handgun Control, spent $340,000  
from January through June of this year, up from $60,000 during the 
same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Handgun Control's spending was less than half that of the  
NRA. Using both its own staff and the help of outside lobbying 
firms, the NRA poured $850,000 into its effort during the first six 
months of the year, compared with $750,000 during the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity stems from congressional action on gun  
control that took center stage after the April shooting at 
Columbine High School outside Denver left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators are considering gun-control  
proposals as part of juvenile-crime legislation. GOP leaders 
believe agreement is near on provisions to bar minors from 
possessing assault weapons, ban certain large-scale ammunition 
clips and require ``reasonable'' mandatory background checks for 
purchases, including those at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	By one vote, the Senate in May passed legislation that included  
mandatory background checks on all firearms buyers at gun shows and 
required dealers to provide safety devices with all handguns. A 
month later, the House deleted the gun measures from the 
juvenile-crime bill after some Republicans argued they were too 
strong and some Democrats asserted they were too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	That has left it to a House-Senate conference to resolve the  
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	For Handgun Control, there finally is a bill that gun-control  
advocates can use to pressure lawmakers, spokeswoman Naomi Paiss 
said. Contributions also rose and helped finance more lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun control had been stymied for many years,'' Paiss said.  
``We finally got something on the floor that people understood was 
critically important to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals 
and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, acknowledging the important fight, hired two new  
outside lobbying firms to buttress the efforts of the group's 
staff, including one headed by Randall Scheunemann, a former top 
aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could have found 15 more people who were particularly  
effective, I would have hired them, too,'' said James Baker, the 
NRA's chief lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the NRA urged its members to contact lawmakers  
involved in the gun-control talks as well as their own members of 
Congress. ``It is critical that you call ... to ensure that no 
anti-gun language is included in the final conference committee's 
'compromise' legislation,'' the NRA said in a fax message. 
</P>
<P>
	Handgun Control spent $100,000 on television ads last month in  
Washington, D.C., and 10 congressional districts, most them 
represented by members expected to face competitive races next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Susan Sarandon each narrated a  
commercial, which included scenes of shootings at Columbine and a 
Jewish community center in Los Angeles in August, as well as the 
1998 killings of five people in Jonesboro, Ark., shot as they left 
school during a fire alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough. No more excuses,'' O'Donnell and Sarandon  
said in separate ads. ``Call Congress and tell them to close the 
loopholes that give children and criminals easy access to 
firearms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA quickly answered with its own $50,000 ad campaign,  
citing a study that found the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms sending fewer gun-related cases to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need tougher gun laws,'' the narrator says in a  
message that mirrors what NRA lobbyists carry to Capitol Hill. ``We 
need to get tougher on violent criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the prosecution is a very salient point,'' Baker  
said. ``It's one we're trying to put across in every venue 
possible.''

<HEADLINE> Convictions in Teen Informant Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Calif. (AP) -- Two men and a woman were convicted Monday  
of murdering a teen-ager police had used as a drug informant. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury that convicted Jose Ibarra, 21, Michael Martinez, 22,  
and Florence Noriega, 30, will return next month to consider 
whether they should get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad MacDonald, 17, was killed in March 1998 and his 16-year-old  
girlfriend was raped, shot in the head and left for dead. She 
survived and testified during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald's death led to tighter restrictions on the use of  
minors in undercover police work in California. Police are now 
banned from using children 12 and younger as informants and are 
required to get permission from a judge to use youths ages 13 to 
17. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy MacDonald, the murder victim's mother, claimed her son was  
killed because he was involved in undercover work for the Brea and 
Yorba Linda police departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said MacDonald had worked for the agencies for a while,  
but by the time he was killed he had been dismissed as an informant 
because he had gotten arrested.

<HEADLINE> 3 Carolina Starters Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers' first victory over  
a team with a winning record in nearly three years carried a 
significant price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach George Seifert said Monday that three starters -- the  
Panthers' best offensive lineman and their two most recent 
first-round draft picks -- will be sidelined for extended periods 
because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury reports on left guard Matt Campbell, wide receiver  
Rae Carruth and defensive end Jason Peter came one day after 
Carolina stepped out of character with a 31-29 victory over the San 
Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time since the 1996 NFL playoffs that  
Carolina beat a team with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty sad,'' said safety Mike Minter, a second-round  
pick in 1997 after a standout career at perennial NCAA powerhouse 
Nebraska. ``I'm used to being on the other end with people talking 
about trying to beat our team. To be able to say now we finally 
beat somebody over .500, that's not good. But we did it, and that's 
the key. Now the key is for us to get over .500 ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina (2-3) reversed another trend with Sunday's victory. The  
Panthers lost an NFL-record nine games by seven points or less in 
1998, and it was more of the same early this season, with Carolina 
losing three games by a total of 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers appeared to be headed for trouble again Sunday,  
building a 31-16 lead before holding on for the road victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we know we can do it,'' Seifert said. ``We also know we've  
had to battle our butts off to have a chance. And that's the type 
of team we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the San Francisco game, the Panthers had been relatively  
free of significant injuries. But Carolina will be without three 
starters and have several others nursing injuries for Sunday's home 
game against Detroit (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said Campbell is likely to miss at least six weeks with  
a sprained ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Carruth, the Panthers' No. 1 draft choice in 1997, has a  
sprained left ankle that Seifert said is likely to sideline him 
``at least a couple weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Peter, Carolina's top pick in 1998, had to leave Sunday's  
game because of what the team called tendinitis in his left 
shoulder. Peter offered a different assessment of his injury, 
however, saying he was experiencing numbness in his left arm and 
hand and will be sidelined for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Seifert said four starters are likely to miss  
practice time this week with minor injuries but should be able to 
play Sunday: wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad with a thigh bruise, 
right guard Anthony Redmon with a sore left clavicle, linebacker 
Mike Barrow with a bruised sternum and tailback Tshimanga 
Biakabutuka with a groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten along pretty well up until this game,'' Seifert  
said. ``Now it's up to these other fellas to take advantage of 
their opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Jefffers is likely to start in place of Carruth, and  
Seifert said he probably will use Antonio Edwards or Mike Rucker to 
fill in for Peter. Seifert said he was considering Nate Newton and 
Bryan Stoltenberg to start for Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton filled in for Campbell after the injury, so it would seem  
logical that the starting job would go to Newton, a 13-year NFL 
veteran with six Pro Bowl appearances and a gift for gab. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you thought Nate talked a lot before, beware,'' Campbell  
said. ``You all are going to have to get bigger tape recorders, 
something that takes like VHS tapes.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up vs. Euro, Down vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Monday,  
reclaiming some of the ground it lost last week. But the dollar 
slipped against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had plunged against the euro last week amid sharp  
declines on Wall Street and worrisome data released Friday on an 
unexpectedly sharp rise in inflation at the wholesale level during 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping to drive the dollar higher against the euro Monday were  
remarks over the weekend from European Central Bank officials that 
expectations may be overdone for an increase in European interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0842, down  
from $1.0889 late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 105.08 
Japanese yen, down from 105.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Against other leading currencies, the dollar bought 1.4650 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.4585, and 1.4953 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4884. The British pound fell to $1.6686 from $1.6714. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8039 German 
marks, up from 1.7962; 6.0501 French francs, up from 6.0240; and 
1,785.90 Italian lire, up from 1,778.19.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 96.57  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, careening through a  
volatile session marked by continued worries about rising interest 
rates and inflation. Technology stocks fell sharply, bearing the 
brunt of investors' pessimism. At the close of trading on Wall 
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 96.57 at 10,116.28. 
Most of the gain occurred in the final 30 minutes of trading. 
Earlier in the session, the Dow was up as much as 108 points and 
down as much as 43 points from Friday's close. Broader stock 
indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index managed a 
slight gain, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 42.68 to 
2,689.15.

	Delta, Continental Earnings Down  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Delta and Continental airlines reported a drop  
in third-quarter earnings as Hurricane Floyd grounded hundreds of 
flights for both carriers. Delta said today its earnings excluding 
a one-time gain fell 13 percent during the quarter, while 
Continental Airlines said its earnings fell 27 percent. Delta's 
earnings were $290 million, or $1.96 per share, compared to $327 
million, or $2.08 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. 
Delta exceeded the $1.91-per-share expectations of analysts. 
Continental's net earnings fell 27 percent to $110 million, or 
$1.53 per share, from $150 million, or $1.94 per share a year ago. 
The 1998 results do not reflect a one-time charge for the 
retirement of aging aircraft. Continental's latest results 
surpassed predictions of analysts.

	Nissan To Close Plants, Slash Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co.'s new boss, Carlos Ghosn,  
announced plans today to shut down three assembly plants in Japan 
and slash Nissan's worldwide work force by 14 percent in an attempt 
to return Japan's second-largest automaker to profitability. Of the 
21,000 jobs being cut in the three-year restructuring, about 1,400 
positions will be eliminated in the United States, where offices 
will be closed in New York and Washington. Nissan is expected to 
show a significant loss this year, ``much larger than the one 
previously forecast,'' Ghosn warned.

<P>
	SBC To Upgrade Internet Access  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications, the nation's largest local  
phone company, plans to spend $6 billion in a bid to become the top 
provider of high-capacity, always-connected Internet service. The 
three-year spending plan announced today is expected to bring 
upgraded Web access to about 35 million homes, or 80 percent of 
SBC's customers. The figure includes those from the just-competed 
purchase of Ameritech, the local phone company in the Midwest. 
SBC's other units are Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell in 
California, Nevada Bell, and SNET in Connecticut.

<P>
	Xerox Earnings Down 11 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. said today that, as expected,  
its third-quarter profit fell 11 percent as the result of lower 
productivity from its reorganized sales force and pricing pressures 
from competitors. The office machine manufacturer also said the 
factors that depressed its results are expected to continue into 
the fourth quarter and the first half of next year. Net income for 
the just-ended quarter fell to $339 million, or 47 cents per share, 
compared with earnings of $381 million, or 53 cents per share, in 
the same period a year ago. The decline, which the company had 
forecast Oct. 8, came on revenues of $4.63 billion, essentially 
unchanged from last year. 

</P>
<P>
	American Home Increases Earnings  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising sales of its estrogen replacement and  
arthritis drugs helped American Home Products Corp. post a 2 
percent increase in third-quarter earnings. The results do not 
reflect $3.29 billion in charges mostly related to the company's 
proposed national diet drug settlement. American Home said Monday 
it earned $633.46 million, or 48 cent per share, compared to 
earnings of $618.99 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same 
quarter a year ago. Results beat analysts' forecasts by a penny. 
Sales rose 3 percent to $3.32 billion from $3.22 billion a year 
ago.

	Nextel Narrows Its Loss  
</P>
<P>
	RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Nextel Communications Inc., a leading  
wireless telephone company, narrowed its operating loss to $86 
million in the third quarter, edging Wall Street predictions as it 
added more than half a million subscribers. But results continued 
to be hurt by a costly strategy of expanding the company's overseas 
telecommunications network. Nextel reported today that its 
three-month loss, excluding one-time expenses, came to $1.10 per 
share, slightly less than analysts' forecasts of $1.11 a share. 

</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan Profits Almost Triple  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With profits almost tripling in the third  
quarter, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. said today it would purchase up to $3 
billion of its stock. J.P. Morgan posted net income of $442 
million, or $2.22 a share, beating analysts' estimates by 7 cents a 
share. The results were far better than the $156 million, or 75 
cents a share, J.P. Morgan earned in the third quarter last year. 
The New York-based commercial and investment bank had a 53 percent 
jump in revenues to $1.99 billion from $1.3 billion in the year-ago 
period. Expenses fell $330 million in the period. 

</P>
<P>
	Citigroup Profits Surge 229 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. reported a 229 percent jump in  
profits for the third quarter as business boomed in its global and 
investment banking units. Citigroup posted net income of $2.4 
billion, or 70 cents a share, beating Wall Street's forecast by 2 
cents a share. The New York-based company had net income of $729 
million, or 20 cents a share in the third quarter last year. 
Revenues totaled $14.57 billion in the quarter, up 33 percent from 
last year.

	Kodak Earnings Up; Job Cuts Coming  
</P>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. said today it sold more  
film at lower prices in the third quarter, driving sales up 6 
percent and profits up 17 percent, but the photography company also 
planned to cut about 1,000 more jobs. Kodak reported profits 
excluding one-time charges of $466 million, or $1.45 per share, up 
from $398 million, or $1.21 a share, in the same quarter a year 
ago. The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.43 a 
share. Kodak announced earlier it was cutting its payroll by 2,000 
to 2,500 jobs. Today it put the number of jobs to be eliminated at 
3,400 and said the positions would come from manufacturing, 
photofinishing, selling, general and administrative ranks. Eastman 
stock was down 5/16 at 70 9/16.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is going back to court to try to  
force a Mustang enthusiast to stop putting confidential company 
information on his Internet site. But the enthusiast, Robert Lane, 
has fired back with a $15 million counterclaim against Ford, 
claiming the company tampered with his site and illegally tried to 
silence him. Ford lost an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge 
Nancy Edmunds in September. The automaker wanted to ban Lane, a 
32-year-old Dearborn nursing student, from using, copying or 
disclosing company information.

<HEADLINE> Asia Leaders Split on Recovery Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Two prominent Southeast Asian leaders praised  
the region today for beating one of the most serious economic 
crises in recent times, even as they clashed over recipes for 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and his Malaysian counterpart,  
Mahathir Mohamad, both spoke at the opening day of the three-day 
East Asia Economic Summit, attended by some 700 top economists and 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuan praised the free-market system and benefits of democracy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Economically, we have no choice but to be more responsive to  
market conditions and trends, especially given today's world of 
rapid globalization,'' Chuan said. He said the Asian nations have 
to ensure that they have competitive economies ``with 
internationally accepted regulatory and supervisory frameworks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mahathir, speaking after Chuan, extolled the virtues of  
capital controls and derided measures of the international 
financial community. While frowned-on by Western economists, 
Malaysia's controversial currency controls helped to lift the 
Southeast Asian nation out of its first recession in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Controls have ``made it possible to secure currency stability,  
to pump-prime the economy without serious negative consequences, 
and to massively cut interest rates -- thus to save the real 
economy,'' Mahathir said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir criticized the guidelines that the IMF has prescribed  
to the affected Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have each taken our own unique paths to the so-called  
'Asian miracle,''' he said. ``There has never been a single 
model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Chuan said the Association of Southeast Asian  
Nations should play a bigger role in noneconomic matters such as 
the crisis in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN nations have traditionally held a strict policy of  
noninterference in one another's domestic political affairs. But 
some countries, such as Thailand and the Philippines, have recently 
called for greater involvement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gunmen opened fire outside a recording  
studio, killing a security guard and wounding two rappers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 people were standing outside the Echo Sound studio just  
after the completion of a rap recording when two gunmen began 
firing at 11:40 p.m. Sunday, investigators said.

	``They fired without provocation,'' Officer Guillermo Campos

<HEADLINE> Ex-Lawmaker Names AP in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A federal judge on Monday agreed to  
dismiss a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times brought by 
former state lawmaker Craig Peterson over a photo mixup by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Peterson has named the AP as the defendant.  
</P>
<P>
	The mixup occurred after an ethics panel released a report in  
February concerning the 2002 Winter Olympics bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The report tied the former administrative officer for the Salt  
Lake City bid committee, also named Craig Peterson, to improper 
payments made to members of the International Olympic Committee and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP transmitted a picture of the former state lawmaker, which  
the Times used to illustrate a story published Feb. 10 about the 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	When Peterson complained about the error, the Times removed the  
photo from its Web page and ran a correction in the next day's 
print edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP learned from Peterson of the misidentification on Feb.  
10, and immediately advised its members the photograph was of the 
wrong Craig Peterson and that it should be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In his complaint against the Times, Peterson had claimed the  
error caused him ``personal humiliation, anxiety, shame, 
mortification and mental anguish and suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had sought unspecified damages exceeding $75,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson's attorney, Roger Hoole, and the Times' attorney, Randy  
Dryer, told U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball that they agreed the 
lawsuit against the newspaper should be dismissed. Kimball then 
signed an order dismissing the Times as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	AP executive editor William Ahearn said Monday the news service  
would have no comment on the amended lawsuit because the AP does 
not discuss pending legal matters.

<HEADLINE> Korean Newspaper Publisher Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The owner and publisher of one of  
South Korea's largest newspapers was indicted today on charges of 
evading millions of dollars in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Hong Seok-hyun has evaded $2.11 million in  
business and inheritance taxes since November 1994 by forging 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, Hong could face at least five years in prison.  
His newspaper, The JoongAng Ilbo, was not implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vienna-based International Press Institute has expressed  
concern that Hong's arrest might be a government attempt to control 
press freedom in South Korea ahead of general elections scheduled 
for April 2000. Hong is vice president of the press institute's 
South Korean chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong's newspaper has an estimated circulation of 1.5 million.  
The newspaper said it was targeted because it supported President 
Kim Dae Jung's main opponent in 1997 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government said the investigation had nothing to do with  
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe began early last month after a three-month government  
tax audit of the Bokwang Group, in which Hong is the largest 
stockholder. The Bokwang Group has four subsidiaries specializing 
in convenience-store chains, TV component manufacturing, 
communications and finance.

<TEXT>
<P>
	RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Nextel Communications Inc., a leading  
wireless telephone company, narrowed its operating loss to $86 
million in the third quarter, edging Wall Street predictions as it 
added more than half a million subscribers, 
</P>
<P>
	But results continued to be hurt by a costly strategy of  
expanding the company's overseas telecommunications network. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel reported Monday that its three-month loss, excluding  
one-time expenses, came to $1.10 per share, slightly less than 
analysts' forecasts of $1.11 a share, according to First 
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared to a loss of $244 million, or $1.56 a share, in  
the third quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating revenue grew to $889 million from $506 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Nextel, based in Reston, Va., cited its growth in subscribers,  
adding 458,000 domestic and 70,000 international subscribers for a 
total of 4.3 million subscribers worldwide in the quarter. It also 
said it taking in more revenue per subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is not expected to make any money for several more  
years. It underwent a management shakeup three months ago with 
president and chief executive Tim Donahue succeeding Daniel 
Akerson. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel has the largest digital wireless network for cellular  
phones, numeric and text paging and two-way radio in the United 
States and serves 92 of the top 100 U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ended Sept. 30, Nextel lost $413 million, or  
$3.78 a share, compared to a loss of $800 million, o $5.04 a share, 
in the year-ago period. Revenue grew to $2.35 billion from $1.26 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel stock rose $1 a share to $75 in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market.

<P>
	The 10th-ranked Crimson Tide already beat Florida. They get a  
chance at No. 5 Tennessee on Saturday and, for the first time in 69 
years, the game is in Tuscaloosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone believed we could beat the big teams,''  
quarterback Andrew Zow said Monday. ``People seemed to think we 
could win nine games this year but they assumed we'd lose to 
Florida and Tennessee. Well, we beat Florida and people are now 
starting to take us seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trick to proving the critics wrong was simply not listening  
to them, coach Mike DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had enough to do with just trying to keep the football team  
focused that we didn't get caught up in all that,'' DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Alabama (5-1, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) plugged away  
at its schedule. There have been three straight wins over ranked 
teams, the first three-game winning streak under DuBose, and 
Alabama cracked the Top Ten for the first time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we feel like we can play with anyone in the  
nation,'' guard Griff Redmill said. ``We have such a high 
confidence level right now, we feel like we can win out or schedule 
and play with anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tide gets a shot at the defending national champions this  
week. The Volunteers (4-1, 2-1) have a four-game winning streak 
over the Tide, their longest winning streak in the series' 81 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The game marks Tennessee's first trip to Bryant-Denny Stadium  
since 1930 and only its fourth ever. Alabama traditionally played 
the Volunteers at Legion Field in Birmingham, but spent more than 
$1 million this winter to move all its SEC games on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The move means Alabama will finally have the home field  
advantage in the series, tailback Shaun Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a whole different atmosphere here, with Bear Bryant  
talking on the Jumbotron and the students all coming to the game,'' 
he said. ``It's going to be a fun game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atmosphere won't be enough against Tennessee, though. For  
Alabama to have a shot at beating Tennessee, the Tide's defense 
will have to get better in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, the Tide has managed to win despite a  
defense ranked last in the SEC. Alabama allows opponents 354.2 
yards a game and is no better stopping the run then it is the pass. 
And, the Tide is ranked dead last in interceptions, with two. 
</P>
<P>
	That led DuBose to shake up his secondary last week, demoting  
strong safety Marcus Spencer -- the team's leading tackler. Tony 
Dixon was moved into Spencer's spot and Reggie Myles switched from 
cornerback into Dixon's old free safety spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup had some success -- Alabama held its opponent under  
300 passing yards for the first time in four games. But it won't be 
good enough against Tennessee, which has finally found an offensive 
groove. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling offensively in games against Florida, Memphis  
and Auburn, the Vols rolled up 458 total yards in a 37-20 win over 
Georgia two weeks ago. Quarterback Tee Martin accounted for 332 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe they're the most talented team in the country,  
and they may be playing as well as any team in the country,'' 
DuBose said. ``I think they are peaking at just the right time, so 
it will be a tremendous challenge and also a tremendous 
opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Social Security Checks May Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 44.2 million Americans getting Social  
Security checks will likely see them grow by more in 2000 than the 
tiny cost-of-living raise they received this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because inflation has picked up speed in recent months,  
with prices rising especially swiftly for products such as gasoline 
and prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to bring that COLA number up,'' said David Wyss,  
chief economist for Standard and Poor's DRI, in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Monthly checks from the government's biggest benefit program are  
adjusted annually to keep rising prices from eroding recipients 
buying power. 
</P>
<P>
	The yearly cost of living adjustments -- known as COLAs -- are  
tied to changes in the government's chief measure of inflation, the 
Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in prices could translate into about a 2.5 percent  
raise in Social Security checks in 2000, analysts say. That would 
be nearly double the 1.3 percent raise -- an average of $10 a month 
for retirees -- beneficiaries got in their checks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to retirement checks, Social Security benefits  
affected include those paid to the disabled and families whose 
breadwinners have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 COLA was scheduled to be announced today, as the  
government released inflation figures for September, the last month 
of the federal fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe the government figures will show that  
prices in September continued an upward swing that has, in recent 
months, ended the lull in inflation that made Social Security's 
1999 cost-of-living raise the smallest in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1998, prices rose at a 1.6 percent annual rate, the  
slowest in 12 years, as falling energy costs helped hold inflation 
down. But so far this year, prices have increased at a 2.6 percent 
annual rate -- an acceleration that has lead a concerned Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say rebounding energy prices are largely to blame.  
Gasoline prices are rising at a 36.7 percent annual rate so far 
this year, and fuel oil, used for heating homes, is rising at a 17 
percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	For the elderly and disabled, rapidly rising prices for medical  
care are also troubling. The cost of prescription drugs, for 
example, which many must pay for out-of-pocket because there is no 
coverage under Medicare, is rising at a 6.6 percent annual rate so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Food and clothing prices, however, have so far remained tame.  
And while overall inflation is worse, it is still moderate compared 
with other periods in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of low inflation, yearly boosts in Social Security  
benefits have been below 3 percent since 1994. In contrast, 
double-digit inflation in the late 1970s drove the cost-of-living 
increase up to 14.3 percent in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Accords, Camrys Big With Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys remained the most  
popular vehicles among thieves last year, but high-end light trucks 
gained ground as popular targets for pilfering, the National 
Insurance Crime Bureau said in its latest list Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Accords and Camrys were followed by the Chevrolet C/K pickup  
truck, Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles, Honda 
Civic, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Ford F-series pickup, Ford Mustang, 
Dodge Caravan and Toyota Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevrolet C/K jumped four spots in the list to third,  
Cherokee/Grand Cherokees five places to fourth, and Ford F-series 
pickups three notches to seventh in rankings mirroring the shifts 
in taste on America's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vehicle thieves follow market trends and target the most  
popular vehicles because they provide the best market for stolen 
vehicle parts,'' the bureau's Ed Sparkman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The list is based on more than 400,000 stolen vehicle reports  
submitted to the nonprofit bureau by its member insurance companies 
nationwide. The figure represents roughly one-third of all vehicles 
reported stolen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau combines theft reports for all model years of a  
particular make and model, unlike a similar annual list issued by 
CCC Information Services Inc. That company, which also tracks 
vehicle thefts for the insurance industry, lists the most-stolen 
vehicles by model year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two lists feature some of the same cars. In February,  
CCC reported that the top three stolen cars in 1998 all were Camrys 
from various years, followed by the 1994 Accord EX, tops among 13 
Accords in that list's top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The lists of most-stolen vehicles usually lag sales trends by  
several years. As a popular model ages and demand for its parts 
rises, it moves up on the theft lists. The high ranking of the Olds 
Cutlass, for example, reflects the car's immense popularity in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying habits in different parts of the country also are  
reflected in theft trends. American vehicles are the top targets of 
thieves in Detroit and Chicago, pickups in Houston and Phoenix. 
Japanese cars lead the list in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the FBI reported Sunday that the estimated 1.2 million  
vehicles reported stolen nationwide last year were 8 percent less 
than the previous year -- and the lowest number since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated total value of vehicles stolen nationwide in 1998  
was nearly $7.5 billion, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NICB, based in Palos Hills, Ill., is supported by more than  
1,000 insurance companies.

	Milosevic Rejects Early Elections  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's  
government today rejected opposition demands for early elections, 
saying rebuilding Yugoslavia after NATO's bombing campaign must 
take first priority. All major opposition parties last week 
demanded early parliamentary and presidential elections by the end 
of this year. In a rare show of unity, they set a series of 
conditions for a free and fair vote, including foreign monitoring 
and freeing of the media, which are under tight government control. 

</P>
<P>
	Russian, Chechen Forces Skirmish  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian and Chechen forces skirmished  
north of Chechnya's capital today as Russian commanders vowed to 
crush Islamic militants in all parts of the breakaway territory. 
The Russian troops are entrenched to the north and west of the 
capital Grozny, and are close enough to shell the city. But the 
Russians have not yet launched a ground attack on the city, and say 
the main aims are to build a security zone around Chechnya, and 
then root out Islamic militants. 

</P>
<P>
	Cyclone Tears Through Eastern India  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A cyclone tore through India's eastern  
state of Orissa today, uprooting trees, toppling huts, snapping 
power and telephone lines and killing 10 people, a news agency 
said. The cyclone, coming from the Bay of Bengal, crossed the coast 
after midnight and caused widespread damage, an official told Press 
Trust of India. Six people were killed in Ganjam district, three in 
Khurda district and one in Puri district, the report said. The 
death toll was expected to rise, it said. 

</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Irene Moves Out to Sea  
</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene raced out to sea today,  
but not before dumping nearly a foot of rain in parts of eastern 
North Carolina and rekindling fears of residents displaced by 
Hurricane Floyd a month ago. North Carolina's third hurricane in 
two months churned through Florida during the weekend and up the 
Southeast coast toward the Carolinas. Late yesterday, it turned 
northeast back to sea. Irene's maximum sustained winds increased to 
105 mph overnight and it accelerated its movement out into the 
Atlantic. Tropical storm warnings were canceled as the storm moved 
away from the coast. 

</P>
<P>
	Calif. Wildfire 50 Percent Contained  
</P>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Dying winds were helping firefighters  
in their battle against a 25,900-acre wildfire in northern 
California that engulfed dozens of homes and forced thousands of 
people to evacuate. Already, the fire in Shasta County was 50 
percent contained, the California Department of Forestry said 
yesterday. Although higher-than-average temperatures and low 
humidity were still expected for the next few days, a decrease in 
the wind will aid firefighters, officials said. 

</P>
<P>
	Pakistanis Move From Indian Border  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistani troops began moving back  
from the Indian border today, making good on a pledge by the 
military regime to thin its forces to ease border tensions, an 
official said. India responded cooly to the gesture, saying the 
move had little military significance. Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who 
deposed the government of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 
last Tuesday, said in his first policy speech yesterday that he was 
ordering the troops back as a ``meaningful confidence-building 
measure'' with the new Indian government. 

</P>

	Habibie Determined To Win Election  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Despite widespread criticism of his  
government, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said today he is 
determined to win this week's presidential election. He also told 
students to stop staging violent, anti-government protests. 
Thousands of students have taken to the streets in a series of 
demonstrations over the past week, protesting everything from 
Habibie's presidential candidacy to Australia's role in the East 
Timor crisis.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose in early trading today,  
but continuing fears of higher interest rates prevented investors 
from snapping up bargains in the broader market. In early trading 
on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.28 at 
10,045.99. Losers on the New York Stock Exchange held a 1,432-989 
lead over gainers. The Nasdaq composite index was down 37.23 at 
2,694.60.

	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer,  
injury-free throughout his football career until this season, will 
be out four to six weeks with a broken ring finger on his right 
hand. Plummer was hurt when he was leveled by blitzing linebacker 
Shawn Barber a minute into the third quarter of the Cardinals' 
24-10 loss to the Washington Redskins last night.

</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Robert Ray Replaces Starr  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Career prosecutor Robert Ray was sworn in  
today to replace Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and wrap up the 
wide-ranging investigation of President Clinton and the first lady. 
One of the appointing judges pleaded with him to act with 
``deliberate speed.'' Ray appeared at the federal courthouse 
shortly after taking the oath as independent counsel, vowing to 
finish the five-year, $40 million-plus investigation in a ``prompt, 
responsible and cost-effective manner.'' The new special prosecutor 
thanked Starr for his personal sacrifice and said his office would 
carry on the investigation with the same professionalism. ``We 
should do our best to be thorough and fair,'' Ray said. 

</P>
<P>
	HCFA Absolves Hospitals of Payments  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has decided to end  
attempts to recover millions of dollars from hospitals it had 
accused of overstating the amount of money the government owed them 
for providing care for the poor. ``It became obvious that confusion 
regarding the issue was pervasive,'' Chris Peacock, a spokesman for 
the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers the 
payments, said today. ``This was the fairest thing to do for these 
hospitals which treat some of the nation's most vulnerable 
patients.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Vetoes Foreign Aid Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today vetoed a $12.6 billion  
foreign aid bill as inadequate and called on Republican 
congressional leaders to join the administration in seeking a 
solution to the budget impasse. ``We need to sit down and do it 
together,'' the president told reporters in the Cabinet Room. He 
said he would sign another emergency spending measure to keep the 
government running beyond Thursday into fiscal 2000, but that it 
should be a short-term measure. ``We have to put politics aside and 
seek common ground,'' Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	Tanzanians Welcome Nyerere Remains  
</P>
<P>
	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania -- The port city known as the ``haven of  
peace'' came to a standstill today as thousands of Tanzanians 
welcomed home the remains of former president Julius Nyerere, the 
father of their nation and independent Africa's spiritual guide. 
Businesses and government offices remained closed as people 
thronged the airport hours before the coffin of the man known to 
all as ``Mwalimu,'' or ``teacher'' in Kiswahli, arrived aboard an 
Air Tanzania jet from London. Nyerere died Oct. 14 in a London 
hospital of complications from leukemia. He was 77. 

</P>
<P>
	Indonesia To Vote on East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Lawmakers vote this week for a new  
president and whether to accept East Timor's overwhelming vote for 
independence -- key steps in Indonesia's difficult transition to 
democracy. The 700-member People's Consultative Assembly decides 
Wednesday who will be Indonesia's leader for the next five years, 
but embattled President B.J. Habibie may not make it that far. His 
political future hinges on a parliamentary vote tomorrow on whether 
to accept a recent ``accountability'' speech about his 
administration's successes and failures. If they don't, Habibie's 
Golkar Party may replace him as its presidential nominee -- a 
last-minute move that could change the vote's outcome. 

</P>
<P>
	First Lady To Decide Next Year  
</P>
<P>
	KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she  
won't make her final decision about running for the Senate from New 
York until sometime next year. The first lady also had kind words 
for former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is battling Al Gore for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. Polls show Bradley running 
stronger in New York than the vice president. And, Mrs. Clinton 
said that while she favors campaign finance reform, she won't 
``unilaterally eliminate any potential fund-raising means'' in her 
quest for the Senate, other than not accepting tobacco money.

	Yankees, Red Sox Play Game 5 Tonight  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The New York Yankees can advance to their second  
straight World Series tonight when Orlando Hernandez faces Kent 
Mercker of the Boston Red Sox in Game 5 of the AL Championship 
Series. Last night's 9-2 win gave New York a 3-1 lead in the series 
and moved them within a win of a record 36th American League 
pennant. Boston must win the next two to give the ball back to 
Pedro Martinez, who stopped the Yankees' 12-game postseason winning 
streak with seven shutout innings in Saturday's 13-1 rout of Roger 
Clemens.

<HEADLINE> Page Rocks Neighbor in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDSOR, England (AP) -- A decorated former military pilot met  
his match when he faced off in court against a neighbor, rock 
guitarist Jimmy Page. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley Burnside, who's retired and lives on a $26,500 military  
pension, said he may have to sell his home to pay Page more than 
$40,000 in legal expenses as ordered by a judge last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Page, 54, a founding member of Led Zeppelin, had refused to  
remove some trees that Burnside claimed blocked out the light and 
caused cracks in cement on his property, The Independent reported 
Monday. The trees have grown 33 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	A court dismissed the former World War II and Korean War pilot's  
claim against Page and ordered him to pay Page's legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I served in bomber command, whose 55,000 casualties are a  
reminder to the postwar generation, of which Mr. Page belongs, of 
the cost of the liberties they now enjoy,'' Burnside told The 
Independent. ``I would have hoped he would have thought of that for 
a moment before he refused our legitimate request to remove his 
trees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone who answered the intercom outside Page's gated property  
said: ``The Burnsides lost the case, and there is obviously good 
reason for that.''

<HEADLINE> Piazza Trying To Play With Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mike Piazza faced a media horde in a hotel  
conference room Monday evening, his left arm dangling helplessly 
under the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for a donor,'' Piazza joked. ``Maybe I could call  
Arnold Schwarzenegger and get his left arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Championship Series has become a war zone for the New  
York Mets catcher, whose left thumb already was hurting after the 
opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Through five games against the Atlanta Braves, Piazza has been  
hit twice with a bat -- backswings by Gerald Williams and Ryan 
Klesko -- and has been on the receiving end of bone-crushing 
collisions at home plate with Bret Boone and Keith Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishaps left Piazza with an aching hand and a deep bruise on  
his left forearm, not to mention the lingering effects of a slight 
concussion. He was forced to leave New York's 4-3, 15-inning 
victory in Game 5 with two innings to go, the pain simply too much 
to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza plans to be back on the field for Game 6 Tuesday night at  
Turner Field. The Braves lead the best-of-7 series 3-2, but the 
Mets have momentum from two straight victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a little better,'' Piazza said after the Mets arrived  
at their downtown hotel. ``I had a good night of sleep. I'm a 
little banged up, but I'll give it all I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza has never gone through a stretch with so many nagging  
injuries. He might switch to a lighter bat to cope with the pain in 
his arm and hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's weird,'' he said. ``I can't explain why I'm so banged up.  
Maybe I've done something wrong. Maybe I need to do a good deed 
like helping an old woman across the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, after Lockhart tried unsuccessfully to bowl over  
Piazza with the tie-breaking run in the top of the 13th, the 
catcher came to bat in the bottom half. But he knew it was time to 
come out after striking out against John Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole arm felt numb,'' Piazza said. ``There was a tingling  
in my fingers and a real hot sensation throughout the arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by Todd Pratt, who walked with the bases loaded  
to force in the tying run in the 15th before Robin Ventura's grand 
slam-single brought home the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt hit the series-winning homer against Arizona in the  
opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Todd is doing such a great job, it's not like the guys are  
saying, `If Mike's not in there, we can't win the game,''' Piazza 
said. ``Everybody knows they can make an impact with this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are starting to take notice of the Mets, who had to win  
the final four games of the regular season just to make the 
playoffs. Now, they've rallied to win two straight games against 
the Braves won the first three. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what happens, I think they can walk around proudly  
anywhere, New York especially,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said 
before his team played Boston in Game 5 of the ALCS on Monday 
night. ``They've shown a lot of heart and lot of grit to win those 
games.''

<HEADLINE> Ruthless Red Sox Tease Fans Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They don't just go quietly. That's not the Boston  
Red Sox way. 
</P>
<P>
	They can't just lose. They must tantalize.  
</P>
<P>
	It would be easier to take if they were pathetic. Instead, they  
are cruel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruthless, even.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite an eighth-inning rally that provided one last tease in a  
season filled with flirtation, the New York Yankees beat Boston 6-1 
Monday night to win the first-ever postseason pairing of the 
longtime rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' Boston catcher Jason Varitek said, ``it would  
hurt if it was the Bad News Bears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox gave New England Pedro Martinez and Nomar  
Garciaparra, 94 wins in the regular season and an exhilarating 
first-round victory over Cleveland that set up a dream matchup with 
the hated Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	And, after falling behind 3-1 in the best-of-7 American League  
Championship Series and spotting New York a four-run lead in what 
would be their final game, the Red Sox mounted one last rally to 
torture their long-suffering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Loading the bases after Jason Varitek's leadoff home run in the  
eighth inning cut the deficit to three, the Red Sox brought the 
chilly Fenway Park crowd to its feet. But Ramiro Mendoza struck out 
pinch-hitter Scott Hatteberg and got Trot Nixon to pop up, then 
pitched a perfect ninth to bring Boston's surprising season to an 
unsurprising end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told these kids in there that I was really proud of them,  
the way they performed all year long. I think they really did a lot 
for this city,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. 
``Unfortunately, it didn't work out for us. So I tip my cap to the 
Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston hasn't won the World Series since selling Babe Ruth to  
New York in 1920. Since then, the Yankee have won 36 AL pennants 
and 24 World Series championships, with a chance at their 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been so long since since the Red Sox won the World Series  
that Ruth's 82-year-old daughter, who threw out the first pitch 
Monday night, was a 1 year-old when her father pitched his first 
team to the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Ruth Stevens came in from Arizona on a chilly night and  
proclaimed herself a Red Sox fan. She said she didn't believe her 
father has put a curse on baseball's unluckiest franchise, but she 
did notice the coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be impossible not to.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, it was Johnny Pesky allegedly holding the ball as St.  
Louis' Enos Slaughter raced around the bases to score the winning 
run. In '78, it was Bucky Dent's popup that reached the screen 
above the Green Monster and gave the Yankees the AL East title. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the slow roller that went through Bill  
Buckner's high-topped ankles in 1986 to help New York's Mets 
emotionally clinch a title they wouldn't actually win until two 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the only bad luck was running into the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
	In a series bound to inflame baseball's fiercest rivalry well  
into the next century, the deeper defending champions merely needed 
to wait for the days Martinez couldn't pitch and take advantage of 
some sloppy Red Sox fielding -- and, yes, an umpire's call or three. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Lowe could only relieve so much, Jose Offerman could only  
bat so many times and Garciaparra's fielding failed at the most 
inopportune time for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, despite a surprising 94-win season and a first-round  
victory over Cleveland, Boston heads into the winter the way it has 
every year since the Babe bounced his baby daughter on his knee: 
Saying ``Wait 'till next year.''

<HEADLINE> `Get Real' a Fine, Forgotten Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blame that Debrah Farentino for the problems  
facing the wonderful ``Get Real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Start with her, anyhow.  
</P>
<P>
	She's beautiful, she's sexy, and the very first moments of Fox's  
new drama ``Get Real'' showed her in a steamy bedroom scene with 
her husband's business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, this was only a fantasy born of desperation:  
Farentino plays Mary Green, a loving wife and mother who was 
fearful that her husband Mitch no longer found her attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was beside the point. The scene raised critics'  
eyebrows (and perhaps some viewers' blood pressure). Then the 
balance of the hour may have struck the audience as flip, cynical 
and self-absorbed. Perhaps most problematic, the series' title was 
put to use by teen-age daughter Meghan, who twice addressed the 
camera and goaded the audience to ``get real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Get real? Well, maybe she's on to something. Either given a bad  
rap or overlooked entirely by most viewers, this series is in real 
trouble: So get with the program. It's time you gave ``Get Real'' a 
second chance. Or, more likely, a first. 
</P>
<P>
	Put simply, ``Get Real'' is one of the season's best new series.  
</P>
<P>
	As evidenced by its skimpy following -- in audience size, it  
ranks 86th out of 137 series -- ``Get Real'' also qualifies as Most 
Unfairly Neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	And for any viewers who were put off by its premiere and never  
returned, or skipped it altogether after its generally lousy 
reviews, ``Get Real'' can boast yet another distinction: Most 
Improved. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pilot episode was fascinating (at least, in my  
opinion), it depicted the Green family as teetering on the verge of 
a collective nervous breakdown. Everyone seemed in a separate 
orbit, headed for collision. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, near the end of the hour, rebellious son Cameron  
wrecked his car. Were his injuries serious? Would he die? At the 
hospital, Meghan turned to the camera and fired a gotcha: ``You 
think we're gonna kill my brother?'' she scoffed, needling the 
audience for caring. ``In the first episode?!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The post-pilot ``Get Real'' has eased the attitude a few notches  
and made the dysfunctional Green family functional. And no one says 
``Get real!'' much anymore, if it all. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains from this not-so-drastic tinkering is what really  
counts: smart scripts, a splendid cast and, from scene to scene, an 
intoxicating visual ebb-and-flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get Real'' is a rare thing indeed: a multi-generational family  
show all ages can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Back after two weeks of baseball, ``Get Real'' airs its fifth  
episode Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty, popular and brainy Meghan (played by Anne Hathaway) will  
be blindsided by a vicious rumor sweeping her school: That her 
decision to skip college is explained by pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron (Eric Christian Olsen), a high school lothario whose  
first love is his skateboard, strikes a deal with his sweet but 
fumbling little brother: Kenny (Jesse Eisenberg) will help him 
regain his skateboard rights on school property. In return, Cameron 
agrees to teach Kenny some courtship techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary worries about Mitch (Jon Tenney), a struggling real-estate  
developer who in recent weeks has lost his partner to a prosperous 
rival and his best friend to a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mary's widowed mother Elizabeth (Christina Pickles) wrestles  
with guilt at her deepening relationship with the first man she has 
dated after losing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Would it be wrong to tip their hand? Well, by hour's end Kenny  
kisses his girl, Cameron resumes flight on his 'board, Elizabeth 
removes her wedding ring, and, with Mary's support, Mitch finds 
fulfilling new work. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a hopeful, feel-good hour, even when it deals with sticky  
dilemmas and bristles with diverse points of view. It plays funny, 
sad, authentic. 
</P>
<P>
	But how much longer?  
</P>
<P>
	A series that was written off from its first week, ``Get Real''  
continues to be tyrannized by its time slot. What a fearsome enemy 
front: ``Drew Carey'' on ABC, NBC's outstanding new ``West Wing,'' 
the WB's much-talked-about new teen drama ``Roswell,'' plus the CBS 
movie and UPN's ``Star Trek: Voyager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that menu of options, how many viewers are likely to  
gravitate to ``Get Real''? This requires an act of will, and now is 
the time: ``Get Real'' is scheduled the next four weeks, through 
Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Do yourself a favor and take a look. Then catch the show you'd  
have watched otherwise as a rerun next winter or spring. Not to 
play the blame game, but without some more viewers real soon, ``Get 
Real'' could be history by then.

<HEADLINE> McCartney Not Looking for Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Paul McCartney says that he's not looking for  
another woman, more than a year after the death of his wife Linda, 
but that he's open to the possibility of a new relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might happen, I don't know, you know, I'm not really  
working at it. I just take things as they come,'' McCartney said in 
an interview broadcast Monday by Independent Television News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Linda would want me to be happy,'' he said. ``We'll  
just see what happens really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda McCartney died of cancer in April 1998. She had married  
the former Beatle in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney said he decided not to throw himself into his music  
immediately after her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just did what came naturally and that involved a lot of  
crying, basically, and a lot of letting it out, wherever I was, 
sometimes a bit embarrassing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a question of how long did she want me to grieve,  
because she was such an upbeat lady I think she would have said, 
'Come on, get on with it now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney recently released a new album, ``Run Devil Run.''

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Profits Surge 229 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. reported a 229 percent jump in  
profits for the third quarter as the nation's largest financial 
company saw business boom in its global and investment banking 
units, which had suffered the most during last year's market 
tumoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup posted net income of $2.4 billion, or 70 cents a  
share, beating Wall Street's forecast by 2 cents a share. The New 
York-based company had net income of $729 million, or 20 cents a 
share in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues totaled $14.57 billion in the quarter, a 33 percent  
increase from $11 billion in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quarter's results were solid, particularly amidst a  
challenging trading environment and significant weather-related 
catastrophes,'' John S. Reed and Sanford I. Weill, chairmen and 
co-chief executive officers, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The global corporate and investment bank division showed a  
strong rebound for the quarter from the loss in the 1998 period 
that resulted from severe global economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global corporate banking income totaled $461 million vs. a  
loss of $2 million in the third quarter period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney, the company's investment bank, reported  
income of $432 million, a complete turnaround from the $396 million 
loss in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Citigroup appears to be delivering on the promised  
synergies of the merger between Citibank and Travelers insurance 
group last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Income from the Citibank's lending operations increased 65  
percent to $604 million. Income from the bank's credit card 
business, one of the largest in country, grew 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, international income grew by about one-third to $270  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead,'' Reed and Weill said, ``we are well-positioned  
to realize the benefits from economic recoveries underway in Japan, 
Latin America and Asia, since 30 percent of our earnings are 
currently generated internationally and our presence in these 
markets continues to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Citigroup earned $7.25  
billion, or $2.07 a share, a 41 percent jump from $5.13 billion, or 
$1.43 a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months, revenues totaled $44.18 billion vs. $37.8  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's stock rose $1 to $43.13 a share in early New York  
Stock Exchange trading today.

<HEADLINE> Virgin To Sell Brit, Irish Cinemas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Richard Branson's Virgin Entertainment Group plans  
to sell its cinema business in Britain and Ireland for $355 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin disclosed Monday it will sell 35 cinemas to France's UGC,  
which is expected to drop the Virgin name and rebrand them under 
its own mark. 
</P>
<P>
	UGC, formerly known as Pathe, is a film distribution company  
owned partly by French industrial conglomerate Vivendi. It operates 
400 movie screens in France, Belgium and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Branson's group paid $322 million when it bought the former MGM  
cinema chain four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale includes a long-term contract for the marketing of  
Virgin Cola within the British cinemas, the company said. Virgin 
will also negotiate to sell its cola through UGC's cinemas in 
Europe -- a project that could be worth ``tens of millions'' of 
dollars for the Virgin group, the British company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cinemas employ around 900 people in the United Kingdom and  
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Money from the sale will go toward Virgin's other entertainment  
businesses, including Megastores, which sell music and videos, and 
its unit for retailing via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Entertainment Group is owned by Virgin Group and a  
minority shareholder, U.S. venture capital firm Texas Pacific 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	British billionaire Branson is perhaps best known for his  
airline Virgin Atlantic and its rivalry with British Airways.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Smith Has Hernia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings running back Robert  
Smith could miss between three and six weeks with a hernia. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith practiced lightly last week, but said he realized early in  
Sunday's 25-23 loss to the Lions that his hernia had not improved. 
He played only in the first quarter against the Lions, gaining 14 
yards on four carries. Leroy Hoard gained 45 yards on 13 carries in 
Smith's place. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Fischer, the team's medical director, said a decision  
on when Smith will undergo surgery was expected to be made today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically took the week off, and it was worse than it was  
last week. And I think if we continue like this, it may even get 
worse before it gets better,'' Smith said. ``So it might just be 
best to get it done now and hope things work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said last week he had been hampered by the hernia since  
the Sept. 26 game at Green Bay and that the injury wasn't diagnosed 
until early last week, when he saw a specialist.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Blackbirds Found Dead in Ill. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASCOUTAH, Ill. (AP) -- Thousands of birds were found dead in a  
farm field, and officials suspect a chemical may have killed them. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department of Natural Resources biologists are running  
tests on some of the birds and should have the results Tuesday, 
department spokesman Joe Khayyat said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of about 2,000 red-winged blackbirds, starlings and  
grackles were found late last week in a farm field with their wings 
to the side and heads pointing into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists at first suspected that a violent downdraft killed  
the birds by slamming them into the ground. But Khayyat said new 
evidence points to possible chemical contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind had been blamed in an earlier incident this summer, when a  
flock of egrets was found dead near Springfield after a strong 
storm.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers To Go to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A 6,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force  
will be sent to Sierra Leone to help implement a peace accord that 
ended the West African country's savage civil war, according to the 
final draft of a U.N. Security Council resolution circulated 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The council is expected to approve the resolution Friday,  
authorizing the peacekeepers to establish a presence at key 
locations across the country to help disarm and demobilize the 
combatants. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft resolution establishes the U.N. Mission in Sierra  
Leone for an initial period of six months to help safeguard the 
fragile peace deal and approves the deployment of the peacekeeping 
force, including 260 military observers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. peacekeepers won't be responsible for maintaining  
security in Sierra Leone. That job will remain with the West 
African-led peacekeeping force that helped end the country's 
eight-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft resolution commends the readiness of the Nigerian-led  
force, known as ECOMOG, to provide security, ensure implementation 
of the July 7 peace agreement and begin disarming the combatants. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. force, which is expected to be lightly armed, may take  
``necessary action'' to ensure security and movement of U.N. 
personnel and to protect civilians under imminent threat of 
violence, the draft resolution says. The document gives the force 
orders including cooperating with the government and rebels in 
implementing the agreement, and monitoring adherence to the 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	During the war, tens of thousands of people were killed by  
rebels from the Revolutionary United Front and their allies. 
Thousands more had their hands, ears or lips hacked off in a 
display of rebel terror and power. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the July 7 agreement, rebel leader Foday Sankoh and Sierra  
Leone's president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, agreed to form a 
power-sharing government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council draft resolution stresses ``the urgent need  
to promote peace and reconciliation and to foster accountability 
and respect for human rights in Sierra Leone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It urges the government to ensure the prompt creation of three  
commissions established under the peace agreement: the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, the Human Rights Commission and the 
Commission for the Consolidation of Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report to the council last month recommending establishment  
of a U.N. peacekeeping force, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
said Sierra Leone desperately needs international assistance to 
prevent further violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft resolution stresses the urgent need for more money to  
finance the peace effort in the country and to provide humanitarian 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Sierra Leone, a Roman Catholic bishop kidnapped  
last week has reportedly been freed along with 15 other people. 
MISNA, the Rome-based Roman Catholic missionary news agency, said 
that Bishop Giorgio Biguzzi and the others, including a priest and 
humanitarian aid workers, were safe and were to head to Freetown on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Biguzzi is the bishop of the central town of Makeni and is a  
well-known figure in Sierra Leone for his humanitarian work during 
the country's eight-year civil war. While the details of what 
happened to the 63-year-old Biguzzi remain unclear, he and the 
others are believed to have been kidnapped on Friday while 
traveling along a northern highway near Makeni.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Defeat Cardinals 24-10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins, awful on defense in  
the first four games, turned terrific Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 24-10 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, who lost  
quarterback Jake Plummer with a broken finger, Redskins rookie 
Champ Bailey intercepted three passes and returned one of them 59 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was time for us to go out there and get some big  
plays,'' Bailey said of the defense. ``All that pressure they put 
up front made it possible for me to make those plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona coach Vince Tobin said Plummer would be out four to six  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, you lose football games in this league, but when you  
start losing your football players, it certainly makes it more 
difficult to bounce back,'' Tobin said, ``and Jake is a big part of 
our football game, as everybody knows. It's going to be a big 
loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a bye last week, Washington hired 72-year-old defensive  
specialist Bill Arnsparger to try to shore up a defense that was 
ranked 31st out of 31 NFL teams, and the Redskins were vastly 
improved against an Arizona offense that has struggled all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's another coach, another good football coach, another set  
of eyes in the press box,'' Washington coach Norv Turner said. ``We 
didn't have the assignment errors or the technique errors we were 
having before the bye week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins (4-1) had the No. 2 offense in the NFL entering the  
game, but quarterback Brad Johnson had a difficult night, throwing 
his first two interceptions of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson finally got the offense going on a 12-play, 90-yard  
drive, putting Washington up 17-3 on a 1-yard touchdown pass to 
tight end Stephen Alexander on third down with 1:20 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to panic just because we didn't put up as many  
points as we'd like to have,'' Johnson said. ``Sometimes things 
don't go your way. The main thing to do is not panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (2-4) went 91 yards in nine plays to cut the lead to  
17-10 on a 10-yard pass from Plummer's backup, Dave Brown, to Rob 
Moore with 6:59 to play. But the Cardinals couldn't move the ball 
on their next possession, and the Redskins put the game away with 
Skip Hicks' 14-yard touchdown run with 2:03 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	With the victory, Washington took a half-game lead over Dallas  
in the NFC East. The Cowboys play the New York Giants on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer's third season went from bad to worse a minute into the  
third quarter on a vicious hit from blitzing linebacker Shawn 
Barber. Plummer's right ring finger stuck in Barber's facemask. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hit was nothing. It was just that my finger was in the  
base of the facemask, way deep in there,'' Plummer said, ``kind of 
a freakish thing. The guy started to get up and I shouted `Hold on! 
hold on!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, injury-free throughout his football career before this  
season, missed most of the preseason with a sprained right thumb, 
an injury that bothered him through the first few weeks of the 
season. Last week, he was knocked out of the Cardinal's 14-3 
victory over the Giants early in the third quarter with a hip 
pointer, but came back for the game's final series. 
</P>
<P>
	The sore hip kept him out of practice nearly all of last week,  
and he was questionable for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer has thrown 15 interceptions and just three touchdown  
passes this season. Before he was hurt Sunday, he was picked off 
twice by Bailey, the Redskins' No. 1 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Cardinals have next weekend off to try to figure out how  
to get things turned around without Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Jake has had a tough year already,'' Tobin said, ``but  
he still was the guy we felt like could do some things for us. He's 
going to be out for an extended period of time, and we've got to 
get the offense on track with the people that we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Jacke's 44-yard field goal, Arizona's first points in the  
first quarter all season, put the Cardinals up 3-0 with 3:15 left 
in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Conway tied it 3-3 with a 36-yard field goal with 7:50 to  
play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington took the lead when Bailey stepped in front of fellow  
rookie David Boston, picked off Plummer's pass and ran untouched 59 
yards for the score to make it 10-3 with 3:33 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	The next time Arizona got the ball, Plummer had a clear field to  
run, but tried instead to throw long to Moore. The pass fell short, 
Bailey picked it off and Plummer was booed as he left the field. 
</P>
<P>
	J.J. McCleskey, starting at cornerback in place of injured Corey  
Chavous, intercepted Johnson's pass to stop the game's opening 
drive. Linebacker Ronald McKinnon intercepted Johnson's pass at the 
Arizona 36 with 4:32 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cardinals' running back Michael Pittman had two strong runs  
for 15 yards early in the game, then left for the night with a 
slight concussion. ... Albert Connell caught eight passes for 110 
yards for the Redskins. ... Washington has an NFC East showdown at 
Dallas next Sunday. ... Arizona managed just 67 yards rushing. ... 
The Redskins' three turnovers doubled their total for the season. 
... The Cardinals had won nine of the previous 12 meetings between 
the two teams. ... As Arizona's offensive line continued to be a 
major weakness, the Cardinals used rookies L.J. Shelton and Yusuf 
Scott together at times.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Hire Matthews From Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers on Monday hired former  
Toronto Blue Jays batting coach Gary Matthews as their minor league

<HEADLINE> Boxer Morrison Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Tommy  
Morrison pleaded innocent today to a variety of drug charges and 
will face trial Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The former WBO champion entered his plea before Judge John  
Lineberger. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison was arrested Sept. 16, less than a week after he was  
placed on probation for a Tulsa, Okla., drunken driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, the boxer was charged with cocaine possession,  
simultaneous possession of drugs and firearms, being a felon in 
possession of a firearm, possession of drug paraphernalia, 
misdemeanor possession of marijuana and driving while intoxicated. 
He also was charged with traffic violations that most likely will 
be handled in another court. 
</P>
<P>
	A charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute was  
dropped last week after prosecutors said they could not prove 
Morrison had any intent to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 10, Morrison received a two-year suspended sentence for  
drunken driving in Oklahoma. Morrison had pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, an Oklahoma jury convicted Morrison of driving under  
the influence and other charges related to a chain-reaction traffic 
accident that injured three people. He was ordered to spend time in 
treatment. He also avoided jail time on charges of drunken driving 
and speeding in Kansas in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison became the WBO's heavyweight champion in 1993 by  
defeating George Foreman. He had 40 knockouts during his career, 
the last in 1996 -- just after testing positive for the AIDS virus.

<HEADLINE> AL Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Babe Ruth spent most of his career with the New  
York Yankees after leaving Boston. His daughter, though, made it 
clear who she prefers -- the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started leaning towards them last year and, this particular  
year, I really have been a true Red Sox fan,'' 82-year-old Julia 
Ruth Stevens said before throwing out the first ball Monday night 
for Game 5 of the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she used to follow the Yankees, but switched  
allegiances to the Red Sox ``because I think that they deserve a 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox have been hurt in the series by two calls made at  
second base by umpires who said later that they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had a lot of tough breaks and the umpires certainly  
haven't made it any easier for them, I must say,'' she said. ``I 
came all the way from Arizona just to see the Red Sox beat the 
Yankees tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A loss would eliminate Boston and, no doubt, be attributed by  
some to ``The Curse of the Bambino,'' her father's nickname. The 
Red Sox last won the World Series in 1918 and they sold Ruth to the 
Yankees before the 1920 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really believe in it,'' she said. ``I know my father  
would never wish anything like that on baseball, and he really 
loved baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mostly, I think it's a myth,'' she said. ``But it is a  
coincidence, definitely, that there's been many, many, many years 
since the Red Sox managed to win a World Series. I think they've 
had a lot of bad luck and I am certainly hoping from here on in 
they have nothing but good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVINE INTERVENTION:* New York manager Joe Torre found out how  
partisan Red Sox fans could be when he went to church with his 
3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were leaving church and she wanted to light candles,''  
Torre said. ``A Red Sox fan came up to me and said, `If one of 
those candles is for a (Yankees) victory, I'm going to blow it 
out.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I never light a candle asking for good things to  
happen like that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won anyway Sunday night, 9-2.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE BREAKS OF THE GAME:* Most of the breaks in the series have  
gone New York's way, and Boston manager Jimy Williams doesn't know 
if they even out in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You create your own breaks,'' he said. ``We made a couple of  
mistakes (Sunday) night. They capitalized. I don't know about 
breaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he took an indirect poke at the bad calls at second base by  
umpires Rick Reed in Game 1 and Tim Tschida in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players decide the game,'' Williams said. ``The pitchers,  
the hitters, everything. Let them decide the game. Not anybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHAKE IT UP, JIMY:* Going by the book, Williams changed his  
lineup for Game 5 by re-inserting lefties Trot Nixon in right field 
and Brian Daubach at designated hitter against Yankees righty 
starter Orlando Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Both played in Boston's 13-1 win in Game 3 when righty Roger  
Clemens started for New York. They went a combined 5-for-8 with 
three doubles, a homer and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday against lefty Andy Pettitte, Williams inserted two  
righty hitters -- Damon Buford replacing Nixon and Butch Huskey 
taking over for Daubach. Buford and Huskey went a combined 3-for-6 
with a double and a stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre also made two changes because the Red Sox started lefty  
Kent Mercker one day after they went with righty Bret Saberhagen. 
Torre replaced designated hitter Darryl Strawberry and left fielder 
Ricky Ledee, who both homered in Game 4, with Chili Davis and Shane 
Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHOOPS:* The Red Sox earned a new line in the postseason record  
book, one they would prefer not to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Their four errors in Game 4 gave them eight for the series,  
tying an LCS record shared by five other teams. The last National 
League team to do it was Atlanta in 1998. Toronto was the last 
American League team to accomplish that dubious feat in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The LCS record for errors in one game is five by the Los Angeles  
Dodgers in Game 3 of 1974 and the Yankees in Game 2 of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra has four errors in the series, one shy of the  
ALCS the record set by another Boston shortstop, Spike Owen, in the 
seven-game series in 1986.

<HEADLINE> GM Won't Pursue Asian Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- General Motors Corp. intends to double its Asian  
market share over the next five years, but does not expect to 
undertake a large-scale, cross-border merger, a top executive said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the U.S. company will strengthen current alliances with  
Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Suzuki Motor Corp., as well as try to 
sell more cars in China, GM president and chief operating officer 
Rick Wagoner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asia Pacific auto market ``has absolutely tremendous growth  
potential,'' Wagoner said, speaking at a news conference ahead of 
this week's Tokyo Motor Show. ``This is the big ball game over the 
next decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner stressed that GM has learned from past mistakes in Asia.  
To boost its market share to 10 percent from the current four 
percent, GM will work harder to get a local perspective on 
individual Asian markets, targeting products accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``A major full-scale acquisition really isn't necessary for us  
to succeed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, GM's partnership with Isuzu, a company in which it holds  
a 49 percent stake, and Suzuki, in which it holds 10 percent, will 
serve as ``major strategic advantages and major pillars for our 
future strategy in this region,'' Wagoner said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is also counting on future development of its activities in  
China, where it already has several joint-ventures with Chinese 
companies, Wagoner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next 20 to 25 years, China could be the biggest auto  
market in the world,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Seinfeld' Co-Creator Does HBO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry David, so misunderstood.  
</P>
<P>
	A funny guy? Sure. ``Seinfeld,'' which he co-created and often  
wrote, proved it. So does ``Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' 
his HBO special premiering Sunday at 10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	But what about the accompanying stigma -- that he's  
mega-neurotic, hypersensitive or simply odd? Where does that kind 
of nonsense get started? 
</P>
<P>
	If a recent interview proves anything, Larry David is in fine  
psychic fettle. For example, even after his triumph with 
``Seinfeld,'' there's no swelled head for him. ``I maybe have just 
a little more confidence in my work now,'' he allows, ``but not 
that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor has his ``Seinfeld'' payday -- a reported $242 million -- made  
a material difference in his world. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do have thoughts occasionally like, 'Holy cow! I have a  
lot of money!''' he admits. ``But it's not like, 'I must be 
great.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 51, David knows exactly who he is: the same as he was a  
long time ago, plus years of experience to seal it. ``I really 
don't think that anything about me has changed since I was, I don't 
know ... 12?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps his biggest life change: the onset of baldness.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I like how I've taken to it,'' he declares with a  
mirthless laugh. ``No toupees. No beard to offset it. I'm quite 
proud of how I've adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I ever did for it was try the Chinese Bald  
Cure. We did an episode about it on the show.'' (That would be 
``Seinfeld'' No. 25, ``The Tape.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``But it actually happened. We asked the guy bringing the  
Chinese food to call China on the phone from my apartment, after we 
tried and couldn't get anybody who spoke English. And the stuff 
came. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worked great.''  
</P>
<P>
	Consider that last remark an exercise of comic license. And  
expect more on ``Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' David's first brush with 
TV since the May 1998 ``Seinfeld'' finale, this is a very funny 
special about Larry David putting together a Larry David special. 
</P>
<P>
	During ``Curb,'' he kvetches to his manager, frets to his wife,  
stews during meetings at HBO, and wonders why he said OK to cameras 
stalking him to get it all. 
</P>
<P>
	On the program, David is a hybrid form of volatile  
impassiveness, someone capable of juggling stubbornness with 
cautious indecision. Meanwhile, as any ``Seinfeld'' fan would 
expect, he has a tendency to deconstruct life's every passing 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	After waiting for his manager to get off the phone, David lodges  
a complaint about the office-greeting policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know I'm in the room, how come you don't pick up your head  
and say, 'One second?''' David asks. ``All you have to do is: `One 
second.''' His right hand cradles an invisible receiver. ``When I'm 
on the phone, I go, `One second.' Or you don't have to SAY `One 
second,' just --'' he hoists the index finger of his other hand -- 
``like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beside such telling glimpses, this ``mockumentary'' includes  
insights from David's friends, Jason Alexander, Richard Lewis and, 
of course, Jerry Seinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of all, it captures him doing stand up for the first time  
in 9 1/2 years (who knew!), seen in snatches from club dates he books 
to steel himself for his big HBO concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who do you think has more freedom -- the married men in America  
or the single men in Communist China?'' he asks the room. ``I gotta 
go for the single guy in Communist China, no contest. I'm a married 
guy in America. I can leave the country -- but I can't leave my 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was David's real-life itch to get back onstage that led to  
this ``Curb Your Enthusiasm'' spoof: Somebody suggested he should 
film his practice sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very reluctantly said, `Oh ... OK,''' recalls David, sipping  
his nonfat decaf cappuccino. ``That's exactly the way I make up my 
mind to do anything: a reluctant OK. I never go, 'Yeah! Great idea! 
Let's do it!' Never. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I thought, `Well, maybe this needs some narrative around  
the stand up.' It became more and more of a comedy film, and less 
and less of a stand-up film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David says he made seven or eight unannounced appearances at  
clubs in Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And how did it feel? ``I was as anxious as I was 10 years ago.''  
</P>
<P>
	So why did he want to go back? Among comedy cognoscenti, David  
is as well-known for his hatred of stand up as for his mastery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated it and loved it, all at the same time,'' he explains.  
``When it goes badly, you have one of two attitudes: either, `Well, 
everyone is stupid, but I'm great,' or, 'People are really smart 
and I stink, I have no talent, what am I doing?' 
</P>
<P>
	``But when it goes well, everyone is brilliant and I'm the  
greatest thing on the planet!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words: David doesn't hesitate to assume that the  
consensus of everyone on Earth is reflected by 100 people in a 
comedy club. ``They're a very representative group,'' he insists. 
``A scientific sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The funny thing is, he's got proof.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Earnings Down 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. said Monday that, as  
expected, its third-quarter profit fell 11 percent due to lower 
productivity from its reorganized sales force and pricing pressures 
from competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The office machine manufacturer also said the factors that  
depressed its results are expected to continue into the fourth 
quarter and the first half of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the just-ended quarter fell to $339 million, or  
47 cents per share, compared with earnings of $381 million, or 53 
cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, which the company had forecast Oct. 8, came on  
revenues of $4.63 billion, essentially unchanged from third-quarter 
revenues of $4.61 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the lowered expectations of Wall Street  
analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Xerox stock 
was off $3.62 1/2 at $23.81 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock had plunged 25 percent after the company  
warned that its earnings would be disappointing. Before that 
announcement, analysts expected Xerox to earn 58 cents a share for 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox said weakness in a joint venture with Fuji and the  
economic decline in Brazil also hurt its results. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results are totally unacceptable. Our shareholders have  
a right to expect better execution at a time when the competitive 
environment has intensified,'' president and chief executive 
officer Rick Thoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman said he is confident that the company's strategy to  
broaden its distribution channels and expand its product and 
services mix will eventually accelerate revenue and earnings 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales force reorganization, which continues to pressure  
earnings, will also eventually foster growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced earlier this year it was reorganizing its  
14,000-person sales force to boost sales of ``bundled'' services to 
corporate customers -- integrating fax machines, printers, copiers 
and personal computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it planned to move its sales force away from  
geographical coverage toward coverage of specific industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue growth slowed to 6 percent in the United States and 3  
percent in Europe, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, 
increasing competition and pricing pressures, and lower sales 
productivity associated with the realignment to an industry 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``While realizing the benefits of our strategic direction is  
taking longer than anticipated, the positive effects of these 
changes should be reflected in stronger results towards the end of 
next year,'' Thoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Xerox reported earnings  
of $1.13 billion, or $1.55 per share. That compares with a loss of 
$219 million, or 39 cents per share, in the same period a year ago, 
when the company posted a restructuring charge of $1.11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from continuing operations in the first nine months  
increased 5 percent to $1.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the first nine months rose 1 percent to $13.79  
billion, compared with $13.65 billion in the first three quarters 
of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Scalping Follies at Fenway Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Melrose man faces charges after he was busted  
scalping tickets to the New York Yankees-Boston Red Sox playoff 
game. So does the man who tried to bust him. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a man tried to steal the tickets from a scalper by  
posing as a Boston police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged scalper, attorney Paul Beaulieu of Melrose, was  
asking $500 for two tickets to Sunday night's Game 4 of the 
American League Championship Series, said Sgt. Detective Margot 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Roballo, 21, approached Beaulieu about 8 p.m. two blocks  
from Fenway Park, and flashed fake identification, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Roballo allegedly told Beaulieu, 37, that he and his friend were  
police officers, then grabbed Beaulieu by the arm and attempted to 
drag him down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	But real members of the Boston Police Department were watching  
the exchange, and arrested both Roballo and Beaulieu, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roballo faces charges of unarmed robbery and impersonating a  
police officer, and Beaulieu will be charged with scalping, said 
police spokesman Kevin Jones. They were scheduled to be arraigned 
today in Roxbury District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said 12 people were arrested trying to scalp tickets to  
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are trying everything in their desperation for  
tickets,'' Hill said.

<HEADLINE> Eastman Chemical To Cut Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSPORT, Tenn. (AP) -- Eastman Chemical Co. will eliminate  
1,200 of its 16,000 jobs, or about 7.5 percent of the work force, 
as part of a plan to reduce expenses by $200 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemical industry has undergone fundamental changes in  
recent years, making it imperative that we immediately take further 
steps to improve our financial performance and better position our 
company for growth,'' Earnest W. Deavenport Jr., chairman and chief 
executive, said Monday in announcing the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it expects to save about $100 million by  
reducing employment and another $100 million by cutting capital 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	It said termination packages will be offered to employees in the  
United States who are eligible for full retirement benefits by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company anticipates that if it does not achieve the  
necessary reduction in labor costs, involuntary separations will 
follow before the end of the year,'' Eastman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the cuts would affect mostly managerial and  
professional employees and their support groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman has traded at over $62 a share in the past year, but  
closed Friday at $38.12 1/2 per share, barely above its low for the 
year on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman makes plastics, chemicals and fibers. The company  
employs 9,400 people at its Kingsport headquarters and 16,000 
people overall in 30 countries. It had 1998 sales of $4.48 billion.

<HEADLINE> CAW: GM Nixes Outsourcing Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers reported progress  
Monday in talks with General Motors Corp., saying GM had withdrawn 
a proposal to contract out hundreds of jobs at five plants. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW President Buzz Hargrove said while there were still several  
major disputes, he did feel ``some measure of optimism.'' The union 
has set a strike deadline of midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had said the CAW's 22,000 GM workers were ready to  
strike over GM's plans to shift between 700 and 1,300 jobs from its 
own factories to outside suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased to report that GM has made a decision that the  
outsourcing demand they had on the union was not attainable,'' 
Hargrove said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had said the CAW would not accept any outsourcing at a  
time when more than 1,500 workers are on layoff from GM's Canadian 
plants. He also said the company had separated the outsourcing 
proposal from an offer to invest $1 billion (Canadian) in two 
plants in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the largest remaining dispute was the future of  
the St. Therese, Ontario, plant. GM has said it will cease Camaro 
and Firebird production at St. Therese in September 2002, and no 
products are scheduled to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is willing to consider modular assembly proposals for  
St. Therese as part of a plan to keep the plant open, Hargrove has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to keep this factory building cars, trucks and  
minivans,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	A CAW contract with GM is expected to closely model agreements  
already reached with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. Those 
call for a 3 percent wage increase in each year of a three-year 
package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an improved retirement 
package and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Camaro and Firebird, GM assembles the  
Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo, the Buick Regal and some 
full-size pickups in Canada. Canadian plants also build engines and 
transmissions for other GM plants. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's Oshawa, Ontario,  
assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Illness Kills Long Island Lobsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A mysterious illness is killing tens of  
thousands of lobsters in Long Island Sound, alarming lobstermen and 
conservation officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The die-off is the Sound's worst in nearly a decade, officials  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About eight of every 100 lobsters caught are coming up dead,  
said Byron H. Young of the state Department of Environmental 
Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests on blood taken from the lobsters have not pinpointed the  
cause. Water quality tests have ruled out pollution and low oxygen 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has 900 commercially licensed lobstermen. New York was  
the nation's No. 3 lobster producer in 1998, behind Maine and 
Massachusetts, with 8.5 million pounds of lobsters worth nearly $30 
million. The fall harvest normally accounts for half of the annual 
income for lobstermen. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of illnesses from eating lobsters  
since fishermen first reported the die-off about six weeks ago. 
Boiling the lobsters will kill any microbes, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, thousands of lobsters died in the waters off Maine,  
the nation's top producer. Scientists there have not pinpointed the 
cause.

<HEADLINE> German, French, UK Space Cos. Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The French and German companies that  
are forming a European challenger to U.S. aerospace giants 
established a link with a British partner Monday in announcing 
plans to create Europe's largest space-technology business. 
</P>
<P>
	Marconi Electronic Systems in Britain plans to join with  
DaimlerChrysler's DASA unit and France's Aerospatiale Matra in the 
joint venture to be called Astrium. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Astrium effectively would become Europe's main  
space-technology company, similar to the role of Airbus Industrie 
plays as Europe's maker of jet airliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect to begin the venture in early 2000, pending  
regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for the space venture follow last week's announcement by  
DASA and Aerospatiale Matra that they would form a company that 
will be known as European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co., or 
EADS. 
</P>
<P>
	While EADS would offer a broad range of products from  
helicopters to rockets, Astrium will focus on Europe's Ariane space 
program, satellite observation of the earth, telecommunications, 
science and launchers. 
</P>
<P>
	EADS will hold 75 percent of Astrium's shares. British  
Aerospace, which is acquiring Marconi Electronic Systems from 
General Electric Company PLC of Britain, will hold the rest, said 
DASA spokesman Rainer Ohler. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohler stressed that the deal links Britain with EADS, which is  
being formed to become a better European competitor to U.S. 
aerospace powers Boeing and Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the bridge to Britain,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But analysts played down the significance of the Astrium deal in  
terms of cooperation between British, French and German aerospace 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture was long in the works and does ``not in itself''  
suggest any deeper involvement by British Aerospace with the French 
or Germans, said Andrew Clifton, London-based aerospace and defense 
analyst for Merrill Lynch International. 
</P>
<P>
	He said potential cost savings were unknown, but that pooling  
resources should benefit research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	With 8,000 people and annual sales of $2.5 billion, the Astrium  
venture will be one of the world's leading space companies, DASA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	DASA said Alenia Spazio of Italy was also expected to join  
Astrium in several months.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Lower; Dow Down 8.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as continuing  
fears of higher interest rates prevented investors from any serious 
bargain-hunting following last week's big drop. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 8.87 at 10,028.58. The Dow was moving between gains 
and losses, dipping repeatedly below 10,000. Earlier today, the Dow 
was up as much as 108 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 8.88 at 1,238.53, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was off 82.90 at 2,648.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts had expected investors to seek out buying  
opportunities in the battered market today. Last week, the Dow fell 
630.05, or 5.9 percent, in its worst performance in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the factors that drove stocks lower last week  
haven't been resolved. Investors continue to await the latest 
indications of whether inflation is increasing and giving the 
Federal Reserve another reason to raise interest rates for the 
third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Consumer Price Index will provide the next gauge  
of inflation pressures, and analysts expect trading to remain light 
until that report is released. 
</P>
<P>
	News of strong profit growth lifted several Dow stocks today.  
Citigroup rose 1/2 to 43 after reporting a 229 percent jump in 
profits for the third quarter. The nation's largest financial 
company earned $2.4 billion, or 70 cents a share, beating Wall 
Street's forecast by 2 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan rose 4 3/4 to 111 1/4 after saying its third-quarter  
profits nearly tripled. The brokerage earned $2.22 per share, 
beating analysts' estimates by 7 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe widespread strength in corporate earnings could  
be the catalyst that snaps the market's recent decline. The 
companies that comprise the S&AMP;P 500 are expected to post average 
profit growth of at least 19 percent from last year's third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But corporate earnings could be threatened if interest rates  
continue to rise. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, 
making it more costly to finance growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead, lingering interest rate concerns may offset the  
solid earnings outlook for this year,'' said John H. Shaughnessy, 
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies reported weaker-than-expected earnings, and  
investors reacted by selling off their stocks. Xerox fell 4 1/16 to 
23 3/8 after saying its third-quarter profit fell 11 percent from the 
same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $339 million, or 47 cents per share, matching  
analysts' predictions that had been lowered earlier this month, 
after Xerox first indicated its profits would fall short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the Nasdaq's weakness stemmed from the fact that it  
fell less steeply than the Dow last week. At the close of trading 
on Friday, the Nasdaq was still up 24.6 percent so far this year, 
while the Dow was up just 9.1 percent, well off its 16 percent 
return in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses in the technology-dominated Nasdaq were broad-based, with  
Intel off 2 7/8 at 68, and eBay down 7 7/8 at 126 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pressure on stocks, long-term interest rates on  
bonds are holding at their highest levels since October 1997. 
Today, the 30-year Treasury bond offered a yield of 6.30 percent, 
high enough to attract some investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 622.97 million 
shares, well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.01 to 407.69.

<HEADLINE> Zhirinovsky's New Bloc Registers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Days after Vladimir Zhirinovsky's party was barred  
from running in December parliamentary elections, Russia's most 
flamboyant lawmaker formed a new group that qualified Monday for 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Zhirinovsky Bloc, with 84 candidates on its party list,  
is made up of the Russian Union of Free Youth, closely connected to 
Zhirinovsky, and the Party of Russian Spiritual Revival, led by his 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger was drawn up after the commission banned his Liberal  
Democratic Party from running because two of its top three 
candidates violated election rules. Under Russian law, if even one 
of the top three candidates is removed from the candidate list, the 
party cannot run. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing an Oct. 24 registration deadline, Zhirinovsky quickly  
convened a congress of the two political movements and had them 
form the new bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Electoral Commission accepted the bloc on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Zhirinovsky, who has doused fellow parliamentarians with water,  
punched another lawmaker and called for Alaska's return to Russia, 
is known for his outrageous statements and wild behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	His party is currently the third-largest faction in the  
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, with 50 of the 450 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zhirinovsky's party has consistently backed President Boris  
Yeltsin on key votes in parliament, alienating some supporters. The 
party has not fared well in recent opinion polls.

	Great Wall Asset Management Corp., with $1.2 billion in capital,  
is to take over bad loans from the Agricultural Bank of China, one 
of four main state banks, the China Securities News said. 
</P>
<P>
	China is trying to revitalize state banks that are regarded as  
insolvent by international standards. They have tens of billions of 
dollars in loans outstanding to failing state companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Wall will try to turn around delinquent debts through  
corporate restructuring, asset exchanges and debt-for-equity swaps, 
agency president Wang Xingyi was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency started operation Monday, according to the Securities  
News. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports did specify the size of the Agricultural Bank's bad  
loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad-debt clearing agencies already have been set up for the Bank  
of China and the Construction Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of China says its bad loans total $16 billion. Construction  
Bank's clearing agency says it expects to handle some $25 billion 
in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The first agency, set up in August, has restructured some $3.5  
billion in loans, swapping them for shares in six state-owned 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials say such swaps are to be a key feature of  
efforts to reform state industry.

<HEADLINE> 7th Case E. coli Bacteria Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- An outbreak of E. coli has sickened seven  
people, and unpasteurized apple cider is suspected of causing six 
of the illnesses, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Five children, ages 2 through 11, fell ill last week, and two  
cases have since been confirmed, said Dr. Mike Crutcher, state 
epidemiologist with the Oklahoma Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
	One adult and five children apparently got sick drinking  
unpastuerized apple cider from Livesay Orchards in Wagoner County, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities are unsure how a 13-year-old girl became sick.  
She remained hospitalized Monday in fair condition. Three other 
children were also hospitalized, one in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other children are believe to have contracted the bacteria  
but it hasn't been confirmed, Crutcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly on the alert and looking for others,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also warned northeastern Oklahoma residents not to drink the  
unpasteurized cider from Livesay Orchards in Porter. The cider was 
only marketed in the Tulsa area and sold in half-gallon and 
one-gallon containers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still may be more cases, but it doesn't look like it's a  
huge outbreak,'' Crutcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of E. coli typically appear a few days after exposure.  
They include watery diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, low-grade 
fevers and blood in the stool. Crutcher said anyone who has 
consumed the cider and has such symptoms should contact a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Livesay, co-owner of Livesay Orchards, said last week that  
the outbreak is the first suspicion of any problem in nearly 20 
years of making cider.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys, Giants Set for Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Troy Aikman doesn't want to hear  
anything about the New York Giants being in turmoil. The Dallas 
Cowboys quarterback has already heard it all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants' offense is struggling, quarterbacks are playing  
musical chairs, their defense is miffed that it has worked so hard 
for nothing and the team is heading toward a second straight 
disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Put it all together and the Cowboys (3-1) should have no problem  
handing the Giants (2-3) another Monday night mauling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be willing to bet Philadelphia was a little divided  
last week, too,'' Aikman said sarcastically as he reminded everyone 
that the then-winless Eagles overcame their problems to beat Dallas 
13-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you don't like to see any team divided,'' Aikman  
said. ``I have been in those situations earlier in my career, and 
it is very frustrating. But I don't think that that necessarily 
means that they are not going to go out and play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys have their own problems to worry about. They will be  
without receiver Michael Irvin for an undetermined period because 
of a neck and spine injury sustained in last week's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Mills and Wane McGarity will replace him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in the guys that are going in and playing,  
but at the same time, any time you lose a player of Michael's 
stature, you lose something off your football team,'' Cowboys coach 
Chan Gailey said. ``It will have an impact. How much of an impact 
remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants are a troubled team coming into the game. The offense  
has struggled since opening weekend, and that's taking a toll on 
the defense, which has played well enough to win four games. 
</P>
<P>
	After last week's 14-3 loss at Arizona, the defenders were so  
angry that coach Jim Fassel came close to having a civil war in his 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooler heads prevailed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about the team,'' said center Brian Williams, who  
is expected to return to the lineup after missing the Cardinals 
game with a hand injury. ``We got a lot of things out in the open 
earlier on. We know what we have to do, but obviously we have to go 
out and execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Kent Graham, who missed the Arizona game with a  
concussion, will return to the starting lineup. Kerry Collins 
struggled in his start last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead hasn't noticed any outward  
changes in the offense this week. It has always been an emotionless 
group, and the rift with the defense didn't change that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all got to wait and see,'' Armstead said. ``I don't know  
what will happen. I don't know if the gun is going to shoot forward 
or shoot back. Too much attention can help you or hurt you. It 
might make a guy realize that the spotlight is on, and if it's on 
you, you can't hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants have never beaten Dallas in six Monday night games.  
The Cowboys won 31-7 last year to keep the record perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I start worrying about that stuff, it will make me  
nervous,'' Fassel said. ``The bottom line is it's prime time, and 
we have to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmitt Smith of Dallas comes into the game leading the NFC in  
rushing with 409 yards. Giants receiver Amani Toomer is tied for 
the conference lead with 29 receptions.

<HEADLINE> Page Rocks Neighbor in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDSOR, England (AP) -- A decorated former military pilot met  
his match when he faced off in court against a neighbor, rock 
guitarist Jimmy Page. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley Burnside, who's retired and lives on a $26,500 military  
pension, said he may have to sell his home to pay Page more than 
$40,000 in legal expenses as ordered by a judge last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Page, 54, a founding member of Led Zeppelin, had refused to  
remove some trees that Burnside claimed blocked out the light and 
caused cracks in cement on his property, The Independent reported 
Monday. The trees have grown 33 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	A court dismissed the former World War II and Korean War pilot's  
claim against Page and ordered him to pay Page's legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I served in bomber command, whose 55,000 casualties are a  
reminder to the postwar generation, of which Mr. Page belongs, of 
the cost of the liberties they now enjoy,'' Burnside told The 
Independent. ``I would have hoped he would have thought of that for 
a moment before he refused our legitimate request to remove his 
trees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someone who answered the intercom outside Page's gated property  
said: ``The Burnsides lost the case, and there is obviously good 
reason for that.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Budget Demands in NJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- With the budget battle coming to a head,  
President Clinton renewed his demand for increasing the nation's 
investment in education and a shoring up the retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who vetoed a $792 billion Republican tax cut bill in  
September, said federal budget-writers also must take advantage of 
good economic times to pay down the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question before America ... is, `Where are we going  
now?''' Clinton told a group gathered for a $500,000 fund-raising 
dinner for state assembly Democrats. ``This is the chance of a 
lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also suggested tougher steps against crime and  
greater investment in the inner cities and rural areas that have 
yet to share in the booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do something now, ... we will never get around to  
it,'' he said. ``Now is the time to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke the night before he was to meet with Republican  
leaders at the White House. Before dinner Monday, Clinton told 
reporters he hoped bitter partisanship can be left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to reach out a hand of friendship and hope that  
we can work together,'' the president said upon arriving in Newark, 
N.J., for a fund-raiser to benefit state democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	He lamented the growing divide between his administration and  
Republicans on Capitol Hill, and said he found it ``almost 
inexplicable'' that some act as if good economic times allowed them 
the ``luxury of indulging in division and diversion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he criticized the GOP for its opposition to a  
prescription-drug benefit for Medicare recipients, full funding for 
his program to hire 100,000 new teachers and expansion of the 
Family and Medical Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted he vetoed a foreign aid bill Monday because it didn't  
meet U.S. obligations to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's White House meeting, Clinton and the congressional  
GOP leaders were seeking a route through the budget impasse on 
eight of the 13 government operations spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	A stopgap measure that has kept federal agencies functioning  
since fiscal 2000 began on Oct. 1 expires Thursday. Clinton said 
earlier he would sign a short-term extension.

<HEADLINE> European Space Companies Link Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The companies behind a big  
German-French aerospace merger designed to challenge the U.S. 
industry have launched a space technology venture with a British 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Marconi Electronic Systems plans to join the German aerospace  
unit of DaimlerChrysler and France's Aerospatiale Matra to form 
Europe's largest space company, to be named Astrium, according to 
an announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way joint venture follows last week's merger by the  
DaimlerChrysler unit, known as DASA, and Aerospatiale in a bid to 
bolster their position against U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	While that fusion involves a broad product range from  
helicopters to rockets, Astrium will focus on Europe's Ariane space 
program, earth observation, telecommunications, science, launchers 
and orbital infrastructure 
</P>
<P>
	A DASA spokesman said the deal links Britain to the continent's  
emerging German-French group, to be called European Aeronautic, 
Defense and Space Co. or EADS. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the bridge to Britain,'' spokesman Rainer Ohler said.  
</P>
<P>
	EADS will hold 75 percent of Astrium's shares. British  
Aerospace, which is acquiring Marconi Electronics Systems from 
General Electric Co. PLC of Britain, will hold the rest, Ohler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Astrium effectively would become Europe's main  
space-commerce concern, similar to Airbus Industrie's role as 
Europe's maker of jet airliners. It is expected to be the main 
player in Ariane activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture was long in the works and does ``not in itself''  
suggest any deeper involvement by British Aerospace with the French 
or Germans, said Andrew Clifton, London-based aerospace and defense 
analyst for Merrill Lynch International. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting for this to happen for some time,'' said  
William Macke, aerospace and aviation analyst in London at Credit 
Lyonnais Securities Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He said potential cost savings are unknown, but that the pooling  
of resources should benefit research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Astrium should begin operations in early 2000, after approval  
from European Union antitrust authorities, the DASA statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	With 8,000 people and annual sales of $2.4 billion, the Astrium  
venture will be one of the world's leading space companies, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Alenia Spazio of Italy, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, is  
expected to join Astrium within several months

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Awaits Formula One Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Mika Hakkinen is the Formula One champion for the  
second straight year -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
	But auto racing's governing body could wipe that out in Paris on  
Friday. The organization will rule on an appeal by Ferrari of the 
decision that gave the title to the McLaren driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen was awarded the Malaysian Grand Prix and the title when  
two Ferrari drivers were disqualified hours after Sunday's race. 
But he is not happy about winning under such circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won the race fair and square on the track,'' the Finnish  
driver told the London Evening Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Dennis, the head of McLaren, agrees with his driver even  
though his team stands to win the constructors title if the 
International Automobile Federation upholds the disqualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the way to win a championship, '' Dennis said.  
``It is bad for the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Irvine, battling Hakkinen for the title, won the race, and  
two-time series champion Michael Schumacher was second in the other 
Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	But a side deflector panel was found to violate regulations by a  
fraction of an inch. The immediate result was a 12-point advantage 
for Hakkinen, who finished third on the track, an insurmountable 
margin with only the Japanese Grand Prix remaining on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari general manager Jean Todt offered to resign Monday, but  
Ferrari rejected the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the blame completely,'' Todt said, conceding the panels  
were irregular but ``did not give us any advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We maintain that the punishment -- double disqualification --  
does not fit the crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Todt was baffled by the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``This car has been scrutinized every day here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen needed to win the Malaysian GP -- with Irvine fifth or  
worse -- to retain the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Ferrari victory stood, Irvine would be leading Hakkinen  
70-66. As of now, Hakkinen has clinched the title, 72-60, with a 
victory worth 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Schumacher's manager, Willi Weber, said he was sure  
Ferrari did not knowingly break any rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ferrari is a team that never had any infractions before,'' he  
said. ``Perhaps the manufacturer of this part made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA's appeals court is made up of 15 judges from around the  
world, and at least three are needed to hear a case. The judges are 
experienced lawyers or judges with auto racing backgrounds and no 
longer involved in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari said it will contend that the infraction did not give  
drivers an advantage, and the same deflector panel had been used at 
previous races without being ruled illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Irvine or Schumacher has been  
punished by FIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was suspended from three races in 1995 after causing a  
crash in the Brazilian GP. Schumacher got a two-race suspension for 
infractions during the British GP. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Schumacher, then with Benetton, was disqualified from  
the Belgian Grand Prix on a technical violation when a wooden board 
underneath the car was judged too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher broke his leg at the British Grand Prix on July 11,  
and Sunday's race marked his return to racing.

<HEADLINE> World Markets Sag on Wall St. Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as the  
stock market sought direction after last week's big decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 56.67 at 10,076.38 in  
the first hour of trading, while other major market indicators 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets were down. In London, the Financial Times-Stock  
Exchange 100 index was down 0.95 percent, while the DAX index in 
Frankfurt was down 1.19 percent and the CAC index in Paris was off 
0.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian stock markets were broadly lower. In Tokyo, the benchmark  
225 issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in New York last week ``has certainly been the single  
biggest factor driving the market at the moment,'' said Toshihiko 
Matsuno, deputy manager of the investment advisory office at 
Tokyo's Yamatane Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 630.05 points, or 5.9 percent, to close Friday at  
10,019.71, largely on fear that emerging signs of inflation will 
force the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the 
third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Dow's worst week ever in terms of points lost, and  
the worst of the decade in terms of percentage. On Friday alone, 
the average lost 266.90 points, or 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall Friday was precipitated by comments late Thursday from  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who expressed concern 
about the stability of U.S. stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares were also hit by the announcement Friday that U.S.  
wholesale prices had risen 1.1 percent in September -- far above the 
market estimate of 0.5 percent. That raised fears of inflation in 
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian State Files Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Brazilian state of Goias filed a lawsuit Monday  
against more than a dozen U.S. tobacco companies, seeking billions 
of dollars on behalf of sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, alleges  
the tobacco companies concealed the dangers of smoking and the 
addictive nature of nicotine. It names 20 defendants, including 
Philip Morris Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven C. Marks, attorney for Goias, said discussions with  
Philip Morris representatives had been ``a miserable failure, and 
they have left us with no choice but to proceed with litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Latin American nations have filed lawsuits in U.S.  
courts against the tobacco industry. In May 1998, Guatemala became 
the first country to sue U.S. cigarette makers. Bolivia, Nicaragua 
and Panama have since followed. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Venezuela sued to recover billions for treating sick  
smokers. Marks also represents Venezuela in that suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian state of Rio initiated a suit in July, now pending  
in a Texas court. Last year, Brazil's Health Minister Jose Serra 
met with U.S. lawyers to discuss a possible lawsuit filed by 
Brazil's federal government, but no action has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Lindon, associate general counsel for Philip Morris,  
said he could not comment on the specifics of the Goias case 
because his company has not been served with the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is a copycat of the Rio suit, then we think it ignores  
many significant rulings over the past two years of the appellate 
courts,'' Lindon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rulings, Lindon said, have found that third party claims  
should be dismissed on grounds of remoteness or lack of direct 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Glueck, another lawyer for Goias, said the case was filed  
in Miami because it is considered the gateway to Latin America. 
Additionally, one of the defendants, the Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc., 
is based in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Vermeil Says Rams Are No Fluke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The unbeaten St. Louis Rams meet or exceed the  
profile of a playoff team, and coach Dick Vermeil has the numbers 
to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of weekly statistical goals and objectives covers nearly  
an entire wall of a second-floor meeting room at Rams Park, with 
goals achieved highlighted in yellow. Right now, the board is 
glowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for the season goals, based on the production of  
the winning team in every game last year. The most glaring is their 
average score of 36-12; playoff teams last season won 24-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I study playoff teams; I know what their numbers are,''  
Vermeil said Monday, a day after the Rams exceeded last year's 
victory total with a 41-13 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. ``Our 
profile right now is equivalent to a very fine playoff team. 
Players tease me about this once in a while when I get going, but 
it does define things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a few Vermeil-generated numbers to crunch:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Playoff teams won nine of 12 season openers last year, and the  
Rams beat Baltimore 27-10 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Playoff teams were 7-1 at home, and thus far the Rams are 3-0.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Playoff teams convert turnovers to touchdowns, and the Rams  
entered last weekend second in the NFL in that category. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got it broken down a ton of different ways and it's very,  
very accurate,'' Vermeil said. ``Right now, we're exceeding all 
that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics would say the Rams' startling success is largely a  
product of their schedule, the third-easiest in the NFL based on 
last year's records. Their first five victims are a combined 8-21. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, entering the year the first five games looked  
somewhat daunting. Besides beating the Baltimore Ravens and 
Cincinnati Bengals, they have swept Atlanta, which went to the 
Super Bowl last year, and ended a 17-game losing streak to the San 
Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't hurt the Rams that the Falcons were without running  
back Jamal Anderson for both games, or that 49ers quarterback Steve 
Young was sidelined with post-concussion syndrome two weeks ago 
when the Rams dispatched them 42-20. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil also pointed out that the Rams played 10 teams that went  
to the playoffs last year, winning three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one sent me a sympathy card when we were playing the  
toughest schedules in football the last few years,'' Vermeil said. 
``We just line up and play. Some of the reasons those teams have 
losing records is they've played us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil's conclusion: ``I don't think those five wins are a  
fluke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons sweep is a case in point. The first time around, the  
Rams beat them with the pass as Kurt Warner threw for 275 yards and 
three touchdowns in a 35-7 victory, and on Sunday he had only 111 
yards passing and one TD while Marshall Faulk carried the load with 
181 yards on 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did what they wanted to, and we were at their mercy,''  
Falcons defensive end Chuck Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said the best may be yet to come.  
</P>
<P>
	``Can we play better? I think so,'' he said. ``I think we can  
eliminate some penalties. I don't know if we'll score any more 
points.''

<HEADLINE>  Tanzanians Welcome Nyerere Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Tanzanians  
thronged the international airport today to welcome home the 
remains of late president Julius Nyerere, the African statesman 
considered to be Tanzania's founding father. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Tanzania jet carrying Nyerere's coffin from London  
landed just after 9 a.m. local time amid cheers and wailing from 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	People had begun arriving around dawn to await the body of their  
beloved leader, who died Oct. 14 in a London hospital. As the plane 
arrived, some in the crowd fainted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police wielding truncheons pushed people back as they surged  
towards Nyerere's coffin, draped in the green, blue, black and 
yellow Tanzanian flag. An honor guard fired a 21-gun salute, and 
guard members fixed their eyes on the ground in a sign of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to see the man who is for me still my president,''  
said Mansul Abdul. ``Because of Nyerere, our parents were able to 
raise us,'' he said, referring to Nyerere's goal of providing free 
basic education and health care to all Tanzanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere's coffin was to be placed on a gun carriage and pulled  
six miles through this Indian Ocean port. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral mass was scheduled at St. Joseph's cathedral Tuesday  
morning for Nyerere, who died at age 77 after a battle with 
leukemia. Afterwards, the body of the man everyone called 
``Mwalimu'' -- teacher in Kiswahili -- will be taken to the National 
Stadium, where it will lie in state until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	World figures, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, are to attend a state funeral 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former South African President Nelson Mandela, the only other  
Africa leader of Nyerere's international stature, was not expected 
to attend the funeral because he was traveling in the Middle East, 
but his wife, Graca Machel was already in Dar es Salaam today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere will be buried Saturday in his home village, Butiama.  
</P>
<P>
	A founder of the Organization of African Unity in 1963, Nyerere  
was a leading proponent of economic sanctions against the former 
apartheid regime in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the drive for the independence of his East African nation  
from British rule and became the first president of what was then 
Tanganyika in 1962. In 1964, Nyerere presided over the union of the 
Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar and Tanganyika, on the 
mainland, to form Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Nyerere stepped down in 1985 after 23 years in office  
to devote time to farming and diplomacy, he remained the major 
power broker in the East African nation. He also worked tirelessly 
to negotiate an end to the violence that has wracked central and 
southern Africa in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Hammer Beatings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man was convicted Monday of murder for  
beating four people to death with a claw hammer while robbing their 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found Michael Barnhart guilty of three counts of  
first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder in the 
deaths of an elderly couple, the woman's son and his wife. All were 
beaten in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnhart, 25, was arrested three days after the bodies were  
found Nov. 1 in Holly Township, 45 miles northwest of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnhart faces mandatory life imprisonment with no chance of  
parole when he is sentenced Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnhart's attorney asked the jury to find Barnhart guilty of  
involuntary manslaughter, arguing he did not intend to kill anyone. 
Investigators said Barnhart entered the home intending to rob it, 
heard someone in the house and panicked.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Profits Surge 229 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. reported a 229 percent jump in  
profits for the third quarter as the nation's largest financial 
company saw business boom in its global and investment banking 
units, which had suffered the most during last year's market 
tumoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup posted net income of $2.4 billion, or 70 cents a  
share, beating Wall Street's forecast by 2 cents a share. The New 
York-based company had net income of $729 million, or 20 cents a 
share in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues totaled $14.57 billion in the quarter, a 33 percent  
increase from $11 billion in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quarter's results were solid, particularly amidst a  
challenging trading environment and significant weather-related 
catastrophes,'' John S. Reed and Sanford I. Weill, chairmen and 
co-chief executive officers, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The global corporate and investment bank division showed a  
strong rebound for the quarter from the loss in the 1998 period 
that resulted from severe global economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global corporate banking income totaled $461 million vs. a  
loss of $2 million in the third quarter period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney, the company's investment bank, reported  
income of $432 million, a complete turnaround from the $396 million 
loss in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Citigroup appears to be delivering on the promised  
synergies of the merger between Citibank and Travelers insurance 
group last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Income from the Citibank's lending operations increased 65  
percent to $604 million. Income from the bank's credit card 
business, one of the largest in country, grew 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, international income grew by about one-third to $270  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead,'' Reed and Weill said, ``we are well-positioned  
to realize the benefits from economic recoveries underway in Japan, 
Latin America and Asia, since 30 percent of our earnings are 
currently generated internationally and our presence in these 
markets continues to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Citigroup earned $7.25  
billion, or $2.07 a share, a 41 percent jump from $5.13 billion, or 
$1.43 a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months, revenues totaled $44.18 billion vs. $37.8  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's stock rose $1 to $43.13 a share in early New York  
Stock Exchange trading today.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Peter Fonda roared through town on a striped  
and star-spangled chopper to celebrate the 30th anniversary of 
``Easy Rider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fonda took part in a motorcycle rally and attended a private  
party in the French Quarter on Saturday to raise money for sick 
children and promote the movie, which Columbia Pictures is 
re-releasing on digital video disk. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia also has discussed releasing ``Easy Rider'' in theaters  
on a limited basis, said William Hayward, who co-produced the 
picture about two hippies, played by Fonda and Dennis Hopper, who 
ride through the South from California. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonda quoted his character's closing lines at the party: ``You  
know what Billy? We blew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hell's Angels has more family values than most U.S.  
families,'' he added. ``We better wake up or my prophetic words at 
the end of 'Easy Rider' will come true.''

	``I hope it can succeed on its own,'' Hamm said. ``What we don't  
want is just for it to be around for a couple of years. We want it 
to endure the test of time and be around for my kids to play in. We 
want to make sure we do it right and get a solid foundation before 
we jump into anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now the players bask in the glow of the World Cup with  
the victory tour and a series of indoor soccer exhibitions that 
begins Friday in Pittsburgh. The 12-city tour against an 
international team ends Dec. 15 in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster, who won the U.S. Open, is enjoying her best season in  
17 years on the tour. She once went five years without a tour 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized I could be a mom and play golf,'' she said. ``It's  
a fine balance. I have a lot of support at home. It's not easy, but 
I am doing what I love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After achieving her goal of winning the U.S. Open, Inkster won  
the LPGA Championship to become only the fourth woman to win the 
career Grand Slam, joining Pat Bradley, Louise Suggs and Mickey 
Wright. She gained the final point for the Hall of Fame last month 
with a victory in the Safeway Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they changed the Hall of Fame criteria, I was like, `I  
need seven points, two majors and three tournaments, there's no 
way.''' she said. ``And that's just what I did this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Inkster is vying with Karrie Webb for Player of  
the Year honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Player of the Year is important, but getting in the Hall of  
Fame was my No. 1 thing,'' she said. ``Whatever comes next is 
gravy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the eight surviving cofounders of the LPGA attended  
Women's Sports Foundation dinner. Among those attending the 
festivities was Aileen Riggin Soule, a gold medalist diver at the 
1920 Antwerp Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Other award winners: golfers Sandra Haynie and Betty Jameson;  
marathon runner Joan Benoit Samuelson; former Temple lacrosse coach 
Tina Sloan Green; Olympic track star Gail Devers; and Deborah 
Slaner Larkin, former executive director of the foundation.

<HEADLINE> More Questionable Calls in ALCS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two more questionable calls against the Red Sox on  
Sunday night had fans flinging debris onto the field and Boston 
manager Jimy Williams getting ejected after throwing his cap. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought to three the number of umpires' decisions that have  
gone against the Red Sox. And two of the umpires admitted later 
they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's being taken away from us, but we don't know  
why,'' Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees beat Boston 9-2 Sunday night and took a 3-1  
lead in the best-of-7 AL Championship Series. They can win it 
Monday night at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, trailing 3-2, had a runner on first and one out in  
the bottom of the eighth Sunday when John Valentin hit a grounder 
to Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch took a swipe at Jose Offerman on his way to second.  
Second-base umpire Tim Tschida called Offerman out, and Knoblauch 
threw to first to complete the inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams argued the call, and fans watching the instant replay  
on mounted televisions booed wildly and directed obscenities at the 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make the right call,'' Tschida said. ``I couldn't get  
into a position where I could see daylight between the glove and 
the runner. The only position I ever got to see that daylight came 
when I got to the dressing room and saw it on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch said he had ``no idea'' if he tagged Offerman. ``I  
didn't know what was going on after I threw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tschida ``just said he (Knoblauch) tagged me,'' Offerman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams didn't go to the interview room and issued a statement  
saying, ``It's the first one to win four (games), and it's not over 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees added six runs in the ninth, before first-base  
umpire Dale Scott made the second questionable call in the bottom 
of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra led off with a grounder to third baseman Scott  
Brosius and Scott called Garciaparra out. Replays showed he beat 
the throw. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway Park erupted with booing. Williams ran onto the field to  
protest, chopping his hand through the air and throwing his cap in 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	Trash streamed onto the outfield -- bottles, cups, a batting  
helmet. Yankees fled the field and their bullpen and ran to the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Play was halted while more than a dozen police and security  
staff took the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens. What are you going to do?'' Garciaparra said of  
the call. 
</P>
<P>
	And the fans?  
</P>
<P>
	``Fans doing that, we can't control,'' he said. ``Obviously,  
they have feelings. They're pretty emotional, too. That stuff 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first incorrect call against Boston came at a critical  
moment in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	With Offerman at first and the score tied 3-3 in the top of the  
10th, Valentin hit a grounder to Brosius. The throw was dropped by 
Knoblauch, but second base umpire Rick Reed ruled that Knoblauch 
dropped the ball while transferring it to his throwing hand. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Reed admitted he was wrong, that Knoblauch never  
had possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you want is to get the benefit of the doubt and to get  
respect,'' Lewis said. ``I'm not saying we don't have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He shrugged when told it may seem that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``What can you do, man?'' Lewis asked.

<HEADLINE> Umpires' Errors Befuddle Sox, Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It's hard to tell which mistakes were more  
damaging to the Boston Red Sox: the four they made, or the two 
committed by the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox errors led to three unearned runs, including the  
game-winner Sunday night as New York rallied to win 9-2 and take a 
3-1 lead in the best-of-7 AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the umpires' mistakes that frustrated the Red Sox and  
their fans for a second time this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make the right call,'' second base umpire Tim Tschida  
said after seeing a television replay that confirmed Chuck 
Knoblauch missed the tag on Jose Offerman in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult play to get in the position you want,''  
Tschida said. ``And that's a frustrating thing for an umpire, 
because we like to call everything properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were trailing 3-2 with a runner on first and one out  
in the eighth when John Valentin grounded the ball to Knoblauch. He 
took a swipe at Offerman on his way to second base, and Tschida 
signaled an out. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch threw to first to complete the inning-ending double  
play. Although he said he had ``no idea'' if he tagged Offerman, 
replays -- and Tschida -- confirmed that he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams came out of the dugout to argue  
the call, while fans watching the instant replay on ballpark 
televisions booed wildly and directed obscenities at the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored six runs in the ninth before first-base  
umpire Dale Scott made the second questionable call when Nomar 
Garciaparra led off with a grounder to third baseman Scott Brosius 
and Scott called Garciaparra out. 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed the call was wrong. Again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sure the umpires don't want to play a part in the  
outcome of the ballgame,'' Valentin said. ``It's just too bad it 
turned out that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams ran onto the field to protest, and he was ejected after  
he threw his cap in disgust. That brought trash streaming onto the 
field -- bottles, cups, a batting helmet -- and the Yankees fled the 
field and their bullpen and to the safety of their dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Play was halted for eight minutes while more than a dozen police  
and security staff took the field, pointing into the stands in an 
effort to catch the fans who were throwing things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans doing that, we can't control,'' Garciaparra said.  
``Obviously, they have feelings. They're pretty emotional, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third bad call that has gone against the Red Sox this  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 was tied 3-3 in the top of the 10th when second base  
umpire Rick Reed ruled that Knoblauch dropped the ball while 
transferring it to his throwing hand after a force at seconf. After 
the game, Reed admitted that Knoblauch never had possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's being taken away from us, but we don't know  
why,'' Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it might have something to do with the Red Sox defense, and  
the sudden clumsiness of their All-Star shortstop, who committed a 
team-leading fourth error on Sunday. Pitcher Bret Saberhagen also 
made an error in the fourth inning, and Boston made two more in the 
ninth as New York put the game away with a six-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took advantage of a few things tonight, a couple of  
miscues -- one by me that cost us a run,'' Saberhagen said. ``I 
thought I make that play 10 out of 10 times, but I guess it's nine 
out of 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the four errors were to blame for three Yankees runs.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make those types of mistakes, defensive mistakes,  
especially against this type of ballclub,'' Lewis said. ``They're 
going take advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Garciaparra's glove that made the first-round draft  
choice so attractive to the Red Sox. As he quickly rose through the 
farm system, the team thought his shiny fielding would make up for 
whatever hitting deficiencies he might have. 
</P>
<P>
	But Garciaparra was a star at the plate as well, batting .306  
with 30 homers and 98 RBIs to win the AL rookie of the year award 
in 1997, then topping that as a sophomore with a .323 average, 35 
homers and 122 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, all he did was lead the AL in batting with a .357  
average and hit 27 homers with 104 RBIs. And he cut down on his 
errors, committing a career-low 17 in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	His two errors in Game 1 against New York didn't lead to any  
damage -- and he also had two great catches to save three runs -- but 
the Yankees won 4-3. In Game 3, Garciaparra had an error in the 
ninth inning after Boston was already ahead 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Game 4, his defense finally hurt the Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it is'' uncharacteristic, Garciaparra said.  
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the fourth, Bernie Williams hit a grounder that  
Garciaparra picked up on his backhand but threw over first baseman 
Mike Stanley's head and into the Boston dugout. Tino Martinez 
doubled to make it 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	After Darryl Strawberry was intentionally walked and Brosius  
struck out, Chad Curtis hit a grounder to first. Stanley fielded 
the ball behind the base but Saberhagen couldn't handle the low but 
catchable throw, and as it rolled away Martinez scored to make it 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Offerman allowed New York's fourth run to score when he made a  
low throw to Garciaparra at second base. Right fielder Darren Lewis 
made Boston's fourth error of the game when his bouncing throw in 
the ninth eluded the relay man: Garciaparra.

<HEADLINE> Green Bay's Rhodes Has Flashbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Ray Rhodes had some bad flashbacks while  
watching his new team struggle as horrendously as his old team 
frequently did. 
</P>
<P>
	During the previous two seasons, Rhodes coached the Philadelphia  
Eagles to a 6-26 record before being fired. With five Super Bowl 
rings on his fingers, Rhodes came to Green Bay anxious to reclaim 
his reputation as a winner and a master motivator. 
</P>
<P>
	He won seven of his first eight preseason and regular season  
games with the Packers, and his Philly failures seemed to be behind 
him. But after taking a 31-10 thrashing from the Denver Broncos on 
Sunday, Rhodes was thinking back to the two worst years of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suffered two years through that, and I don't want to go  
through that again in my life,'' Rhodes said. ``When you get 
drubbed like we did yesterday, that feeling in your gut comes 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, who's known to sleep four hours a night and drink coffee  
by the gallon during the season, will no doubt spend the Packers' 
off day in feverish preparation for Green Bay's trip to San Diego 
to face the Chargers and their impressive defense on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes made the unusual move of putting the Packers (3-2)  
through a regular practice on Monday. He also said the team would 
run additional full-contact tackling drills later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes was hard-pressed to mention specific aspects of their  
game the Packers need to improve, simply because everything they 
did was so awful. Outside of Louie Aguiar's punting and Corey 
Bradford's special teams play, Rhodes couldn't find any positives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm concerned with all the aspects of our game,''  
he said. ``That area we were in (on Sunday), I'm certain we'll get 
out of it. But we've got to get more consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a team that entered the game leading the NFL in total  
offense, the numbers were staggering. Green Bay ran 35 plays -- 12 
of which gained yardage -- and possessed the ball for 14:46. The 
Packers gained 133 yards, had five first downs and failed on all 
eight of their third-down conversion attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Dorsey Levens, second in the league in yards from  
scrimmage before the game, rushed 10 times for 12 yards and caught 
one pass for no gain. Antonio Freeman, Green Bay's $42 million 
receiver, caught one ball for nine yards, his worst game in more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You remember a game like this,'' Freeman said. ``You keep it  
in the back of your mind. You never forget that feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was Brett Favre, who has already led the Packers  
to three last-minute wins this season. By his own admission, Favre 
was awful against the Broncos, missing open receivers and making 
poor coverage reads on the way to a 7-of-23 day for 120 yards and 
three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's defense wasn't much better, but at least it managed  
to keep the Broncos out of the end zone in the first half. After 
that, however, the floodgates opened, and the Broncos ran away with 
21 straight points through the Packers' flailing missed tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	The defining image of the game was Broncos receiver Ed McCaffrey  
juking cornerback Tyrone Williams to the ground, discarding safety 
Darren Sharper like a winter coat and bulling into the end zone in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters even worse, Rhodes' mother attended the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``She knows not to come around me afterwards,'' he said with a  
rueful grin. ``I'm not going to call her this week, either. I'm 
going to avoid her until we win a game.''

<HEADLINE> SBC To Upgrade Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now the nation's largest local phone company,  
SBC Communications plans to keep it that way by spending $6 billion 
to bring high-speed Internet service to nearly a third of America's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade to SBC's phone systems, which now cover most of the  
Southwest and Midwest, will take three years, the company said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a reasonable timetable for such a big job, but even SBC  
knows it's plenty of time for rivals to introduce their own robust 
Web services -- by phone line, cable TV and wireless communications 
-- and possibly steal away local phone customers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'd call it a race. We're all rushing to get to the  
customer,'' said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief 
executive of SBC. ``I think we can win, but we'll see. We think 36 
months is pretty ambitious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big part of SBC's effort will be to extend its fiber-optic  
cables farther into neighborhoods in major metropolitan and 
suburban areas, digging up streets to replace slower copper lines. 
</P>
<P>
	By bringing fiber-optic cables closer to each home, phone  
companies can provide more robust Internet access through a 
technology called DSL, or digital subscriber line. 
</P>
<P>
	The more rural parts of SBC's territories, however, will be  
upgraded later, possibly by 2004, Whitacre said. SBC's other units 
are Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell in California, Nevada Bell, and 
SNET in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	While DSL features speeds 5-to-60 times faster than the top  
computer modem using ``analog'' signals, the digital signal from 
DSL can only travel a few miles before fading. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from speed, DSL's other big advantage over conventional  
modems is that it provides a live, continuous link without having 
to dial up an access number. DSL also enables a person to use the 
same line for both Web access and a phone call at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	At $40 to $60 per month for basic service, DSL could mean a  
powerful new source of revenue for SBC and other local phone 
companies. But the Baby Bells are also investing heavily in DSL 
services as a way to defend their local telephone business. 
</P>
<P>
	Since consumers frequently show a preference for one-stop  
shopping, a successful Internet service may prove an effective way 
to sell phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC may be the most vulnerable Baby Bell because its systems are  
among the farthest behind in terms of fiber-optic upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question they need to do this. It's just a shame  
that this didn't start earlier,'' said Lisa Pierce, an industry 
analyst for Giga Information Group. ``This fiber upgrade is going 
to take most of the three years. So in a number of markets, SBC 
will be at a competitive disadvantage to something like AT&AMP;T,'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is spending more than $100 billion to buy and upgrade cable  
TV systems, not only to provide television and high-speed Internet 
access, but local and long-distance calling as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding its pending acquisition of MediaOne Group, AT&AMP;T will  
have cable access to about 16 million homes -- 10 million of which 
are already cable TV subscribers and prime targets for AT&AMP;T's 
Internet and telephone service. By the end of next year, the 
company expects to have at least 85 percent of its cable systems 
upgraded for telephone and Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, only about 16 million of SBC's 43 million customers  
will have access to DSL service a year from now, Ms. Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, about 12,000 miles of fiber-optic cable are to be  
installed under SBC's new spending program. After three years, SBC 
hopes to be capable of bringing DSL to about 80 percent of its 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC plans to provide minimum download speeds of 1.5 megabits per  
second, or more than 25 times faster than with a 56k modem, the 
quickest of the conventional modems. 
</P>
<P>
	The $6 billion spending plan does not include spending in the 30  
new markets where SBC has pledged to introduce telephone and 
Internet services as a condition of winning government clearance 
for the Ameritech merger. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, which currently provides local service in 20 of the  
nation's top markets located in 13 states, plans to enter 12 of the 
new markets over the next 18 months and the rest within three 
years. The new markets include New York City, northern New Jersey, 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Denver, Minneapolis, 
Phoenix, and Portland, Ore.

<HEADLINE> Woods Gives Wildcats New Dimension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- There will be a big difference in the  
Arizona Wildcats basketball team this season, a 7-foot-1 difference 
to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren Woods, who transferred from Wake Forest two seasons ago,  
becomes eligible this year and gives coach Lute Olson a presence 
his powerful program has usually lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have for the first time in a long time a legitimate shot  
blocker who can make it difficult to score inside,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is glad to be free from the pressure he felt at Wake  
Forest, where he constantly heard himself referred to as the next 
Tim Duncan, uncomfortably large shoes for anyone to try to fill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Olson said, `Look, you don't have to come in here and be  
anything that you're not,''' Woods said Monday at the Wildcats' 
media day. ``I didn't want to hear I was coming out to be the next 
anybody. Out here, all the players are good. West Coast basketball 
is different. You don't have to worry about being somebody else, 
trying to be somebody you're not. I think I fit perfectly here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this program, Woods feels he's just one of many good players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody on this team has to come out here and  
score 40 or 50 points a game or pull down 20 or 30 rebounds,'' he 
said. ``This team is so talented that any day we should have three 
or four guys coming in and contributing a lot. I think that's going 
to make everybody relax and play up to their ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After averaging 8.8 points and a team-high 7.1 rebounds and  
blocking 50 shots as a sophomore at Wake Forest, Woods had to sit 
out a season before he was eligible at Arizona. He joins a deep, 
talented team that includes 6-7, 238-pound power forward Michael 
Wright, last season's Pac-10 freshman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson plans to use Woods and Wright in a high-low post to take  
advantage of their offensive abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some adjustments in what we're doing offensively to  
allow us to get the ball inside more than what we've done over the 
last few years,'' Olson said. ``It's more an emphasis that we want 
these big guys involved in touching the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge will be to toughen Woods' inside play.  
Woods is a slim 251 pounds and has a reputation for not being able 
to withstand constant pounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest things that he needs to develop is the  
ability to take the banging that's going to go in there with 
someone his height,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the Wildcats will pound on Woods with tackling  
dummies during practice. But the biggest lessons will come from 
Gene Edgerson, the rough senior power forward who is sitting out 
this year as a redshirt to concentrate on school but will usually 
practice with the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgerson said he's perfectly suited for the role of toughening  
up the Wildcats' big new center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take care of Loren this year in practice. You can believe  
that,'' Edgerson said with a big smile. ``I'll make sure he comes 
out of practice with a couple of scratches and bruises, because 
that's how it's going to be come Pac-10 time. I love making your 
job more difficult than you think it's going to be. That's my 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One area that Woods should dominate is shot blocking and that  
talent should fit in well with Arizona's up-tempo style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blocking shots has always come easy to me,'' Woods said. ``I  
have pretty good timing and I'm taller than pretty much everybody, 
so that's always been a natural thing to me. Definitely in this 
program, especially the way we run, once I block a shot and I get 
it, we're gone. That should be two points on the other end -- 
definitely.''

<HEADLINE> Jim Moran Dies at 91 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Jim Moran, known for outrageous publicity  
stunts in the '40s and '50s to promote products, Hollywood films -- 
and himself -- died Monday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Sell an icebox to an Eskimo? Moran traveled to Alaska and did  
just that, at the behest of a refrigerator company. 
</P>
<P>
	Change horses in midstream? Moran performed the feat during the  
1944 presidential election, in the Truckee River in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime resident of Los Angeles and New York City, Moran  
spent the last three years of his life at the Actors' Fund Nursing 
and Retirement home in Englewood, said friend Mimi Brace. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like an icon to many people, and a mentor as well. The  
world isn't the same without him. It's the end of an era,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coddling an ostrich egg under a tailpiece of ostrich feathers,  
Moran managed to induce hatching in 1946. Not by coincidence did he 
pose during the gestation with a best-selling book, ``The Egg and 
I,'' which would soon become a comedy film starring Claudette 
Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquaintances described Moran as a tall, rotund, blue-eyed Irish  
prankster. 
</P>
<P>
	Gags like walking a bull through Ovington's -- a china shop on  
Fifth Avenue in New York -- may have been nutty, but Moran ``was 
crazy like a fox,'' said Herb Steinberg, a retired executive who 
worked at the MCA, Paramount and Universal film studios. 
</P>
<P>
	When the producers of a Broadway show, ``Fanny,'' failed to win  
much ink, they turned to Moran. 
</P>
<P>
	So Moran put a chimp in the driver's seat of an English taxi  
that had a trunk bearing the show's name and -- with Moran actually 
driving from the back seat -- motored around midtown Manhattan, 
Steinberg said. A picture landed in Life magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	James Sterling Moran was born in Woodstock, Va., on Nov. 24,  
1907. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1945 Associated Press article said that before entering the  
publicity business, Moran was an airline executive in Washington 
and operated a studio where congressmen recorded speeches for their 
radio stations.

<HEADLINE> Hornets 104, Rockets 91 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Derrick Coleman scored 18 points,  
offsetting another strong performance by Houston rookie Steve 
Francis, as the Charlotte Hornets defeated the Rockets 104-91 in an 
exhibition game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman scored eight of his points during a 6 1/2 minute stretch of  
the second quarter as the Hornets turned a six-point deficit into a 
54-41 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, the second player chosen in the draft, led all scorers  
with 26 points, including several spectacular dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 27 a night earlier in a loss at Orlando.  
</P>
<P>
	Francis helped give Houston to a 37-31 lead with 6:20 in the  
second quarter. But when Francis and Hakeem Olajuwon went to the 
bench, the Hornets took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman and Charlotte's own rookie point guard, Baron Davis,  
each scored eight points to help their team outscore the Rockets 
23-1 before Bryce Drew hit a 3-pointer with one second left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	With its starters back in the game for the third quarter,  
Houston climbed back into the game by outscoring Charlotte 14-2 
early in the period. Olajuwon had six of the points and finished 
with 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets (1-3) closed to 58-56 with 6:37 remaining in the  
period on a free throw by Francis. But the Hornets gradually pulled 
away again, outscoring the Rockets 30-25 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte's Eddie Jones, despite missing most of the second half  
with five fouls, finished with 16 points. Anthony Mason had 15 and 
Bobby Phills added 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Charles Barkley was unable to play for the third  
straight game with a strained right elbow.

<HEADLINE> American Home Increases Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug industry analysts reacted with skepticism  
Monday to optimistic profit projections from American Home 
Products, the troubled pharmaceutical maker that in the past two 
years has faced a host of safety concerns over its diet drugs, a 
childhood vaccine, and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts said they were impressed with American  
Home's lineup of new medicines including a short-acting sleeping 
pill, a transplant rejection drug and a flu vaccine administered by 
a nasal spray. But they question whether the company that makes 
Robitussin cough syrup and Advil pain reliever will deliver on its 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have some doubts,'' said Kenneth Noven, an analyst  
with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``They've continued to disappoint 
with failed products and a failure to pull off a merger that they 
don't have the complete confidence of the investment community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Home last year called off a proposed merger with life  
science firm Monsanto after top executives could not get along. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting in New York on Monday, American Home officials  
promoted the company's drug development pipeline, in an effort to 
convince Wall Street it can restore double-digit earnings growth-- 
in line with the world's biggest drugmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home on Monday reported third-quarter earnings,  
excluding charges to settle diet drug litigation and to restructure 
the agricultural products business, rose just 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Including $3.29 billion in previously disclosed charges related  
to the company's proposed settlement of fen-phen diet drug 
litigation and some other issues, American Home had a net loss of 
$2.87 billion in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.,-based American Home on Oct. 7 announced it had  
agreed to pay as much as $4.83 billion over a period of up to 16 
years as part of a national settlement of thousands of fen-phen 
liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, which must be approved by a federal  
judge in Philadelphia, the company would set up two funds to pay 
for medical checkups and injury claims for all patients who took 
its diet drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine), and chemical cousin Redux 
(dexfenfluramine) before the medicines were recalled in 1997 after 
being linked to heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposed deal could fall apart if too many plaintiffs  
fail to participate, and several attorneys warn that is a real 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Chairman and CEO Jack Stafford said he expects  
that settlement will remove a cloud hanging over the company. He 
said the spate of negative news surrounding the company was a 
series of unfortunate but unrelated events. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the diet drug litigation, the company last week  
recalled its rotavirus vaccine used to prevent serious diarrhea, 
after it was linked to dangerous bowel obstructions in infants. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, it had to recall 600,000 defective allergy kits used  
by people at risk for severe reactions from bee stings, certain 
foods or asthma. The drugs used in the kits weren't potent enough, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in August, the company reportedly agreed to pay $50 million  
to settle claims by women that its contraceptive Norplant caused 
headaches, irregular menstrual bleeding and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Home recalled Duract, a painkiller that  
caused fatal liver problems in some long-term users. 
</P>
<P>
	Stafford said he believes the medical community still trusts the  
company and its products. But he acknowledged the company faces 
credibility questions among investors. He said he was heartened 
Wall Street's response Monday-- the stock closed up $1.25 to $46.18 3/4 
on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is still down nearly 40 
percent since last spring.

<HEADLINE> The Streak Goes on for Mount Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLIANCE, Ohio (AP) -- And after the 48th straight victory, Mount  
Union rested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purple Raiders' top players seemed mostly anxious to get to  
bed Saturday after beating Otterbein 44-20 to surpass Oklahoma's 
42-year-old NCAA-record winning streak of 47 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sleep,'' wide receiver Adam Marino said after  
catching nine passes for 209 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he was going to celebrate, running back Chuck Moore  
said, ``Go to bed.'' He earned the sleep with a career-high 180 
yards on 26 carries and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purple Raiders said they were relieved the streak-setter was  
behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games, that's what you like to play for,'' quarterback  
Gary Smeck said after completing 15-of-26 passes for 282 yards and 
three touchdowns with one interception. ``But I'm glad it's over. 
Now we'll get back in our routine. No more press conferences on 
Tuesdays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's focus will return to winning a fourth straight NCAA  
Division III championship and a fifth this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you win a national championship, it's more of a  
culminating event from a season of hard work,'' said coach Larry 
Kehres, who is 144-16-3 in 14 years at the northeast Ohio school. 
``This is not quite that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior defensive tackle Matt Domin said there was no comparison  
between winning a title game and extending a streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``National championships are a lot better to accomplish,'' he  
said. ``I'll probably think more of it (the streak) when the 
season's over and I'm done playing football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kehres said that in the locker room before the game, ``I told  
them I was nervous and I'd understand it they were tense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smeck completed 10 passes in the first half, but they went for  
205 yards and two touchdowns as the Purple Raiders built a 28-7 
lead. Smeck, leading an offense that has four seniors listed among 
its top 22 players, hit Marino on a 39-yard bomb on the team's 
first play. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first quarter was almost like a nightmare for us,''  
Otterbein coach Wally Hood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was played before a record crowd of 7,132 in Mount  
Union Stadium, which seats 5,000 people. The Purple Raiders have a 
national title banner for each of the four light poles around the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Union, a 2,000-student school midway between Canton and  
Youngstown, has won 70 of its last 71 games. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no pep rally, bonfire or parade for the players during  
the week as Kehres attempted to keep the focus on the game. 
Besides, there probably wouldn't have been much interest from the 
student body, since few of the students have seen the Purple 
Raiders lose and almost all have come to expect a national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the fans and the media seemed to get emotionally involved  
with the game's historic implications. 
</P>
<P>
	With the kickoff still 45 minutes away, the public address  
announcer asked those without a seat in the already full 
general-admission sections to stand behind the chain-link fence 
circling the field. They stood three and four deep until the final 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd included the usual assortment of fans to be found at a  
nationally televised game between Division I-A powers. There were 
coeds with hair dyed purple, students with the letters M-O-U-N-T 
painted on their chests and aging alumni who sat quietly amid the 
din. 
</P>
<P>
	There was purple everywhere, from the Raiders' all-purple  
uniforms and the lettering on the field to the large purple 
scoreboard and almost every shirt and hat in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rare step into the spotlight for Mount Union, despite  
its four titles and 114-6-1 record this decade. More than 100 media 
credentials were handed out -- roughly four times the number for a 
typical home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehres, who has the highest winning percentage of any coach in  
college football history, said he didn't welcome comparisons with 
Notre Dame's Knute Rockne or Bud Wilkinson, who guided Oklahoma's 
streak. He also said Mount Union never could surpass Oklahoma's 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things in football that are hallowed ground,''  
he said. ``I should be the primary spokesman that Division III is 
not like Division I football. Their achievements should be treated 
with all the respect they merit.''

<HEADLINE> Ga. County Worried by Documentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The suburban Atlanta county still recovering  
from a school shooting in May is back in the national spotlight 
because of a documentary detailing shocking sexual behavior among 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Airing Tuesday as part of the PBS series ``Frontline,'' the  
documentary centers on a 1996 syphilis outbreak that infected 17 
Rockdale County teen-agers and forced 250 others to get medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary features interviews with teens who claim they've  
had as many as 100 sexual partners or joined in group sex parties. 
Some report becoming sexually active as young as age 12. 
</P>
<P>
	While most Rockdale residents have yet to see the documentary,  
reports of its contents have upset local leaders and parents. The 
county is one of the wealthiest in the Atlanta area. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is happy about it, even if we know that we're being  
used as an example of what's going on everywhere. No one likes to 
be slammed in front of the whole country,'' said Bill Hughey, 
director of the Rockdale Coalition, a nonprofit youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the focus of the show, just to have our dirty  
laundry aired is going to turn some people off from coming here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the program, three teen-age girls use stuffed animals to  
depict how classmates participate in multiple-partner sex. Other 
teens recount group sex parties at upper middle-class homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak Goodman, who co-produced the program with his wife, Rachel  
Dretzin Goodman, said it is not intended to make Rockdale County 
seem aberrant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show that this behavior is really just flags or  
indicators that something much more profound is afflicting our kids 
everywhere,'' Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary opens with a reference to the shooting in May,  
when 15-year-old T.J. Solomon wounded six classmates. The youth is 
awaiting trial on adult charges.

<HEADLINE> Umpires' Errors Befuddle Sox, Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It's hard to tell which mistakes were more  
damaging to the Boston Red Sox: the four they made, or the two 
committed by the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox errors led to three unearned runs, including the  
game-winner Sunday night as New York rallied to win 9-2 and take a 
3-1 lead in the best-of-7 AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the umpires' mistakes that frustrated the Red Sox and  
their fans for a second time this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make the right call,'' second base umpire Tim Tschida  
said after seeing a television replay that confirmed Chuck 
Knoblauch missed the tag on Jose Offerman in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult play to get in the position you want,''  
Tschida said. ``And that's a frustrating thing for an umpire, 
because we like to call everything properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were trailing 3-2 with a runner on first and one out  
in the eighth when John Valentin grounded the ball to Knoblauch. He 
took a swipe at Offerman on his way to second base, and Tschida 
signaled an out. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch threw to first to complete the inning-ending double  
play. Although he said he had ``no idea'' if he tagged Offerman, 
replays -- and Tschida -- confirmed that he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams came out of the dugout to argue  
the call, while fans watching the instant replay on ballpark 
televisions booed wildly and directed obscenities at the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored six runs in the ninth before first-base  
umpire Dale Scott made the second questionable call when Nomar 
Garciaparra led off with a grounder to third baseman Scott Brosius 
and Scott called Garciaparra out. 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed the call was wrong. Again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sure the umpires don't want to play a part in the  
outcome of the ballgame,'' Valentin said. ``It's just too bad it 
turned out that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams ran onto the field to protest, and he was ejected after  
he threw his cap in disgust. That brought trash streaming onto the 
field -- bottles, cups, a batting helmet -- and the Yankees fled the 
field and their bullpen and to the safety of their dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Play was halted for eight minutes while more than a dozen police  
and security staff took the field, pointing into the stands in an 
effort to catch the fans who were throwing things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans doing that, we can't control,'' Garciaparra said.  
``Obviously, they have feelings. They're pretty emotional, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third bad call that has gone against the Red Sox this  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 was tied 3-3 in the top of the 10th when second base  
umpire Rick Reed ruled that Knoblauch dropped the ball while 
transferring it to his throwing hand after a force at seconf. After 
the game, Reed admitted that Knoblauch never had possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's being taken away from us, but we don't know  
why,'' Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it might have something to do with the Red Sox defense, and  
the sudden clumsiness of their All-Star shortstop, who committed a 
team-leading fourth error on Sunday. Pitcher Bret Saberhagen also 
made an error in the fourth inning, and Boston made two more in the 
ninth as New York put the game away with a six-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took advantage of a few things tonight, a couple of  
miscues -- one by me that cost us a run,'' Saberhagen said. ``I 
thought I make that play 10 out of 10 times, but I guess it's nine 
out of 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the four errors were to blame for three Yankees runs.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make those types of mistakes, defensive mistakes,  
especially against this type of ballclub,'' Lewis said. ``They're 
going take advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Garciaparra's glove that made the first-round draft  
choice so attractive to the Red Sox. As he quickly rose through the 
farm system, the team thought his shiny fielding would make up for 
whatever hitting deficiencies he might have. 
</P>
<P>
	But Garciaparra was a star at the plate as well, batting .306  
with 30 homers and 98 RBIs to win the AL rookie of the year award 
in 1997, then topping that as a sophomore with a .323 average, 35 
homers and 122 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, all he did was lead the AL in batting with a .357  
average and hit 27 homers with 104 RBIs. And he cut down on his 
errors, committing a career-low 17 in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	His two errors in Game 1 against New York didn't lead to any  
damage -- and he also had two great catches to save three runs -- but 
the Yankees won 4-3. In Game 3, Garciaparra had an error in the 
ninth inning after Boston was already ahead 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Game 4, his defense finally hurt the Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it is'' uncharacteristic, Garciaparra said.  
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the fourth, Bernie Williams hit a grounder that  
Garciaparra picked up on his backhand but threw over first baseman 
Mike Stanley's head and into the Boston dugout. Tino Martinez 
doubled to make it 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	After Darryl Strawberry was intentionally walked and Brosius  
struck out, Chad Curtis hit a grounder to first. Stanley fielded 
the ball behind the base but Saberhagen couldn't handle the low but 
catchable throw, and as it rolled away Martinez scored to make it 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Offerman allowed New York's fourth run to score when he made a  
low throw to Garciaparra at second base. Right fielder Darren Lewis 
made Boston's fourth error of the game when his bouncing throw in 
the ninth eluded the relay man: Garciaparra.

<HEADLINE> Schumer: U.S. Needs Terror Czar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. Charles Schumer is calling for a review of  
the federal response to the recent outbreak of West Nile-like virus 
and says the U.S. government should appoint a terrorism czar. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the CIA concluded the outbreak was not the work of  
terrorists, Schumer asserted in a letter to the U.S. General 
Accounting Office that the outbreak provides an opportunity to 
assess the federal government's ability to respond to a potentially 
catastrophic biological attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be alarmist, but we must be as prepared as  
possible,'' Schumer said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the outbreak revealed troubling gaps in emergency  
preparedness for a biological attack and called the outbreak the 
closest example yet of what a such a terrorist assault on the 
United States might resemble. 
</P>
<P>
	The mosquito-borne virus was first detected in early September.  
It was the first time that particular strain of encephalitis virus 
was found in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It has killed six people and infected 55 others in the  
metropolitan area and has been detected in numerous birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer said he planned to ask President Clinton to appoint a  
high-level domestic terrorism official to coordinate and evaluate 
federal response to terrorist acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the response is fractured all over the federal  
government,'' he said, adding that the fact that the recent 
outbreak went misdiagnosed for three weeks underlines the need for 
a federal director.

<HEADLINE> Study: Brain's Moral Compass Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key part of the brain's circuitry for learning  
moral and social rules lies right behind the forehead, a study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Antisocial behavior might depend at least in part on  
malfunctions in this circuitry, researchers said. But it's too 
early to draw conclusions, and the study doesn't mean that all 
antisocial behavior can be blamed on damage to this area, said lead 
author Steven W. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The area, called the prefrontal cortex, has long been known to  
affect social behavior. Prior studies show that people who sustain 
damage to it as adults can start acting irresponsibly. A happily 
married man, for example, might take up with prostitutes and start 
bouncing checks. 
</P>
<P>
	A classic tale in brain science, in fact, concerns a railroad  
construction foreman named Phineas Gage who was the victim of an 
1848 explosion that drove a metal rod through his prefrontal 
cortex. Before the accident he had been industrious, dependable and 
well-liked, but afterward he became a drifter who was profane, 
unreliable, impulsive and inconsiderate of his loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies of similar patients have shown that despite their  
disruptive behavior, they do know the moral and social rules of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work, focusing on two adults who sustained damage to the  
prefrontal cortex before age 16 months, suggests that such early 
damage can even keep people from learning the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The man and woman were reared in stable homes and had normal  
intelligence, Anderson and colleagues at the University of Iowa 
College of Medicine report in the November issue of the journal 
Nature Neuroscience. But both engaged in petty thievery, lied 
habitually, failed to hold jobs because of undependability, acted 
irresponsibly sexually and showed no guilt or remorse for their 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In lab tests, they couldn't competently deal with hypothetical  
dilemmas like: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A man must steal a drug to save his wife's life. Should he do  
it? 
</P>
<P>
	-- Two people disagree on what TV channel to watch. How can they  
solve the problem? 
</P>
<P>
	-- Your boss invites you to a party you don't really want to  
attend. What should you do? 
</P>
<P>
	By one theory, the prefrontal cortex is thought to be important  
in using emotions in making decisions. For these two people, the 
brain damage apparently kept them from absorbing lessons taught 
through reward and punishment in childhood, Anderson said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP To Meet on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid rising tension marked by President  
Clinton's veto of a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill he said smacks 
of ``a new American isolationism,'' the president and Republican 
congressional leaders agreed Monday to hold budget talks at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was set for Tuesday after Republican leaders  
accepted Clinton's invitation. They said they would insist that no 
taxes are raised and that using Social Security's surpluses to pay 
for remaining spending bills is ruled out. House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Republicans consider the surpluses issue 
``the highest goal of our budget season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's to try and get congressional Republicans to join an  
irresponsible scheme to spend Social Security and raise taxes, I 
don't think the president will find us a receptive audience,'' 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants to talk about the two sides' differences  
over education, anti-crime and environmental programs and how the 
measures would be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to make these critical investments and maintain  
our fiscal discipline to keep our economy strong, we're going to 
have to make tough choices, and we're going to have to make them 
together,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving in Newark, N.J., later for a Democratic fund-raising  
event, Clinton said he hoped that bitter partisan feelings could be 
left behind. ``I'm just going to reach out a hand of friendship and 
hope that we can work together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president lamented the growing divide between the  
administration and congressional Republicans, and said he found it 
``almost inexplicable'' that some seem to think good economic times 
allowed them the ``luxury of indulging in division and diversion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The session was arranged three days before Thursday's expiration  
of stopgap legislation that has kept federal agencies functioning 
since fiscal year 2000 began Oct. 1. Clinton said he would sign a 
short-term extension, and GOP leaders planned to send him an 
extension through Oct. 29 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the White House and Congress, already soured  
by Clinton's impeachment trial, have worsened in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's Senate rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty, a  
top administration foreign policy goal, has prompted bitter 
accusations of partisanship from both sides. Both stood to gain by 
holding a meeting that would afford chances to appear reasonable as 
they address the year's highest-profile remaining issue: the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what Tuesday's meeting would achieve. There were  
some hopes on both sides that it would lead to a series of 
lower-level meetings where specific remaining differences could be 
resolved. But clearly, both face political risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many rank-and-file Republicans loathed the omnibus spending bill  
the White House and GOP leaders wrote last fall, which contained 
billions in spending that conservatives attacked as excessive. Top 
Republicans said anew they would not repeat that process, but they 
risk GOP disaffection if things seem similar. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next year's election campaigns, many Democrats  
have been happy to see Republicans struggle to write spending 
bills. They would react negatively if a quick agreement were struck 
that blurred partisan differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five of the 13 spending bills for fiscal 2000 have been  
enacted. Two have been vetoed, and three face veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	On the five most controversial bills, Clinton wants less than  
$10 billion over what Republicans have offered, a tiny portion of 
the near $600 billion that the annual spending bills control. But 
the two sides have philosophical differences, such as how extensive 
state control over federal education aid should be and GOP 
provisions to help oil and mining industries that the 
administration considers anti-environmental. 
</P>
<P>
	The vetoed foreign aid bill fell $2 billion below Clinton's  
request. It omitted any of the $500 million he wants for Israel and 
the Palestinians to implement the accord they struck last year at 
Wye River, Md. It also provided less than he wanted for 
international debt relief, the Peace Corps and efforts to reduce 
the nuclear threat from Russia, North Korea and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me to be the next big chapter in the new American  
isolationism'' following the Senate's defeat of the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty last week, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As they have for weeks, Republicans sought to cast Clinton as  
demanding to use Social Security's surpluses for extra spending, in 
this case for a program that has little public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to increase foreign aid by 30 percent, and  
he knows that the money will come out of the Social Security trust 
fund. We will not raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for 
more foreign aid,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House rejects that argument and cites projections by  
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and others that GOP 
spending plans would eat into the Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Monday, House and Senate Republicans agreed to a  
compromise $37 billion measure financing the Commerce, Justice and 
State departments. Democrats said Clinton would probably veto the 
measure, which contains about $2 billion less than he wants, 
including less than half his $1.3 billion request for hiring local 
police officers.

<HEADLINE>  Jets' Downward Spiral Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The dazed looks on their faces didn't  
completely disappear one day after their latest painful defeat. The 
New York Jets are 1-5 and sinking, and they can't get a good grip 
on what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's the time of the season -- the approach of Halloween --  
that had some players blaming the metaphysical for their woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of bad things this year,'' said nose tackle  
Jason Ferguson, a victim of one of those bad things, a sprained 
ankle that cost him three games. ``There was a lot of good last 
year. It's like there's a cloud over us. There's definitely a cloud 
over this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bizarre,'' added cornerback Aaron Glenn.  
</P>
<P>
	Labeled a Super Bowl favorite heading into the season after  
making the AFC title game in 1998, the Jets have been ravaged by 
injuries. They've also been plagued by poor decisions on and off 
the field, by players and coaches. In six games, they've made as 
many mental and physical errors, from Parcells down to the rookie 
special-teamers, as they did all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once, in a second-week loss to Buffalo, have they been  
dominated. But they can't make the key play that turns games in 
their favor, and even when things are going well -- as they did in 
the first half of Sunday's 16-13 loss to Indianapolis -- the Jets 
self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
	At no time did they fall apart worse than against the Colts. In  
position to break a 13-13 tie, they moved from midfield to the 
Indianapolis 3 on runs by Curtis Martin. Then Parcells opted for a 
pass by untested Ray Lucas, in his first start, to the left corner. 
Cornerback Jeff Burris stepped in front of Keyshawn Johnson for the 
interception and sprinted 55 yards. Indianapolis moved downfield 
for a winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The few players who made themselves available Monday still  
seemed stunned by that play; by Parcells' decision to start Lucas 
over Rick Mirer -- he didn't let the players know until 2 1/2 hours 
before gametime; and by yet another injury, this time Lucas 
spraining his left ankle on the final play of the game. He's out 
3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each loss we get, we lose a player,'' safety Victor Green  
said. ``It's unbelievable the way we continue to lose players, 
whether it's for one, two, three games or the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Glenn: ``It's bizarre because of the way we're having the  
injuries. Ray on the last play. Kevin Williams ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was placed on the reserve, non-football injury list  
with a severe case of strep throat that sent him to the hospital. 
He is done for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Add that to losing quarterback Vinny Testaverde (torn Achilles'  
tendon), running back-kick returner Leon Johnson, linebacker Chad 
Cascadden (torn knee ligaments) and cornerback Otis Smith (broken 
collarbone), all gone for the season. And wideout Wayne Chrebet, 
who returned against Indianapolis after missing five games with a 
broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever seen it like this,'' said  
punter-quarterback Tom Tupa, who, with Lucas out, could wind up 
starting if Parcells refuses to go back to the sputtering Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said Monday he expects to start Mirer in Oakland this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing after another, it seems every week something  
happens,'' he said. ``You go into the game with the mindset of 
winning, not thinking of the next guy going down. There's been a 
lot of hard luck this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my 12th in the league and it's probably the most I've  
seen. This is particularly a lot for any club.''

<HEADLINE> AL Playoffs Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Babe Ruth spent most of his career with the New  
York Yankees after leaving Boston. His daughter, though, made it 
clear who she prefers -- the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started leaning towards them last year and, this particular  
year, I really have been a true Red Sox fan,'' Julia Ruth Stevens 
said before throwing out the first ball Monday night for Game 5 of 
the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she used to follow the Yankees but switched allegiances  
to the Red Sox ``because I think that they deserve a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox have been hurt in the series by two calls made at  
second base by umpires who said later that they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had a lot of tough breaks and the umpires certainly  
haven't made it any easier for them, I must say,'' she said. ``I 
came all the way from Arizona just to see the Red Sox beat the 
Yankees tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A loss would eliminate Boston and, no doubt, be attributed by  
some to ``The Curse of the Bambino,'' her father's nickname. The 
Red Sox last won the World Series in 1918 and they sold Ruth to the 
Yankees before the 1920 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mostly, I think it's a myth,'' she said of the curse. ``But it  
is a coincidence, definitely, that there's been many, many, many 
years since the Red Sox managed to win a World Series. I think 
they've had a lot of bad luck and I am certainly hoping from here 
on in they have nothing but good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVINE INTERVENTION:* New York manager Joe Torre found out how  
partisan Red Sox fans could be when he went to church with his 
3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were leaving church and she wanted to light candles,''  
Torre said. ``A Red Sox fan came up to me and said, `If one of 
those candles is for a (Yankees) victory, I'm going to blow it 
out.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I never light a candle asking for good things to  
happen like that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won anyway Sunday night, 9-2.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE BREAKS OF THE GAME:* Most of the breaks in the series have  
gone New York's way, and Boston manager Jimy Williams doesn't know 
if they even out in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You create your own breaks,'' he said. ``We made a couple of  
mistakes (Sunday) night. They capitalized. I don't know about 
breaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he took an indirect poke at the bad calls at second base by  
umpires Rick Reed in Game 1 and Tim Tschida in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players decide the game,'' Williams said. ``The pitchers,  
the hitters, everything. Let them decide the game. Not anybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHAKE IT UP, JIMY:* Going by the book, Williams changed his  
lineup for Game 5 by re-inserting lefties Trot Nixon in right field 
and Brian Daubach at designated hitter against Yankees righty 
starter Orlando Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Both played in Boston's 13-1 win in Game 3 when righty Roger  
Clemens started for New York. They went a combined 5-for-8 with 
three doubles, a homer and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday against lefty Andy Pettitte, Williams inserted two  
righty hitters -- Don Buford replacing Nixon and Butch Huskey taking 
over for Daubach. Buford and Huskey went a combined 3-for-6 with a 
double and a stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre also made two changes because the Red Sox started lefty  
Kent Mercker one day after they went with righty Bret Saberhagen. 
Torre replaced designated hitter Darryl Strawberry and left fielder 
Ricky Ledee, who both homered in Game 4, with Chili Davis and Shane 
Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHOOPS:* The Red Sox earned a new line in the postseason record  
book, one they would prefer not to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Their four errors in Game 4 gave them eight for the series,  
tying an LCS record shared by five other teams. The last National 
League team to do it was Atlanta in 1998. Toronto was the last 
American League team to accomplish that dubious feat in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The LCS record for errors in one game is five by the Los Angeles  
Dodgers in Game 3 of 1974 and the Yankees in Game 2 of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra has four errors in the series, one shy of the  
ALCS the record set by another Boston shortstop, Spike Owen, in the 
seven-game series in 1986.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Even if Braves manager Bobby Cox wanted to use  
Kevin Millwood in relief during Sunday's marathon 4-3, 15-inning 
loss to the New York Mets, the right-hander wouldn't have been 
ready to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood pitched a one-hitter in beating Houston in Game 2 of  
the division series. He came on two days later and got the save in 
Game 4 with one scoreless inning to win the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, however, said Monday he had no plans in Game 5 to use  
Millwood, the Game 6 starter Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was still in the clubhouse when we scored the run,'' said  
Millwood, recalling Keith Lockhart's triple that put the Braves up 
3-2. ``I went down there (the bullpen) just in case they wanted me 
to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Kevin McGlinchy, after retiring two Mets in the 14th to  
get out of that inning, gave up a leadoff single to Shawn Dunston 
in the 15th. He walked pinch-hitter Matt Franco before Edgardo 
Alfonso sacrificed. John Olerud was intentionally walked, loading 
the bases. Todd Pratt then walked on five pitches, forcing in the 
winning run. Robin Ventura followed with the winning shot over the 
right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I would have had time to get warmed up, to be  
honest with you,'' Millwood said. ``By the time I got to the 
bullpen, I think he (McGlinchy) was already out on the mound ... 
and that didn't give me a whole lot of time to get loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it normally takes him about 20 minutes to warm up.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I could do it a lot quicker if I had to,'' he said. ``But  
it's just tough to change those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MADDUX MUSES:* Greg Maddux gave up a two-run homer to John  
Olerud in the opening inning of Game 5 before pitching six 
scoreless innings, then leaving. He was asked if the 15-inning 4-3 
loss was demoralizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demoralizing -- that's when an earthquake knocks your house  
into a thousand pieces or you've had a death in the family,'' he 
said. ``It's baseball and we lost. You don't lose sight of the big 
picture, which is what we can do right now to get to the World 
Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COOKIE'S BACK:* Mets third-base coach Cookie Rojas is eligible  
for Game 6 on Tuesday. He had been suspended for the first five 
games of the NLCS and fined $500 by NL president Len Coleman for 
bumping umpire Charlie Williams in Game 4 of the division series 
against Arizona. Bruce Benedict, a bench coach, had replaced Rojas 
against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO TIX:* The Braves couldn't sell out Turner Field (50,000) for  
Games 1 and 2 of the NLCS, drawing 44,172 for the first game and 
44,624 for the second. But they expect a sellout for Game 6.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Clarifies Organ Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing attacks from organ transplant centers  
and Congress, the government today clarified its regulations aimed 
at getting organs to the sickest patients. Organs should not be 
wasted, the new rules make clear, by shipping them coast to coast 
or futilely transplanting them into very sick patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But the revised regulations issued today by the Department of  
Health and Human Services remain unchanged in fundamental ways: 
Organs should be given to the most medically urgent patients first, 
they say, without regard to where patients live. And the HHS 
secretary retains the right to approve or veto any allocation plan 
devised by the private contractor that runs the transplant system. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS issued regulations directing a remake of the transplant  
system last year, arguing that patients in certain communities 
unfairly wait much longer than others for a transplant. Under the 
current system, organs are distributed in local areas first, even 
if there are sicker patients elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But these rules were put on hold by Congress amid fierce  
complaints from transplant programs that feared they would lose 
locally donated organs to larger centers that have more patients on 
waiting lists. Transplant surgeons and the network that runs the 
system also objected to HHS setting the rules, saying allocation 
policies are medical decisions that should be made by medical 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS Secretary Donna Shalala told reporters today that many of  
the revisions are meant to clarify what the department wanted all 
along. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the transplant community read it one way when we  
actually thought we were pretty clear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised rule -- which takes effect in about 30 days -- makes  
several clarifications. 
</P>
<P>
	It notes that allocation should be based on ``sound medical  
judgment.'' It says that policies should be designed to avoid 
wasting organs and futile transplants. And it clarifies that the 
rule does not require a single national list. Rather, organs are to 
be distributed ``over as broad a geographic area as feasible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in fundamental ways, the rule retains HHS' authority over  
the transplant network, which is privately run under a government 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress ordered the Institute of Medicine to study  
the system and make recommendations. That report, released in July, 
recommended that the government exercise more oversight over the 
system and concluded that broad sharing of organs was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS repeatedly cited that study in releasing its revisions  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in line with the institute's report, the new regulations no  
longer require the allocation system to consider the amount of time 
a patient has been waiting for a transplant. And they establish an 
expert advisory committee to help guide HHS policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The revisions also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Retain tough new requirements to produce timely data about  
transplant center performance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Give the transplant network power to enforce rules about who is  
put on the transplant waiting list. This is to ensure that certain 
hospitals are not unfairly listing their patients as sicker than 
they actually are in order to get organs quicker. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow for monitoring of the impact of the new rules on small  
and medium-sized transplant programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the transplant  
program and strongly objected to the first regulation, was 
reviewing the changes and had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> 'Fight Club' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Fight Club'' took the weekend box-office  
title from ``Double Jeopardy'' as the film about men beating one 
another senseless debuted with an $11 million purse, according to 
industry figures Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio estimates Sunday had put ``Double Jeopardy'' on top of  
the box office, with ``The Story of Us'' a close second and ``Fight 
Club'' just behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Final numbers for the weekend had ``Double Jeopardy'' in second  
place with $10.2 million and ``Story of Us'' in third with $9.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Fight Club,'' Brad Pitt and Edward Norton organize a band  
of frustrated men who find ritual satisfaction in bare-knuckle 
brawls. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox, estimated Sunday the  
film took in $10.3 million over the weekend, $700,000 below its 
actual take. ``Fight Club'' did better business Sunday than the 
studio expected, said Tom Sherak, head of distribution for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Reiner's ``Story of Us,'' which debuted Friday, is a  
romantic comedy with Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis as a couple 
on the brink of divorce. ``Double Jeopardy'' stars Ashley Judd and 
Tommy Lee Jones in a thriller about a woman seeking revenge against 
her double-crossing husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramount had estimated ``Double Jeopardy's'' weekend gross at  
$10.5 million, about $300,000 above Monday's actual figures. 
Universal estimated ``Story of Us'' at $10.4 million, about 
$700,000 more than it actually took in. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios covet the No. 1 spot at the box-office so they can  
promote a film as the top-grossing movie. Paramount and Universal 
said Monday they did not inflate their estimates to grab first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our best guess for Sunday's business,'' said Nikki  
Rocco, head of distribution for Universal. ``I don't overestimate 
my numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Friedman, vice chairman for Paramount Motion Picture Group,  
said the studio's estimate was off only slightly. ``Double 
Jeopardy'' had been the top-grossing movie the previous three 
weekends, but Paramount did not jockey numbers to claim the top 
spot again, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had said it was a three-way tie it would be fine by  
us,'' Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Shares Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen and Tokyo share  
prices closed lower today following last week's selloff on Wall 
Street amid fears of inflationary pressure in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.02 yen in late trading in Tokyo, down 0.76  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late Friday level in 
New York of 105.42 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 326.24  
points, or 1.85 percent, to 17,275.33. On Friday, the index shed 
178.69 points, or 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading in Tokyo, the dollar fell on worries over a  
sharp fall on Wall Street on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan expressed concern about U.S. stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average lost 266.90 points, or 2.6  
percent, to close Friday at 10,019.71. The average recorded its 
worst weekly point drop in history, plummeting 630.05 points. It's 
5.9 percent drop last week was the biggest weekly percentage 
decline in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the dollar and U.S. stocks also fell under pressure  
in New York after an announcement by the U.S. Labor Department that 
wholesale prices rose 1.1 percent in September, far above the 
market's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded in a range of 104.95 yen to 105.85 yen in  
Tokyo on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, while some market players said Tokyo's  
reaction to the New York decline was relatively calm and 
unsurprising, others said the benchmark Nikkei index may have been 
supported by government buying during the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something there supporting the Nikkei, and it can't  
be anything but public fund intervention,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, 
general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's release of slightly weaker industrial output data for  
August than initially reported by Japan's Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry last month may also have hurt the market, 
players said. 
</P>
<P>
	Production grew 4.4 percent in August from the previous month,  
slightly worse than the 4.6 percent preliminary figure. Shipments 
grew 3.8 percent, less than the 4 percent earlier reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A broad range of sectors faced selling, led by the  
telecommunications, banking, brokerage and trading sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 50.03 points, or 3.31 percent, to 
1,460.23. The TOPIX fell 26.48 points, or 1.72 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's decline was the TOPIX' largest since Sept. 22, when the  
index fell 50.05 points, or 3.27 percent, the largest drop this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 560.4 million shares Monday, down from 769 million 
shares Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.10 yen late  
Monday, down from 114.96 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7700 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8150 percent. Its price 
rose 0.38 point to 99.39.

<HEADLINE>  BoSox Fans Go Out With Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They had one more chance to get it right.  
</P>
<P>
	They did.  
</P>
<P>
	No, not the Red Sox; they lost 6-1.  
</P>
<P>
	But their fans. They had to let go of the dream of reaching the  
World Series yet one more time. And they finally did -- with some 
sense and a little style. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Yankees celebrated their ALCS win on mound in Fenway  
Park, Boston ace Pedro Martinez began walking toward the dugout 
from the bullpen in center field. The stands summoned up one more 
roar that slowly changed to a chant: 
</P>
<P>
	``M-V-P!'' they yelled at the smiling Martinez, ``M-V-P!''  
</P>
<P>
	It was a disarming moment. And after the ruckus near the end of  
Game 4, it was a welcome one. There were almost as many cops on 
hand Monday night as there were at Woodstock this summer. The best 
thing about their very visible presence is that it wasn't needed. 
Not on this night. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing ballplayers used to talk about New York or Philadelphia  
-- sometimes Cleveland and Chicago -- as the tough places to play. 
There's no need to bother with lists anymore. These days, every 
town is tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, we understand their frustration,'' Boston center fielder  
Darren Lewis said. ``But when you throw things on the field, you're 
crossing a line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sad part about too many sporting events is how blurred the  
line has become. Only a few letters, after all, separate ``fan'' 
from ``fanatic.'' What's troubling about now, however, is how 
easily a few miscreants, stoked by alcohol, rage or a pathetic need 
to be part of the show, can lead entire crowds down the wrong road. 
</P>
<P>
	What ever happened to peer pressure? At an NFL game in  
Philadelphia a few weeks ago, ugliness spread through the stands at 
Veterans Stadium like a virus. While Dallas Cowboys receiver 
Michael Irvin lay motionless on the turf after a numbing hit, what 
began as a few isolated cheers gathered momentum until it crashed 
over him like a wave. Minutes later, the same sick sentiment 
rippled through the crowd a second time as a stretcher was rolled 
onto the field to carry Irvin off. 
</P>
<P>
	That episode hardly marked the first time an injury to an  
opposing player was cheered. Especially in Philly, a town so tough, 
a manager once joked, that when baseball games were rained out, 
fans went to the airport and booed bad landings. Yet, what was so 
troublesome about the latest display there was how easily the crowd 
let a few morons hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the number of bottle- and garbage-throwers in the  
Sunday night crowd at Fenway were just a few dozen among nearly 
34,000 people. What was stunning was how quickly those few managed 
to make the whole place feel unsafe. All they needed was an excuse. 
And when Red Sox manager Jimy Williams went out to argue an 
umpire's blown call -- the third to go against Boston this series -- 
they had it. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, every baseball fan knows the story of how Red Sox owner  
Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to New York just before the 1920 season 
to finance a Broadway play. And how The Bambino led the Yankees to 
the first of their 24 World Series titles and how Boston has not 
won one since. Naturally, some people believe Williams' tirade 
provided the wick for those 80 years of bottled-up frustration that 
spilled over after Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	What a crock. Even Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whose  
ballpark may be the most notorious garden spot in all of sports, 
knew better. What happened Sunday night was the same thing that 
always happens: a few idiots act up; too many other people stand 
around and do nothing, or worse, get caught up in the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys are too young to remember,'' he lectured reporters  
late Sunday night, ``but things could get pretty brutal around here 
in the 1970s when the Yankees came to town. Same thing with the Red 
Sox in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What changed the mood back then was an agreement between  
Steinbrenner and Haywood Sullivan, his counterpart in Boston, to 
ratchet down the rivalry by any means necessary. They started with 
more cops, cracked down on rowdy fans faster, and ejected people at 
the hint of a problem. While no owners have had the guts to 
seriously cut into liquor sales at their parks, they've learned 
that cutting troublemakers out quickly definitely makes the rest of 
the herd easier to steer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we don't have to go back to New York to play these guys  
again,'' Steinbrenner said. ``But if we do, I don't think the 
Boston players have anything to be worried about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's hoping that his confidence is not misplaced.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, we've seen one crazed fan run out of the  
stands to stab tennis star Monica Seles at courtside and another 
goof parachute into a boxing ring. The reason our athletes perform 
so flawlessly in front of so many is because it used to be an 
article of faith that the crowd would just sit and scream. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dangerous few are more inventive, more abusive and more  
menacing. And unless the rest of us are serious about stopping 
them, soon they'll be the only ones in attendance.

<HEADLINE> Short-Term Treasury Rates Rise / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest levels in more 
than 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $9 billion in three-month bills at  
a discount rate of 4.990 percent, up from 4.780 percent last week. 
An additional $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 
5.000 percent, up from 4.930 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since June 29, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 4.995 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since Aug. 3, 1998, when the rate was 5.030 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 5.136 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,873.90, and 5.216 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,747.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.42 
percent last week from 5.34 percent the previous week.

Veterans Stadium like a virus. While Dallas Cowboys receiver 
Michael Irvin lay motionless on the turf after a numbing hit, what 
began as a few isolated cheers gathered momentum until it crashed 
over him like a wave. Minutes later, the same sick sentiment 
rippled through the crowd a second time as a stretcher was rolled 
onto the field to carry Irvin off. 
</P>
<P>
	That episode hardly marked the first time an injury to an  
opposing player was cheered. Especially in Philly, a town so tough, 
a manager once joked, that when baseball games were rained out, 
fans went to the airport and booed bad landings. Yet, what was so 
troublesome about the latest display there was how easily the crowd 
let a few morons hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the number of bottle- and garbage-throwers in the  
Sunday night crowd at Fenway were just a few dozen among nearly 
34,000 people. What was stunning was how quickly those few managed 
to make the whole place feel unsafe. All they needed was an excuse. 
And when Red Sox manager Jimy Williams went out to argue an 
umpire's blown call -- the third to go against Boston this series -- 
they had it. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, every baseball fan knows the story of how Red Sox owner  
Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to New York just before the 1920 season 
to finance a Broadway play. And how The Bambino led the Yankees to 
the first of their 24 World Series titles and how Boston has not 
won one since. Naturally, some people believe Williams' tirade 
provided the wick for those 80 years of bottled-up frustration that 
spilled over after Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	What a crock. Even Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whose  
ballpark may be the most notorious garden spot in all of sports, 
knew better. What happened Sunday night was the same thing that 
always happens: a few idiots act up; too many other people stand 
around and do nothing, or worse, get caught up in the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys are too young to remember,'' he lectured reporters  
late Sunday night, ``but things could get pretty brutal around here 
in the 1970s when the Yankees came to town. Same thing with the Red 
Sox in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What changed the mood back then was an agreement between  
Steinbrenner and Haywood Sullivan, his counterpart in Boston, to 
ratchet down the rivalry by any means necessary. They started with 
more cops, cracked down on rowdy fans faster, and ejected people at 
the hint of a problem. While no owners have had the guts to 
seriously cut into liquor sales at their parks, they've learned 
that cutting troublemakers out quickly definitely makes the rest of 
the herd easier to steer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we don't have to go back to New York to play these guys  
again,'' Steinbrenner said. ``But if we do, I don't think the 
Boston players have anything to be worried about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's hoping that his confidence is not misplaced.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, we've seen one crazed fan run out of the  
stands to stab tennis star Monica Seles at courtside and another 
goof parachute into a boxing ring. The reason our athletes perform 
so flawlessly in front of so many is because it used to be an 
article of faith that the crowd would just sit and scream. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dangerous few are more inventive, more abusive and more  
menacing. And unless the rest of us are serious about stopping 
them, soon they'll be the only ones in attendance. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nissan To Close Plants, Slash Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second largest automaker,  
will shut down three assembly plants and slash 21,000 jobs in an 
attempt to become more competitive, the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key facts and figures point to a reality: Nissan is in bad  
shape,'' Chief Operating Officer Carlos Ghosn said, adding that the 
company had no choice but to undertake drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Renault executive took over at Nissan in July,  
promising to revive the ailing manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the three-year restructuring plan drawn up with partner  
Renault SA of France, the company will cut its worldwide work force 
14 percent, to 127,000 by the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2002, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three plants will be closed by March 2001. Nissan's  
production capacity in Japan will drop by 30 percent as a result, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, which has lost money in seven of the last eight years,  
also announced that it aims to turn a profit by fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The debt-ridden Japanese automaker has undertaken a campaign to  
remake itself since Renault bought a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan 
for $5.4 billion earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a reputation for quality engineering, Nissan hasn't had  
a hit car in ages. The company said it will cut its net debt by 50 
percent by fiscal 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts will come through attrition, an increase in  
part-time and flex-time schedules, spin-offs and early retirement 
programs, Ghosn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said it will reduce production capacity in Japan to 1.65  
million units from 2 million by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	To be closed are the Murayama plant near Tokyo, a plant in the  
western city of Kyoto run by Nissan group member Nissan Shatai, and 
the Aichi Kikai Minato plant in central Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The car company initially announced the closure of the Aichi  
plant in February.

<HEADLINE> Delta, Continental Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Delta and Continental airlines reported a drop in third-quarter  
earnings as Hurricane Floyd grounded hundreds of flights for both 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta reported Monday its earnings excluding a one-time gain  
fell 13 percent during the quarter, while Continental Airlines said 
its earnings fell 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
 *Delta Air Lines Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines reported earnings of $290 million, or $1.96 per  
share, compared to $327 million, or $2.08 per share, in the same 
quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results did not include the proceeds of a one-time stock  
sale. With that one-time gain included, Delta's net earnings came 
to $352 million, or $2.38 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta exceeded the $1.91-per-share expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd, which struck the southeastern coast in  
September, forcing 1,100 Delta flights to be canceled, reduced 
revenues for the Atlanta-based airline by about $20 million. Delta 
reported total revenues for the quarter of $3.87 billion, up from 
$3.80 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's net earnings were boosted by the sale of 35.2  
million shares of Singapore Airlines it had held since 1989. Delta 
also bought back its own common stock held by Singapore Airlines, 
giving the U.S. carrier a pretax gain of $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta also sold 1.8 million shares of Priceline.com, an online  
ticket bidding company, for another $115 million. Delta still owns 
16.8 million shares of Priceline.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta's stock rose 25 cents to $50.37 1/2 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the one-time gain, Delta reported nine-month net  
income of $933 million, or $6.19 a share, up from $884 million, or 
$5.57 a share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $11.34 billion, up from $10.95 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Delta announced it is buying the Comair commuter  
airline for $1.8 billion. The deal is part of Delta's effort to 
expand a regional connection between its hubs and cities served by 
smaller carriers. 

</P>
<P>
                     *Continental Airlines Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Continental's net earnings fell 27 percent to $110 million, or  
$1.53 per share, from $150 million, or $1.94 per share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results do not reflect a one-time charge for the  
retirement of aging aircraft. With that charge included, the 
year-ago earnings came to $73 million, or 97 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental's latest results surpassed predictions of analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp., who anticipated earnings of $1.47 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $2.3 billion, up 8 percent from $2.1 billion in  
the 1998 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Continental reported the cancellation of 700  
flights due to Hurricane Floyd, which cut into the airline's 
revenue. The carrier also reported its results were hurt by a 15 
percent rise in fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental shares rose 25 cents to $36.31 1/4 in New York Stock  
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Continental announced it has sold its interest in  
Amadeus Global Travel Distribution SA for $408 million. The sale 
will close Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time charge, Continental reported nine-month  
net income of $331 million, or $4.51 a share, up from $317 million, 
or $4.15 a share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $6.54 billion, up from $6.01 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who has been suffering  
side effects from radiation therapy, returned to the hospital on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 79-year-old Roman Catholic archbishop, who had a brain tumor  
removed in September and has undergone follow-up radiation since 
then, was readmitted to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors want to do some follow-up on the side effects of  
radiation,'' his spokesman Joseph Zwilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery and radiation have left the cardinal fatigued and  
forced him to cut back on his schedule. O'Connor has not said 
public Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral for the last two Sundays, 
and was too weak to attend the Columbus Day Parade last week.

<HEADLINE>  QBs Passing Through Revolving Door </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dan Marino leaves and Damon Huard plays just fine as his  
replacement. Same for Jay Fiedler in place of Mark Brunell. Even 
Brian Griese has found new life and Dave Brown is back for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the way of the NFL, where Kurt Warner can come out of  
the Arena League and lead the downtrodden St. Louis Rams to five 
straight wins to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the way of NFL fans, who were yelling ``Fiedler,  
Fiedler,'' after the journeyman from Dartmouth went 11-for-13 to 
pull out a win after Brunell went down. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, there is reason for concern in a sport in which one  
position plays so prominent a role. With the season one-third 
complete, 14 of the 31 first-string quarterbacks have been injured 
-- some temporarily, some for the season and one (Steve Young) 
perhaps for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	A partial list:  
</P>
<P>
	--Marino, the NFL's career leader in most passing categories,  
completed one pass Sunday in New England. He threw an 8-yarder on 
the second play of the game that made him the first QB to surpass 
60,000 yards in his career. Then he left with a sore shoulder, 
giving way to Huard. He won the game 31-30 on a 5-yard TD pass to 
Stanley Pritchett with 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	--Brunell, the player most responsible for Jacksonville's early  
success as an expansion franchise, bruised his ribs with the 
underachieving Jaguars trailing expansion Cleveland 7-6 in the 
third quarter. Enter Fiedler, a relative of the late conductor 
Arthur Fielder and a quarterback who has bounced from Philadelphia 
to Minnesota to Jacksonville in four years. Fifteen points later, 
Jags win 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jake Plummer was already playing with a variety of injuries  
that have kept him from fulfilling the promise shown last season. 
He broke his right index finger in a 24-10 loss to the Redskins. 
Enter Brown, a one-time first-round draft choice run out of New 
York by the boos of Giants fans. Brown threw a TD pass that got the 
Cards back in the game temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	--Detroit's Charlie Batch, another bright young QB. He left the  
game with Minnesota with a bruised right shoulder, believed not to 
be overly serious. In the same game, another maligned QB, Jeff 
George, took over for an ineffective Randall Cunningham. George 
nearly won the game out for the Vikings and will start next week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Then there's Brett Favre, who had pulled out all three of Green  
Bay's wins with touchdown drives in the final minutes. Playing with 
a thumb injury that causes constant pain, he had the worst game of 
his career in Denver. He completed 7-of-23 for 120 yards with three 
interceptions in a 31-10 loss to the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thumb has been bothering me all year, but it is not an  
excuse,'' Favre said. ``I don't want it to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Griese was supposed to be benched until Bubby Brister came up  
with a strained rib muscle. But he threw for 363 yards in that 
game. Coach Mike Shanahan, playing quarterback roulette all season, 
declined to say if Brister or Griese will start next week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Finally, Steve Young. He wanted to come back in the second half  
of San Francisco's game in Arizona Sept. 27 after sustaining yet 
another concussion in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he's missed three games now, and the unrelated  
Steinbergs, agent Leigh and Dr. Gary, seem to want him to retire. 
The agent is outspoken; the doctor is guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	In his stead, Jeff Garcia has done decently.  
</P>
<P>
	But he's not Steve Young.  
</P>
<P>
	Nor is Damon Huard Dan Marino.  
</P>
<P>
	In this year of declining and emerging quarterbacks, only Kurt  
Warner has looked like a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's had only five games. Give him time.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOWN BY THE BAY:* It finally looks as if San Francisco's  
fabulous run is near an end. Not because Young has been replaced by 
Garcia at quarterback but because the rest of the parts aren't 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Niners lost 31-29 to Carolina Sunday, ending a 19-game home  
winning streak in a strangely symmetrical fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last regular-season loss at home was 30-24 to the Panthers  
on Dec. 8, 1996. George Seifert was San Francisco's coach in that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, eased out as Niners' coach after that '96 season  
despite a career winning percentage of .766, was the Panthers' 
coach Sunday. He returned as the enemy for the first time to the 
city where he was born, raised and spent most of his coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as excited as I can be,'' he said after the game, about as  
strong a statement as the laid-back Seifert ever makes. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the 49ers, they're 3-3 with a bad secondary and  
questionable offensive and defensive lines. In a league where 
parity reigns, they may not win 10 games this season, ending a run 
of 16 consecutive seasons with double-figure wins. 

</P>
<P>
	 *GEORGIA CONNECTION:* With Terrell Davis and Derek Loville  
injured, Denver turned to rookie Olandis Gary on Sunday. He 
responded with a heavy-duty 124 yards on 37 carries. That was a 
major reason why the Broncos had the ball for an astounding 45 
minutes, 14 seconds in their 31-10 win over the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a connection here.  
</P>
<P>
	Gary was a fourth-round pick from Georgia. That's the same  
school from which the Broncos plucked Davis, who won Super Bowl MVP 
and league MVP awards the last two years, on the sixth round in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another connection.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis transferred to Georgia from Long Beach State after it  
dropped football. He got hurt, then got caught in a pass-happy 
offense led by Eric Zeier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary came from Marshall with Jim Donnan, who moved from there to  
Georgia to replace Ray Goff in 1996, the year after Zeier and Davis 
left. He was a backup to the injured Robert Edwards of the New 
England Patriots before becoming a starter last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's Denver's secret: Draft Georgia running backs late.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Manager Derides Steinbrenner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams mocked New  
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner on Monday and denied 
encouraging fans to bombard the field with garbage during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Georgie Porgie speaks, I don't listen,'' Williams said  
before Game 5 of the AL Championship Series. ``... The calls on the 
field incited it, not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second base umpire Tim Tschida admitted Sunday that he made the  
wrong call in the eighth inning after Chuck Knoblauch tried -- but 
clearly failed, replays showed -- to tag Jose Offerman on his way to 
second. In the ninth, first base umpire Dale Scott also missed a 
call, ruling Nomar Garciaparra out when replays showed he was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams came out of the dugout and was soon ejected. And that  
brought a hail of garbage onto the field as angry fans took out the 
frustrations of 81 years without a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really incited it,'' Steinbrenner said after the game,  
which the Yankees won 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Told of Steinbrenner's comments, Williams said, ``I've never  
worried about Georgie Porgie. He's never been in the trenches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't try to incite it,'' he said. ``I don't like to  
see these things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis acknowledged that Williams'  
tantrum was out of character. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Steinbrenner's statement was sheer madness,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	One umpire had already admitted making a mistake that cost the  
Red Sox a scoring opportunity in the 10th inning of Game 1, which 
the Yankees eventually won 4-3. Williams' complaint then was that 
the umpires didn't ask each other for help. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Williams said he asked Tschida to get help from other  
umpires, but was refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than once, I asked for help,'' Williams said. ``And I  
asked in English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams skipped the postgame news conference Sunday night and  
issued a terse statement reminding everyone that the series wasn't 
over yet. On Monday, he apologized for his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to talk about the umpires any more,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The field was cleared and the game was delayed for eight minutes  
after the second bad call Sunday night. A half hour after the last 
out, fans still crowded around a ballpark television and groaned 
when the replay was shown on the local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he understood the fans' frustration, but he wants  
them to find another way to express it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like those players over there. I don't want to see any of  
them get hurt. I don't want to see any of our guys get hurt,'' he 
said. ``I like our fans, but I was not right. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't incite it. If I really felt I did, I'd accept  
responsibility. But I just couldn't take it anymore. Those calls 
...''

<HEADLINE> Osmond Depressed After Giving Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bout of postpartum depression caused Marie  
Osmond to abandon her husband and seven children this summer, 
planning never to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Osmond became depressed after the birth of her son Matthew  
on July 6, while she was on hiatus from her daytime variety show 
``Donny &AMP; Marie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically gave the baby to the babysitter, gave her the  
credit card, got in my car and just really felt that my kids would 
be better off if they did not have a mother,'' Ms. Osmond said in 
the Oct. 23 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just left, never thinking I would come back, not really  
knowing where I was going or what I was doing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Osmond, who had moved from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles,  
drove up the California coast until her husband, Brian Blosil, 
reached her on her cellular phone and convinced her to check into a 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
	She was treated for depression.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am still going through it,'' she said. ``It is such an  
incredibly dark place.''

<HEADLINE> Douglas' Injury Tempers Eagles' Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles' jubilation over  
their first road victory in nearly three years has been tempered by 
concern about the medical condition of defensive end Hugh Douglas, 
who tore a biceps tendon in his right arm against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas underwent an MRI on Monday afternoon, and the Eagles  
will know the results Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to be patient and hope for the best,'' said  
Douglas, who injured his arm on a running play in the fourth 
quarter of the 20-16 victory, the Eagles' first on the road since 
Dec. 14, 1996. ``I want to make the decision that's best for me and 
the team. I can't go out there and play at less than full strength. 
That won't work for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The worst-case scenario is that Douglas would have to undergo  
surgery on the arm and would miss the rest of the season. The 
best-case scenario is that Douglas would be out for several weeks 
while the arm stabilizes. Neither is very appetizing for Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tough for me to sit out of games,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's been a frustrating season for Douglas, who led the Eagles  
with 12 1/2 sacks last season and started quickly this year, recorded 
two in the first 1 1/2 games this year. But he partially tore a 
ligament in his left knee playing Tampa Bay on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Expected to miss four to six weeks, Douglas made a quick  
recovery and returned to the playing field on Oct. 10 against 
Dallas. He wasn't at full strength, but he was a contributor as the 
Eagles won consecutive games for the first time since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he found out how severe the arm injury might be.  
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a blessing in disguise if I have to miss the rest  
of the year, really,'' Douglas said. ``Then I can get totally 
healthy. I want to play, but I want to play at the level I'm used 
to playing at. I'm not the biggest defensive end in the league and 
I can't be effective if I've only got one arm and a sore leg. That 
wouldn't be the right way to go for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles are tied for the league lead with 17 forced turnovers  
but they have only 11 sacks. Douglas has two of them in limited 
action. With him out, they will have to scramble for help at right 
defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Mamula will continue to start in Douglas' place, but the  
Eagles know Mamula is undersized and will wear down if he's used 
too much. So they hope Brandon Whiting and linebacker Ike Reese can 
help make up the void. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never want Hugh Douglas off the field for any extended  
period of time,'' coach Andy Reid said. ``He's a high-energy player 
and a very productive player.''

<HEADLINE> Accords, Camrys Big With Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys remained the most  
popular vehicles among thieves last year, but high-end light trucks 
gained ground as popular targets for pilfering, the National 
Insurance Crime Bureau said in its latest list Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Accords and Camrys were followed by the Chevrolet C/K pickup  
truck, Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles, Honda 
Civic, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Ford F-series pickup, Ford Mustang, 
Dodge Caravan and Toyota Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevrolet C/K jumped four spots in the list to third,  
Cherokee/Grand Cherokees five places to fourth, and Ford F-series 
pickups three notches to seventh in rankings mirroring the shifts 
in taste on America's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vehicle thieves follow market trends and target the most  
popular vehicles because they provide the best market for stolen 
vehicle parts,'' the bureau's Ed Sparkman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The list is based on more than 400,000 stolen vehicle reports  
submitted to the nonprofit bureau by its member insurance companies 
nationwide. The figure represents roughly one-third of all vehicles 
reported stolen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau combines theft reports for all model years of a  
particular make and model, unlike a similar annual list issued by 
CCC Information Services Inc. That company, which also tracks 
vehicle thefts for the insurance industry, lists the most-stolen 
vehicles by model year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two lists feature some of the same cars. In February,  
CCC reported that the top three stolen cars in 1998 all were Camrys 
from various years, followed by the 1994 Accord EX, tops among 13 
Accords in that list's top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The lists of most-stolen vehicles usually lag sales trends by  
several years. As a popular model ages and demand for its parts 
rises, it moves up on the theft lists. The high ranking of the Olds 
Cutlass, for example, reflects the car's immense popularity in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying habits in different parts of the country also are  
reflected in theft trends. American vehicles are the top targets of 
thieves in Detroit and Chicago, pickups in Houston and Phoenix. 
Japanese cars lead the list in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the FBI reported Sunday that the estimated 1.2 million  
vehicles reported stolen nationwide last year were 8 percent less 
than the previous year -- and the lowest number since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated total value of vehicles stolen nationwide in 1998  
was nearly $7.5 billion, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NICB, based in Palos Hills, Ill., is supported by more than  
1,000 insurance companies.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dozens of parents protested outside the  
headquarters of the Los Angeles Unified School District on Monday, 
demanding the Board of Education rescind its appointment of a new 
chief executive and support its superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	The board named attorney Howard Miller as chief executive  
officer last week, giving him control over all day-to-day 
operations, a move that took direct control of the nation's 
second-largest district from Superintendent Ruben Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs carried by protesters read: ``It's Not Miller Time,''  
``Our Children's Future is with Ruben,'' and ``Recall Genethia,'' a 
reference to school board president Genethia Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle over who is in charge is the latest in a series of  
upheavals to strike the 697,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is the $200 million school that sits half-finished on  
a site polluted with toxic materials. Also, the district is rushing 
to try to meet a deadline to qualify for $900 million in state bond 
money to build 100 new schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Some protesters threatened to remove their children from school  
and said they would seek recall elections of school board members 
who voted to appoint Miller.

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenges Gore to Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain  
on Monday challenged Vice President Al Gore to debate the merits of 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that was defeated by the Senate 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is owed serious treatment of such a profoundly  
important matter as national security, and they deserve a 
presidential campaign centered on substantive issues, public policy 
and competing views about how to best protect the national 
interest,'' McCain, an Arizona senator, wrote Gore in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said that although the vice  
president would gladly debate, he will not accept McCain's 
challenge at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is plenty of time to debate our Republican opponent --  
whether it is senator McCain or anyone else -- next year,'' Salazar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore unveiled a new campaign ad after the Senate rejected the  
treaty last week in which he discussed the need for an 
international ban on nuclear testing and promised to make the vote 
an issue in the campaign. McCain voted against ratifying the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, McCain's political team was preparing its first radio  
advertisements of the campaign. The spots, to begin airing Tuesday 
in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary, are 
designed to show a personal side of McCain. They feature his wife 
Cindy and former Senate colleague Warren Rudman of New Hampshire.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Keeping his options open, New York tycoon  
Donald Trump plans to file the necessary papers this week to be a 
Reform Party presidential candidate in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump says he plans to decide whether to seek the nomination  
next year. His strategist, Roger Stone, said Nov. 1 is the deadline 
to file for ballot access in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about keeping his option open to run. You don't want  
to decide in January to run, having missed the deadline for filing 
in the largest state,'' Stone said. ``I think this increases the 
likelihood of him running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan is preparing to  
bolt the GOP and seek the Reform Party nomination. The party's 
nominee would qualify for $13 million in federal money, a nest egg 
that is attracting the attention of several other potential 
candidates.

<HEADLINE> `Get Real' a Fine, Forgotten Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blame that Debrah Farentino for the problems  
facing the wonderful ``Get Real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Start with her, anyhow.  
</P>
<P>
	She's beautiful, she's sexy, and the very first moments of Fox's  
new drama ``Get Real'' showed her in a steamy bedroom scene with 
her husband's business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, this was only a fantasy born of desperation:  
Farentino plays Mary Green, a loving wife and mother who was 
fearful that her husband Mitch no longer found her attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was beside the point. The scene raised critics'  
eyebrows (and perhaps some viewers' blood pressure). Then the 
balance of the hour may have struck the audience as flip, cynical 
and self-absorbed. Perhaps most problematic, the series' title was 
put to use by teen-age daughter Meghan, who twice addressed the 
camera and goaded the audience to ``get real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Get real? Well, maybe she's on to something. Either given a bad  
rap or overlooked entirely by most viewers, this series is in real 
trouble: So get with the program. It's time you gave ``Get Real'' a 
second chance. Or, more likely, a first. 
</P>
<P>
	Put simply, ``Get Real'' is one of the season's best new series.  
</P>
<P>
	As evidenced by its skimpy following -- in audience size, it  
ranks 86th out of 137 series -- ``Get Real'' also qualifies as Most 
Unfairly Neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	And for any viewers who were put off by its premiere and never  
returned, or skipped it altogether after its generally lousy 
reviews, ``Get Real'' can boast yet another distinction: Most 
Improved. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pilot episode was fascinating (at least, in my  
opinion), it depicted the Green family as teetering on the verge of 
a collective nervous breakdown. Everyone seemed in a separate 
orbit, headed for collision. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, near the end of the hour, rebellious son Cameron  
wrecked his car. Were his injuries serious? Would he die? At the 
hospital, Meghan turned to the camera and fired a gotcha: ``You 
think we're gonna kill my brother?'' she scoffed, needling the 
audience for caring. ``In the first episode?!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The post-pilot ``Get Real'' has eased the attitude a few notches  
and made the dysfunctional Green family functional. And no one says 
``Get real!'' much anymore, if it all. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains from this not-so-drastic tinkering is what really  
counts: smart scripts, a splendid cast and, from scene to scene, an 
intoxicating visual ebb-and-flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get Real'' is a rare thing indeed: a multi-generational family  
show all ages can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Back after two weeks of baseball, ``Get Real'' airs its fifth  
episode Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty, popular and brainy Meghan (played by Anne Hathaway) will  
be blindsided by a vicious rumor sweeping her school: That her 
decision to skip college is explained by pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron (Eric Christian Olsen), a high school lothario whose  
first love is his skateboard, strikes a deal with his sweet but 
fumbling little brother: Kenny (Jesse Eisenberg) will help him 
regain his skateboard rights on school property. In return, Cameron 
agrees to teach Kenny some courtship techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary worries about Mitch (Jon Tenney), a struggling real-estate  
developer who in recent weeks has lost his partner to a prosperous 
rival and his best friend to a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mary's widowed mother Elizabeth (Christina Pickles) wrestles  
with guilt at her deepening relationship with the first man she has 
dated after losing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Would it be wrong to tip their hand? Well, by hour's end Kenny  
kisses his girl, Cameron resumes flight on his 'board, Elizabeth 
removes her wedding ring, and, with Mary's support, Mitch finds 
fulfilling new work. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a hopeful, feel-good hour, even when it deals with sticky  
dilemmas and bristles with diverse points of view. It plays funny, 
sad, authentic. 
</P>
<P>
	But how much longer?  
</P>
<P>
	A series that was written off from its first week, ``Get Real''  
continues to be tyrannized by its time slot. What a fearsome enemy 
front: ``Drew Carey'' on ABC, NBC's outstanding new ``West Wing,'' 
the WB's much-talked-about new teen drama ``Roswell,'' plus the CBS 
movie and UPN's ``Star Trek: Voyager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that menu of options, how many viewers are likely to  
gravitate to ``Get Real''? This requires an act of will, and now is 
the time: ``Get Real'' is scheduled the next four weeks, through 
Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Do yourself a favor and take a look. Then catch the show you'd  
have watched otherwise as a rerun next winter or spring. Not to 
play the blame game, but without some more viewers real soon, ``Get 
Real'' could be history by then. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert Earnings Rise 38 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. (AP) -- Warner-Lambert Co.'s third quarter  
earnings soared 38 percent, powered by explosive sales of the 
nation's dominant cholesterol lowering drug Lipitor, the company 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert, which also makes Listerine mouthwash and Dentyne  
chewing gum, said net income rose to $417 million, or 47 cents per 
share, compared to $302 million, or 34 cents per share, for the 
same period in 1998. Results matched forecasts of analysts surveyed 
by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales rose 20 percent to $3.2 billion from $2.7  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipitor sales soared 72 percent to $981 million, leading the  
company's pharmaceutical division. Lipitor now controls about 44 
percent of the market for cholesterol lowering drugs, compared to 
20 percent for its leading rival, Merck's Zocor, according to 
market research firm IMS Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert's Neurontin anticonvulsant product also  
registered strong sales gains -- up 79 percent to $237 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall sales in the pharmaceutical segment, largest of the  
company's three business divisions, increased 30 percent to $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Warner Lambert earned  
$1.2 billion or $1.41 per share, up from $924 million or $1.01 per 
share in the same period a year ago. Sales increased 22 percent to 
$9.4 billion from $7.7 billion, after adjusting for the impact of 
foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company increased research and development investment by 35  
percent to $347 million in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the company's consumer health care segment increased  
10 percent to $761 million, led by strong sales for Listerine, up 7 
percent to $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales increased 2 percent for the company's Adams confectionery  
segment, to $482 million. Dentyne was the segment's best-performing 
brand, with sales up 21 percent to $39 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it is on track to meet analysts earnings  
forecast for 1999 and 2000. The company expects to have 32 percent 
earnings growth this year and 20 percent in 2000, that's tops among 
the nation's largest drug companies.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Yacht on Auction Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- For the right price, you could sail  
away with a piece of presidential history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sequoia, a yacht used by eight presidents from Hoover to  
Ford, is being sold on ``Treasures in Your Home,'' a live 
collectibles show on PAX TV and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht hit the auction block for display Oct. 6. Bids will be  
accepted through Oct. 26 through the show's Website, www.paxtv.com. 
As of Friday, the Web page featuring the yacht had been viewed 
almost 5,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no bidders.  
</P>
<P>
	The minimum to open bidding is $1.55 million, but even that  
won't be enough. The owners have established a higher reserve, or 
amount they will accept for the purchase. That figure is 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's online auctions usually last a week, but this time  
the producers of the show have requested more time to give 
potential bidders a chance to reflect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a highly priced item,'' said Larry Ferber, an  
executive producer. ``It's not like you sit there and go, `Sure, I 
have a million-five, I'll open the bidding.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Treasures in Your Home'' is broadcast live five nights a week  
from a set at religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's Christian 
Broadcasting Network. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht is by far the most expensive item that has been up for  
bid since the show premiered Aug. 9, Ferber said. The show has 
auctioned a couple of cars for around $18,000 each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht, 100 feet long and 18 feet wide, was built in 1925.  
Herbert Hoover went on fishing cruises with it, and Franklin D. 
Roosevelt had the yacht officially commissioned as a presidential 
yacht in 1933. Over the decades it also was used by presidents 
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Carter had it sold at public auction in 1977 for $286,000.  
</P>
<P>
	From there, it went through a handful of owners until the  
Presidential Yacht Trust took title in 1985. The following year, 
the yacht went to the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Corp. for an 
overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, also known as Norshipco, took possession of the  
Sequoia in 1991 to pay off unpaid bills related to the overhaul. It 
had been trying to sell it for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had nothing to lose by putting it on the (Web) site and  
allowing everyone all over the world who could access the site to 
view it,'' John L. Roper IV, Norshipco's executive vice president, 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Roper said Norshipco must sell the yacht for at least $2.5  
million to recoup its investment but that the company hopes whoever 
buys the historic ship would make it available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	If the reserve is not met by Oct. 26, the yacht will be taken  
off the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sequoia Presidential Yacht Foundation, a nonprofit  
organization based in Alexandria, would like to buy the yacht, but 
not for anywhere near $1.5 million-plus. The group wants to dock 
the yacht at the Navy yard in Washington, D.C., and keep it 
operational. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a national historic property,'' said Ben Brown,  
the foundation's president, who was on the boat when he was a 
military aide in the Johnson White House. ``It belongs really to 
the American people. It's a floating White House.''

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Unfazed By Rough Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Tonya Harding overlooked her rough  
debut in pro competition Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With empty seats outnumbering spectators, Harding fell twice  
during the the technical portion of the Pro Figure Skating 
Championships. She was fourth among five women competitors entering 
Tuesday's artistic program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very nervous and my legs were shaking. But at the same  
time, the audience was wonderful. I went out and did the best that 
I could after being off the ice for so long. I just had a great 
time,'' Harding said. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign flashed ``Good luck, Tonya,'' and the audience warmly  
greeted Harding, the final skater of the three-hour competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she came out, she had tears in her eyes,'' said her  
adviser, Michael Rosenberg. ``Then some little girl yelled, `We 
love you, Tonya.' She perked right up. I think she handled herself 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a turquoise-and-purple outfit, Harding performed to a  
saxophone-guitar medley, falling on her first and final jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Harding was seated in the middle of eight skaters at  
a news conference. She received several hugs, and many skaters took 
turns to welcome back Harding to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a friend of mine back then, and I'm so glad she's back  
skating with us,'' said Surya Bonaly, the only woman competitor who 
didn't fall Monday night and was first after the opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rory Burghart was second, followed by Tonia Kwiatkowski, Harding  
and Liz Manley. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans came from as far away as Japan for the event at the  
5,780-seat Huntington Civic Arena, and there were more than 50 
media credential requests from as far away as Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet no fans who were asked were willing to admit that they came  
specifically for Harding, who was implicated in the 1994 knee-whack 
on rival Nancy Kerrigan and subsequently banned from amateur 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the scandal revisited,'' said Carol Delancey of  
Huntington. ``I don't think skating needs all that. Her reputation 
detracts from the overall picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her friend, Kim Copley, disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if she adds anything, but I want to see her just  
to say I saw Tonya Harding,'' Copley said. ``I don't think she 
detracts from anything.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Norway Has Unusual Economic Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The land of plenty is worrying about a  
rather ironic shortage: Wages are so high in wealthy Norway that 
the country can't find enough people to man the low-paying jobs 
that are the backbone of its generous welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer, say some, is to import foreigners to do the work.  
But that touches a nerve in a country accustomed to isolation on 
Europe's northern fringe. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is not a problem in Norway, the world's second-largest oil  
exporter. The government salts away billions of dollars in oil 
revenue every year in an escrow account. In neighboring Sweden, by 
contrast, the government is trying to find enough funds to keep its 
equally comprehensive welfare state from foundering. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most countries, there has been a lot of debate about how to  
maintain the pay-as-you-go welfare system as the population ages,'' 
said Aadne Cappelen, research director at the state agency 
Statistics Norway. ``With us, the problem is people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1990s, Norwegian politicians, embarrassed by  
thousands of people waiting for health and elderly care, voted to 
heavily increase health sector spending. Since 1990, the number of 
physicians at public hospitals has soared 36 percent, according to 
the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a shortage of nurses and unskilled hospital aides,  
specialists often end up pushing trolleys and filing paperwork, 
cutting into their time with patients, said the ministry's Erling 
Steen. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway has such low unemployment -- 2.9 percent last month -- that  
most Norwegians can pick and choose jobs. Few pick low-status, 
unskilled jobs in health and institutions for the elderly, such as 
retirement homes, where the demand for care is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting welfare programs would be political suicide, so  
officials in Norway are examining other options. Cappelen said 
Norway could send clients abroad for treatment or care, or increase 
wages to make jobs in institutions more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Another idea is to bring in guest workers: Cappelen, for one,  
suggested that Norway could encourage more immigration by those 
willing to accept the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But that suggestion has met with quick opposition from both the  
political left and right. Only 5.5 percent of Norway's population 
is of foreign origin, most from northern Europe. Norway stopped 
free immigration in 1975, except from the Nordic countries and the 
European Economic Area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the immigration policy to meet short-term labor needs  
is not the solution,'' said Carl I. Hagen, leader of right-wing 
Party of Progress, which wants strict limits on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Outsiders, mainly Swedes, Danes and Germans, are already filling  
key medical jobs, often on a temporary basis. Steen said 15 to 20 
percent of Norway's doctors are foreigners, that Sweden alone has 
provided thousands of nurses and that immigrants, often former 
refugees, are the backbone of unskilled labor at many institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are awfully dependent on them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And the problem is not expected to abate.  
</P>
<P>
	The local governments that run most health and retirement  
services say they'll need 85,000 new workers over the next decade, 
but that would be an impossible 80 percent of those expected to 
enter the workforce. Norway has fewer young people looking for work 
due to a low birth rate in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cappelen said Norway must consider a mixture of measures,  
including immigration, purchasing services aboard, encouraging 
older Norwegians to keep working and using taxes to change 
employment patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see young people happily working in cafes. But they don't  
want to work with old people and serve them,'' Cappelen said. ``But 
if we cut purchasing power through taxes, fewer people would eat 
out. That would mean fewer cafes and more people available to serve 
the elderly.''

<HEADLINE> 'Ricky Recorder' Software Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One of life's frustrations is to see a good idea badly done.  
That holds true in the computer world, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The good idea is software that teaches kids how to read music  
and play the recorder, a small woodwind instrument. The recorder is 
connected to the computer by a microphone, which enables the 
software to ``hear'' what the student is playing. 
</P>
<P>
	But that good idea hits some sour notes in ``Learn To Play Music  
With Ricky Recorder,'' a Windows CD-ROM from GVOX of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The package includes a first-rate Yamaha recorder and a good  
microphone. The software takes you through 12 interactive lessons 
and 32 exercises, and teaches 20 songs of the ``London Bridge'' and 
``Three Blind Mice'' variety. 
</P>
<P>
	But the software makes the user work too hard. For openers, it  
doesn't auto-install. The user is presented with a half-dozen or so 
icons labeled with a variation of ``setup,'' and the install 
process is slow. And the user learns how to adjust the sound only 
in the readme file -- and that's done by the Windows utility, not 
through the software. 
</P>
<P>
	The box says the minimum processor is a 100-megahertz Pentium,  
but the readme file and the company's Web site indicate it's 166 
megahertz. The user interface is cuter than it is intuitive, and 
unless you have waded through the readme file, you're not likely to 
guess that clicking on the she icon is how Step Play mode is 
toggled on and off. (In that mode, the computer shows you how to 
play a note and waits until you've played it.) 
</P>
<P>
	The software does deliver the basics of musical notation, and  
the fingering diagrams are clear. Ricky Recorder, the animated 
guide, is well-spoken but a bit -- well, wooden. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says the product, which retails at $49.95, is  
available also at its Web site, but beware: the UPS ground shipping 
charge is $15, about three times what the UPS Web site says such a 
package should cost from Philadelphia to suburban New York, and 
more than twice the cost to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	This is version 1.0 and because it is such a good idea, let's  
hope that it will be improved in later versions. Stay ``tuned.''

 *Pat on the back for Microsoft    	
</P>
<P>
	And now for a nice word about Microsoft -- which to some might be  
like saying Dracula has his softer side: The Natural Keyboard Pro, 
for about $75, is a great investment for those whose wrists hurt 
from typing. 
</P>
<P>
	It has 19 hot buttons, a split keyboard and a good feel for  
those of us who have been typing too long -- say, since the days 
when there was something called a ``typewriter.'' The keyboard also 
offers two USB ports, and user software to define hot keys. It's a 
good job, and a decent price for all the functionality.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Morrison Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Tommy  
Morrison pleaded innocent today to a variety of drug charges and 
will face trial Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The former WBO champion entered his plea before Judge John  
Lineberger. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison was arrested Sept. 16, less than a week after he was  
placed on probation for a Tulsa, Okla., drunken driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, the boxer was charged with cocaine possession,  
simultaneous possession of drugs and firearms, being a felon in 
possession of a firearm, possession of drug paraphernalia, 
misdemeanor possession of marijuana and driving while intoxicated. 
He also was charged with traffic violations that most likely will 
be handled in another court. 
</P>
<P>
	A charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute was  
dropped last week after prosecutors said they could not prove 
Morrison had any intent to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 10, Morrison received a two-year suspended sentence for  
drunken driving in Oklahoma. Morrison had pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, an Oklahoma jury convicted Morrison of driving under  
the influence and other charges related to a chain-reaction traffic 
accident that injured three people. He was ordered to spend time in 
treatment. He also avoided jail time on charges of drunken driving 
and speeding in Kansas in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison became the WBO's heavyweight champion in 1993 by  
defeating George Foreman. He had 40 knockouts during his career, 
the last in 1996 -- just after testing positive for the AIDS virus.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' McGarity Hurts Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys rookie wide receiver  
Wane McGarity dislocated his right shoulder in the second quarter 
against the New York Giants on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity was hurt early in the quarter making a tackle on Sam  
Garnes after the Giants safety had intercepted a pass by Troy 
Aikman at the New York 7-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth-round draft pick out of Texas, McGarity was in the  
lineup this week because of the spine injury sustained by Michael 
Irvin in last week's game against Philadelphia. McGarity had three 
catches for 36 yards before being hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys signed veteran Alvin Harper last week, but he was  
inactive for this week's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants rookie starting left guard Luke Petitgout, a first-round  
draft pick, did not return for the second half because of a 
sprained left ankle. He was replaced by Jason Whittle. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lost starting free safety George Teague in the third  
quarter with a neck injury. He walked off the field after the 
Giants' first possession of the quarter.
