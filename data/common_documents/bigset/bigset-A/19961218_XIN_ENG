<HEADLINE> Russia Exposes 400 Foreign Agents in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federal Security
Service (FSB) has exposed some 400 foreign agents and 39 of their
Russian accomplices in Russia in the past two years, FSB Director
Nikolai Kovalyov said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Kovalyov said more than 100
attempts to pass classified information to foregin countries have
been stopped, and FSB experts are currently investigating five
espionage cases.
</P>
<P>
"Among them (the agents and their accomplices) are a worker of
a Russian defense enterprise; Platon Obukhov, who collaborated
with the British intelligence service; a U.S. officer and agents
of the Israeli special service," he said, adding that "the list of
exposures is much longer, but I will not quote it in full."
</P>
<P>
Bearing in mind "foreign secret services are not expected to
curtail their activities in Russia next year," the FSB will see
the counterespionage operation as its priority in the coming 1997,
Kovalyov said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the Western countries' high interest in social,
economic, military and political information about Russia to "the
role and the place of Russia in the international community."
</P>
<P>
The FSB chief said he was concerned about the rising wave of
terrorism in the country, mostly unmotivated terrorism which
extremely complicates the FSB's investigative work.
</P>
<P>
He also said that organized crimes are posing a real threat to
the country's security, as criminals are lobbying the interests of
the shadow businesses in state bodies and bribing civil servants.
</P>
<P>
However, the FSB has actively cooperated with some foreign
secret services in 1996 by taking joint actions against terrorism,
organized crimes and illicit shipment of arms and drugs, Kovalyov
said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Chief Blasts Murder in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Security Council's
Secretary, Ivan Rybkin, today condemned the murder in Chechnya of
six Internation Red Cross representatives and demanded that the
Chechen leaders take measures to prevent such crimes and
provocations, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Chechen separatist leader, Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev, in Chechen capital of Grozny, Rybkin urged the
Chechen leaders to ensure the security of reporters and observers
representing international and Russian organizations while
performing their professional duties in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, Ruslan Kutayev, the Chechen coalition government
minister, called the murder of six medical workers in Novye Atagy,
southern Chechnya, "an intentional and planned provocation" aimed
at foiling the presidential and parliamentary elections in
Chechnya scheduled for January 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that it was not the last provocation and said
"other, graver ones should be expected."
</P>
<P>
The medical workers, nationals of Norway, Denmark, Canada,
Spain and New Zealand, were shot dead by unidentified gunmen early
this morning in the house where they lived in Novye Atagy. They
worked at a mobile hospital opened in the settlement by the
International Red Cross last September.
</P>
<P>
There are some 70 Red Cross representatives in Chechnya. They
will be moved to a camp in Nalchik, Russia's local republic of
Kabardino-Balkaria in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
At orders from the International Red Cross headquarters, a
plane left Moscow for Nalchik earlier today to evacuate the Red
Cross people from Chechnya, the Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Airlift Food to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- South African Air Force
(SAAF) will deliver 18 tons of food to famine-stricken people in
northeastern Kenya on Wednesday, Air force spokesman Mike Miles
said.
</P>
<P>
A C-130 Hercules aircraft carrying food is scheduled to leave
Waterkloof Air Base near Pretoria for Kenya at 7 A.M. tomorrow,
Miles said.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled assistance to Kenya, according to the spokesman,
was arranged through the Kuwait-based Africa Moslems Agency,
which has branches in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A large number of population in northeastern Kenya are
suffering from hunger as perenial drought went worse last month,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
If there is no rainfall in the region between November 15 and
20, there will be danger of famine, SAPA quoted Kenyan sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the northeastern region in Kenya, the semi-arid
districts of Tana River in the north, Garissa and Mandera in the
northeast, and Isiolo, Marsabit and Samburu in the northwest,
which are seriously affected by drought, also suffer from grain
shortage, SAPA said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Command Dispute Still Troubles NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The dispute between the
United States and France over who should take charge of NATO's
southern command in Europe would not be resolved in the alliance's
semi-annual meeting, a U.S. Senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
"This issue is not an agenda item and we do not anticipate it
will be resolved today or tomorrow," said the official who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
His remarks are a reiteration of Monday's statement by
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, who said that the dispute
had not soured the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner the issue is resolved, the better, but it should be
before the NATO summit scheduled for next July in Madrid, Spain,"
Perry reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to NATO, Robert Hunter, today told a press
briefing that decisions on the overall command structure will be
taken "as a package".
</P>
<P>
But he said that it would be very difficult to rearrange the
command structure at sub-regional level if the southern command
dispute could not be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
France has been pushing for the Naples-based southern command
to be headed by a European, reflecting the desire of the continent
to develop its own security identity within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, has ruled out giving up the
command, which is always headed by an American and currently
responsible for the American 6th Fleet and is integral to
Washington's Middle East policy.

STOCKHOLM, December 17 (Xinhua)-- Sweden decided today to join
NATO's follow-up peace-keeping force in Bosnia, which will replace
the present Implementation Force (IFOR) there.
</P>

republic.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish soldiers will be included in the Nordic-Polish
brigade.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the Swedish contribution toward the force is

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Child-Care Spending Vary Widely in States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A study by a group urging
more government spending for child care says more than half the
states in the United States are spending less than 50 cents of
every 100 dollars in taxes on child care and early education
programs.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of 1994 state spending records, the latest complete
figures available, by the Children's Defense Fund found that in
many states -- even some of those at the top of the spending scale
-- there was a waiting list for families seeking child-care and
educational assistance.
</P>
<P>
"This shows us that, even though states have argued that they
should have greater control over spending on social programs, some
states are putting a very low priority on child care," said Gina
Adams, a CDF child-care analyst who helped compile the study.
</P>
<P>
The state-spending issue is particularly compelling now, since
the massive welfare overhaul law signed in August by President
Bill Clinton gives states unprecedented authority to define their
own welfare programs and the right to decide how most of the
federal government's welfare money will be spent.
</P>
<P>
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that
under the federal bill, there will be a 1.4 billion dollars
shortfall in federal child-care contributions.
</P>
<P>
The study attempted to measure a state's commitment to child
care and education programs by evaluating all spending that the
state itself had the ability to affect -- tax dollars raised by
the state, federal matching dollars and all federal contributions
that states chose to spend on child-care or education instead of
something else.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 13 million children nationwide spend part of every day
in the care of someone other than their parents.
</P>
<P>
Numerous studies have shown that two of the biggest obstacles
people face in staying off welfare is a lack of government-funded
child care and medical coverage, mainly because most newly former
welfare recipients are working at wages too low to pay for these
costly items.
</P>
<P>
One problem is that 20 states failed to take advantage of every
federal matching-fund dollar available too them -- or, federal tax
dollars that are released to states only when the states
themselves hit certain spending levels for various social-welfare
programs.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Up Sharply in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts jumped
by 9.2 percent in November, the fastest increase in 16 months, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gain is the best performance since July 1995 and followed
two consecutive drops in September and October.
</P>
<P>
The report said that housing starts reached the seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.51 million in November, a big increase
from 1.39 million in October.
</P>
<P>
Single-family starts rose by 7.6 percent to a rate of 1.12
million in November, while multi-family construction increased by
15.1 percent to 350,000 units, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the starts jumped by 20.8 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 337,000, the largest increase since March
of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Starts rose by 12 percent in the South to a rate of 682,000.
They held steady in the West at a rate of 364,000 and fell 2.2
percent in the Northeast to 131,000.
</P>
<P>
For the year so far, 1.38 million single- and multi-family
homes were started in the U.S., up by 9.6 percent from the first
11 months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A drop in 30-year mortgage rates during the fall contributed to
the rebound, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, housing permits, a sign of future construction
activity in the country, rose by 3.9 percent in November to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million, the biggest gain
in a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will meet today to consider
changes in interest rates. But many analysts say that the latest
economic reports will keep the Fed leaving the interest rate
unchanged as the U.S. economy slowed down in the third quarter of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Greek Consumers Warned of Inferior Products on Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek consumers have been
warned of inferior products in large quantities which are flooding
the Greek market.
</P>
<P>
The country's Consumers' Institute (INKA) warned today that
used products "baptized" as new and imported "industrial trash"
are to be found in many places on the market, even more so these
days in view of the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
According to the INKA, used computers and home appliances are
presented as new, thus misleading consumers and creating unfair
competition. It also found that home appliances and cooking
utensils made in foreign countries and in Greece are presented as
being made in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The problem becomes more acute in December due to seasonal
shops and open-air selling points, but it is also recorded in
regular retail stores.
</P>
<P>
In addition, industrial trash is flooding the market, not only
due to Christmas' inflated needs but also to the decrease in the
purchasing power of consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Industrial trash concerns mainly products of lower quality and
food made of cheaper raw materials," INKA President Haralambos
Kouris said. "These products are usually anonymous or of an
unknown brand or their brand name resembles that of a well known
brand."
</P>
<P>
The INKA called on the department concerned to increase market
checks and impose fines.

ISLAMABAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Muslim League
Junejo group (PML-J) and Nawaz group (PML-N) may form a sort of
affiliation before the February 3 elections, PML-J President
Nawabzada Hoti disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his first-ever press conference after assuming the
presidency of PML-J in Peshawar, the capital city of the North
West Frontier Province of Pakistan, Hoti said that PML-J had
agreed to affiliate with PML-N.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have three options -- merger, affiliation and
support."
</P>
<P>
"After obtaining permission from the party leaders of all the
four provinces, I will hold talks with PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on
the matter," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The matter of merger of the two factions would be taken up in
the post election scenario, he added.
</P>
<P>
PML-N, the major group of the Pakistan Muslim League, had been
the ruling party of Pakistan from 1990 to 1993 and the major
opposition party from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
PML-J allied with Pakistan People's Party led by Benazir Bhutto
after the 1993 general elections and provided Bhutto with enough
seats in the National Assembly for forming her government.

<P>
ATHENS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek civil servants today
started a 24-hour strike and held protest rallies and marches in
Athens and the northern port city of Salonika.
</P>
<P>
The action by the civil servants took place one day after
workers throughout the country started a week-long strike Monday,
which signaled the start of a week of nation-wide strike wave
against the government's tough 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
The strikes, all aimed at securing better pay, precede the vote
in parliament on the budget scheduled for midnight Saturday
following a five-day debate.
</P>
<P>
Schools around Greece were closed after teachers called a
48-hour strike for Monday and today. In Athens, teachers staged a
march to the Education Ministry to press for their demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, customs officials began a three-day walkout today
and doctors have been on a seven-day strike since last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The streets of Athens have been filled these days with the
chants of unhappy workers, pensioners, students and customs
employees protesting against the tight income policy.
</P>
<P>
Even diplomats, considered the most loyal of civil servants,
have joined the strikes to protest against a new tax on an
allowance given to diplomats serving abroad to cover living and
traveling expenses.
</P>
<P>
Bank employees also held a three-hour work stoppage today.

<TEXT>
<P>
(By Liu Zhongya and Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A China Commodity Fair was
started here today by both Chinese and Kenyan officials who
promised to strengthen bilateral economic and trading ties at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Kenyan Minister for Commerce and
Industry Kirugi M'Mukindia said he welcomed the opening of the
China Commodity Fair here and thanked the Chinese government for
its support to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government fully supports the development of
economic and trade relations between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged China to play a more and more important
role in the South-South cooperation which he said is very helpful
to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
M'Mukindia said Kenya has liberalized its economy, which is
providing better chances for trade and investment, noting that
Chinese investors should take this opportunity to be involved
into Kenya's development and construction.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that cooperation between medium and small-sized
enterprises of the two countries should be enhanced. Chinese
medium and small-sized enterprises should be encouraged to set up
joint ventures here with Kenyan enterprises, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Minister Liu Xiangdong from the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, on his part, said the
seven-day fair is being held at a time when China and Kenya are
enjoying good economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the purpose for holding such a large scale fair
in Kenya is to promote cooperation between Kenyan and Chinese
business people and enterprises and to introduce Chinese
commodities to the Kenyan people, so that bilateral economic and
trade cooperation will be further promoted."
</P>
<P>
The large-scale fair, with 77 standard stands and covering an
area of 2,000 square meters, has attracted eight national import
and export corporations and many companies from 13 provinces and
municipalities from China.
</P>
<P>
At the fair which runs up to December 23, a wide range of
commodities are displayed, including garments, footwears, fabrics
and textiles, small hardwares, manual tools, small farm
machinery, ceramics, household electrical appliances, tractors,
automobiles and furnitures.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Returns From Nairobi Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe said
today a committee of four African Heads of State and Government
has been set up in Nairobi Summit to work out strategies to end
the crises in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made the remarks to reporters at the airport here after
attending the two-day African summit on the Great Lakes region
held in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The summit chose a committee formed by the leaders of
Zimbabwean, South Africa, Kenya and Cameroon to spearhead the
peace mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the committee, which would include
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim, would contact as many people concerned as
possible in a bid to find a lasting solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We should get into action as soon as circumstances allow...
but at the moment President Mobutu Sese Seko is still in Europe.
We do not know whether he will arrive today or not," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Zaire boycotted all the two summits on the Zairean crises as
his parliament has passed a law forbidding participation in any
such meetings so long as part of the country was "occupied by
foreign forces."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said while some western countries, particularly the
United States, had their own ideas about handling the situation
in the region, it was the regional players who held the key to
achieving peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit called on the international community to
give increased assistance to refugees and displaced people,
especially helping those who had returned to Rwanda to rebuild
their homes.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Tobacco Farmers Warn Govt on Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco farmers
today warned the delay to remove a new tax imposed on growers and
merchants this year could jeopardize the industry which is the
largest foreign currency earner in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association said the 10 percent tobacco
levy, equally shared among growers and buyers, was the major
handicap to future expansion of the industry.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of the tax will result in lower production
and foreign currency earnings as market forces reduce prices back
to their long-term trend line," said a press release of the
association.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, one of the world's leading exporter of flue-cured
tobacco after Brazil and the United States, earns about 600
million U.S. Dollars from tobacco exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 17 (xinhua) -- The Greek government said today
the 10 proposals put forward by British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind for a Cyprus solution contained "positive elements"
which corresponded to positions of Nicosia and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas stressed however that
Rifkind's proposals expressed British policy. A comprehensive
proposal of the Cyprus government already existed, on the basis of
which Greece also wished a solution to be found, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind outlined the 10 "elements" at a press conference Monday
at the end of a two-day visit to Cyprus, during which he held
talks with President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
According to Rifkind, a solution should be based on a "bizonal,
bicommunal federation in conformity with the high level agreements
between the two communities and U.N. Security Council
resolutions."

<HEADLINE> SADC Discusses Prevention of Unused Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A four-day seminar on disposal
and prevention of unused pesticides was opened here today.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Assistant Director of the Food
Security Unit of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) Joyce Muzondiwa said huge stocks of unused pesticides
continue to cause a grave threat to the environment and health in
Africa and the Near East.
</P>
<P>
She said unused pesticide stocks in Africa exceeded 15,000
tons, including large volumes of DDT which was banned because
of its persistence in damaging the environment and its ability to
accumulate in food.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is grave in Africa because there are little or no
disposal facilities and storage conditions are often
sub-standard," said Muzondiwa.
</P>
<P>
Some 35 delegates from southern and east Africa attended the
seminar which is aimed at creating more awareness about the
problem of unwanted pesticides and to introduce technical
guidelines.

JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Racial tension has been
raised as some white farmers in South Africa's Kwazulu/Natal
Province have hired soldiers of the former counter-insurgency
unit, KOEVOET, for guards.
</P>
<P>
The apartheid KOEVOET soldiers are now patrolling farms in the
Midlands area of Kwazulu-natal after a spate of farm murders.
</P>
<P>
Some of the white farmers said they even plan to use guards
linked to the apartheid mercenary hiring outfit, the Executive
Outcomes Company, which deploys soldiers of fortune in Angola and
Sierra Leone recently.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are also calling for the return of the death
penalty and a state of emergency to stamp out crime in new South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the police said far more blacks are being killed than
the whites in Kwazulu/Natal Province which is the homeland of
Zulu, the biggest black tribe in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia's 2 Entities Urged to Introduce Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A prominent U.S. economist
has urged Bosnia's two entities -- the Muslim-Croat federation and
Republika Srpska -- to introduce a single currency and a joint
central bank to operate in the next six years as a "currency
board."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expert, Steve Hanke, said in Sarajevo today that a
strong monetary policy and other reforms are necessary for the
stability of a single currency in Bosnia as a condition for
upholding the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Hanke, who has already helped Argentina, Estonia and Lithuania
to reform and stabilize their currencies, predicted that a single
currency in Bosnia, if all conditions are met, will be one of the
factors of stability in the Balkan region and will enable the
inflow of necessary investments and aid for the renewal of the
Bosnian economy, according to a Tanjug news agency report from
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Under the provisions of the Dayton agreement, Bosnia should
have a single currency and a joint central bank, to be organized
in the first years on the principles of a "currency board."
</P>
<P>
In such a monetary system, the money in circulation will be
covered by the central bank's foreign currency reserves and become
the national currency with a fixed exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
However, one year after the signing of the Dayton agreement,
the currency board is still not operating. The paying of the
greatest part of the promised international aid for the
reconstruction of Bosnia, totaling 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, is
made conditional on the central bank to become operational, Hanke
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "currency board" will be a key test for the
peace process in Bosnia. If the monetary system is not
established, it will be a signal that the Dayton agreement has
failed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Muslim-Croat Federation and of Republika
Srpska have so far failed to agree on several issues related to
the central bank, including how the joint currency will look like.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has appointed Frenchman Serge
Robert as governor of the Bosnian Central Bank. He is joined by
three local members to form the executive board of the bank.

<HEADLINE> Report on London Metal Exchange to Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Investments
Board (SIB), Britain's leading financial markets watchdog, said
Monday that it would release its report on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The LME asked the SIB to carry out a review of the market after
the Japanese Sumitomo Corporation scandal hit commodities markets
in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese trading house lost 2.6 billion US dollars in the
scandal in which its chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, who has
been fired since then, was accused of running up the losses in
unauthorized trading.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the report would include two parts, one on
recommendations for reform, and the other a review of all the
submissions it received.
</P>
<P>
The reforms which may be suggested by the SIB in the report
include a daily report of inventory movements, revelation of
ownership of those inventories in warehouses and more transparency
in market positions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, changes in the composition of the LME board, which
is dominated by broker members, may also be advised.
</P>
<P>
The LME dominates world metals trading with 95 percent of the
world's copper futures and 100 percent in most other metals.

ANKARA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today criticized a
resolution by the European Union Parliament (EUP) which accused
the country of infringing upon human rights and freedom of the
press.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Speaker Mustafa Kulamli said in a written statement
that the resolution adopted by the EUP on December 12 was
"unjust without any good intention."
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey strongly opposed the resolution made by
the EUP.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel also said in a
statement that the resolution was adopted on the basis of rumors
instead of facts, describing it as "a new example of the biased
and untrue attitude of this institution against Turkey."
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the EUP opposed the Turkish
government's planned measures to impose a press censorship in
the country, warning the move would damage relations between the
EU and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The EUP also called on the Turkish government to abandon its
bid to adopt a new law to restrict the country's press circles.
</P>
<P>
Akbel denied that such a plan had been presented to the
Turkish parliament, saying that the EUP's resolution would serve
nothing but harm the Turkish people's confidence in the body.

NICOSIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
welcomed a statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton reiterating
his commitment to work toward a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday after the conclusion of a U.S.-European
Union summit in the White House, Clinton said he would "try to

</P>
<P>
"The fact that President Clinton reiterates his personal
interest in finding a solution to the Cyprus problem is
something we consider positive," government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said at his daily press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Cyprus problem was brought up in the meeting
because of the island's application for accession to the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated the government's view that the
U.S. and the EU must coordinate their efforts to facilitate a
Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Before the presidential election, President Clinton reportedly
assured Cyprus of his personal commitment for a solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split 1974 when Turkey sent troops and took
control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> New Internet Pricing Leads to Communication Jam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A new Internet pricing system
adopted recently by major net service providers in the U.S. led to
increasingly frequent jam on the Internet and telephone system.
</P>
<P>
Almost all Internet users in the U.S. can now enjoy a monthly
flat rate of only 19.95 U.S. dollars for staying on line for
unlimited time. It is offered by big companies like the America
Online, the Microsoft Network (MSN) and Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
The New York Time reported today that this new "all you can
eat" price is rapidly causing indigestion among network-access
providers, phone companies and many customers.
</P>
<P>
Since America Online adopted the new pricing, its subscribers
had increased from 7 million to 9 million -- totaling 3.1 million
hours of connection time, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Because many people are having so much trouble getting on line,
once they do get a connection, many deliberately keep the line
tied up, even when they go for lunch or during their sleep.
</P>
<P>
"It is as if a diner at a fixed-price buffet had someone hang
onto his seat after lunch, so he could still have a place for
dinner," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
For the Internet enthusiasts, the all-you-can-eat price plans
are prompting residential phone customers to add second and even
third phone lines.
</P>
<P>
America Online is also working around the clock to add phone
lines, computers, modems and network connections to deal with the
surge.
</P>
<P>
The phone companies are likely to spend millions of dollars to
increase the network capacity, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Nynex Corporation, the regional Bell company for New York
and New England, estimated that the number of additional lines was
up 14 percent over the past year.

<HEADLINE> UK Economic Prospects Best for 30 Years: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain is set to enjoy the
best period of sustained growth and low inflation for 30 years,
according to the latest report by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The OECD forecast in its end-of-year assessment of the major
economies that the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in
Britain is set to strengthen next year helped by stronger consumer
spending and a pick-up in investment.
</P>
<P>
It predicted a UK GDP growth of 3.3 percent in 1997 and 3.0
percent in 1998, faster than the US, Germany, France and Italy,
with only Canada and Japan of the Group of Seven countries
forecast to grow faster during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the UK inflation will fall below the
target level of 2.5 percent or less set by the government and
remain there without early and steep rises in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
This can be achieved with a mere quarter point base rates rise
in the second half of next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is forecast to fall below 7.0 percent of the labor
force in 1998, its lowest level in eight years and the third
lowest among the big economies after Japan and the US.
</P>
<P>
However, the report drew attention to the government's failure
to reduce the public sector deficit as planed.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the public sector deficit next year, the
reference year for membership of a single European currency, will
be 3.7 percent of GDP against the 3.0 percent limit set under the
Maastricht Treaty and will fall to 3.0 percent in 1998.

for their extradition, absence of serious move on the part of
the German government to combat terrorism, export of weapons of
mass destruction to Iraq used in Iraqi missile and chemical
attacks on Iran in the course of the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988),
especially within 1985-1988, and the damages inflicted on Iran
as a result of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The commission also assigned the government to examine the
issue of German conventional arms exports to the region, sale of
weapons of mass destruction to the regional states, and lack of
seriousness of Germany in the campaign to make the Gulf and the
Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It also required the government to look into the current
violation of human rights in Germany especially racism and the
status of Iranians living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
It raised the subject of German withdrawal from the economic
agreements reached between the two countries, such as the German
move of leaving Bushehr and Qazvin projects unfinished.
</P>
<P>
It urged the government to determine the extent of economic,
political, cultural, regional and international cooperation
between Iran and the European Union (EU) and German capacity to
go ahead with such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It said that the government's report on the above-mentioned
issues would help determine the prospects of Iran-Germany
relations by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that ties between Iran and Germany are
likely to be strained by the outcome of a trial taking place in
Karlsruhe concerning the assassination of Kurdish dissidents in
a Berlin restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The most important issue for Iran is that Germany has accused
Iranian top leaders, including Ali Khamenei and Hashemi
Rafsanjani, of taking responsibility for the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Judiciary Chief Mohammad Yazdi
were present at today session of the Parliament Commission.
</P>
<P>
Velayati elaborated on the Iranian-German relations from
various point of view and emphasized the need for protection of
the existing relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi put forward legal reasoning that German prosecutor's
statement has been in contravention of international
regulations.

<HEADLINE> Israel Unveils Plan To Boost Development Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government
today announced a new plan to encourage economic growth in the
country's development towns.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu made the announcement at a
press conference held together with Minister of Finance Dan
Meridor and Minister of Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the government will allocate half a
billion shekels (about 150 million U.S. dollars) annually for the
development towns, which are largely located in the Negev Desert
and remote Galilee areas.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that at the heart of the program is a shift of
emphasis from encouraging investment in the physical side to
developing "the greatest assets of the towns -- manpower."
</P>
<P>
Meridor explained that in so doing, "we can change development
towns by giving more money to the human side."
</P>
<P>
To further encourage growth, the government will also
streamline marketing and trade for industry in the
towns. Specific factories in the rural areas will be exempted
from taxation for two years in order to encourage absorption of
investments.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for improving infrastructure in the areas
in question.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu declared that the aim of the plan is to improve the
quality of life in these towns, with the ultimate goal of
dispersing the country's population from the coastal concentrated
urban centers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Expresses Concern Over Current </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman today expressed his deep concern over the tense
situation that Israel is facing both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of the Red Sea resort city of Eilat in the
south, President Weizman, ceremonial head of the state, told
reporters that he was not sleeping well recently because of the
tense and stormy situation in Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the president called on the Israeli public not to be
despondent, saying that Israel was not yet on the brink of
war. He said what was necessary now was to work toward the
permanent settlement with the Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
Weizman's remarks were obvious, indirect criticism of the
Likud government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, whose
hardline policies have led to tensions between Israel and the PA
and the other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government has created a tension both
domestically and internationally following the militants' attack
last Wednesday in which three radical Palestinian gunmen killed
a Jewish mother and her 12-year-old son in a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reacted to the incident in a rare tough manner by
immediately declaring new policies to grant priority to
expanding the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
This move has aroused strong protests not only from the PA and
Israel's Arab neighbors such as Egypt and Jordan, but also from
its closest ally the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, Egyptians and Jordanians have warned that
the expansion of settlements could lead to new round of
violence. And U.S. President Bill Clinton also fired his first
warning shot after reelection Monday, saying Israel's settlement
policy was not helpful to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, a crisis of confidence has also emerged for the
Netanyahu government. Israeli media recently exposed the dispute
between Netanyahu and the security branches over the
responsibility for the decision to open an exit to the
underground tunnel in eastern Jerusalem that sparked the
September Israelis-Palestinian bloodshed in which over 70 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Ami Ayalon, head of Israel's secret service the General
Security Service, was reportedly considering resignation because
Netanyahu openly placed the responsibility on him over the
tunnel issue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu disclosed that it was Ayalon who encouraged him to
open the exit on several occasions. Ayalon, enraged by
Netanyahu's move, was forced Monday to admit his responsibility
over the tunnel issue.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, taking advantage of the latest
developments, escalating their embarrassing campaign against
Netanyahu. The Labor and Meretz tabled a non-confidence in the
Knesset (Parliament) Monday, though it was rejected in a vote of
21-58.
</P>
<P>
In another bid to protest Netanyahu's policies, 40 Labor and
Meretz Knesset members today presented a motion to dismiss
Netanyahu from the post of prime minister. They claimed that
Netanyahu has shown his incompetence and failure in the areas of
diplomacy, security and economic affairs since he took office in
June.
</P>
<P>
The motion, presented according to the new Basic Law, is to be
put to vote in the Knesset plenum in 30 days. However, it seems
unlikely to be passed as the law requires 80 votes of the
120-seat Knesset to dismiss the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> S.Africans on Alert Against Ebola Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The monitoring of Ebola
Fever "contacts" has come to an end this weekend with nobody
being found infected with the fatal disease, said a statement
issued by Gauteng Provincial government here today.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring was made among 380 people who had, for one
reason or another, contacted Marilyn Lahana, the only vicitim of
Ebola fever in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ebola is one the most virulent diseases known to human being
thus far. Its early symptoms include headache, vomiting and
diarrhoea, followed by profuse bleeding from the orifices, skin
and internal organs.
</P>
<P>
Ebola fever was reportedly imported into South Africa in late
October when Clement Mambana from Gabon was treated in a private
clinic in Johannesburg. Nobody knew Mambana was a Ebola virus
carrier at the time.
</P>
<P>
Lahana, a 46-year-old nurse in the clinic, unfortunately
became infected in the course of nursing Mambana. While Mambana
survived Ebola fever, Lahana died from complications on November
24.
</P>
<P>
The death of Lahana has for some time resulted in a great
shock to South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring of Ebola Fever contacts taken by the local
health authorities is apparently one of precautions following
Lahana's death.
</P>
<P>
The fact that there is no further infection among those who
cared for Mambana and Lhana is extremely encouraging, Liz Floyd,
Gauteng Director for Aids and Communicalbe Diseases said.
</P>
<P>
She said with international travel on the increase, South
Africa's only effective defence against deadly diseases is to be
more vigilant and to apply infection control measures
systematically in all appropriate circumstances.

CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt reaffirmed today that the
priority of the privatization program underway has been given to
expanding the base of ownership and readjusting the financial and
administrative structures.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri made the statement
when meeting with members of the board of the Egyptian Trade
Union Federation (ETUF) and leaders of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also briefed labor leaders on the giant
national projects being carried out to develop southern Egypt and
the establishment of a new delta in the western desert to develop
the Gulf of Suez area.
</P>
<P>
These projects, which include agricultural, industrial,
tourism and infrastructure plans, will provide thousands of job
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri told the labor union leaders that the government was
drafting a new unified labor law, which will be referred to the
People's Assembly at its current session after reviewing it by
the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The new law provides for several benefits for workers,
particularly health and social services, he said.
</P>
<P>
The reassuring of the public about the government's commitment
to the welfare of government employees and expansion of the base
of the enterprises' ownership came amid warnings of massive
layoffs and private monopolies as a result of privatization.
</P>
<P>
The government has been cautious in moving toward the goal of
ending state ownership of 314 enterprises since privatization
became the centerpiece of Egypt's domestic and economic agenda
since Ganzouri announced his cabinet in January.

PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- France will maintain the tough
immigration law adopted since 1993 to attain the aim of "zero
irregular immigration," said French Interior Minister Jean-Louis
Debre today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling rightwing majority today rejected at the National
Assembly two motions by Socialist and Communist deputies to
abolish the 1993 immigration law drafted by former Interior
Minister Charles Pasqua.
</P>
<P>
Debre also defended a draft amendment of the Pasqua law which
will simplify procedure for expelling paperless immigrants and
requires visa appliers to show mayoral certificates of their
French hosts' addresses.
</P>
<P>
"It is this furrow we are going to dig deeper further. The
reorientation, operated over the past two years after years of
laxness, is more valid than ever for the future,"said Debre.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist deputy Julien Dray today proposed an amnesty for
all paperless immigrants by granting them French citizenship,
while Communist deputy Andre Gerin called for the revival of the
old immigration policy of 1945 which allowed in immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Debre rejected the two leftist motions as "illusional" and
"irresponsible."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mixed Feelings for Angola's Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- All indications show that the
peace process in Angola is coming closer to the last victory, but
some worrying problems remain in the process.
</P>
<P>
Angola's Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura, who is paying a
visit to Portugal, announced in Lisbon on Monday that a new
Angolan government of national unity and reconciliation will be
sworn in at the end of this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
The office-taking of the new government signalizes that peace
process in Angola enters a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Recently, great progress has been made in resolving military
problems in the peace process though joint efforts by two warring
sides in Angola.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, the former rebel UNITA movement announced in a
statement that its troops had been assembled completely and all
their weapons used in the civil war had been handed in.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos issued
an order to appoint high-ranking UNITA officers to new posts in
the national unified army, including Deputy Minister of Defense,
Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Deputy
Chief of the General Staff of the Army and Commander of the
Luanda Command.
</P>
<P>
The solution of military problems has pushed political issues
on top of the agenda of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Concerned parties will have to resolve four major
political problems: UNITA seats in the National Assembly, the
power building throughout the country, the formation of a new
government of national unity and the political status for UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The political status for UNITA leader Savimbi is the most
thorny problem at present. If not resolved properly, the problem
will directly affect the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government proposed that two vice presidents be
installed in the new government and Savimbi will serve as second
vice president. But the proposal was rejected by the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
After that, a proposal by the UNITA that Savimbi act as leader
of the oppositions of Angola was also opposed by the government.
</P>
<P>
At present, the two sides are still holding negotiations on
the problem under the mediation of the UN Peace Verification
Mission in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here observed that it is fairly possible to resolve
the political status of Savimbi after joint efforts and
compromise by the two sides are made.

Rifkind's elements. We have our own views, and we agree with
some of the points he has made and disagree with others,"
government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told his daily press
briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the ten-point document is not intended
to be seen as common ground between the positions of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides but instead as "an outline of
Britain's views which could form the basis for progress."
</P>
<P>
"We still need a lot of work in the context of an
intensive preparatory process to hope for an agreement between
the two sides on the main aspects of the Cyprus question
(security, guarantees, territory and constitutional matters)," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Monday at the end of his
two-day visit to the island, Rifkind outlined Britain's position
on the main aspects that make up the Cyprus question and
called for a comprehensive settlement based on a bizonal,
bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
He also advocated a single international personality for the
federate state that will emerge from negotiations and backed
international guarantees as may be agreed by the parties.
</P>
<P>
On Cyprus' prospect for accession to the European Union
(EU), Rifkind indicated he favored membership talks to be
conducted after a federation is established.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said he agreed with Rifkind's position that the
solution of the problem must be based on U.N. resolutions
and the notion of a bizonal, bicommunal federation and backed
also the principle of political equality, which is not equated
with numerical equality.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the separate referenda, the spokesman said
"we have always supported the idea of separate referenda, but
it must be made clear that the Republic of Cyprus cannot be
dissolved, because, if the result of these referenda is
negative, that which will remain is the Cyprus Republic."
</P>
<P>
On the security issue, he said the government backs the
demilitarization of the island and the stationing of an
international force to ensure the implementation of a settlement
and safeguard peace.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said guarantees for a federal Cyprus could
increase in numbers and abolish the right of unilateral
intervention on the part of Turkey. The present system of
guarantees names Greece, Turkey and Britain as the three
guarantor powers.
</P>
<P>
On the territorial issue, Cassoulides said a settlement must
allow the return of two thirds of the Greek Cypriot refugees
to their homes under Greek Cypriot administration and secure the
right to return and to property for the remaining third.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Rifkind's position relating to EU accession
prospects, Cassoulides said "we adhere to the EU decision
stipulating that accession talks with Cyprus will begin six
months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed "if we reach a settlement, then the
Federal Republic of Cyprus will negotiate the terms of
accession. If not, the internationally recognised government of
the Republic will conduct the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and took
control of 37 percent of the island following a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Public Security Arouses Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Defense Headquarters
today expressed concern over the state of public security in the
country, especially the increase in the incidence of bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters have put in place certain measures to
beef up security, said Godwin Ugbo, deputy director of defense
information here today without giving any details.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman made the remarks following an explosion
Monday morning which destroyed a car in the convoy of the Lagos
state administrator and left three persons seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Explosion of bombs was rare Nigeria until October 19, 1986
when a parcel bomb snuffed the life of Dele Giwa, a renowned
journalist and founding editor-in-chief of the country's much
read "Newswatch" weekly.
</P>
<P>
And Nigerians have since had to witness bomb explosions in
offices and homes of notable citizens, including high ranking
military officers, particularly since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Bomb blasts are recorded not only in Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial center and former capital where there live a big
number of notable citizens, but only in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
On January 18 this year, the Durbar Hotel in Kaduna, northern
Nigeria, was bombed, followed less than 24 hours later by another
bomb explosion at the international wing of the airport in Kano
State, also in the north.
</P>
<P>
The plane crash near Kano in which Ibrahim Abacha, the son of
the head of state General Sani Abacha, and 13 others died was
suspected to have exploded before it crashed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Monday's explosion which the Lagos State
Administrator Mohammed Buba Marwa escaped unhurt, a bomb planted
in the car killed the assistant general manager (security) of the
Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria and his cousin in Lagos on
November 14.
</P>
<P>
Also last month, there was a bomb scare at the Defense
Headquarters based in Lagos, which houses the Nigerian army, navy
and air force headquarters.
</P>
<P>
This year's bomb blasts also included one on April 11 in
Lagos' Ikeja Cantonment, a strategic military barracks, one two
weeks later at the Nigeria Air Force base also in Lagos, and two
others in June in the Defense Industries Corporation Complex in
Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
Following Monday's explosion, security was beefed up at the
Defense Headquarters and an emergency security council meeting of
Lagos State was summoned.
</P>
<P>
The police have arrested six suspects in connection with the
bomb blast and are busy carrying out investigations into the
incident, which the defense spokesman said has not yet been
reported officially to the Defense Headquarters.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: US New Administration's Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An atmosphere of anxiety is
prevailing the Arab world with regard to the new
U.S. administration's Middle East policy since the appointment of
Madeline Albright by President Bill Clinton as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries accuse Albright of pursuing a hostile attitude
toward the Arabs at the U.N. Security Council where she is
renowned for her hard stances when Arab issues come up for
debate, particularly in the cases of Iraq, Libya and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Amid rumors that she is a Jew, the appointment of Albright
casts doubts that she will take pro-Israeli positions. This will
have a negative effect on Arab-Israeli negotiations and on the
peace process at a time when Arab parties are hopeful that the
U.S. administration will take a strong attitude toward the
Israeli Likud government of Binyamin Netanyahu to resume the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here point out that Arab fears of Albright
have actually increased as she has openly supported Israel and
obstructed several Arab diplomatic campaigns at the Security
Council to condemn Israel, particularly on the issue of Israel's
attack against a U.N. post in Qana in south Lebanon. The attack
killed at least 91 Lebanese civilians in April.
</P>
<P>
Albright has also reportedly used the veto power to make a
draft resolution aborted which upholds that Israeli confiscation
of Arab land in Jerusalem is illegal.
</P>
<P>
Besides Albright, Clinton's appointment of William Cohen, also
a Jew, as U.S. Defense Secretary, will prompt the Arab leaders
who are pinning great hopes on a more effective and positive
U.S. role in the region to be quite cautious.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital of
Damascus say that much of the Arab pessimism not only stems from
the appointment of Albright and William Cohen, but also from the
new U.S. administration's priorities during Clinton's second term
which are expected to be devoted to economy and security.
</P>
<P>
However, some Arab diplomatic sources believe that the Clinton
government will be committed to the supreme U.S. policy which is
based on the establishment of peace in the Mideast region,
because this is in the interest of the U.S..

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition Claims Pairing Vote "Unfair" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Labor and
Liberal Democrat parties are to suspend all pairing arrangements
with the ruling Tories from the return of the Commons in January,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Donald Dewar of the Labor and Archie Kirkwood of the Liberal
Democrats told a joint news conference here this afternoon they
had discovered the double counting after the government survived a
key vote on EU fishing quota on Monday by 11 votes.
</P>
<P>
They accused the ruling Tory of double-pairing Tory MPs with
opposition MPs to give them an unfair advantage in the crucial
vote.
</P>
<P>
Pairing is the system whereby an MP is matched to an opposite
MP, if one does not go to a vote, neither does the other.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party bid to defeat the Tory government in
the vote -- the first test the Tory faced since losing its overall
majority in the House of Commons --was rejected by 316 votes to
305.
</P>
<P>
The end of pairing will cause inconvenience for Tory MPs in the
next few months at the very least and make it harder for Prime
Minister John Major to pass legislation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Bruton Call for IRA Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton today called for a cease-fire
by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to clear the way for its
political ally, Sinn Fein, to gain a role in the Northern
Ireland's peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I want to reiterate my call for the IRA to institute a
cease-fire in words as well as deeds," Clinton told reporters as
he was starting a second day meeting with Bruton at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"If they do that, I am convinced that Sinn Fein will be invited
to participate in the talks," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Talks on Northern Ireland's future began in June with the
participation of nine local parties. But the Sinn Fein party was
barred from the talks because its allies in the outlawed IRA ended
a cease-fire in February with a truck-bomb explosion in London.
</P>
<P>
The IRA claimed that it resumed bombing campaign because the
British government had refused to let Sinn Fein into the talks
without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "They can't succeed unless there is a cease-fire,
an end to the violence, and we ultimately have inclusive talks."
</P>
<P>
He praised both the British and Irish governments for their
efforts in the peace process. "We're in a rough patch" now,
Clinton said, but progress is possible if "we just keep at it."
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Clinton, Bruton said he saw a "window of
opportunity" to ensure Sinn Fein's place at the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
"A cease-fire now is the right choice for the Republican
movement to make," Bruton said. "The window is never closed, but
there are times when it is more open than other times."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Decides to Build More Nuclear Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of Energy and
Natural Resources Recai Kutan disclosed here today that Turkey
would build several more nuclear plants in the coming decades in
a bid to "save the country from darkness."
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement at a press conference for
the construction of its first nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
According to Afif Demirkiran, general director of the
state-run Turkish Electricity Generation and Transmission
Corporation (TEAS), the tender for the construction of the first
nuclear plant would expire on June 30 of next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of companies from Sweden, the United
States, France, Japan, Canada as well as Germany were encouraged
to join the bidding.
</P>
<P>
The tender is open to any kind of reactor with minimum 600
megawatt output including pressurized-water reactors,
boiling-water reactors as well as heavy-water reactors, according
to the TEAS general director.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which is estimated to cost a total of 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars, will be built either as a single unit with a
capacity of 1,200 megawatts or two equal units each with a
capacity of 600 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Turkey announced its plan to build the nuclear
plant, several environmental protection organizations expressed
their strong opposition to the program, warning they would take
joint actions to block the construction of the plant.
</P>
<P>
In response to protests from the environmentalists, Turkish
Minister of Environment Ziyaettin Tokar said Monday that nuclear
energy is the cleanest energy and nuclear plants would not be
detrimental to the environment if they are administered
properly.

<HEADLINE> EU Accuses Italy of Discriminating against Lecturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
decided to take Italy to court again for its treatment of foreign
language lecturers in Italian universities.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC) took the decision in response to
the claim made by a group of non-Italian European citizens working
in Italian universities as foreign language lecturers that they
have been discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
The foreign lecturers said that they were obliged to accept
short term and temporary contracts which had to be periodically
renewed, which they claimed had clear adverse consequences on
their working conditions.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that while the Italian universities are now
offering open-end contracts with a new job description, the
lecturers who were already in service under the old regime must
apply for such contracts and accept the new job description in
order to retain their posts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the lecturers' representatives, language
lecturers hired under the former discriminatory regime have not
been able to maintain their acquired rights.
</P>
<P>
The EC will take the case to the European Court of Justice,
which decided in 1989 and 1993 that the imposition of temporary
contracts for foreign language lecturers when other university
staff enjoyed stability of employment was discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
Italy modified its related legislation in June 1995 after the
EC started infringement proceedings against it in 1992.

TEHRAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today denied once again any Iranian
involvement in bombing a U.S. military complex in Saudi Arabia
last June.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said in an interview with Turkish media
"that claim is not anything new. We have just become only too
accustomed to such allegations."

<P>
"We oppose all forms of tyranny against every innocent
person. More than any other country, we have been victim of
terrorism, and have, more than others, tasted the bitterness of
that incorrect course of action as done against us," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to Iran's terms and conditions for dialogue between Tehran
and Washington, he said, "The United States has often been
inclined to do it without ever having been disinterested about
relations with Iran."
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that we deeply suspect the goodwill of the
United States. Our only term and condition is for the United
States to do something by way of demonstrating its goodwill," he
said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Gives Activation Order for Stabilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense ministers
meeting in Brussels today have given the activation order to send
31,000 troops to monitor the Balkan states's peace accords next
year.
</P>
<P>
The 16 ministers agreed that a Stabilization Force(SFOR) would
replace the current NATO implementation force IFOR when its
mandate runs out on December 20.
</P>
<P>
After today's session of the defense ministers' semi-annual
meeting, General George Jouwan, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander
Europe(SACURE), told a press conference that the new force would
comprise 31,000 troops and have an 18-month mandate.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the mission, he said, would start from 20
December and end 45 days after SFOR's deployment.
</P>
<P>
The second and the main phase, which is called "stabilization
force", will run about one year, according to the General.
</P>
<P>
From the third "deterrence phase", in which the number of
troops will be reduced, SFOR would enter the last phase in the
spring of 1998 and have its mission completed by June that year.
</P>
<P>
General Jouwan said that the SFOR mission, with half of the
IFOR's 60,000 troops at peak time, would concentrate on its
principal military tasks to provide a secure environment for the
civilian implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that Bosnia-Herzegovina was "still a dangerous
place", and that he 'would not hesitate to come back with request
for more troops if conditions have changed".
</P>
<P>
As for the war criminal issue, NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said that SFOR's mandate remained the same as for the IFOR
troops, which means the SFOR soldiers will detain the indicted war
criminals if they come in contact with them, and hand them to the
proper authorities, saying that hunting down the war criminals was
not the mission SFOR was going to take.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher expressed his disappointment on Tuesday as
fresh talks between the Israelis and Palestinians on Israelis
withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron once again snagged.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the discussions on Hebron are not making the
progress that we had all hoped they would make," Christopher told
reporters before talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini.
</P>

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a telephone
conversation with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday after
U.S. call for resumption of their negotiations, and senior
negotiators on both sides resumed talks shortly after the
telephone call. But nothing substative was discussed at the
overnight meeting, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
"We've been very disappointed," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Christopher all but blamed Netanyahu for souring the atmosphere
by renewing a program of tax incentives for the Jewish to expand
settlements on territory claimed by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Payment of Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged again member states to pay their
contributions to the Organization in his farewell statement to the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"What use the world makes of the United Nations over the next
few years can affect the course of world affairs for generations
to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most immediately there remains the financial crisis. "It is a
threat to the future of the United Nations that began over a
decade ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the causes of the the financial crisis, he stressed, "it is
not the result of mismanagement. It is the refusal to fulfill a
Treaty obligation."
</P>
<P>
"Now that a new Secretary-General is being appointed, all
arrears should be paid at once, as has been promised so often in
the past few months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding contributions to the United Nations amounted to
2.4 billion dollars so far. Arrears of the United States alone
accounted for over 60 percent of the total, according to UN's
latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali also stressed independence of the
Secretary-General to maintain the reputation of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more precious to the United Nations than its
reputation. That reputation rests on four pillars: impartiality,
equity, efficiency and achievement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A fifth, indispensable principle is independence. If one word
above all is to characterize the role of the Secretary-General, it
is independence," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The holder of this office must never be seen as acting out of
fear of, or in an attempt to curry favor with, one state or group
of states," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General's loyalty must be international and
nothing but international, and the international civil service
must be real civil service," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artists and writers
have responded warmly to the speech made by Chinese president
Jiang Zemin at the opening ceremony of the Sixth National Congress
of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Fifth
National Congress of the Chinese Writers' Association, which
opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group held lively discussions immediately after Jiang spoke.
</P>
<P>
Most said that the President's words offered solutions to many
important questions facing the literary and art circles, and serve
as a cross-century document of philosophical guidelines to ensure
the prosperity and development of literary and artistic creations.
</P>
<P>
Gong Mu, a noted poet, said that the late chairman Mao Zedong
made a famous speech in Yan'an decades ago, which gave direction
to the development path for China's literature and art.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago, Deng Xiaoping sent a congratulatory note to
the Fourth National Congress of the China Federation of Literary
and Art Circles, which has brought prosperity to literature and
art in modern-day society.
</P>
<P>
Gong stressed that Jiang's speech will lead the country's
literary and artistic creations into an even brighter and broader
sphere with the deepening of the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates to the two congresses said that the speech
reflects the consistent literary and artistic ideology of the
Chinese Communist Party, and the new thinking that is needed to
solve the problems that have cropped up in the new era. Therefore,
it is significant to the development of contemporary literature
and art.
</P>
<P>
Han Shaogong, a young writer, said that Jiang reiterated that
literature and art are not subordinate to politics, but they
cannot be separated, either. "This will help artists and writers to
clear up the misunderstandings concerning literary and artistic
theories," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the artists and writers strongly believe that
literature cannot be separated from politics and everyday life.
</P>
<P>
Wheelchair-bound writer Zhang Haidi said that writers should
adopt a correct ideology for their literary creations, and write
stories that will encourage the people.
</P>
<P>
He Shen, a writer from north China's Hebei Province, was
grateful for the concern shown by the Party and the government to
the country's literary work and men of letters.

<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Offshore company registrations in Cyprus are
expected to increase 19.5 percent in 1996, compared with that in
1995.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the total number of all offshore companies
registered in Cyprus from 22,200 at the end of 1995 to 26,500
this year.
</P>
<P>
Iakovos Pashos, a senior official at the Central Bank of
Cyprus, was quoted by Financial Mirror as saying today that
although the increase in the rate of registrations is lower than
the figure of 28.7 percent in 1995, the rise is still very
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Europe continues to be the main market from where Cyprus gets
business, contributing about 80 percent of all the new offshore
companies, followed by North America with 11 percent of
registrations.
</P>
<P>
The number of offshore companies with fully-fledged operations
in Cyprus will reach 1,180, showing a net increase of 12.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange receipts from this sector will reach 170
million Cyprus pounds (about 340 million U.S. dollars), up 5.3
percent from 161.5 million pounds (about 323 million dollars) in
1995.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- New England Investment Cos., which launched a
12-million-U.S.-dollar Growth Fund of Israel in March, said it
will liquidate the fund next January due to its failure to
attract enough investors.
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Lawrence Dawyer was quoted by The Jerusalem
Post as explaining Tuesday that the turmoil in the Middle East
makes it a more speculative investment than most other
single-country funds and reduces the universe of potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli national postal and communications
company, Bezeq, has begun to look into the possibility of
installing integrated service digital network (ISDN) lines
instead of conventional phone lines into all new homes to allow
simultaneous access to the Internet and multimedia services.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday that the installation of
ISDN is about 50 percent more expensive than the regular lines,
but it is several times more useful and effectively functions
like two phone lines.
</P>
<P>
An ISDN line allows users to make a phone call, through the
internet and send a fax over the same line simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The domestic debt of Turkey has reached nearly 22
billion U.S. dollars, according to Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliamentary group of the Welfare Party
Tuesday on the 1997 draft budget, Erbakan said that the domestic
debt owed to individuals amounted to some 15 billion dollars,
while the state banks accounted for 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country had the means to repay that total,
the local newspaper Daily News today quoted the prime minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said 29 billion dollars was expected in revenue from
the "resource-creating package."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that the "fourth
resource-creating package" involved the planned sale of
state-owned property, including civil servants' official housing
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Top Leaders Stress Importance of Political, Legal Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today told representatives to a national conference on political
and legal work that remarkable achievements have been made in
their professions this year, which have helped to maintain social
stability and guarantee the reform, opening up and the
modernization process.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is also the General Secretary of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Other senior leaders present at the meeting include Li Peng,
China's premier and a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Hu Jintao, a
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and of
the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the CPC Central Committee launched the
Strike Hard campaign last spring, the crime rate has been
effectively reduced, and the safety of people's lives and
belongings has been ensured. The campaign has won popular support.
</P>
<P>
"The primary goal of the political and legal work is to
safeguard the political and social stability of the country," the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still quite a few unstabilizing factors, he
added, and leaders at all levels should fully understand Deng
Xiaoping's thoughts that "stability is above all else" and
properly handle the relationship between reform, development and
stability to better shoulder their responsibilities in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
While praising the achievements of the Strike Hard campaign,
Jiang nevertheless warned that blind optimism toward the situation
should be avoided, and that "the task before us remains very
strenuous."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that the campaign will continue, as it has proved
effective so far. It will remain a major task for Party committees
and governments at all levels next year.
</P>
<P>
During a speech made at the meeting, Premier Li Peng said that
legal measures should be fully implemented to maintain the sound
development of a socialist market economy, and political and
legal work should be subordinated to the central task of economic
construction, and also serve it.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with the president that the Strike Hard campaign
should continue, and comprehensive measures to safeguard public
security should be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged that full rein be given to the political and
legal departments to promote ethical and cultural progress,
and called on the departments to solved major problems of
common concern.

<HEADLINE> Famous Temple in Jiangsu Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A 1,500-year-old temple that
was rebuilt into a workshop in the 1950s has been restored to its
original form in the city of Taizhou in east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxiao Temple, established during the Eastern Jin
Dynasty (317-420), has long been famous for its fine Buddhist
sculptures and senior monks.
</P>
<P>
However, in the 1950s the city was involved in a nationwide
rush to build factories. As a result, the temple was reconstructed
into a factory to produce textile machinery.
</P>
<P>
Thirty years later, the city decided to restore the temple and
moved the factory and more than 40 households out of the temple.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built main hall is 22.5 m high, 26 m wide and 33.5 m
long, covering an area of 800 sq m. Three Buddhas, each measuring
six m high, are located in the hall.

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers Semi-Annual Meeting Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO's defense ministers of
16 member states ended their semi-annual meeting here today after
approving the follow-up NATO mission in Bosnia and decisions to
further adapt the alliance to the challenges in the post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the ministers approved the
operational plan for the Stabilization Force(SFOR) and authorized
the activation of the new force to replace the current NATO-led
implementation force (IFOR) when its one-year mandate expires on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers welcomed the progress made in
adapting the alliance's internal structure, notably the command
rearrangement. But they left the issue of the U.S.-French dispute
on NATO's Southern Command in Europe out of the meeting's agenda.
</P>
<P>
On the implementation of the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)
concept, which makes the future European-only operation possible,
the ministers decided to initially designate the headquarters of
Striking Fleet Atlantic and NATO's Central and Southern Command in
Europe as "parent headquarters" for CJTF nuclei.
</P>
<P>
As for the alliance's enlargement, the ministers reiterated the
stand voiced by NATO foreign ministers last week that NATO had "no
intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the
territory of new members."
</P>
<P>
On NATO-Russian relations, the ministers stated in the
meeting's final communique that NATO's relations with Russia "can
and should be made broader, more intensive and more substantive"
on a more permanent institutional basis.
</P>
<P>
They said NATO was ready to work with Russia to establish
permanent Russian military liaison missions at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels and the NATO's Supreme Allied Command in
Europe based in Mons, Belgium, and to establish NATO missions at
corresponding Russian institutions and headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Other topics at the meeting were further reinforcement of the
Partnership for Peace, enhancing closer practical cooperation with
Ukraine, and the dialogue with non-NATO Mediterranean countries.

<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng met with some recipients of the national
science awards at the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, also was present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee, congratulated the scientists who have received the
national technical renovation and science advance awards for 1996.
</P>
<P>
This year, 674 achievements in scientific research covering all
aspects of the economy and society have been granted the top-level
awards.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee and also a member of the Secretariat of
the CPC Central Committee, said today that it is vital to promote
scientific and technological progress in order to effectively push
forward the national economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that giving awards to Chinese scientists is one of the
important measures taken by the Party and the government to
encourage scientific and technological advances and technical
renovations across the country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that economic construction hinges heavily on
progress in science and technology. Therefore, it is imperative to
let these fields penetrate all levels and areas of economic
construction, and to give top priority to the role of science and
technology in the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wen called upon scientists to be bold enough to probe new areas
and blaze new trails in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
All departments concerned should prepare and provide
satisfactory conditions for scientists in order to pave the way
for their research efforts and enable them to give full play to
their talents.

<HEADLINE> EU Sees Need to Reform Tobacco Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
concluded that its tobacco regime should be fundamentally reformed
in order to promote the production of higher quality tobacco and
allow farmers to cease production.
</P>
<P>
In a report, which was adopted Wednesday by the European
Commission (EC), the member countries analyzed different options
for the future of the regime, outlined the importance of the
tobacco sector, and assessed the economic impact of the EU support
for raw tobacco production.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that abolishing the EU's support for raw
tobacco production would cause serious consequences for some
200,000 jobs involved in its production and processing.
</P>
<P>
It also admits the contradiction between the EU's policy on
reducing tobacco consumption and its support for raw tobacco
production.
</P>
<P>
The EC says in the report that a total abolition of support
would lead to 100 percent of the EU's tobacco demand being met by
imports. Right now, around 80 percent of tobacco consumed in EU
countries is imported.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, some 80 percent of the EU's tobacco is produced
in economically fragile regions of the Union on plots of land
which are so small as to offer little alternative in terms of
diversification.

<HEADLINE> US Offers Grant to Egyptian Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has provided Egypt
with 14 million U.S. dollars in grant to boost its ambitious
rural development program launched to narrow the gap between
rural and urban lives, according to Egypt's Middle East News
Agency (MENA) today.
</P>
<P>
Under two U.S.-Egyptian agreements signed Tuesday night, the
14 million dollars comes out of a total of 35 million dollars
earmarked by the American administration to help the Egyptian
national program "Sherouk."
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed by Egyptian Minister of Economy and
International Development Nawal Tatawi, Minister of Local
Administration Mahmoud Sherif and American Ambassador to Egypt
Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the significance of the "Sherouk" program, Tatawi
told reporters that it is aimed at raising the standard of living
of the rural community by stepping up local participation to
upgrade their economic, cultural and social life.
</P>
<P>
The national program is also designed to promote the economic
reform process which will consequently lead to more reliance on
the private sector and individual efforts, MENA quoted her as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Sherif said Egypt is keen on the project to narrow the gap
between the village and the city, and transform the village from
consumer into producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 30 Egyptian intellectuals and scientists have
met to discuss the best means to implement this program and to
avoid negative points of previous rural development ventures.
</P>
<P>
The U.S Ambassador praised the program and expressed
confidence in the government's ability to encourage rural
residents to participate in development programs.
</P>
<P>
Washington, the top aid supplier to Egypt, has in recent years
made an annual allocation of 2.3 billion dollars to the African
country, which has received 18.1 billion dollars of U.S. grant
since 1975.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Says EUP's Discussions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Turkish official has
said that the discussions of the European Union Parliament (EUP)
regarding press freedom in Turkey were "baseless and untimely."
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted Turkish Justice
Minister Sevket Kazan, who sent his four-page letter to EUP
Chairman Klaus Haensch, as saying that the EUP had taken a very
hasty and prejudicial stance toward Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Turkish Speaker Mustafa Kalemli said in a written
statement that the EUP Resolution on December 12, which accused
Turkey of infringing upon human rights and press freedom, was
"unjust without any good intentions."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akber said in a statement
that the EUP resolution was adopted on the basis of rumors
instead of facts. He described it as "a new example of the biased
and untrue attitude of this institution against Turkey."
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the EUP opposed the Turkish
government's planned measures to impose a press censorship in
the country, warning that the move would damage relations between
the EU and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The EUP also called on the Turkish government to abandon its
bid to adopt a new law to restrict the country's press circles.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China, Nigeria Forge Closer Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China and Nigeria, both
regional population and economic big powers, have witnessed
stronger economic and trade ties in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Though trade between the two countries started as early as in
the 1950s, it was not until the 1970s after a diplomatic tie was
established that a significant annual trade volume was recorded.
In 1980, the bilateral trade volume stood at 56.8 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Into the 1990s, with the prosperity of the Chinese economy and
the implementation of the strategy to diversify China's export
market, trade between China and Nigeria has been growing at an
annual rate of a remarkable 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, bilateral trade volume hit a record 212 million U.S.
Dollars, with an export of 152 million U.S. Dollars and an import
of 60 million Dollars on the Chinese side, making Nigeria China's
third biggest trade partner in Africa, only after South Africa
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, the two countries
registered a trade volume of 132 million U.S. Dollars, 10 percent
up from the same period of last year. And it is expected that the
figure for the whole year will be well above that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
While China's exports to Nigeria keep growing, the structure
of export goods is also changing. Whereas light industry products
and black metal pieces used to dominate China's export list, at
present more and more television sets, refrigerators, bicycles,
sewing machines as well as chemicals and medicines have begun to
enter the Nigerian market.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also been forging closer ties in the
field of technological and engineering cooperation since the
signing of an agreement between the two governments in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Up to August of this year, Chinese enterprises have gained 99
engineering contracts in Nigeria, totalling 733 million U.S.
Dollars in the values of the contracts. China has become one of
the largest engineering contractors in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The recent two years have witnessed major breakthrough for the
Chinese contractors. In late 1995, the China Civil Engineering
Corporation signed a contract worth 529 million U.S. Dollars with
the Nigerian Railway Corporation for the renovation of the
country's 3,500-paralyzed railway which is actually paralyzed. This is
the largest contract that China has ever won in Nigeria and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the China harbor Engineering Company won the
51-million-dollar contract for the dredging of the navigation
channel of the Calabar port in Lagos, a project essential to set
up Nigeria's first export processing zone in the port.
</P>
<P>
Five months later, a Chinese company signed an agreement with
the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Works and Housing that paves the
way for the Chinese to enter Nigeria's housing development
market.
</P>
<P>
China has also reached understanding with Nigeria for the
entrance of Chinese firms in Nigeria's electrical power and oil
exploration markets.
</P>
<P>
The technological and economic exchange has been mutually
beneficial. Since 1994, China has implemented 31 projects
involving the training of Nigerian technicians in rice and
vegetables growing, farm machinery, weather forecast, solar
energy, fresh water culture and many other fields, all according
to a bilateral agreement in 1994, and 26 more projects are
expected to be carried out in the future.
</P>
<P>
As production costs are rising in China and export
competitions are getting fierce, more and more Chinese
enterprises have chosen to set up joint ventures overseas.
</P>
<P>
By August this year, Chinese businesses have registered 10
joint ventures in Nigeria, with a total investment of seven
million U.S. Dollars from the Chinese side. Seven of them have
started operation and most of them are enjoying brisk businesses.
</P>
<P>
Though China's trade with and investment in Nigeria are still
modest in the absolute volume, Chinese trade officials and
experts pin high hopes on the future.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has rich oil and many other resources that not only
present a high economic potential but also may be needed by
China.
</P>
<P>
And though the country's economy is currently in a depression,
its 18.8 billion U.S. Dollars of annual imports are elusive
enough to Chinese businesses.
</P>
<P>
China's manufacture products may not be able to compete with
those of the west in some aspects, but their reasonable price,
simple and easy-to-manage technology as well as easy maintenance
have its edges in the Nigerian market.

<HEADLINE> Japan Asks Peru to Ensure Hostages' Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today asked the Peruvian government to take effective
measures to ensure the safety of hundreds of people held hostage
by guerrillas at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori, Hashimoto asked Fujimori to give maximum attention to
the safety of the hostages, Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori told Hashimoto that most of the women hostages had
been released, bringing the number of hostages down to some 200
people.
</P>
<P>
He said he will make his utmost effort to solve the incident
and guarantee the safety of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
A group of gunmen from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
(MRTA) Tuesday night set off explosions, broke into the residence
and took hostage hundreds of people inside, who were attending a
reception to mark Japanese Emperor Akihito's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages include Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki,
high-ranking Peruvian officials and diplomats of various countries.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded the release of their imprisoned comrades,
including their leader Victor Polay, a review of the country's
judicial system and negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have begun between the rebels, the government and
the officials from the International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, after his 10-minute
phone call with ambassador Aoki, told reporters on Wednesday that
the Japanese ambassador to Peru said he saw no sign of
negotiations going on to free the 200 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, estimated at 20 to 30 in number, threatened to kill
all the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
"If they do not release our prisoners, we will all die here," a
guerrilla told a local radio station from inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
Aoki phoned local radio from within his house, saying that no
one inside was injured. But he added that he was not allowed to
speak freely of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The attackers slipped into the residence dressed as waiters,
police said.
</P>
<P>
The leftist MRTA movement is the smaller of two major guerrilla
groups in the country. The government last year foiled its daring
plan to storm the Congress after a bloody all-night siege of a
house full of armed guerrillas preparing for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Construction on New Railway in Shaanxi Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Construction began today on a
new railway line in northwest China's Shaanxi Province connecting
the capital city of Xi'an with Ankang.
</P>
<P>
The 267.8-kilometer Xi'an-Ankang line will link the northern
and southern parts of the province through the Qinling Range. Upon
its scheduled completion at the end of 2000, the rail line will be
able to carry 15 to 20 million tons of cargo each year, and serve
as a new north-to-south trunk line.
</P>
<P>
Initially an electrified single-track rail, it will later be
expanded to double tracks.
</P>
<P>
The new line will cross seven counties and cities, with 29
stations and seven transformer substations. Ninety-seven tunnels
and 160 bridges will be built along the line at a total length of
nearly 160 km. They will account for 60 percent of the entire
length of the Xi'an-Ankang Railway.
</P>
<P>
The 18.4-km Qinling Range No. 2 Tunnel, the key project for the
whole line, went under construction last January. It will become
the longest mountain range tunnel in China, and the sixth longest
in the world.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Liberalize Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will allow foreigners
to take direct equity stakes in Cypriot companies in many
industries hitherto closed to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to a new plan mapped out by the Central Bank of
Cyprus and released here today, foreigners can take direct equity
stakes up to 100 percent in Cypriot companies in the fields of
industry, tourism and services.
</P>
<P>
The new plan, which will soon be tabled before the Council of
Ministers for approval, says that the only criteria that
interested foreigners have to fulfill are to prove that their new
ventures will neither pollute the environment, nor be contrary to
the country's economy or a security risk.
</P>
<P>
Local economists see this latest move as the most far-reaching
proposal ever made by the Central Bank. It shows that the Central
Bank is proceeding fully with liberalization of investments to
and from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, foreigners were limited to take minority
control in Cypriot companies, and where they wanted a majority
control, they were required to undergo intense scrutiny
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many traditional industries, the tourism sector
and the vibrant services sectors were mostly or completely off
limits to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
A Central Bank spokesman said that although the foreigners
will still need to submit an application to the Central Bank,
many corners have been cut and red-tape reduced to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
Previously, when a foreign company wanted to take a stake
in a local entity, in addition to the Central Bank approval,
the application also had to be screened by the responsible
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank, as part of its policy of a gradual
liberalization, has also decided to further relax terms and
conditions under which Cypriots may invest abroad.
</P>
<P>
The new relaxed regulations, which are under the same
package as those pertaining to inbound investments, will cut
red-tape and significantly reduce the time an application is
vetted and a response is received.

<HEADLINE> Latest Hebron Talks Produce No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official said in Gaza today that the recent Palestinian-Israeli
talks on Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank city of
Hebron had yielded no results, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahman, Palestinian cabinet secretary, said that
the meeting between Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and
Israeli prime minister's adviser Yitzhak Molcho in Jerusalem
Monday night were simply a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
The two men resumed discussions after Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu held
a telephone conversation Sunday night. The two leaders decided to
resume Hebron talks, which had suspended for more than a week as
the result of a bloody incident on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said that it is difficult to arrange a meeting
between Arafat and Netanyahu because a summit between the two
leaders must end in conclusive results.
</P>
<P>
Rahman called on Israel to stop trying to change the signed
agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently under mounting international pressure to
show more flexibility regarding the peace process. President Bill
Clinton broke his silence since his re-election for the second
term, criticizing the Netanyahu government's decision on
settlement expansion and urging Israel to conclude the Hebron
talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu today held consultations on the negotiations with the
Palestinians, including the long-delayed Hebron
redeployment. Heads of security services and Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon attended the meeting. No reports of details
are available for the time being, however.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Arafat will travel to Cairo Friday to
exchange views with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
state of peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny pointed out that there
is no point for a visit to Israel by Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa at this time because differences between
Israelis and Palestinians are still great.

<HEADLINE> CASS Awards Foreign Experts Honorary Academy Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- An Oxford professor's research
into the literary origins of "The Pilgrimage to the West," a
Chinese mythological tale that is especially appealing to
children, has brought him an honorary research fellowship from the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
Glen Dudbridge, a professor at Oxford University in Britain,
believes that the 100-chapter version was the original on which
two more simplified versions were based. He says his theory has
the support of some Chinese researchers.
</P>
<P>
"The Pilgrimage to the West," written by Wu Cheng'en
(1500-1582), tells of Tang Dynasty (618-907) monk Xuanzang's
journey to transport Buddhist scriptures from the West (India). It
is considered to be one of the four greatest novels in the Chinese
literary history.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Dudbridge, who is the director of the Institute
for Chinese Studies at Oxford University, is among four foreign
experts who received the honorary title today.
</P>
<P>
The other scholar-recipients are Hirano Ryuichi, 76, former
president of Tokyo University and academician of the Japan
Academy; Vladimir Nikolaevich Kudriavtsev, 73, Vice-President of
the Academy of Sciences of Russia; and 66-year-old Wang Gungwu, an
Australian, who is the chairman of the Institute of East Asian
Political Economy at the National University of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time CASS has awarded its highest honorary
title to world-renowned foreign professors, CASS Vice President
Wang Renzhi said at today's awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he believed that having these famous scholars as
honorary CASS members will help CASS scholars to absorb the
outstanding foreign scientific achievements and boost CASS's
endeavor to conduct academic exchanges with international partners.
</P>
<P>
CASS plans to award honorary titles to more foreign experts in
1997, when the Academy celebrates its 20th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ambassador to China and other diplomats from
Australia, Russia and the United Kingdom also attended the
function.

<HEADLINE> Cases Against 2 Pakistani Corrupt Officials Referred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Lahore High Court of
Pakistan today received two corruption cases against two senior
officials of the former Benazir Bhutto government from the
Accountability Commission.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Khokhar, former minister of science and technology, was
mainly accused of occupying official land in and around Islamabad
illegally.
</P>
<P>
In the reference against Khokhar, it is alleged that Khokhar
occupied official land at Sehala near Islamabad and an amount of
1.8 million rupees (about 45,000 U.S. dollars) was outstanding
against him in this connection.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Khokhar tried to forcibly occupy two pieces of land
in Islamabad, which are very expensive. He prepared forged
documents in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Riffat Askari, former head of the Oil and Gas Development
Corporation which is the largest state-own oil and gas company in
Pakistan, was charged for involvement in huge financial
irregularities which caused huge losses to the government.
</P>
<P>
The relevant documents to substantiate allegations against him
are also attached with the reference.
</P>
<P>
Soon after receiving the two cases, Chief Justice of the Lahore
High Court Ijaz Nisar set up a three-member bench for the hearing
of the cases and directed the bench to dispose of the cases within
60 days.
</P>
<P>
According to the amended Law of Election promulgated earlier
this month, politicians who are involved in corruption cases are
not allowed to contest the forthcoming general elections scheduled
on February 3, 1997.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov left here today for Brussels to attend the "16-plus-1"
meeting along with his 16 counterparts of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
During his one-day working visit, Rodionov is expected to meet
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe George Joulwan, and hold bilateral talks with
some of his Western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss NATO's eastward expansion plans and the
military and political relations between the alliance and Russia,
a spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov is expected to voice once again Russia's opposition to
NATO's military enlargement efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, NATO wants Rodionov to make
clear Russia's stance on certain issues of special interest to the
West -- when and how Russia will decide on the exchange of
military liaison officers with NATO, as well as whether Russia
intends to activate its participation in the Partnership for Peace
program.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss a plan of sending new multinational
Stabilization Force to Bosnia, the reports said, adding that
Russia had agreed to participate in the new force but bring its
contingent down to 1,070 from the currently deployed 1,600 there.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Reduces Output for Gold Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's gold production may
not reach the projected target of 25 tons this year mainly due to
reduced output during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
A mining industry source said here today that based on
provisional statistics compiled so far, gold output could
actually be lower than that recorded in 1995 when over 23 tons
were mined, the highest in over five decades.
</P>
<P>
"It could be that the gold price in U.S.-Dollar terms has not
been the best and maybe there has been a cutback in production,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Gold, the country's second largest foreign currency earner
after tobacco, brought in 260 million U.S. Dollars to the country
last year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is Africa's third largest gold producer, after South
Africa and Ghana, and is ranked number 17 in the world.

CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian Swimming
Incorporated (ASI) Wednesday suspended the fine of 1,975
U.S. dollars imposed upon Samantha Riley's coach Scott Volkers
unless he has any breach of doping control rules before the end of
October, 1998.
</P>
<P>
ASI board met in Melbourne Wednesday and said in a statement
that they supported the findings and the decision done to Volkers.
</P>
<P>
But the board also said it had suspended Volkers' fine.
</P>
<P>
World swimming governing body FINA banned Volkers for two years
from all swimming activities for giving forbidden drugs to Riley,
the 100m and 200m breaststroke World Champion.
</P>
<P>
Riley tested positive after the World Short Course
Championships in Rio de Janeiro 12 months ago but FINA did not ban
her by issuing only a warning so that she was able to compete at

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani has said that Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq
should cooperate to establish tranquility and peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the remarks at an exclusive interview with
Turkish Daily News, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that northern Iraq should not be turned into a
hotbed of instability for all these countries.
</P>
<P>
On Iranian-Turkish relations, Rafsanjani said that both Iran
and Turkey are Moslem neighboring countries with deeply-rooted
ties in history, which make it possible for Tehran and Ankara
to strengthen their bilateral cooperation in a broader way.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian leader warned that there were certain
forces in the world that did not want to see a cordial
relationship between Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), he said that the issue of the Kurds was a common one both
for Tehran and Ankara, so it would be necessary for the two
countries to cooperate in ensuring the stability on the border
areas.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prospect of the Iranian-U.S. relations
during President Bill Clinton's second term of office,
Rafsanjani said he had seen both positive and negative signs.
</P>
<P>
"America has held the view for a very long time to normalize
its relations with Iran. The main problem is that we have lost
trust in the Americans. The only condition that we have mentioned
is an attitude or the conduct of America to prove its goodwill
and good intentions," the Iranian president said.

<HEADLINE> Framework of Socialist Market Economy Basically Built in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Li Tieying
said here today that China has basically built the framework of a
socialist market economy system, and that a diversified economic
structure with public ownership playing the leading role has taken
shape.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and minister in charge of the
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, was addressing a
national meeting on economic restructuring today, marking the 18th
anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that profound changes have taken place in China's
economic structure over the past 18 years, through a host of
reform and opening-up initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Various types of enterprises have become increasingly
market-oriented and competitive, and the market mechanism is
playing an even more significant regulatory role in economic life,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that a macro-level regulatory and control
system which is more tuned in to market needs has taken initial
shape. As a result, the government gives less direct
administration concerning the allocation of production plans and
quotas, investment, projects and materials, but gives more
indirect control to individual enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A new income distribution pattern, which lets the practice of
"distribution according to work" play the leading role and allows
for the existence of other distribution systems, has been
established, he said, adding that a new social security system is
being introduced at a fast pace.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China will open still wider to the outside world,
since "great achievements" have been scored ever since the Third
Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China, and both reform and opening-up are widely regarded
as great experiments in the history of mankind.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in China's
largest city dropped to 3.5 percent in November, down from 7.2
percent recorded at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics published in today's Shanghai-based "Jiefang Daily"
show that the retail price index in the past eleven months
increased by 5.1 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that the current dropping inflation
rate did not cause a plunge in the economy as has happened
previously. Statistics show that the city's gross domestic product
-- the value of goods and services produced -- enjoyed a 12.9
percent growth rate to reach 257.5 billion yuan during the
January-November period.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the higher economic growth rate and the
lower rate of inflation to the "relatively tight" economic policy
that is now in place in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 37 percent of Shanghai's GDP increase has come from
technological upgrading.

<HEADLINE> US Expects Mubarak's Visit "at Any Time:" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States, keen on
breaking the Mideast peace deadlock, is looking forward to a
visit by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at any time he deems
appropriate, U.S Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker has said.
</P>
<P>
Walker made the remarks Tuesday night after signing two
agreements with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton is keen on achieving
peace in the Middle East region, adding that "it is up to the
Egyptian president to fix the date."
</P>
<P>
A month has passed since the proposed Clinton-Mubarak summit
was first announced at the Cairo economic conference on November
12-14 in a bid to reactivate the stalled peace process with
efforts by the U.S and Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. envoy renewed the U.S. pledge to pursue honest
efforts to promote the peace march and bring the parties concerned
to resume negotiations to solve the problem, he ruled out any
changes in the U.S. Mideast policy.
</P>
<P>
He said when the new U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright assumes office in January, she will continue the
U.S. efforts in this respect and try to help have the Israel-PLO
Oslo 2 agreement implemented.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the key player in the Mideast peace process,
has so far failed to broker a deal between the
Palestinians and Israelis, despite numerous shuttlings by
outgoing Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Christopher has expressed disappointment with the pace of the
talks on partial Israeli troops pullback in the West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Monday also expressed the toughened U.S. stance on
Jewish expansion of settlements, saying they were an obstacle to
peace.

<HEADLINE> China's Fiscal Situation in 1996 Healthy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China has reported a basically
balanced state budget this year and will continue to stick to a
moderately tight fiscal policy next year, a top finance official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongli, minister of the Ministry of Finance, told a
national conference on fiscal work today that the state revenue
increased by 18.1 percent during the past 11 months, and the
nation is expected to hold the state deficit within the targeted
range for 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's fiscal situation has entered a smooth development
period since the new fiscal and tax system was established three
years before, said the finance minister, adding that the new
system has already benefited both the state treasury and coffers
of governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show the state revenue has been growing by 90
billion yuan annually for the past four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
"This fully demonstrated that China's reform in its fiscal and
tax system is successful," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu said the nation is still not spared from problems
such as tax losses, unrestricted spending and fiscal disorder.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to enhance its taxation next year to ensure
a relatively fast growth in the state revenue, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"But wasteful activities and over-spending should be strictly
stemmed all over the country to ensure a slower growth in
expenditure than in revenue, and contain the state deficit within
a reasonable range." the minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> UNCC Approves Compensations for Gulf War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The governing council of the
United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) has approved 1.247
billion U.S. dollars of awards to the individual victims of the
1991 Gulf War and a Kuwaiti oil company.
</P>
<P>
Of the total awards, 637 million dollars will be paid out to
successful individual claimants in categories "A" (claims for
departure from Iraq or Kuwait) and "C" (claims for losses up to
100,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rest (610 million dollars) will go to the Kuwaiti Oil
Company who had spent much money in extinguishing more than 600
burning oil wells, ignited by Iraqi forces during its withdrawal
from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
As for this company's original claim of 951 million dollars,
UNCC determined Tuesday that the 337-million-dollar claim needs
further verification and rejected the remaining three million
dollars-odd claim outright.
</P>
<P>
Because of a shortage of funds, UNCC has paid only 13.45
million dollars to nearly 4,000 persons who suffered a serious
personal injury or the death of a relative (Category B) until now.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Security Council's "oil-for-food" resolution
(Resolution 986 in 1995), UNCC will receive 30 percent of Iraqi
oil export revenues, no less than 100 million dollars a month over
a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
When the resources are available, UNCC said, it would be able
to meet its humanitarian goals in bringing actual relief to
hundreds of thousands of victims.
</P>
<P>
During the December 16-17 session in Geneva, the 15-member
governing council also took note of the developments on the
processing of claims in categories "D" (individual claims above
100,000 dollars), "E" (corporate claims) and "F" (governmental
claims).
</P>
<P>
Although hampered by a lack of necessary resources, plans are
underway to speed up the processing of the claims in these three
categories once the commission's budget for 1997 is approved.
</P>
<P>
The next session of the council is scheduled for January 1997.

<HEADLINE> Artists Discuss Jiang Zemin's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delegates to the Sixth National Congress of the China
Federation of Literary and Art Circles this week have analyzed
Jiang's keynote speech at Monday's opening ceremony of the
congress.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ji, honorary president of the Chinese Musicians'
Association, said the President's speech is a thorough explanation
of the situation of the arts in China, which will guide the cause
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On the question of how artists should represent contemporary
mainstream issues, spread national culture and resist the
infiltration of decadent Western cultures, renowned film director
Xie Tieli said that a significant point in Jiang's speech
emphasized that artists should have political and ideological
awareness, and they should be guided by Marxist and Leninist
thoughts and assess their works by the thoughts.
</P>
<P>
Three delegates said that when absorbing the best aspects of
foreign cultures, artists must promote national culture: to
promote the purity of ideology and culture is a sacred historical
mission for every artist.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liping, a composer and member of the secretariat of the
Chinese Musicians' Association, said artists must understand fully
this era in order to win more readers, listeners or viewers for
their works.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that Jiang's speech "sounds the clarion
call toward further development of literature and art."
</P>
<P>
Now is the favorable time to promote the development of
literature and art, and the key is to practice the gist of Jiang's
speech in everyday life, said Li Zhun, director of the Literature
and Art Bureau under the Propaganda Department of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China.

<HEADLINE> Sofia Hopes to End Language Dispute With Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will propose a
compromise agreement with Macedonia to end the dispute over
language, local press quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Zheliu Zhelev called on diplomats to speed up work on
the issue, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Macedonia when it
announced independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, but
refused to recognize the existence of a distinct Macedonian
nationality or language.
</P>
<P>
As a result, dozens of accords between the two countries were
left unsigned.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry has reportedly worked out five
proposals to solve the problem. The most feasible one might be to
sidestep the issue of language in striking accords.
</P>
<P>
Sofia may no longer insist that Skoplije sign accords in
English or other working languages of the United Nations, which is
rejected by Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are now eager to solve the problem as trade links
between them are growing stronger.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is the biggest trading partner of Macedonia while
Macedonia ranks the second in trade with Bulgaria in the Balkans,
only after Greece.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Addresses Writers, Artists about Foreign Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today addressed the country's writers
and artists about the international situation.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s when the international situation experienced
fundamental changes, China has achieved economic takeoff, Qian
told the delegates to the Six National Congress of the China
Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Fifth National
Congress of the Chinese Writers' Association.
</P>
<P>
After the cold war, the world tended to become multi-polarized,
with the strength of developing countries as a whole growing and
playing an increasing role in international affairs, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
In an overall situation toward detente, various countries, big
countries in particular, are vying with each other by means of
their comprehensive national strengths, so that economy is playing
an increasing role in international relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are still many unstable and uncertain
factors and conflicts on the international scene. All countries in
the world can safeguard world peace and seek common development
only when they respect each other and seek common ground while
reserving their differences.
</P>
<P>
Led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
with Jiang Zemin at the core and guided by Deng Xiaoping's
strategic thinking and policy, China has made remarkable
achievements in its foreign affairs since 1990s by grasping
opportunities and facing challenges, and thus safeguarded China's
state sovereignty and territorial integrity, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chinese leaders visited many countries in
various continents, and consolidated and promoted friendship and
cooperation between China and those countries. This is significant
to promoting the healthy development of the international
situation.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Sino-US relations, Qian said that there is a
marked improvement in the atmosphere in the relations between the
two countries and the prospects of developing the bilateral
relations are promising.
</P>
<P>
While speaking of the major successes achieved in the struggle
against splittism and "independence of Taiwan", Qian reiterated
China's policy of "peaceful reunification of Taiwan and one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Talking about Hong Kong, Qian said that the central government
has approved the first chief executive designate of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
At present, social stability, steady economic growth and the
growing confidence of Hong Kong residents about the future are all
conducive to the smooth handover of Hong Kong, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Fiscal Input in Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China will allocate more
fiscal money for poverty alleviation starting next year, Minister
of Finance Liu Zhongli said here today.
</P>
<P>
An important task to maintain social stability in China is to
make greater efforts to alleviate poverty, and enable the
poverty-stricken population in the rural areas to have enough to
eat and wear, Liu told a national meeting on fiscal issues in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The State Council has decided that the central government will
earmark another 1.5 billion yuan (about 180 million US dollars)
each year for poverty alleviation between 1997 and the end of this
century," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the amount of money put aside for poverty reduction
by the central government stands at 10.8 billion yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
Liu also said that during the period banks will increase their
loans for poverty relief efforts by three billion yuan annually,
adding that local governments have been ordered to invest a sum
equal to 30 to 50 percent of the input by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be placed on improving the living and production
conditions of the poverty-ridden areas by growing plants and
developing aquaculture and the farm produce-processing industry,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"Industrial projects must not be launched blindly and the
misuse of poverty reduction funds will be harshly dealt with," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China launched a nationwide poverty reduction campaign in the
1980s. The rural poverty-stricken population fell by 20 million
during the 1991-1995 five-year plan period, to 65 million by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government declared in 1994 that the issue of
enabling rural poverty-ridden people to have enough to eat and
wear would be solved by the end of this century.

their best," Mahathir told reporters here.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets UNCTAD Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
expressed his hope that friendly cooperation between China and the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will
be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with UNCTAD Secretary General Rubens Ricupero,
Li highly evaluated the active role played by UNCTAD in promoting
world trade development.
</P>
<P>
The organization made great contributions to the successful
convening of the UN conference on environment and development, the
world summit for social and economic development and other
international conferences, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
It has also done a lot to support the developing countries and
promote economic growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said he appreciates the long-term cooperation between UNCTAD
and China, and that he is grateful for the organization's efforts
to help China's economic construction and its poor areas. It is
his wish that both sides would further consolidate their
cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said that over the past years, China has actively
supported the UN and UNCTAD. The UN has reached a critical stage,
he pointed out, and the issue of development has not received
enough emphasis.
</P>
<P>
He praised the proposals put forward by the Chinese government
at the 50th anniversary of the founding of the UN.
</P>
<P>
The UN's affairs should involve consultation among the UN
member countries, and all UN resolutions should reflect the will
of the majority of countries, especially those that are
developing, Ricupero noted.
</P>
<P>
Li said as the world's largest developing country, China is
well aware of the importance of development, and the UN should
stress the issue.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD believes that China should enter the World Trade
Organization as early as possible, Ricupero said, because without
China, the organization is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
He held that no harsh restrictions should be implemented in
order to grant China's access to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation for UNCTAD's position on the WTO
issue. He reiterated that no force can block China's development
as well as its international trade and economic cooperation, which
are based on equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, this evening met with and hosted a dinner in honor of
Ricupero, who is here as her guest.

<HEADLINE> China to Curb Rapid Fiscal Expenditure Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to gradually
introduce a mechanism able to curb the excessive growth in the
fiscal expenditure, in order to ensure that the country's fiscal
budgetary target will not be missed, Chinese Minister of Finance
Liu Zhongli said here today.
</P>
<P>
The current fiscal strains are due to a low growth rate in the
fiscal revenue and an excessive expansion in fiscal expenses, Liu
told a national meeting on fiscal work.
</P>
<P>
China's fiscal revenue has grown substantially since a new
fiscal and tax system was introduced three years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, fiscal revenue has been outgrown by that of the
economy and its proportion to the gross domestic product has slid,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China's fiscal revenue was up 18.1
percent year-on-year between January and November, while its
fiscal expenditure was up 17.4 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
"To curb the rapid expansion of expenses and readjust our
expenditure structure, we must practice thrift and fight against
waste," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"We must tighten our belt for a fairly long period of time."
</P>
<P>
An effort toward that direction next year is to rein in public
expenses and strictly control the purchasing power of
institutions, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of expenditure must be lower than that of the fiscal
income, in order to guarantee the fiscal funds for agriculture,
education, science and technology, and the building of the state
power, Liu noted.

ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani caretaker
government is working to speed up the recovery of stuck-up loans
amounting to 130 billion rupees (3.25 billion U.S. dollars), a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have to do everything to recover the loans as much as
possible," said Shahid Burki, advisor to the prime minister on
finance and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is seeking to recover the stuck-up debts
by restructuring the defaulted loans, strengthening the legal
basis and setting up a new organization -- Resolution Trust
Corporation -- for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Several former governments had tried to solve the serious loan
default problem in Pakistan. The last caretaker government
published a list of the country's 700 biggest defaulters and the
government of Benazir Bhutto also published a list of 500 biggest
defaulters.
</P>
<P>
However, not enough concrete steps have been taken to recover
these loans or to punish the defaulters.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Former NBA All-Star Alvin

<HEADLINE> Evening Paper Stops Publication in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- One of the two evening
papers in Hong Kong, the 58-year-old Sing Tao Evening Post, closed
 from today on.
</P>
<P>
About 270 staff will lose their jobs just a week before the
Christmas. Rising newsprint costs and falling advertising revenue
forced the final closure of the loss-making evening paper, one of
the four dailies under the Sing Tao Holdings.
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of the newspaper group, Sally Aw Sian said the
closure would end an annual loss of 50 million HK dollars (6.5
million US dollars), and more resources can be concentrated on
another paper under the firm, the Sing Tao Daily. The group also
publishes the Tin Tin Daily and the Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
Daily circulation of the evening paper had dropped 90 percent
to 20,000 copies since its heyday in the 1970's, when it sold
200,000 copies a day. Advertising revenue had fallen by 10 percent
annually over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Competition among papers and pressure of diversified media
choices also contributed to the evening paper's demise. Many Hong
Kong Chinese papers threw themselves into a price-cut war early
this year in order to take a big market share in the keen
competition.
</P>
<P>
The Sing Tao Evening Post is the fifth paper to close in Hong
Kong within a year, following the TV Daily News, the United Daily
News, the Express News and an English paper, the Eastern Express.
The Express News later resumed publication.
</P>
<P>
The closure made The New Evening Post the only local evening
paper, which is likely to print 30 to 50 percent more copies.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Output Forecast Revised Downwards in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee authorities
have again revised its forecasts for 1996/97 production downwards
as coffee berry disease is affecting main production areas.
</P>
<P>
In an annual report, Flavian Mwangi, chairman of the Mild
Coffee Traders Association (MCTA), projected the 1996/97 output
at 85,000 tons, an 11 percent decline compared with the 1995/96
output of 96,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Previous forecasts stood at 100,000, 95,000 and 90,000 tons,
according to an East African Standard report today.
</P>
<P>
The MCTA Chairman said the decline is caused by an insurgence
of coffee berry disease in the main growing areas around Mount
Kenya in the country's Central Province.
</P>
<P>
He noted that coffee small-holders are likely to be further
affected due to the lack of adequate fungicide sprays against the
disease.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Kenya Coffee Board was quoted as saying
that the extent of damage from coffee berry disease was not yet
known, adding that there are other factors such as weather which
affect the production as well.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Blood Donations For Chinese Child in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 10,000 people in the
northeast Chinese city of Harbin have donated blood to help a
Chinese baby in Canada who is suffering from congenital
immuno deficiency syndrome and in need of a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month-old baby, Yang Mingyue, is the daughter of Yang
Jilin, a Chinese scientist who is studying medicine at Toronto
University. The baby's disease was diagnosed when she was three
months old, according to the "China Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
A bone marrow match can be found by using blood samples,
according to doctors.
</P>
<P>
"The disease is so deadly that patients usually don't survive
for more than a year. There were 20 such cases around the world in
the past decade," the paper said, and "Marrow transplants are
the only way known so far to treat the disease."
</P>
<P>
A transplant requires bone marrow that is identical to
recipient's, and the chance of finding a donor from anonymous
blood donations is about one in 100,000, the paper quoted an
unidentified expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many university students, soldiers, medical personnel, and
other residents of Harbin, where Yang Jilin studied, offered to
donate blood when they heard about the baby's condition, and by
Saturday, 2,000 donations had been made.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Local Red Cross society said that this was the
biggest blood donation for a marrow transplant by people not
related to the recipient, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's health minister has written to Chen Minzhang, China's
Minister of Public Health, saying that the blood samples were
"human wealth" and would benefit both Canadian and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The blood has been sent to a testing center at the University
of California for a final check.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the donations, the baby's father, with help from the
Canadian government, had checked three million marrow samples held
by the International Red Cross Society but failed to find a
suitable one, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Unveils Program to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Virawan Tuesday unveiled a long-awaited program aiming to
buoy up the country's slow-growing economy and ailing sectors,
sparkling the hope for an economic upturn in the country.
</P>
<P>
Priorities of the 18-point program fall on measures to relax
the financial policy to stimulate local monetary, capital and
foreign exchange markets, encourage savings, curb consumption and
boost investment.
</P>
<P>
Among the short-term measures in the program, the government
will allow local finance and securities firms to engage in foreign
exchange trading, encourage dealers to trade the baht at offshore
markets like Hong Kong and Singapore, and upgrade the country's
foreign exchange trading through introducing electronic settlement
means.
</P>
<P>
To promote competition in the financial sector, the government
will allow the establishment of more new banks and encourage
commercial banks to open more provincial and overseas branches in
line with the country's financial liberalization by the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Financial market mechanisms, especially the repurchase market
mechanism, will be developed to allow easier liquidity adjustment
through financial institutions' participation.
</P>
<P>
To prop up the country's stalled property business, the
government will lower interest rates for housing loans, support
setting up of property funds, allow more foreign ownership of land
or buildings, and cut costs of residential projects.
</P>
<P>
Among medium-term measures, the program has set a target to
attract at least 100 billion baht (4 billion U.S. dollars) into
capital markets within five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the government will also relax rules
concerning investment in stocks, debt instruments and other
financial instruments.
</P>
<P>
To raise national savings, the government will amend relevant
regulations on provident funds to boost savings of individuals and
enterprises and stimulate large-sized companies to set up pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
As for long-term measures, the program says that the government
will readjust the existing tax structure, raising the tariff rates
on polluters and granting incentives to high-tech operators.
</P>
<P>
The government will also continue to develop tourism, bolster
the maritime industry with tax incentives and tax privileges,
decentralize fiscal power to provincial agencies, seek closer
monetary and fiscal cooperation with other countries and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Amnuay's program has won wide praise
from the business and banking communities and is expected to help
boost investors' confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
But some economists and bankers commented that the program is
long on economic targets but short on methods to achieve them.

plot against President Tejan Kabbah in which 11 people including

ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today strongly dispelled the perception that he wants a
hung Parliament, saying that people of Pakistan will decide the
composition of the future parliament.
</P>
<P>
Leghari made the remarks while talking with Khurshid Mehmood
Kasuri, vice president of Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz group),
who called on him at the Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said the misinformation of the hung parliament was
spread by certain dejected elements.
</P>
<P>
"Had there been any such plan on my side, we would not be
wasting our energies to make the elections free, fair and
transparent," he contended.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government should make clear its position and
steps should be taken to remove this impression, he added.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government is providing the nation with an ample
opportunity to exercise their right of vote independently by
taking every possible step to ensure fair elections, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Leghari dissolved the National Assembly and the government led
by prime minister Benazir Bhutto on November 5.

<HEADLINE> China to Advance Housing Reform Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China will quicken the pace
of housing reform next year to help turn the housing sector into a
new growth outlet and a pillar of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, State Councillor and also Minister of the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, made the remark today in
Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national working conference on economic
restructuring, Li said that the housing sector has a strong impact
on the national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Currently the sector is facing the difficulty in selling
commodity houses, which shows that the country's housing system
does not by far suit the development of a market economy, he said,
adding: "Only with a faster reform could we turn housing
into a strong pillar sector."
</P>
<P>
Li urged a quick shift from traditional welfare distribution in
kind, to a commercialized distribution in China's housing system,
and an early establishment of a public housing fund in different
enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
"It is also necessary to raise rents for government-built
apartments with the purpose of reducing financial burdens on the
state and enterprises, and to change residents' irrational
consumption expenditure structure and consumption plans," said the
state councillor.
</P>
<P>
He also called for increased investment for "comfortable
housing" projects and a greater success in implementing the
schemes.
</P>
<P>
The state councillor urged that important measures be taken for
advancing the establishment of a financial network for housing,
including increasing the extension of mortgage loans to
individuals for house purchase, encouraging commercial banks to
start housing deposit services, and insurance companies to provide
residents with insurance services for house purchase.
</P>
<P>
Housing reform should be carried out hand and hand with the
enterprise restructuring to realize a separation of housing
management from enterprise production, said Li, while urging
efforts be made to promote the sale of more unsold commodity
houses and reduce housing costs.

CHENGDU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to breed up to 48
giant pandas by the year 2000, Zhang Anju, head of China Panda
Breeding Technology Commission, told the commission's ninth
session held in Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and American panda experts attended the four-day
meeting, probing new ways of panda breeding.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of world most precious animals. The
world has only some 1,000 pandas, with most of them in southwest
China's Sichuan Province and northwest China's Gansu and Shaanxi
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Pandas can become pregnant once a year and could produce one or
two babies. However, most female pandas look down upon male pandas
and the breeding of pandas nowadays mainly depend on instrumental
insemination.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that breeding pandas and baby panda survival still
needs long and arduous research.

<HEADLINE> Japan Undertakes to Destroy Chemical Weapons It Left in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan conducted
government-level negotiations here yesterday on the issue of
chemical weapons abandoned by Japan in China.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side made a commitment to be responsible for the
destruction of all the chemical weapons it left behind in China
during the World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yi, director of the Asian Affairs Bureau of China's
Foreign Ministry, and Kato Ryozo, director of the Asian Affairs
Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs led the two
governmental delegations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side stressed in the negotiations that the issue of
chemical weapons Japan abandoned in China was caused by Japan's
militarist invasion of China, when the Chinese side was totally
victimized.
</P>
<P>
China demanded that Japan introspect its atrocity of the
invasion earnestly, and shoulder all the responsibilities for the
destruction of all the chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side should fulfil its obligation as soon as
possible to destroy all chemical weapons it left behind in
China according to the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons
and on their Destruction, China said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side expressed deep retrospection and sincere
regret for the grave damage its invasion had brought to China, and
admitted the fact that Japanese invasion troops had abandoned a
large amount of chemical weapons in China after their defeat.
</P>
<P>
Japan said it has completely realized the seriousness and urgency
of this issue, and is deplored by the fact that this issue is
still causing damage to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The policy of the Japanese government on this issue is that it
will completely and resolutely solve this issue according to the
spirit and principles of the Joint Declaration of Japan and China
and the Peace and Friendship Treaty of Japan and the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Japan, as the abandoner, is willing to earnestly fulfill its
obligation to destroy chemical weapons in accordance with
the stipulations in the Convention on Chemical Weapons, it said.
</P>
<P>
No matter how many weapons there are, and how difficult
technically it is to destroy them, the Japanese side said it will
spare no efforts to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the negotiation has been positive and
fruitful, and has been a major step toward the complete and
resolute settlement of this historical issue. Both sides have
agreed to form a joint working group as soon as possible to
discuss specific matters related to the issue.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin Meets Hong Kong's First Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin stressed
here today that the principle of "one country, two systems" is not
an expedient policy but a set state policy for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a cordial meeting with Tung
Chee-hwa, first Chief Executive Designate of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Extending warm congratulations to Tung Chee-hwa, who was
appointed first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, Jiang
said that Britain has ruled Hong Kong for one and a half
centuries, and its every Governor of Hong Kong has been appointed
by the British Royal family. Opinions were never solicited from
Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
He said to Tung: "you are the first Chinese Chief Executive for
more than 100 years. This truly demonstrates 'Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong', and a high-degree of autonomy, and also
shows that Hong Kong will enter a new era."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the principle of "one country, two systems" is not
an expedient policy, but an established state policy. The election
of the Chief Executive shows the central people's government's
determination and sincerity of implementing the principle of "the
Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", and a high-degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, in dealing with the question of Hong Kong, we
will strictly act in accordance with the Basic Law, and will never
interfere in affairs belonging to the scope of autonomy of the
Special Administrative Region," Jiang assured Tung.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in accordance with the provisions of the Basic
Law, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region should be responsible for the central people's government
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
"If the Chief Executive needs help from the central government
when he meets with difficulties, the central government will be
bound to render full support to him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said to Tung: "You are shouldering arduous tasks and will
head the Hong Kong people to put the principle of 'one country,
two systems' into practice. This is unprecedented and the burden
is heavy and the road is long."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Mr. Tung Chee-hwa will certainly
live up to the expectations of the people throughout the country,
including six million Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that with the powerful backing of the
motherland and the concerted efforts of the six million Hong Kong
people, the principle of "one country, two systems" will certainly
be crowned with success and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability
will surely be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he was very pleased to meet Jiang, adding that
he felt greatly honored to be elected and appointed the first
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by
the central people's government.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will try his utmost to do the work well for
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and thriving of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on economic and
trade cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai was held here
today with a focus on the development of Shanghai's financial
market and emerging opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) and
Shanghai Hong Kong Economic Development Association, the symposium
attracted about 200 corporate and individual investors.
</P>
<P>
Michael Sze, executive director of TDC, said that Hong Kong and
Shanghai both have a role to play in China's modernization.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong and Shanghai will play complimentary
roles. The strength of each other are different and the areas
each will focus on are different as well.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe that Shanghai will continue to develop as
 China's financial center, and that Shanghai will be the center of
 industrial activity and it will dominate import and export trade
flowing from northern and central China, he said.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he said, Hong Kong will retain its traditional
role as an international financial center, a gateway for foreign
investment to enter into China and a trade hub for the Pearl River
Delta and southern China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that the connection between Hong Kong and Shanghai is
very close. Hong Kong is the biggest investor in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, total cumulative contracted overseas direct
investment in Shanghai was about 34 billion U.S. dollars with Hong
Kong's share reaching 17 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong and Shanghai working together using
complimentary skills and pursuing common interests would be the
way of the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that Shanghai is expected to further strengthen its
infrastructure and continue with rapid growth, develop some
international financial capabilities and develop into a strong
financial center.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China has given the green
light to the production of 282 environmental protection devices
and products by offering special qualification certificates.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the State Bureau for Environmental
Protection has issued qualification certificates for environmental
protection devices and products.
</P>
<P>
They include industrial dusters, garbage burning devices,
facilities for tackling water pollution, sonic pollution control
devices and environment monitoring instrument.

<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the bureau, said today that after
initial practising of qualification certification regulations, his
bureau will join efforts with other departments to get rid of
outdated and backward production installations, and to improve the
quality of China's environmental protection products.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the ongoing national conference on
environmental protection science and technology
</P>
<P>
He stressed that products without the qualification
certificates will not be allowed to be sold on the market in the
coming years, adding his bureau will announce lists of the

country has so far more than 9,000 factories for making
environmental protection products.
</P>
<P>
He said that his bureau will offer qualification certificates
to more varieties of environmental protection products in the
coming years after appraisal and gradually standardize China's

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Reform of state-owned
enterprises will continue to be the focus of China's drive to
restructure its economy in 1997, a senior official with China's
policy-making body said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country will organize the inflow and regrouping of factory
assets and properties, establish a new system on the management
and supervision of state assets, push social security and housing
reforms, optimize the structure of circulation for grain and
cotton, and improve investment and fund-raising channels.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Li Tieying, state councillor and minister in
charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, at a
national conference on mapping out the country's plan to reform
its economic structures.
</P>
<P>
On reforming state-owned enterprises, he said, progress will be
made to invigorate large state-owned enterprises, while having a
free hand on smaller ones, accelerate the restructuring and
changing of the mechanism of industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the number of cities chosen for experimenting
optimization of capital structure will be increased to 100 from
58. The number of key enterprises linked with a sponsoring bank
will go up from 300 to 500. Enterprise groups picked up as reform
pilots will almost double from 57 to 100.
</P>
<P>
Existing enterprises will be transformed with direct foreign
investment, funds and technology of other Chinese provinces and
regions, and bank loans, bonds and shares, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to financial reforms, the minister said that
competition should be introduced in various investment spheres
next year.

China will increase the ratio of direct investment and expand
investment channels, grant commercial banks bigger rights to
providing loans for investment, and expand the scale of inter-bank
loans of policy-oriented banks, Li said.

Social security reform, an arduous task for 1997, will embrace
establishment of a unified insurance system for urban pensioners,
experiment of medical insurance reforms, improvement of
unemployment insurance fund and unification of insurance
administration, he said.

the state is to separate the function of government grain
departments from enterprises engaged in grain purchasing and
processing, separate national grain reserves from regional
reserves and commercial operations, separate the responsibilities
of the central government from local governments, and separate
bank accounts of losses incurred by grain enterprises so far this
year from the losses to be made in 1997 and thereafter, he said.

MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today blasted the hostage-taking of some 250 people Tuesday
night at the Japanese ambassador's residence in the Peruvian
capital of Lima.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to condemn, in the strongest terms possible, this
outrageous act of terrorism," Ramos said in a statement, which was
released by the Presidential Press Office this afternoon.

Some 20 gunmen raided the Japanese ambassador's residence in

officials attending a party there. Earlier reports said all women
hostages have been released.
</P>

Ramos urged the captors, who identified themselves as the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (TARM) guerrillas, to immediately
release their remaining innocent captives, alive and unharmed.

The Philippine government so far had no information that any
Filipino is involved in the tragedy, Ramos said, adding that he

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented move, an
overwhelming majority of the newly-elected Congress parliamentary
party (CPP) executive members at a meeting here today asked former
prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to step down as CPP leader in
the larger interest of the party, the party sources said.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made hours before the Congress Working Committee
(CWC), the highest policy-making body of the party, is scheduled
to meet here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Rao also attended this morning's meeting. Reportedly he neither
rejected nor accepted the request of the CPP executive members to
step down. He only said that he would look into it and inform them
of his decision.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the 24 executive members signed today's
resolution demanding Rao's resignation. The resolution, adopted at
a short requisitioned meeting of the CPP, said, "We the elected
members of the executive committee of the CPP with a view to
further strengthening these measures strongly feel the need for
change in the leadership of the CPP and request the leader to step
down."
</P>
<P>
Rao is reported to have raised technical objections to moving
a resolution against him without prior notice and without him
being given a copy of it beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the anti-Rao camp P.R. Dasmunshi told him that the
resolution could be treated as a statement on behalf of the
executive.

strengthening of the Indian National Congress has acquired utmost
political significance in the interest of the people and the

<HEADLINE> One Man, One Farm, Says Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government will
ensure that no farmer owns more than one farm as it moves towards
effectively redressing the existing land imbalance created during the
colonial era in the country, President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing farmers in Chesa small-scale purchase area in north
Zimbabwe yesterday, Mugabe said the government would continue to
acquire all underutilised farms, whether owned by blacks or whites,
for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
''Although we know this move will hurt some farmers, we cannot sit
back while some farms continue lying idle. We will give the land to
those who can fully utilise it,'' said the president to a big
applause from thousands of large-scale and small-scale commercial
farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said the land issue had been talked about for a long time now,
and the people were fast becoming impatient.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe noted that farmers with more than one farm, and who did not
want to lose the extra land, should honestly prove that they can
fully utilise all of them.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of compensation on the acquired farms, Mugabe
reiterated that the government did not have any moral obligation to
pay for the designated farms. However, he noted that if the British
government, which is negotiating with the government, provides the
resources, ''my government will be prepared to pay for the farms''.

accustomed to such allegations."
</P>
<P>
"Previously, and in relation to other blasts such as the one
in Argentina, they levelled the same accusations. More recently,
they levelled the same accusations in relation to the crash of a
TWA airplane, but soon after it became evident that the charges
were wrong," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of the possible closure of the Strait of
Hormoz if a crisis occurs, Maleki said, "we have no plan to
disrupt the flow of oil by closing the Strait of Hormoz."
</P>
<P>
"But if and when necessary we will take whatever measure
necessary to defend our rights," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Iranian official said that Iran is opposed
to any foreign military presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
On security in the Gulf, he said, "we propose collective
security arrangement in the region to other countries, and the
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman declared the details of this
arrangement two months ago."
</P>
<P>
"I want to reiterate that Iran and the littoral states can
sit and discuss security of the region and guarantee the oil
flow from the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormoz to other
countries, specially those who have concern about the oil flow
from this region to the rest of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I think if we reach a compromise about
security, it would not be needed to invite foreign military
presence in the region."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify the name of any foreign
countries. But it is clear that he pointed his finger to the
United States. Iran regards the American forces in the Gulf as
the biggest threat to the national security of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian forces have been at red alert over the possible
military attack by the American forces.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Sees No War with US Now: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran sees no military
confrontation with the United States "at this time and state," an
Iranian senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Maleki said at a press
conference that "we have already made preparations against any
attack from any country in this region."
</P>
<P>
However, Maleki said, "it is not true that the United States
is preparing an attack against Iran."
</P>
<P>
While answering the question posed by Xinhua on potential
military attack by the American forces in the Gulf, he said,
"this is some issue that they claim but it is not approved by
officials with decision-making responsibility in the United
States and other countries."
</P>
<P>
Some media reports said that the United States is making a
special military program to strike 19 Iranian targets, including
nuclear reactors and terrorist training camps.
</P>
<P>
Referring to statement by Saudi Interior Minister Nayef Bin
Abdel-Aziz, he said, the Saudi authorities have rejected some
reports and said that there is not evidence to show that Iran is
behind this issue in the U.S. base.
</P>
<P>
Iran has again and again denied any involvement in bombing
U.S. military complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia last June, which
killed 19 U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Tuesday "that
claim is not anything new. We have just become only too
accustomed to such allegations."

<HEADLINE> Australia Offers Wool Credit Facility to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia today announced a
300 million Australian dollars (240 million U.S. dollars) credit
facility for wool exports to China.
</P>
<P>
The facility, as a major trade-boosting step, offers Chinese
importers a longer-term financing structure.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Commonwealth Bank and Hong Kong Bank of
Australia, Eric Howie, told reporters here that the banks had
already been flooded with requests by importers for more than 300
million Australian dollars in credit.
</P>
<P>
"By working directly with selected major wool importers, we
believe the facility will encourage more regular and stable buying
and will build confidence among Australian wool exporters," Howie
said.
</P>
<P>
China is Australia's largest wool market and together with Hong
Kong, it bought about 807 million Australian dollars' (645.6
million U.S. dollars) worth of wool or 26 percent of Australia's
total production in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Australia Hua Junduo believed that
today's package would boost China's import of wool from Australia.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Hold Hostages in Japanese Ambassador's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian guerrillas were still
holding 250 to 300 hostages by midnight at Japanese ambassador's
residence in Lima, while negotiations begun between the rebels,
government and officials from the International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
A group of Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) gunmen
Tuesday night set off explosions, broke into the residence and
took hostage hundreds of people inside, who were attending a
reception to mark Japanese Emperor Akihito's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages include Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki,
high-ranking Peruvian officials and diplomats from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Peru's Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, Agriculture Minister
Rodolfo Munante Sanguineti, Supreme Court President Moises
Pantoja, and South Korean Ambassador Lee Won-young were among
those trapped.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded release of their imprisoned comrades,
including their leader Victor Polay, a review of the country's
judicial system and negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said his Interior Minister
Juan Briones Davila is negotiating with the guerrillas for the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
About 80 women and old people have been set free, reportedly
including Fujimori's sister and mother, but none of the men were
released.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, estimated at 20 to 30 in number, threatened to kill
all the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
"If they do not release our prisoners, we will all die here," a
guerrilla told a local radio station from inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
Aoki phoned local radio from within his house, saying that no
one inside was injured. But he added that he was not allowed to
speak freely of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The attackers slipped into the residence dressed as waiters,
police said.
</P>
<P>
The leftist MRTA movement is the smaller of two major guerrilla
groups in the country. The government last year foiled its daring
plan to storm the Congress after a bloody all-night siege of a
house full of armed guerrillas preparing for the attack.

<HEADLINE> PAGAD Part of Crime Problem, Says S.African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The South African Police
Service (SAPS) has called off talks with the Cape Town-based People
Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD), saying the militant Muslim
anti-drugs group had now become part of the country's spiralling crime
problem, and not the solution, said sources here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at police headquarters in Pretoria on
Tuesday, acting National Police Commissioner Zoli Lavisa said PAGAD's
naked aggressioin, especially against police, showed quite clearly
that it had embarked on a policy of deliberate criminality.
</P>
<P>
The tough stand followed bloody clashes between police and PAGAD
supporters at Cape Town International Airport on Monday and outside a
courtroom early yesterday, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Seven policemen were wounded in two separate clashes and 13 PAGAD
members were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Lavisa announced police would suspend all talks with PAGAD on a
national level with immediate effect and vowed to deal with the
anti-drugs vigilantes with an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz's spokesman
said the police were not banning the Muslim group on conditions that
they were operating within the law.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Dullah Omar, himself a Muslim, has failed in
negotiations with the PAGAD leaders to persuade them not to take
the law into their own hands by attacking the homes of alleged
durg dealers.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Nelson Mandela also reiterated that PAGAD
would no longer be allowed to demonstrate with guns and with their
faces covered as they did in the past. enditem

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Ambassador Taken Hostage in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Ambassador to
Peru Ahmad Mokhtar Selat is among at least 200 hostages held by
heavily armed guerrillas at the Japanese ambassador's residence in
Lima today, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Confirming this at the Parliament House here, Anwar said the
Foreign Ministry is waiting for more information on the incident
from the Peruvian government.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the information received so far, the
ambassador is the only Malaysian among the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Anwar hoped Mokhtar Selat would be released to carry on his
duties. It is "not right for a Malaysian ambassador who has no
connection with the internal problems of Peru to be involved,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the Malaysian government has not
yet negotiated with the guerrillas for the release of the
ambassador, "since we have nothing to do with what they (the
guerrillas) have raised."
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Lima quoting witnesses and
officials, the guerrillas fired a rocket and sprayed gunfire into
the building where a reception was held to mark the Japanese
Emperor's birthday at around 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday (9 a.m.
Malaysian time today), before scaling walls and entering the
building during the ensuing chaos.

<HEADLINE> China Integrates Trade Network with Global Trade Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The founding of a development
center which aims to integrate China's trade network with the rest
of the world was announced today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with advanced technology and facilities, the China
National Trade Point Development Center (CNTPDC) has successfully
opened DDN leased lines between the China Electronic Commercial
Network for Foreign Trade and Economy (CTNet) and the UN Global
Trade Point Network (GTPNet).
</P>
<P>
By using electronic trading opportunities, electronic digital
inter-change, E-mail, multimedia and other trade opportunity
information, the center will help Chinese enterprises to seek
trading partners around the world, with a view to promoting trade
efficiency and reducing cost.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the center will help China's import and
export oriented enterprises to enter international markets and
take part in global trade.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the center demonstrated the Chinese
government's determination to promote the Trade Efficiency
Programme put forward by the UNCTAD, the UN Conference on Trade
and Development.
</P>
<P>
It also reflected China's efforts to realize one of the two key
tasks for foreign trade during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period --
the integration of China's enterprises engaged in foreign trade
with the international information network.
</P>
<P>
As a center of the national level of the GTPNet in the
Asia-Pacific region, the Chinese center will operate through the
CTNet with technical support from the UN Trade Point Development
Center, which is set up by UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, GTPNet has been connected to seven million
enterprises and other networks in over 140 countries and regions,
producing 150,000 pieces of information on electronic trading
opportunities every month.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Value of Production Index Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine manufacturing
sector's value of production index (VPI) went up by 14 percent to
463.8 in September from 406.7 a year ago, a survey conducted by
the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed today.
</P>
<P>
This double-digit year-on-year growth comes after six straight
months of single-digit increases starting in March, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month comparison, the VPI increased by 2.4
percent, compared with 453.1 in August, according to the Survey of
Key Enterprises in Manufacturing (SKEM).
</P>
<P>
The SKEM is a regular monthly survey conducted by the NSO to
provide flash indicators on the performance of key manufacturing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Double-digit year-on-year increases in the VPI were observed in
six sectors, with the electrical machine building industry posting
the highest increase of 37.9 percent from 686.5 to 946.7.
</P>
<P>
The food manufacturing sector followed with an increase of 31.9
percent from 197.8 to 260.8. Coconut products, milled and refined
sugar, grain mill products and miscellaneous food products
contributed to the increase in this significant rise.
</P>
<P>
Since April, the industries of garments, rubber and paper
recorded double-digit year-on-year decreases in the VPI, the NSO
said.
</P>
<P>
In September, the garment industry recorded the biggest drop of
34.5 percent this year, compared with last year's index of 297.3,
the survey showed. The NSO predicted the downtrend in the apparel
industry will continue due to depressed external demand and
shutdown of some key sample enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Month-on-month increases were observed in six sectors, of which
the electrical machine building industry also registered the
highest increase of 21.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Adviser Denies Using Impolite Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior aide of Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Tuesday night denied having
used inappropriate words in comments on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's criticism of settlement expansion, reported Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
At his daily briefing Tuesday, U.S. State Department Spokesman
Nicholas Burns indicated to reporters that David Bar-Ilan,
Director for Policy Planning and Communication of the Israeli
Prime Minister's Office, was disrespectful to President Bill
Clinton when he referred to the U.S. statements about the
settlements as "semantic posturing."
</P>
<P>
However, Bar-Ilan denied this, saying he would never use such
language. He said that he had already telephoned Burns to
clarify the matter.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton said at the White House that Israel's new
policy encouraging Jewish settlers to come to the occupied
territories was "preempting" Israeli-Palestinian final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he would agree to the characterization of
settlements as an obstacle to peace, Clinton responded
"absolutely."
</P>
<P>
On Bar-Ilan's statement, Burns said: "I don't believe that's
a polite way to refer to the words of the president of the U.S.,
who, after all, is a very, very clear supporter of the State of
Israel and has followed, since he came into office, a policy of
support for Israel's defense needs, support for the security of
Israel, a real friendship for Israel in a thousand different
ways."
</P>
<P>
Burns said: "So when the president of the U.S. speaks, we
very respectfully would hope that other friendly governments
would listen with respect."
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan, who was former executive editor of The Jerusalem
Post and well-known for his strong rightwing views, said in
response to Clinton's statements that the U.S. was consistent in
its positions regarding settlements and it was the U.S., not
Israel, who should change its policy.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic incident reflects in a way the Clinton
administration's unhappiness about the Netanyahu government's
hardline policy regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's statements came after nine former U.S. secretaries
of state and national security advisers signed a letter urging
Netanyahu not to expand settlements.
</P>
<P>
The former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Professor Itamar
Raninovich, told Israel Television Tuesday night that the
letter reflects the views of the White House.
</P>
<P>
Rabinovich, who was also an Israeli negotiator with Syria, said
that he would expect a harsher U.S. attitude toward Israel
should the government do not change its current policy.

<HEADLINE> IMF Makes Positive Assessment of HK's Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has made a very positive assessment of Hong Kong's
economic performance in 1996 and its prospects in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The assessment was made in a concluding statement by an IMF
mission following an annual consultation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Secretary, Donald Tsang, decided to make public
the statement for the first time today, as part of the Hong Kong
government's efforts to enhance openness and transparency.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the IMF noted that, compared to last year,
there is a "significant reduction of uncertainties" over the
handover in 1997 and "widely held confidence" concerning Hong
Kong's prospects.
</P>
<P>
The IMF statement said that the current macroeconomics
conditions in Hong Kong are healthy, providing a conducive
environment for a smooth political transition.
</P>
<P>
A moderate recovery is underway, with a real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rate reaching 4.5 to 4.75 percent in 1996,
and the recovery would continue to broaden and strengthen, gaining
a 5 to 5.25 percent real growth in 1997, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It added that the confidence was helped by reassurances made by
China on keeping Hong Kong's economic and legal system intact. In
particular, China's commitment to maintain two separate monetary
systems and currencies, and two mutually independent monetary
authorities was noted.
</P>
<P>
The mission also pointed out that the rule of law, neutrality
of the civil service, impartiality of the judiciary, and freedom
of information are elements which are key to Hong Kong's economic
future.
</P>
<P>
Under Article Four of the IMF Articles of Agreement, the IMF
consults its members and their territories on their economic
policies. The IMF has annually sent a mission to conduct an
economic review on Hong Kong since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the IMF mission came to Hong Kong for ten
days and held discussions with the private sector and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
"The independent, candid and authoritative views and advice we
receive each year from the IMF are insightful and
thought-provoking. They are both important and helpful," said
Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The IMF strongly endorsed the continuation of Hong Kong's
existing policy framework -- prudent fiscal policy, the linked
exchange rate and firm financial regulation.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Hong Kong to promote competition in areas such as
telecommunications, transportation, utilities and broadcasting,
saying future development would critically depend on the
competitiveness in the service-based industries.

<HEADLINE> Border Accord With China Must Be Honored: Russian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The agreement between Russia
and China on the eastern section of the boundary must be honored
unconditionally, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Russian border agreement was based on norms of modern
international law and was in Russia's interest, Gennady Tarasov,
director of the Press Bureau of the Foreign Ministry told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov made the remarks in response to the opposition of some
local officials in Eastern Russia to the demarcation work between
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
The remarks of those local officials run counter to a federal
policy sanctioned by Russian president, Tarasov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Federal Assembly approved the border agreement in
February 1992 and the two countries exchanged instruments of
ratification in the following month.
</P>
<P>
Border demarcation has won the support of Russian federal
leaders, but been opposed by several local officials.

<HEADLINE> East Coastal City Attracting Taiwanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province's Ningbo
city has become a popular spot for Taiwanese investors because of
a good investment environment and promising future.
</P>
<P>
The coastal city has approved 667 enterprises with a total
investment of nearly two billion US dollars, a third of which are
solely owned by Taiwanese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six Taiwan-funded companies have invested over 10
million US dollars each, accounting for 74 percent of the total
Taiwan investment in Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
Since the country launched its opening up and reform policy in
the 1970s, both the central and local governments have put a large
amount of funds into infrastructure at Beilun Port, the Beilun
Power Plant, and into an expressway linking Ningbo with the
provincial capital, Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The city has adopted regulations for investment from Taiwan and
the city government has given special care to these firms.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. The amount of investment from the
island province has been growing in the recent years, and small
Taiwanese companies occasionally join together to invest in
Ningbo. The "Zhejiang Far-East Industrial City", for example, has
been jointly funded by 120 members of the Taiwan association of
toy manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Talent Bank Discuss West-East Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars are calling
for more support to be given to western China to narrow the
economic gap between western and eastern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Harsh natural conditions are blamed for lack of development in
the west, according to participants at a symposium being held here
on social and economic development in west China, who note that a
major factor is also lack of investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to some scholars, investment in fixed assets in west
China was only 11 to 12 percent of the nation's total over the
past few years, and transportation, telecommunications, and energy
facilities are poor, while science and technology personnel are
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The area is home to more than a dozen ethnic groups and borders
several countries. An underdeveloped west China would undermine
national unity and social stability, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
In its Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) and Long-Range
Objectives For the Year 2010 the Chinese Government noted that
"efforts must be made to narrow the gap."
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested that that greater efforts should be made in
developing the rich natural resources in the region to spur
industry, and that preference should be given to basic facilities
to improve the investment environment and living conditions, while
economic and technological ties between western and eastern parts
should be strengthened, emphasis should be put on some major
cities, and state policies should be made for the area.
</P>
<P>
The western part of China covers 5.38 million sq km, or 56
percent of the nation's territory, and has a population of 273
million, or 23 percent of the national total. It has more than 50
percent of the nation's arable land, grassland, and forests, over
50 percent of the nation's coal resources and 71 percent of the
hydro-electric energy resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the region's share of the national economy has been
decreasing in recent years. It accounted only for 16.4 percent of
the nation's GDP in 1990, but dropped to 14.4 percent in 1994, and
14.1 percent in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 18 (Xinhua)-- The first ever appraisal of a
Hong Kong company by Chinese inspectors could pave the way for
China to win more international business of this kind.
</P>
<P>
Two appraisers from the Zhejiang Appraising Centre under the
State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export
Commodities left today for Hong Kong to carry out the
appraisal of the Hong Kong Yeufung Industrial Company.
</P>
<P>
The work will be done according to the quality assurance system
based on the recognised international standard, ISO9000, which is
universally received.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors have been entitled to examine the company's
performance of the quality system and its results, and to decide
whether or not to recommend the company to be registered by the
State administration.
</P>
<P>
China has set up an ISO9000 working committee involving 19
ministries and commissions in an effort to popularize the
operation in export-oriented enterprises. More than 200
authentication licenses have been approved.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang center held training classes this year in Shenzhen
together with the Federation of Hong Kong Industries to
familiarize Hong Kong-funded enterprises with the system.
</P>
<P>
It has won a good reputation by carrying out strict and fair
appraising of overseas-funded enterprises by multinationals like
the US's Du Pont and Japanese-owned Matsushita.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Air Force Seeks US Glide Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel Air Force is
seeking to acquire from the United States a precision glide bomb
that can revolutionize air tactics, the latest edition of Defense
News reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, named as the Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW), was
jointly developed by the U.S. Navy and Air Force and is
scheduled to enter low-rate production early next year.
</P>
<P>
The JSOW is a platform with fold-out wings that can glide up
to 60 kilometers after it is dropped by an aircraft. It is
designed to hold various weapons, including anti-personnel
bomblets and more deadly bombs capable of taking out radar
installations and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
More advanced versions of the JSOW will enable a pilot to
drop one over a tank formation and move on to other targets.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the JSOW is not a strategic weapon, but it
can have capability of one aircraft to attack a various number of
targets while avoiding flying directly over targets so to reduce
the risk of being attacked.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Eitan Ben-Eliahu
discussed the JSOW deal with U.S. officials during his visit to
Washington last week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Eliahu also expressed desire for other cheaper precision
weapons like the Joint Direct Attack Munition, a laser-guided
kit attached to bombs, which allows them to be released from
great heights with deadly accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The United States as the closest ally of Israel is providing
1.8 billion U.S. dollars of annual military aid to maintain
Israel's military superiority over its Arab neighbors,
especially those who have yet made peace with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan New Party Promises to Establish Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Imran Khan, the most popular
cricket star of Pakistan and chief of a new party named
Tehreek-e-Insaf, said today that the destination of his party is
to establish peace and justice in the society.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as chief guest at an award ceremony held by All
Pakistan Muslim Labor Conference in Karachi, Imran Khan said that
if his party came to power in the general elections scheduled on
February 3, 1997, they would establish an era of justice and
progress in the society.
</P>
<P>
He said that instead of criticizing the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, those corrupt people who secured
loans in the name of the country should be punished and the loans
should be recovered.
</P>
<P>
He said that revolutionary changes were needed in the
prevailing political culture and that his party was bringing to
fore those who enjoy good reputation.
</P>
<P>
Imran Khan was a classmate of former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto at Oxford University in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Leading Pakistan's national team to win the Cricket World Cup
1992, Imran Khan became the hero of the country where cricket is
the most popular sport.
</P>
<P>
He became a controversial figure last year when he married the
daughter of a British millionaire in Britain, while Pakistani
people want their hero to marry a Pakistani girl who is also a
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Since he came back to Pakistan with his wife this year, Imran
Khan has been active in politics and founded Tehreek-e-Insaf in
April.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to fight against the rampant corruption in the country
and won certain public support.
</P>
<P>
Tehreek-e-Insaf was the first party in Pakistan to start the
election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SAARC: Progress Made, Rough Road Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- In the past 11 years, the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has made
some achievements in agreed areas of cooperation as well as in
economic and trade fields. Yet the progress is not as big as
expected due to mistrust and differences among the member nations.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The objectives in the
charter, adopted on December 8,1985, for SAARC are: to promote the
welfare of the peoples of South Asia and to improve their quality
of life; to accelerate economic growth, social progress and
cultural development in the region; to contribute to mutual trust,
understanding and appreciation of one another's problems.
</P>
<P>
In the past 11 years, member nations have agreed on cooperation
in the following areas: agriculture (including forestry),
communications, education and culture, environment, health and
population activities, meteorology, prevention of drug trafficking
and drug abuse, rural development, science and technology,
tourism, transport, and women in development.
</P>
<P>
A regional study on trade, manufacturing and services (TMS) was
completed in 1991 outlining a number of recommendations for
promoting regional cooperation in economic areas. The Council of
Ministers at its ninth session in Male, capital of the Maldives,
in July 1991, endorsed the study and decided to set up a
high-level (commerce secretaries) committee on economic
cooperation (CEC). The CEC formulates and oversees the
implementation of specific measures, policies and programs within
the framework of SAARC to strengthen and enhance intra-regional
cooperation in the fields of trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The 6th SAARC summit in 1991 accorded the highest priority to
the alleviation of poverty in all South Asian countries. In order
to achieve this, the 6th summit reaffirmed the importance of
attaining the target of providing primary education to all
children between the ages of 6-14 years by the year 2000 and
decided to establish an independent South Asian commission on
poverty alleviation to conduct an in-depth study of diverse
experiences of the SAARC countries on poverty alleviation and to
report to the 7th summit their recommendations on the alleviation
of poverty in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the 7th SAARC summit in Dhaka in April 1993, the member
nations signed an agreement on SAARC preferential trading
arrangement (SAPTA) and by the end of 1995 ratified the SAPTA
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The progress achieved by SAARC in the past 11 years, however,
is slow compared to other regional economic groupings due to
bilateral conflicts and mutual mistrust among the member nations.
The SAARC countries are still facing the multi-faceted and
intertwined crises of deep-rooted poverty, rapid population
increase, unsatisfactory human development, terrorism, internal
ethnic conflicts and bilateral conflicts even as regional
cooperation inches its way towards progress. As a result, some
SAARC resolutions and agreements have not been put into effect
while others have not been put into full play.
</P>
<P>
Politicians and experts here maintained that the key to SAARC's
success is the political will of all the member nations. There is
no doubt that a rough road lies ahead for SAARC, yet political
will, vision and vigor can successfully lead to regional economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Raid Hezbollah Bases in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes rocketed
guerrilla bases of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party
of God, in south Lebanon this morning, and there was no immediate
reports of casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Israeli air strike at Hezbollah bases
since Israel claimed that three Katyusha rockets fired into
northern Israel from south Lebanon Friday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the Israeli
warplanes launched three successive air raids around 6:30
a.m. (04:30 GMT), targeting Tetal Mlita in Iglim Al-Toffah, or
Province of Apple, a mountain area about 60 kilometers southeast
of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes fired six air-to-surface rockets at the targets,
black smokes were witnessed rising high into the sky and echos of
explosions were heard in the south Lebanese market town of
Nabatiyeh, according to the security sources.
</P>
<P>
The air offensive was accompanied by reconnaissance flights
of Israeli fighter jets at medium altitude over south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iglim Al-Toffah, which is often used by Hezbollah guerrillas
as a springboard to launch attacks at the Israeli self-carved
"security zone" in south Lebanon, was bombarded by Israel's
artillery Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the shells straightly hit a civilian house at Arab
Salim village, causing serious damages, while another hit a
Mercedes 230 at the same village.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raid came a day after a five-nation committee
monitoring a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border
completed its investigation of a rocket attack on Israel Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday, the committee confirmed that at
least one Katyusha rocket was fired into Israel from the area of
Qlaileh Friday.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's Foreign Ministry said that the cease-fire monitoring
committee, which groups France, the United States, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel, declined "to hold Lebanon responsible" for
the Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
The committee met in the border town of Naqoura at the
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon to
consider an Israeli complaint filed to the committee over the
Katyusha offensive.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee's statement said that "this act ran
counter to the April understanding," the U.S.-brokered cease-fire
agreement which put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Katyusha attack, the committee called on "all
those responsible to take appropriate measures to ensure that
such acts do not reoccur."
</P>
<P>
The committee was established under the April understanding to
look into complaints in case civilians on either side of the
border were targeted in military operations.
</P>
<P>
This was the seventh meeting of the committee since it was
set up in August.
</P>
<P>
In the previous meeting last week, the committee deplored the
Jewish state for bombardment at south Lebanese villages, in
which six civilians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Israeli warplanes carried out three air raids
at Hezbollah's guerrilla bases in the Syrian-controlled Western
Beqaa in southeast Lebanon without causing any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone in
1985 to protect the Jewish settlements in northern Israel from
border-crossing attacks.

<HEADLINE> Invisible Commodities Protected by Service Trademark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- "Oriental Horizon" and "Focal
Report" are two of the best-known prime time television programs
in China. But few people are aware that the names are also
registered service trademarks protected by law.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the names of the two prize-winning programs from
being misused, China Central Television (CCTV) last year
registered them with the Trademark Bureau of the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Because of the registration, no mass media, cultural
institutions, and publications can use the names of the TV
programs without authorization, otherwise they might face lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
They are only two of over 40,000 service trademarks registered
in China. Also among them are familiar names, such as "Kentucky
Fried Chicken", "MacDonalds", "Great Wall Sheraton Hotel", "China
Southern Airlines", "Bank of China", and "China International
Travel Service".
</P>
<P>
According to Wei Zhenzhi, a Division Director of the Trademark
Bureau, since registration began in July, 1993, the bureau has
received over 50,000 applications.
</P>
<P>
"Differing from commodity trademarks, service trademarks are
designed to protect the property rights of invisible commodities,
such as the name or logo of a service enterprise", Wei explained.
</P>
<P>
The registration covers a wide range, including hotels,
airlines, travel agencies, foreign trade companies, banks,
computer firms, television stations, commercial businesses,
hospitals, educational and entertainment units.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the awareness of Chinese enterprises for
registering service trademark is yet to be raised.
</P>
<P>
There has been over 10,000 new registration applications for
service trademark each year in the past few years, which only
accounts for ten percent of the commodity trademark.
</P>
<P>
While applications in Japan topped 130,000 in the six-month
transitional period after it began the registration, the figure in
China's transitional period only stood at 12,000, of which 34
percent were from overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Another feature is that the larger the enterprise, the more
aware it is of service trademark registration, Wei said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Projects built with World Bank
loans have recently started in Gansu province, an under-developed
area in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
These projects, which will involve 2.76 million US dollars in
loan, cover public health, agriculture and education.
</P>
<P>
A program aimed at improving basic education in
poverty-stricken areas will hold the largest sum of loan, said a
local official.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Gansu will use 18 million US dollars in loan
from the World Bank and allocate another 157 million yuan to
assist 23 primary and secondary schools in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Another major project will be a disease prevention program
which is to cover 10 provinces and cities with the aim to improve
immunity service and reduce the incidence of infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
Other projects include import of a seed processing line and
construction of seed nurturing bases.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has cooperated with the World Bank for 16 years. As the
region is an agricultural area, 72 percent of the WB loan has been
used in agriculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Committee of
the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) today asked its leader
former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to step down from his
present post in the interest of the unity and credibility of the
party, according to party sources here.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Executive Committee of the CPP held here
this morning in its resolution asked Rao to step down from the
post of CPP leader. The resolution was signed by the entire
24-member CPP Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
Following the defeat of the Congress Party headed by Rao in the
general elections during April-May this year and his involvement
in corruption cases, Rao was forced to resign as congress
president earlier but retained the leadership of the CPP. Since
then the anti-Rao camp within the party has stepped up its
pressure for his ouster from the CPP leadership. As the tussle
picked up momentum, Congress President Sitaram Kesri virtually put
Rao on notice, asserting that "hated and disliked" leaders should
retire from public life.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Zambia Rehabilitate Oil Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is to provide 44
million US Dollars to Zambia for the rehabilitation of the Tazama
petroleum pipeline, the country's major petroleum supplyer.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Zambian Energy Minister Suresh Desai in Ndola
on Wednesday when he toured energy facilities including the Indeni
Petroleum Refinery, the Zambia National Oil Company and the Tazama
Terminal.
</P>
<P>
The 1,710 kilometer Tazama pipeline was commissioned in 1968. It
pumps crude oil from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Ndola.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the line also has a component of
building a bulk storage tank on the Zambian side as a safety
valve against unexpected crude pumping stoppage. The bulk-tank
will have a 50,000 cubic meter capacity that keeps the Indeni
Refinery running for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
At present, Tazama has bulk storage facilities in Dar es Salaam
while on the Zambian side it operates on a hand-to-mouth basis.

<HEADLINE> India's Air Transport Poised for Take-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- India's airports will
witness a major boom with explosive growth in international and
domestic air traffic, and India's share in Asia-Pacific air travel
will rise to 6 percent by the year 2000 from its current level of
2 percent, said a latest study by the Confederation of Indian
Industry (CII).
</P>
<P>
With an increase in disposable income among emerging middle
class and growth in business activities, domestic passenger
transport over a longer period of a decade-and-half is expected to
rise six fold to 85 million journeys from nearly 15 million at
present.
</P>
<P>
International traffic is expected to touch 25.3 million
passengers by the year 2012 from 10.7 million in 1995-96. Overall
growth in economy will simultaneously lead to massive cargo
transport.
</P>
<P>
Domestic cargo transport is expected to grow from 128,000 tons
to 350,000 tons while international cargo inflow to India is
likely to go up to 2,191,000 tons from 433,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
An open sky policy has facilitated the clearing of cargo piled
up at the airports and greater inflow of tourists into the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease present and future congestion, efficient and
competitive procedures are required for awarding take-off and
landing rights at crowded airports, the CII study said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The first diesel locomotive
that can travel at a speed of more than 120 kph came off
production line Tuesday at the Dalian Rolling Stock Plant.
</P>
<P>
The Dongfeng-4D locomotive, which can pull 20 passenger
carriages, will soon go into mass production. The effort is aimed
at catering for an increasing demand for faster trains on several
major rail lines in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways has decided to raise train speed to
120 kph on railways from Beijing to Guangzhou, Shanghai, and
Harbin, and the Harbin-Dalian line in northeast China, from April
1 next year.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian plant plans to produce 50 high-speed locomotives in
the first quarter of next year, and the annual output will reach
150.
</P>
<P>
The new type of locomotive has a diesel engine of nearly 3,000
kw, 500 kw more than Dongfeng-4B locomotives which are being
widely used on China's trains. Designers say Dongfeng-4D
locomotives represent a high technical level.

<HEADLINE> Output of Major Industries Dips in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Cumulative growth of
industrial production registered by 24 select industries in India
declined to 4.8 percent between April and October this year,
compared to 12.1 percent a year earlier, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
While the drop was sharp for six infrastructure industries,
which saw a combined growth rate of just 3 percent as against 10.4
percent in the same period of last year, the other 18 major
industries posted a combined growth rate of 8 percent, compared
with 15.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
If the sharp decline in the growth rate of the 24 industries is
any indication, it will be difficult for India to achieve a
double-digit industrial growth in 1996-97 as these industries
carry a combined weight of 50.37 in the index of industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry, however, has been claiming that this
year would also end in a double-digit growth rate for industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
Among the major industries, crude petroleum, with a negative
growth rate of 10.2 percent, tops the list of industries which
continue to register dismal performance in the current financial
year. It is followed by phosphatic fertilizers (-6 percent) and
nitrogenous fertilizers (-5 percent).
</P>
<P>
The power sector and salable steel industries, however, showed
a marginal improvement in their production in October with a
growth rate of 4.4 percent and 1.5 percent respectively, compared
with 3.8 percent and 0.8 percent in September this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved a new labor bill, enabling the country's workers,
especially women and children, to obtain greater protection and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, workers will enjoy the maximum working
time of 48 hours per week and 30 days of sick leave with pay.
</P>
<P>
Those who have worked for six uninterrupted years are entitled
to claim severance pay for 240 days, while those who have worked

300 days.
</P>
<P>
The bill raises the minimum working age from 13 to 15 with

one-hour break for every four straight hours.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which is on the way to the parliament for
approval, employers are prohibited from demanding guarantee money
from their employees unless the nature of their work is related to
money.
</P>
<P>
The bill also indicates that employers are banned from firing
female workers because they are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
In a business where 500 workers are employed, a labor committee
comprising equal representation from both parties must be set up.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government approval of the labor bill was
part of its effort to promote the people's social welfare as
promised by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh in the November
election.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner to Punish Party President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali ruling partner,
which announced to withdraw from the coalition government, has
decided to take disciplinary action against its party president
after he defied a party whip, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Central Working Committee (CWC) of the
National Democratic Party (RPP) Tuesday took the decision after
party president Surya Bahadur Thapa and some of RPP MPs in the
lower house sat on the ruling bench when a special house session
opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
The special session of the House of Representatives, called by
King Birendra as requested by 102 MPs, is expected to discuss a
no-confidence motion against the three-party coalition government
led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
The motion will be jointly tabled by the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and
the RPP.
</P>
<P>
The RPP meeting Tuesday was attended by 23 of its 41 CWC
members. The 23 CWC members earlier decided to stop supporting the
present government and form a new coalition government with the
main opposition CPN-UML.
</P>
<P>
RPP parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand will become
prime minister of the RPP-UML government if the current coalition
government is toppled by the no-confidence motion, opposition
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a small leftist party, Nepal Workers' and Peasants'
Party, Tuesday put forth some preconditions, such as the country's
economic independence and administrative discipline, for its
support for the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Support from the party, which has two MPs in the lower house,
is important for the no-confidence motion sponsors as the motion
requires a majority of 103 votes to pass in the 205-seat house.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 gunmen attacked the
Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima Tuesday night and held
hostage diplomats and officials attending a party there, local
press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Shots were exchanged between the gunmen and police guarding the
residence, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The attackers, identified themselves as the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement (TARM), set off one large explosion and two
minor ones, and were trapped inside the residence along with
Peru's Foreign and Agriculture ministers, various foreign
ambassadors and Peruvian congressmen.
</P>
<P>
It was not known exactly how many people were inside.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki as telling
Japan's Broadcasting Corp. that there were some 800 people held
hostage at the residence.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the guerrillas said they were holding 250
hostages inside the residence, while authorities said earlier that
they believed 40 hostage were held there.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas threatened to kill the hostages unless
authorities released their colleagues from prison, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman asked for immediate negotiations with government
representatives and asked that the talks be broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
Police had surrounded the building in the San Isidro district
of Lima, in an area with various foreign embassies.
</P>
<P>
Guests at the reception to honor Monday's birthday of Japanese
Emperor Akihito included ambassadors from Brazil, Bolivia and
Cuba, as well as Carlos Torres Lara y Lara, president of the
Congress, and Peru's agriculture and foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
At the scene, Jose Munoz, a security guard with the Venezuelan
Embassy said that country's ambassador was also inside, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Some hostages had left the residence in small groups, including
several dozen women and old men. Among them was the mother of the
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is of Japanese descent.
</P>
<P>
TARM is the smaller of Peru's two main armed movements.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace Is Illusive in Sri Lanka (1) by Li Zheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- For Sri Lanka, the tiny island
nation in the Indian Ocean, peace is a dream that seems as remote
as the Moon or the Mars in the sky and hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
As the year 1996 drawing to a close, the government and the
Tamil rebels that have been locked in deadly fighting since 1983
are still not prepared to seek a solution of their conflict by
other means. And observers tend to believe that the civil war
seems certain to go on indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the Sri Lankan government is ready for
renewing peace talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) with or without foreign mediation. The British and Indian
governments are willing to play that role.
</P>
<P>
But, preconditions laid down by both sides stand in the way of
negotiations. The government wants the LTTE to lay down their arms
which the latter categorically refuses. The LTTE want a ceasefire
and the withdrawal of government troops from liberated areas which
the government is not prepared to concede.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the peace in Sri Lanka seems a
distant dream although it is of prime importance for the island
nation to survive and develop alongside the rest of the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of this year, the Sri Lankan government
launched a massive recruitment drive for its armed forces. It
purchased large quantities of arms, ammunition and equipment. It
launched many well- conceived operations against the Tamil rebels
successfully and captured areas earlier held by them.
</P>
<P>
The government forces were able to rout the rebels from their
heartland, Jaffna city, last December. Further successive
operations enabled them to recapture the entire Jaffna Peninsula
by May this year.
</P>
<P>
More combined operations enabled the forces to dislodge the
rebels from many of their strongholds and finally in September
they routed the rebels from their last bastion at Kilinochchi
Town.
</P>
<P>
The forces are now consolidating their positions after having
regained most of the lost territory and having captured large
stocks of arms and ammunition from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in desperation, having suffered these reversals in
the North, sent suicide bombers to Colombo to raise havoc. They
blasted the Central Bank building and neighboring high-rise
commercial buildings, causing much damage and destruction to the
country's economic center. On that occasion over 90 persons were
killed and over 1,400 others injured.
</P>
<P>
In July, they blasted an office train in Dehiwela, a suburban
town of Colombo, where more than 70 died and over 500 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, Attorney General Sarath Silva filed indictments
against rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and nine others
suspected to be behind the Central Bank bomb blast. He was also
examining India's request for the extradition of Prabhakaran and
others wanted for the slaying of former Indian prime minister
Rajiv Gandhi who was assassinated by an LTTE woman suicide bomber.
This was the first time legal action was initiated by the
government against the rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
Senior military officials have expressed confidence that the
war will end soon and peace will follow. But President Chandrika
Kumaratunga does not share their optimism. She has reiterated time
and again that the war will take more time to end and thereafter
it will be a long arduous journey towards ultimate peace. She has
said that a military solution will not mean the end of the basic
problem which requires a political solution.
</P>
<P>
She believes that this national issue can be resolved only
through peaceful negotiation. To this end, she exhorted last month
the rebels to lay down arms and come to peace talks at an early
date. She has since repeated her call but the rebels have
rejected these approaches again and again.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace Is Illusive in Sri Lanka (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sri Lanka's ethnic tension has been simmering for a long time.
Sri Lanka which is a mosaic of ethnic cultures is liable to strife
with historical roots.
</P>
<P>
Its population comprises 74 percent of Sinhalese and 18 percent
of Tamils and enmity and confrontation erupted between the two
ethnic groups on several occasions since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1948, the minority Tamil community has
consistently complained of discrimination by successive Sinhalese
governments. Ultimately island-wide hostilities broke out in July
1983 with a major ethnic riot and bloodshed. Subsequently the LTTE
launched a guerrilla war for a separate state in the north and the
east which so far has taken the life of over 55,000 persons and
rendered one million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the urgency for ending the war, successive
governments attempted the political option but to no avail.
Assuming power in 1994, the present People's Alliance government
pledged to end the war and establish peace in the country. To
achieve this, it entered into a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE
and held four rounds of talks within five months. But later, the
LTTE unilaterally reneged the ceasefire and rekindled the war.
</P>
<P>
The military thereafter went at the LTTE rebels with a
vengeance, but despite notable victories, the war continues
unabated. It is anticipated that the war will continue on a wider
scale. Though dislodged in the North, the rebels still hold
positions in the North Central and Southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Occasionally they attacked Anuradhapura, the capital of the
North Central province. They have infiltrated into the National
Park of Yala in the deep South on three occasions and destroyed
bungalows in the park, captured vehicles of tourists and taken in
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The present situation is that both the government and the LTTE
rebels are not ready to concede anything to each other. On the one
hand, the LTTE is pursuing its military stance determined to
attain its idealistic separate state. On the other hand, the
government will carry on pushing the military option as a prelude
to achieving a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Senior military officers have said that they are ready to hound
out the rebels from their jungle bases. But the LTTE has been
preparing for such an eventuality. It has set up training bases
for its cadres, stealthily purchased modern military equipment
abroad and attempted to attack liberated areas with a view to
recapturing them.
</P>
<P>
Observers here are of the view that the civil war in Sri Lanka
will continue without an end in sight.

<P>
DHAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Prisoners demanding better
living conditions have been holding the control of the Jessore
Central Jail in southwestern Bangladesh since Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, the trouble started
on Monday morning following a wrangle between jail warders and
prisoners over distribution of food.
</P>
<P>
The unruly prisoners drove out the warders from the jail and
got entrenched around the jail compound, authorities confirmed,
adding that they are demanding reintroduction of a rule made in
1990 by the then caretaker government enhancing facilities for
jail inmates.
</P>
<P>
High officials rushed to Jessore but failed to come to grips
with the jail revolt while police from other districts were called

<HEADLINE> Clinton Approves NATO Plan for New Force to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today approved NATO's plan for a new NATO-led military force, with
U.S. military participation, in Bosnia to keep peace in the Baltic
country.
</P>
<P>
In a brief written statement, Clinton said he welcomed the NATO
decision to move ahead with a Bosnia "Stabilization Force."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the alliance's 16 defense ministers in
Brussels approved a final "activation order" to the military to
deploy a Stabilization Force (SFOR) of 31,000 at its peak and to
remain in the country for 18 months. The force will include about
8,300 Americans.
</P>
<P>
The new force takes over from the current Implementation Force
(IFOR) policing the Dayton peace accord on December 20, the day
its mandate expires. The accord, brokered by the United States
and reached in the Ohio city of Dayton, the U.S., helped bring an
end to the 43-month war in November, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"By preventing the parties from sliding back into armed
conflict and providing more breathing space for political and
economic efforts to take hold, SFOR will help Bosnians assume full
responsibility for their future -- a future without an outside
military presence," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders said the force would concentrate on providing the
security climate in which the Dayton peace accord could continue
to be implemented. Clinton said his administration would review
the situation every six months to see the necessity of reducing
the force level.
</P>
<P>
SFOR was authorized by the U.N. Security Council last week.
The 17 non-NATO countries contributing to IFOR have also agreed to
maintain their participation in the new force.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said today that the U.S. is satisfied with the
recent positive progress of the Sino-U.S. relations, which had
experienced a difficult period in the past.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the remarks when meeting Liu Huaqiu, Director
of the Foreign Affairs Office of China's State Council. Liu is on
a visit to Washington at the invitation of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said President Bill Clinton reaffirmed, after his
re-election, the dedication of the U.S. government to the
improvement and development of U.S.-China relations, and took
positive steps including an increase of high-level contacts and
exchange of visits.
</P>
<P>
He said that although he would leave the post of the Secretary
of State soon, he believed the wide ranging common interests
shared by the United States and China would enable both sides to
overcome and reduce differences. He expressed hope that
U.S.-China relations would make greater progress during the second
term of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the recent successful meeting between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in Manila had a
very important significance in promoting the improvement and
development of the relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that to maintain a good relationship was a common
desire of the peoples of the two countries. It conformed to the
fundamental interests of the two countries and was beneficial to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the entire
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides should, from the strategic angle and
with the approach of the 21st century, strengthen dialogue and
cooperation, and carefully settle the existing problems and
differences so as to enable Sino-U.S. relations to make healthy
and stable progress on the basis of the three Joint Communiques.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting on the U.S. side were Under-secretaries
of State Peter Tarnoff and Lynn Davis, and U.S. Ambassador to

MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian
Development Bank (ADB) Tuesday approved a 50-million-US-dollar
loan, the first of its kind, for some rural enterprises in
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The loan, together with a technical assistance grant worth

rehabilitate and modernize at least 25 small and medium non-state
enterprises in the country's agro-processing sector.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises in Uzbekistan have faced severe cash and
credit constraints, leading to a progressively worsening economy
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is estimated to be complete in mid-June
2002, will mitigate rural unemployment and contain further
deterioration of the agro-processing industry of the country.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Price Index Downs in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' consumer price
index (CPI) for all income households has exhibited a downward
trend in November compared with the level last month, according to
the National Statistics Office (NSO).
</P>
<P>
CPI on all items showed a declining trend for the last three
consecutive months as it settled at 229.6 in the 11th month of the
year, dwindling 0.17 percent compared with the 230.0 posted in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
CPI is a general measure of average monthly and annual changes
in retail prices of commodities commonly bought by consumers from
all income households.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, CPI measures the purchasing power of the country's
currency. As the CPI increases, the purchasing power of the peso
devaluates. On the other hand, as the CPI decreases, peso
purchasing power appreciates.
</P>
<P>
Using 1988 as base year at 100, the peso purchasing power in
November settled at 0.4355 pesos, compared with the 0.4348 peso
value recorded in October.
</P>
<P>
The latest NSO figures showed that fuel, light, and water
exhibited the largest increase to reach 237.0 in November, up 1.28
percent against the 234.0 posted in October.
</P>
<P>
Despite a decline in the overall CPI, the CPI on all items in
Metro Manila remained on an upward trend for two consecutive
months as it stood at 249.7 in November, up slightly by 0.12
percent over the 249.4 registered a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Combat Grey Economy by Tax Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Widespread illegal economic
activities are prompting the Ukraine Government to reform its tax
system in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reform, announced by officials, is part of the "Government
Action Program" for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Tax reform is seen as reinforcement to the financial reform and
currency reform policies unfolded in 1995 and the start of 1996.
It is aimed against the "grey economy," another name people use
for illegal economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, which is shifting from a central-planned system into a
market economy, has been troubled by the grey economy for several
years.
</P>
<P>
The grey economy covers a wide range of activities from
tax-evading businesses to illegal financial dealings that go
beyond the supervision of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
About 17.1 percent of the population of the country are
involved in such activities, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey jointly made by the Ministry of Labor and the
World Bank shows that those who turn to grey economy activities
after losing their jobs amount to about 12.6 percent of the total
labor force in the country.
</P>
<P>
Around 5.5 million moonlighters have also joined in such
activities, 5 to 10 percent of whom are pensioners.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 3.3 billion grivna (1.78 billion
U.S. dollars) and 6 to 16 billion dollars cash circulate outside
the governmental bank system. Grey economy money is estimated to
bring in a profit of about 5 to 8 billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Investigation shows that about 50 percent of the country's
total income is in the hands of only 20 percent of population,
Ukrainian governmental officials say.
</P>
<P>
The grey economy also disrupts the operation of the country's
economy. Experts say the state got at least 7.8 billion grivna
(about 4.2 billion dollars) less than expected for the year's
budget by the end of last November.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Israel to Abide by Peace Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, on a visit in Vennia, today urged Israel to abide
by all the peace accords it has signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference held with Austrian Federal
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Arafat warned if the Middle East peace
process stopped, the whole region would face "real difficulty" and
there would be a "time bomb" there.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of violating the existing accords and
repeatedly putting forward new conditions.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that Israel lift its blockade on Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here earlier today for a two-day visit to
Austria, said that the Palestinians are determined to continue the
peace process and the Israeli government headed by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is also required to take the same stand.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe should play an "active and powerful role"
in the Middle East and that the European Union (EU), which was one

<HEADLINE> Workers Burn Down Thai Firm After Bonus Talks Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai workers at an electronic
company burnt down the company headquarters and its warehouse here
late last night after their talks on the year-end bonus with the
management broke down.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said today that the violence taking place
at the headquarters of Sanyo Universal Electric Co. was the worst
ever in the country to a major firm in a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh rushed to the scene
to supervise peace-keeping and fire fighting as fire engines from
almost all fire stations in Bangkok were mobilized to fight the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
The incident flared at about 6 p.m. after the company's workers
learnt that their talks with the management failed and then at
least 2,000 workers began to rally in the forecourt of the company
to smash the company headquarters building with rocks, whisky and
beer bottles and demolish the courtyard fence.
</P>
<P>
The situation was soon beyond the control when the protesters
began to set fire on the company's four-storey warehouse which
houses refrigerators, televisions and air compressors before the
fire spread into the eight-storey headquarters building.
</P>
<P>
At least 400 policemen were sent to the spot but blocked out of
the sealed company after clashes with some workers.

BUDAPEST, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian President Arpad
Goncz today filled two key ministerial posts vacant for more than
20 days.
</P>
<P>
Nagy Frigyes was named agriculture minister to replace Laszlo
Lakos who was sacked by Prime Minister Gyula Horn on November
27. Horn said a change was needed to prepare Hungary's agriculture
to meet European Union requirements.
</P>
<P>
Komeny Mihaly took over as the new welfare minister from Gyorgy
Szabo, who resigned on November 26 in protest against insufficient
funds for the health service in 1997. He will be the third welfare
minister in two years.
</P>
<P>
Szabo and Lakos were the latest in a string of 11 ministerial
resignations or sackings which have plagued the government since
it was formed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some political observers said the latest changes were made
because the prime minister was under pressure from his party to
reshuffle the government to bring new faces before the elections
in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- In a to improve Hainan
province's tourism market, tourism authorities have taken steps
against some travel businesses for breaking the rules.
</P>
<P>
Those punished included 35 travel agencies which conducted
irregular operations, 26 tourism guides without professional
certificates, eight hotels that undercut their prices to
unreasonably low levels. Four tourist sites were stopped for a
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the province has focused on
reorganizing the tourism market and regulate business activities
to promote a healthy development of its travel industry.
</P>
<P>
From April to November, the provincial authorities have revoked
the licenses of 100 travel services for irregularities, punished
11 other services and 106 guides.
</P>
<P>
The tourism authorities have also set the lowest protective
prices for travel services, hotels, and tourist sites to put an
end to unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
A healthy market has instilled new vitality into Hainan's
travel industry. The island has been regarded as one of the most
attractive tourist destinations in China by experts and ordinary
travelers alike.
</P>
<P>
By November, some 3.6 million domestic and overseas travelers

<HEADLINE> Philippines Needs to Import Huge Amount of Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has to import a
large amount of fish in the next three years because of a big
average deficit in its fish supply each year during the period,
according to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.
</P>
<P>
The bureau, in a review on the fishery industry, said that the
country had suffered a deficit of 763,000 tons in its fish supply
for years, adding that the trend will continue until the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The country has already imported a significant amount of fish
during the past few years. By the end of June 1996, total fish
shipped into the country reached nearly 91,000 tons worth more
than 900 million pesos (34.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country's fishery industry has failed to meet the domestic
demand during the past decade despite a considerable increase in
fish production during the period. Between 1986 and 1995, fish
production increased by 31.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The supply situation may get worse since the fishery industry
registered the first decrease in its total output for the first
six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, total fish output reached 1.25 million
tons, down 3.3 percent from the level for the previous year. But
the bureau did not give the reason for the decline in fish
production.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the Philippines has fell to the 12th
place in the list of the world's top fish producers in 1995 from
the 7th place in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Czech Minister Resigns Over Phony Law Doctorate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Czech Deputy Prime Minister and
Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda resigned today after admitting his
doctor of law qualification was fake, the Czech News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kalvoda's resignation comes amid a growing row over the
academic qualifications of Czech politicians.
</P>
<P>
He is the second member of parliament to quit for falsely using
an academic title. Three other deputies have also admitted using
false titles, but have not resigned, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kalvoda, 43, was the leader of the Civic Democratic Alliance, a
junior partner in the ruling coalition. He was appointed deputy
prime minister and justice minister last July.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, head of the Civic Democratic
Party, told reporters that Kalvoda's resignation would not affect
the stability of the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet on Wednesday morning with Christian
Democrat chairman Josef Lux and a designated member of Kalvoda's
party to assess the situation in the three-party coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Kalvoda's party were not immediately available
for comment, and it was not yet clear who would take Kalvoda's
place in the cabinet or what his status would be within his party.
</P>
<P>
Kalvoda is the most senior politician to have resigned in the
growing scandal over the false use of qualifications. Pavla
Jurkova, a member of the Christian Democrats, resigned her seat in
the lower house for falsely claiming a law doctorate, the news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Two members of Klaus's party -- Anna Roeschova and Ondrej
Zemina -- also admitted their law doctorates were false, but have
not resigned.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Reports Marked Achievements in Desert Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Deserts in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region are shrinking dramatically, due to the
great efforts the local government has organized in desert control
in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries in the world which suffers most
from serious desert encroachment. Its desert area stands at 3.32
million square kilometers, or 34 percent of its total
landspace. Some 400 million people are threatened by desert
encroachment.
</P>
<P>
A census carried out in 1995 shows that Inner Mongolia has
31,35 million hectares of sandy deserts, 5 million hectares of
potential sandy desert area, 1.03 million hectares of sandy
farmland and 4.58 million hectares of sandy grassland and pastures.
</P>
<P>
In the region, there are five major deserts including the
Badain Jaran Desert, the Ulan Buh Desert, the Tengger Desert and
the Hobq Desert.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the region's farmland and 60 percent of its
grassland are threatened by wind and sand shifting.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Jiaxiang, director of the region's forestry
bureau, Inner Mongolia started desert control in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the central government launched a ten year desert
control program (1991-2000), to harness 7 million hectares of
sandy land, 40 of which lie in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Forestry show that
between 1991 and 1995, the region harnessed 1.47 million hectares
of desert land by planting trees and grass and building fences.
</P>
<P>
At present, 22 percent of the region's desert area has been put
under control. The green coverage rate in the Muus Desert has
reached 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Aohan Banner in southern Horqin started to harness desert land
in the 1970s. By the end of 1995, the banner had planted more than
300,000 hectares of trees.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1960s, the local frost-free period is 5.3
days longer and windy days are reduced and wind speed has also
dropped greatly. In 1994, the banner became one of the ten major
grain producers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
To date, the region has a dozen banners and counties which have
been awarded by the state for making outstanding achievements in
desert control.
</P>
<P>
The region has established a responsibility system to enhance
efforts in this regard. Government officials have taken the lead
and set up more than 1,500 tree-planting pilot zones, covering
70,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The central government invests some 50 million yuan in
interest-free loans for desert-harnessing in Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
During the period between 1996-2000, the region will focus its
attention to harnessing sand land in Horqin, Muus and areas to the
north of the Yinshan Mountain. It will also establish a group of
timber, cash tree and medicinal herb bases.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Moscow Keeps Saying "No" to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's eastward expansion has become the central point at
issue between Russia and Western powers as Moscow keeps saying
"no" to the U.S.-led military bloc's determined enlargement plans.
</P>
<P>
The row between Russia and NATO member states began to boil
when leaders of the 16-nation alliance officially announced their
plans to expand NATO eastwards at the Brussels summit in January
1994.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement plans, aimed at taking in former Moscow-led
Warsaw Pact countries in Central and Eastern Europe, is regarded
as a major step by the West to consolidate their victory in the
Cold War and to contain Russia. Observers believe the security
balance of Europe will be entirely broken up once the eastward
expansion of NATO is achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact bloc, dissolved after the collapse of the
Soviet Union in the early 1990s, was the arch rival of NATO in the
Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Russia reacted strongly to NATO's enlargement plans.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the Kremlin's foreign policy at a parliament session
in February, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stressed that NATO's
expansion would result in geopolitical changes which, he said,
would seriously harm Russia's political and military interests and
threaten its security.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned that the enlargement
could only lead to the creation of new division lines and
political-military confrontation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov even threatened to point
Russia's nuclear missiles at those countries which joined NATO.
</P>
<P>
"It (NATO expansion) could even come to us redirecting our
missiles at certain European countries entering NATO (all the more
so if these countries agree to alliance nuclear weapons being
positioned on their territory)," he told the Nezavisimaya Gazeta
newspaper in late November.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov also threatened to form a new military bloc involving
other member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), all former Soviet republics, to review the 1990 treaty over
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) and to refuse to ratify the
START-2 treaty between Moscow and Washington on reducing strategic
nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
"It is entirely possible that we will face a need to strengthen
our southern, western and northwestern forces without looking at
the agreement limiting conventional weapons in Europe," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Politicians of the Russian opposition showed rare unity with
the Kremlin on this issue.
</P>
<P>
They believe the enlargement of NATO would further isolate
Russia politically and militarily and break up the balance of the
conventional forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Despite Moscow's strong opposition, NATO refused to go back on
its plans.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana stressed NATO's
determination on several occasions. He said the alliance would
carry out its enlargement plans whatever happened.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton declared that non-NATO
states didn't have a right to veto any decision of the bloc to
take in new members.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day meeting in Brussels earlier this month, NATO
foreign ministers announced that an enlargement timetable would be
unveiled and a list of the first new NATO members would be named
at a NATO summit scheduled for next July in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.S. initiative, NATO will begin to accept former
Warsaw Pact nations in 1999, the 50th anniversary of the founding
of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, realizing that NATO expansion is probably inevitable,
began to make preparations for an enlarged NATO.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Primakov visited Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland
and Slovakia and reportedly urged these Central and Eastern
European countries not to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russia also made efforts to try to speed up integration,
especially military integration, within the CIS. Besides an
economic integration treaty with Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Kirgyzstan, it signed an agreement with six former Soviet
republics to make joint efforts to safeguard the external borders
of the CIS. It also reached accords with nine other CIS countries
to create a joint air defense system.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also signed 10 documents with Belarus designed to
enforce bilateral military cooperation and build a military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, Russia's closest ally within the CIS, has firmly sided
with Russia in opposing NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce political, military and psychological
pressure of NATO expansion, Moscow established several
preconditions for the alliance's enlargement. These included a
bilateral agreement ensuring Russia's security and a promise by
NATO that it would not station nuclear weapons in new NATO member
countries.
</P>
<P>
To quell Russia's fears, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher recently agreed not to place nuclear weapons on
territories of newly admitted NATO members.
</P>
<P>
But NATO foreign ministers made it clear that the agenda of
NATO expansion did not hinge on the so-called "charter" with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Eastward enlargement is a fixed goal of NATO and meanwhile
Moscow will by no means soften its stance against the move. As
the date of NATO's planned expansion draws near, a new round of
wrangling between the two sides seems inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Opposes Moves to Extend His Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos has reiterated that he will oppose moves to extend his term
in office beyond 1998, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Any move to amend the constitution for this purpose of
extending the term of the president or giving him a second term is
something that I will oppose," Ramos said in a television
interview on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was elected to a six-year term in 1992. The 1987
Constitution bars the president from seeking reelection and also
restricts the time in office for other elected officials.
</P>
<P>
A citizens' group, the People's Initiative for Reform,
Modernization and Action (Pirma), has launched a campaign to
collect five million signatures that will pave the way for a
people's initiative to amend the charter and lift the term limits
on Ramos, members of Congress and local officials.
</P>
<P>
Pirma is saying that economic reforms launched by the Ramos
administration could falter if he was not reelected. Ramos had
repeatedly denied any links with the group and said he does not
believe in its objectives.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The reliability of large power
generating units at and above 100 megawatts made in China has gone
up to more than 86 percent this year, 4.4 percentage points more
than the figure reported five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Power Industry Lu Yanchang said in an

Lu noted that China has introduced an administrative system
aimed at solving problems of quality, which has proven effective,
according to which power facility constructors and power equipment
manufacturers work jointly on installation and trials of new
units, working together to try to find out and solve any defects
of power equipments.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's total generating capacity is 220,000
megawatts this year, almost 59 percent of which comes from large

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today sent congratulations to Ghanan President Jerry John Rawlings
on the election of Kofi Annan as the new chief of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The election of Mr. Annan to the post of Secretary-General is
not only an honour for Ghana but also a pride for African
countries and all developing countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said he extended cordial congratulations on behalf of the
Chinese Government to the Government and people of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the U.N. would play a more active
role in international affairs during Annan's tenure of office.
</P>
<P>
China and Ghana, which enjoyed traditional friendship, had
always supported each other in bilateral and international
affairs, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government cherishes the friendly relations
between China and Ghana, and will, as always, work together with
the Ghanan side to further develop and strengthen the existing
bilateral relations and the friendly cooperation," said the
Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen also sent messages to his Ghanan counterpart, Obed
Asamoah, and Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general elect on
Annan's election.
</P>
<P>
"The election of Mr. Annan evidences the international
community's trust in and expectations of Africa, and also
demonstrates the important role Ghana plays in Africa and
international affairs," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the appointment of Annan to the chief post
showed that the international community highly trusted the
well-known African diplomat, and confirmed his contribution made
during his tenure as under secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Your Excellency (Kofi Annan)...will play an
active role in safeguarding world peace and security, promoting
economic and social development among countries and strengthening
international cooperation," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that during Annan's term of office between January
1997 to December 2001, the good relations and cooperation between
the two countries in international affairs and as members of the
U.N. would be further developed and consolidated.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution Tuesday
afternoon, appointing Annan as U.N. secretary-general to replace
incumbent Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali. Annan will assume office on
January 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Hints at Revamp in Cabinet Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos has hinted a possible cabinet reshuffle next year, but
preferred to call it "replacements", local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said Tuesday at a press briefing in his office that from
the start his administration has never reshuffled the cabinet.
Instead, it has replacements of course, but the administration did
not make them so sudden just for the sake of revamping.
</P>
<P>
He said traditional evaluation of each cabinet member's
performance by the Presidential Management Staff will take place
this year during the cabinet workshop from December 27 to 29.
</P>
<P>
On or before December 24, he said, each cabinet member must
submit an accomplishment report and those who failed to meet the
targets they set early this year may face revamp.
</P>
<P>
During the workshop, the cabinet members will be asked to give
a critique of one another on top of the individual assessment of
their own accomplishments, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president refused to name the cabinet members who
may be affected by the "replacement" process.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China's first super market of
building materials has started operation in this north China city.
</P>

gross output worth six billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, most building materials are now sold in hundreds of
thousands of small shops. In Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai
alone, there are more than 17,000 such shops.

<HEADLINE> Lilic Says Political Events in Serbia Bad for Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic said Tuesday the latest political events in Serbia had badly
affected results achieved in the economic development in
Yugoslavia after the U.N. sanctions were lifted two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"The latest developments concerning local polls in Serbia have
had quite a negative impact on advantages for the country's
economic recovery we have created," Lilic said on his visit to the
Serbian Post, Telegraph and Telephone services.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have marched peacefully daily through
Belgrade and other cities in Serbia over the past four weeks to
protest government decision to annul the election results of
November 17 in which the opposition coalition had claimed victory,
thus causing a political crisis in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Lilic said, the developments could affect
Yugoslavia's stability and foreign companies' interest in economic
cooperation with the country.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said all parliamentary parties must show wisdom and must
cooperate in achieving goals of economic development and make it
possible for this country to catch up with other European
countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The only true way out is a political solution in line with
democratic principles and adopted by countries with a long
democratic tradition like Serbia," he said, referring to the
solution of the month-long crisis in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Left Party Calls to Protect Citizens, Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav United Left
party (JUL) demands Tuesday that the authorities take all measures
in keeping with the law to protect the safety of the citizens and
their property and to ensure normal life in Belgrade and all towns
where protests have been staged.
</P>
<P>
JUL, a coalition partner of the ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia in the parliament elections, said all measures envisaged by
law must be taken, including prosecution of persons who have
caused material damages or urged for political terrorism and
disregard of the law and the constitution during their protest
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"Competent bodies must also determine whether a part of the
opposition is financed and politically organized from abroad,
inform the public and take measures in line with the law,"
spokesman and directorate member of JUL Ivan Markovic said.
</P>
<P>
The protest of the followers of the opposition coalition
Zajedno in Belgrade has jeopardized production, business
activities, services, the activity of schools, hospitals and child
care institutions, other institutions, city services and above all
traffic, Markovic said.
</P>
<P>
"This is why the city municipal assembly must be constituted at
all speed, so that deputies elected by the citizens can be in
charge of city services," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative that education authorities, school
directors and college presidents take all measures to protect
school children and students from political parties and their
rivalry, Markovic added.
</P>
<P>
The protest marches, organized by the opposition Zajedno, have
been staged for the past four weeks in Belgrade and other cities,
sparked off by the Serbian government's decision to annul the
November 17 elections in which Zajedno claimed victory in 14 out
of the 18 cities in Serbia, including capital Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> UN Assembly Appoints Kofi Annan Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly appointed on Tuesday Kofi Annan of Ghana
Secretary-General of the United Nations for a term of office
beginning on January 1, 1997 and ending on December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the resolution by acclamation, the General
Assembly elected a life-long international servant, who has been
working in the world organization for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In his long-time service in the world body, Kofi Annan worked
his way from ordinary administrative officer and budget officer of
the World Health Organization up to under-secretary-general of the
U.N. Secretariat in charge of the peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is consensus and commitment," said the
Secretary-General-Elect Kofi Annan in his inauguration speech.
"Our task is to find common ground, to shape together the changes
that will move this Organization forward."
</P>
<P>
Noting many roots of conflict, particularly the economic base
of stability, Annan stressed the need to help the developing
countries and the need of the developed countries to extend their
help.
</P>
<P>
"Let us ensure," said Annan, "that the resources and facilities
of the United Nations system are effectively channeled towards
those who need them most, those whom globalization has left
behind."
</P>
<P>
"And let us ensure that the voice of the United Nations in
economic matters is heard by those member states with the
greatest capacity to give," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the international community to support the
world organization, which mainly designed to use collective power
to prevent war.
</P>
<P>
"No nation need to face or fight alone the threats which this
organization was established to defuse," he said. "But we cannot
succeed without your political, moral, financial and material
support and participation."
</P>
<P>
"Applaud us when we prevail; correct us when we fail; but,
above all, do not let this indispensable, irreplaceable
institution wither, languish or perish as a result of Member State
indifference, inattention or financial starvation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly also adopted a resolution, expressing deep
appreciation of the 185-member states for the contributions of
Secretary-General Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace
and security and development.
</P>
<P>
"In saying farewell to this great Assembly," Dr. Boutros-Ghali
said, "I stressed nothing is more precious to the United Nations
than its reputation."
</P>
<P>
He said that reputation rests on four pillars: impartiality,
equity, efficiency and achievement and that the fifth,
indispensable principle is independence.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General's loyalty must be international and
nothing but international, and the international civil service
must be a real civil service," he said.
</P>
<P>
In apparent retort to American criticism about his performance,
he said: "Throughout the past five years, the first thing I
thought of when I awoke in the morning were my responsibilities as
Secretary General to the ideal of Charter and independence and
credibility of the Organization."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly made the appointment at the recommendation
of the Security Council, which last Friday unanimously agreed to
give a five-year term to Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council took that decision after the United States
insisted on vetoing a second term for 74-year old Boutros-Ghali,
whom they alleged slow in reforming the world body and too
enthusiastic about giving his visions on how to deal with the
international affairs.

<P>
BELGRADE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The assembly of Serbia
decided Tuesday to organize a panel discussion on issues relating

media in the election process, as proposed by the deputies of the
ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS).

<P>
The panel discussion is to last until all proposed topics are

adopted, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four weeks, thousands of people have marched
daily through Belgrade and other cities in Serbia to protest
against the government for the alleged election fraud, causing a
political crisis in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the panel discussion will take effect a day
after it is published in the official gazette and the discussion
will be accessible to the public and media.

discussion on current issues regarding recent election disputes
would provide the best opportunity to all parliament members to
meet and discuss many issues.

held, Tomic said it was yet to be agreed, but noted that the
parliamentary debate on this subject on Tuesday had constituted in

He also said the second meeting of the regular autumn session
of the Serbian parliament would be held on December 24, which
would focus on the draft budget for 1997, a package of tax laws
and modifications of the law on internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Extension, Augmentation of Stand-by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved the extension of the current stand-by
credit through end-September 1997 and to augment the amount
available under it by some 231 million U.S. dollars for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The financing is offered in support of the country's economic
adjustment and reform program.

<P>
The IMF's Executive Board made the decision in conjunction with
the completion of the second review under the stand-by credit for
about 579 million dollars approved on December 13, last year.
</P>
<P>
The program supported by the IMF stand-by credit was designed
to reduce Pakistan's macroeconomic imbalances and to address a
range of structural changes.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan joined the IMF in July 1950. Its quota in the
institution is some 1,092 million dollars and its outstanding use
of IMF credit currently totals about 1,382 million dollars.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Tuesday set conditions for humanitarian assistance to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Reports say that American diplomats, who have been meeting
intermittently for the past two weeks at the United Nations with
the head of DPRK' American Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry,
have offered a "package" deal that includes shipments of rice and
fuel.
</P>
<P>
But the United States said it would only proceed with the
assistance program until DPRK apologizes in some fashion for its
submarine aground off the South Korean coast.
</P>
<P>
Before a meeting with Italian foreign Minister Lamberto Dini,
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters that DPRK
should "express regret or make some other gesture with respect to
the submarine incident... before we can proceed" with the package.
</P>
<P>
DPRK has refuted South Korea's accusation of infiltration of
the submarine, saying it ran aground on a routine mission.

<HEADLINE> Serbian President Receives Nis University Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic received a delegation of students of the Nis university
on Tuesday and discussed with them the problems which emerged
after local elections in several towns in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
A group of 17 students marched to Belgrade on Tuesday from Nis,
the second largest city in Serbia 240 kilometers south of
Belgrade, to express their support to their Belgrade colleagues.
</P>
<P>
There have been demonstrations in Belgrade and other cities in
Serbia over the past four weeks to protest against alleged
government election fraud. The opposition coalition Zajedno
(Together) had claimed victory in 14 of 18 cities in the second
round of local elections held on November 17.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, three student representatives read to President
Milosevic a letter written beforehand explaining their reasons for
coming to Belgrade, underlining they were not members of any
political parties but ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
The students were protesting the denying of municipal council
seats to representatives of the opposition coalition Zajedno who
had won the elections in Nis, the representatives said.
</P>
<P>
They also presented to Milosevic written evidence justifying
their demands, official Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told the students that no one had ever come to
Serbian presidency seeking truth and left without obtaining the
truth they sought.
</P>
<P>
"We must, however, make it clear, regardless of all visits of
your leaders to foreign embassies and their visits or those of
their envoys to foreign capitals, that Serbia will never accept
foreign rule. We are our own masters in Serbia and must resolve
our problems within our own institutions.
</P>
<P>
"This, of course, does not mean that we do not wish to
cooperate with other countries, but this cooperation must be
based on equality," Tanjug quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic has invited a delegation of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to Belgrade to look into
the cause of the political crisis. An OSCE team is expected to
arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
"Our country can be a good partner, but cannot be anyone's
servant and will not bow to anyone," he told the student
representatives.

<HEADLINE> US Fed leaves interest rates unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) decided today to leave short-term interest rates unchanged
in its last policy-making meeting of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's action was announced in a brief statement at the
conclusion of a meeting of its policy-maker, the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), which meet eight times a year to review
interest rate policies.
</P>
<P>
A Fed spokesman said that the FOMC meeting had adjourned after
3 and an half hours and there would be no further announcements,
the wording the U.S. Fed uses to inform financial markets that
rates were left unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The decision had been widely expected in the past two months as
the U.S. economy slowed down drastically in the third quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government has reported that growth pace of economy slowed
to an annual rate of 2 percent in the July-September quarter from
the 4.7 percent rate in the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
In its latest survey of economic activities in its 12 Federal
Reserve districts announced early this month, U.S. Fed held that
the economy was growing moderately with little sign of rising
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. central bank last changed interest rates on January 31
when it reduced the federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other for the overnight loans, by a quarter-point down
to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last January's rate cut was the third in a series of
quarter-point reductions aimed at spurring the U.S. economy that
looked as though it could topple into a recession.
</P>
<P>
While some economists have been looking for the Fed to begin
tightening credit for six months, it has passed up every
opportunity to do so, preferring to watch and see if the economy
would slow enough on its own.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's decision had little immediate impact on financial
markets today because it had been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. monetary policy next year, many U.S. economists now
believe the U.S. Fed's next move will be to increase rates
slightly to make sure faster growth doesn't trigger higher
inflation. The best guess is that a rate hike could occur either
in late spring or early summer.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said if the current Christmas sales
season proves to be disappointing and the economy weakens further,
the next Fed move could well be a cut in rates.

<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The food poisoning outbreak in
Lanarkshaire, Scotland has claimed its 13th life with the death of
an elderly women, according to a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
A "frail and very elderly" woman died of the E-coli strain of
food poisoning at a Scottish nursing home near Glasgow earlier
today, local health officials said.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 people who have died in the second worst E-coli food
poisoning outbreak ever recorded in the world have all been
elderly, they said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported more than 300 people have reported symptoms of
the food poisoning, which can cause kidney failure in vulnerable
people such as the elderly and young children.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts said that E-coli is a common gut bacteria that
is normally harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can
be passed to humans via manure or improper slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Scottish Office has ordered an emergency probe into
the outbreak and two butchers' shops which were linked with the
crisis have been closed.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pentagon official
will conduct study for the proposed big merger of Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas and then come up possible recommendations to the
antitrust agency that reviews the 13.3 billion U.S. dollar deal.

John Goodman, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Industrial

Besides, a decision is expected within two weeks on whether the

</P>

Under the cases of large mergers, concerned companies are
required to notify the government and provide certain data. The
reviewing agency has 30 days to challenge the merger, either
giving green light or demanding additional information, which
could postpone the regulator's decision.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prepares to Pay Due Contributions to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States, facing
the danger of losing influence in the United Nations, is preparing
to pay off debts to the world body to defuse pressure from other
U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
Several plans were being considered to be put to the new
Congress when it takes office in January, Princeton Lyman, Acting
Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization
Affairs, told a news conference today.
</P>
<P>
The United States owes the United Nations 1.3 billion U.S.
dollars of its contributions, blaming the world body for
over-spending and mismanagement of peace-keeping operations. The
arrears aroused resentment from other member nations.
</P>
<P>
There was "a great deal of resentment and anger" among other
U.N. members that the United States, while pressing for reform of
the organization, was its largest debtor, Lyman said.
</P>
<P>
"More and more countries are saying the U.S. has always been
the champion of the sanctity of treaties, of contracts and
international obligations, and you the United States are in
violation of a treaty, an obligation...We recognize that," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't deal with this effectively in the next year or so,
we're going to find it very difficult to mobilize votes in support
of the things we need in the United Nations -- not just in the
reform area, not just in the budget area, but in some of the areas
of security and disarmament that are so important to us," Lyman
noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States "will be coming forward with proposals" to
deal with the arrears, he said, but no decision had yet been taken
on the proposals.
</P>
<P>
Lyman said one option was to go back to Congress with a
proposal to pay off the arrears over five years. The proposal was
raised last year but rejected by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at other ways of perhaps doing it more quickly,
but we haven't reached a conclusion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan, the newly-chosen U.N. secretary-general, said on
Monday he would speak to the U.S. Congress if necessary to get
Washington to pay its debts.
