<HEADLINE> Major Reaffirms West's Commitment on Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
today reaffirmed the West's commitment to helping Ukraine close
down the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the world's worst
nuclear accident in April 1986.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, Major
told reporters that Chernobyl will be discussed at this weekend's
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
"We're fully committed to implementing (the aid plan)," he
said. "I anticipate it will be an important part of discussions
later this week."
</P>
<P>
The G-7 has promised to give Ukraine 3.1 billion U.S. dollars
in aid for a quick closure of Chernobyl. But Ukraine, which has
suffered serious energy shortages for years, wants more money for
developing new energy sources.
</P>
<P>
Major, who arrived here today on his first visit, promised
Kuchma that Britain will help Ukraine in energy development and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Britain's support for Ukraine's independence and
democracy and said Britain appreciates Ukraine's efforts to
overcome the difficulties Kiev is experiencing as it proceeds with
political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed European security, for which
Major said a smoothly-developing Ukraine is a decisive factor.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said Major's visit continued an active bilateral
political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Kuchma, Major and his Ukrainian
counterpart, Yevgeny Marchuk, signed two accords on cooperation in
crime-fighting.
</P>
<P>
Major will leave here tonight for Moscow to join other G-7
leaders for the summit on nuclear safety, which will also be
attended by Kuchma and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Exports Fuel UK Car Production in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British car production in March
continued to rise, with the seasonally-adjusted index at 127,
compared with the 124 of February, according to the reports here
today.
</P>
<P>
That means that in the first quarter of this year, total
seasonally adjusted car production rose by 5.3 percent
compared with the previous three months and by 2.1 percent
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that growth was mainly driven by overseas
sales as production alocated for export rose by 11.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign demand may not long continue to help, as
western European car sales in March suddenly slowed to a
rise of only 3.1 percent compared with a year earlier, after
the promising start to the year with a rise of 10.2 percent
in January and seven percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The continued sluggishness of the home market, with the
car sales rising only 1.1 percent for the quarter in total
and 3.5 percent down for UK-made cars, means production for
British buyers was actually 0.2 percent down in the
three-month period.
</P>
<P>
Only the fleet market had remained good, with private
purchases actually falling, which dealers blamed on high
prices and poor marketing.
</P>
<P>
Seasonally adjusted commercial vehicle productoin for the
first quarter was 14.7 percent up on the previous quarter
but 2.2 percent down on the corresponding period a year ago.

<HEADLINE> World's Poor living Standards Raising: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Substantial progress has been
made over the past quarter-century in raising the living standards
of the world's low-income countries, according to the World Bank's
Social Indicators of Development 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 397-page report will be released during the Spring Meetings
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which
are scheduled to open later this week.
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted remarkable improvements in the region of
the East Asia and Pacific, and also pointed to areas, particularly
Sub-Saharan Africa, which require intensified efforts to overcome
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The report said a comparison between social indicators for the
East Asia and Pacific region and Sub-Saharan Africa indicates the
disparity in rates of progress among regions of the developing
countries. For East Asia and Pacific, GNP per capita has grown by
an average of 6.4 percent per year since 1980, and the average
rate of population growth has been only 1.6 percent per year. For
Sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand, GNP per capita has
decreased by an average of 1.4 percent per year, but the
population has increased by an annual rate of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank listed 64 low-income countries which are
concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These countries
have a combined population of 3.2 billion, or roughly 67 percent
of the world population, with an average annual per capita GNP of
only 390 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Drafts Banking Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A new banking law and plans for a
securities and stock exchange have been drawn up as part of
Vietnam's financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The banking law, described by Deputy Governor of the State Bank
Le Van Chau as essential for the continuing drive to modernize
Vietnam's banking industry, will be submitted to the National
Assembly later this year for adoption.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of a stock exchange is part of the government's
plan to transform state-owned companies into joint stock
companies. The program was set up two years ago, but the trading
of shares has so far been very small due to the lack of a proper
legal framework and support services, said Chau.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's network of financial institutions has flourished in
both quality and quantity during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
A domestic inter-bank market, a foreign exchange inter-bank
market and a treasury bill auction market have been established to
help stabilize the exchange rate, maintain the purchasing power of
the domestic currency, said Chau.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has four state-owned commercial banks, more than 50
joint-venture banks, two financial companies, 600 credit funds and
21 branches, and about 70 representative offices of foreign banks
from 48 countries.
</P>
<P>
The main tasks for the State Bank now are to improve its
formulation and implementation of monetary policy and to maintain
a balance between controlling inflation and promoting economic
growth, the bank deputy governor added.

sufficient food, a World Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of Earth Day, Ismail Serageldin, World Bank

that most developing countries are producing less food than they
were at the beginning of the 1980s.

"The time has come for us to send a wake-up call to governments
worldwide...a message saying agricultural growth and broad-based
rural development are crucial, and that these issues must be put
back at the top of national agendas," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Serageldin said:"We need to have sustained investment in
agricultural research to develop new varieties of crops and new
technologies to see us into the next century."
</P>

In order to achieve goals of poverty reduction, food security
and sustainable management of natural resources, the World Bank

LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's service sector grew
quickly in the first three months of this year, according to the
latest survey by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).
</P>
<P>
The BCC, polling more than 7,500 companies, found that the
service sector, including high street shops, enjoyed its best
quarter for two years in the three months to the end of March and
had the highest growth in sales for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of service-sector companies which said that
their sales had risen between the last quarter of last year and
the first quarter of this year was a positive balance of 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the survey found that UK manufacturing was
at its worst for growth for three years, suffering from destocking
in the retail market and weakening export markets.
</P>
<P>
While medium-sized companies reported stable levels of
business, companies with more than 500 employees reported falls in
sales and orders.
</P>
<P>
These large companies also said that they were shedding jobs

<HEADLINE> S.Leone President To Offer Peace Proposal To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Tejan
Kabbah is to put forward a six-point proposal to the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh in their
peace talks on monday in the Ivorian city of Yamousoukro,
diplomatic sources said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah and Sankoh will be meeting for the first time on Monday
in the second round of talks to end the five-year rebel war in
the West African state.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks was held between Sankoh and the
former military leader, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio, who
handed power to the civilian government in March.
</P>
<P>
According to West African diplomats, Kabbah will urge Sankoh
to agree to a "permanent ceasefire" to replace the two-month lull
which runs out at the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will also include the need for disarmament of all
combatants and the signing of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, during his visits to Ghana and Nigeria earlier this
week, vowed to carry on the war.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the chances of a breakthrough are remote for the
moment, although West African leaders, including General Sani
Abacha of Nigeria, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings and Ivorian
leader Konan Bedie, have undertaken a "pacifying approach to
maintain Sankoh's interest in a negotiated settlement of the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leoneans will be "disillusioned" if Sankoh decides to
end the ceasefire and resume fighting again as thousands have
taken advantage of the lull to travel by road to the interior
without fear of being ambushed by rebels, observers say.
</P>
<P>
Many cities in the interior which have been on the brink of
starvation are now fully equipped with food while international
aid agencies have sent in hundreds of tonnes of vital relief
supplies.
</P>
<P>
One agency, Medecins Sans Frontieres of Holland reported a
drop in the percentage of malnourished children in Kenema in the
east.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah is also to hold bilateral talks with the presidents of the
Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Ghana on courtesy visits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the women's movement for peace on Friday called on
the RUF and the Sierra Leone government to "commit themselves to
making meaningful progress"in the up coming meeting.
</P>
<P>
The movement is a network group of non-governmental
organizations whose main objectives are to ensure a lasting peace
and to articulate the interest of women in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Claims Botswana Military Buildup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua)-- An alleged Botswana military
buildup near a disputed island on the borders with Namibia had
been described as provocative by its neighbouring state, the
South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters yesterday in the capital Windhoek,
Namibian Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said: ''It would serve
the interests of both countries if Botswana were to behave in a
manner that serves the course we have jointly agreed to find a
binding ruling by the international court of justice.''
</P>
<P>
Ownership of the small island in the Chobe River between
northeastern Namibia and Botswana, had been in dispute since
1992, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The island, often covered by water, was named Kasikili in
Namibia and Sedudu in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
After having failed to negotiate a settlement earlier this
year, both Botswana and Namibia agreed to take the case to the
international court of justice at the Hague and committed
themselves to abide by the world court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said it was unclear why botswana had stepped up its
military presence in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said Namibia was not prepared to go to war over the island.
</P>
<P>
''Our focus is on peace, job creation and development, not
only in our own country but in the Southern African Development
Community as a whole,'' said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Botswana defence force soldiers had
stopped Namibians from fishing in the river near the island and
tourists in the area felt threatened by having guns pointing at
them from look-outs. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today urged the United Nations Security Council to reconsider its
position after Libya recently showed a positive response and
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief made the appeal when addressing the opening
session of the 19th ordinary ministerial session of OAU Labour
Commission at Africa Hall.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the role of the workers, Dr. Salim said "as your
commission will be seized of the issue of the conditions of the
Libyan workers, I would like to express our solidarity with the
Libyan workers and Libyan people in general, at a time when they
are facing serious hardship and difficulties as a result of the
UN embargo."
</P>
<P>
He declared: "It is our fervent hope that the UN Security
Council will reconsider its position in view of the positive
response and flexibility shown by Libya, which has accepted to hand
over the two suspects for trial on a neutral venue."

<HEADLINE> UK Proposes Legislation Bill for Ulster Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
introduced a legislation bill to the House of Commons for the
Ulster elections scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said that the
proposal offered a gateway to negotiations that can lead towards a
long-term political settlements in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The UK government in this bill has relaxed its original
proposed restrictions on how many parties could take part in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The legislation allowed for 22 parties and eight independents
to contest the poll,instead of 15 designated parties as originally
proposed.
</P>
<P>
The legislation stressed that the peace forum, which will be
composed of 110 representatives elected from different parties on
May 30, will be deliberative only and have no legislative,
executive or administrative powers.
</P>
<P>
From those elected, parties will nominate delegates to take
part in the planned all-party negotiations on the future of
Northern Ireland scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
The bill also stressed that all participants in the
negotiations must commit themselves totally and absolutely to the
principles of democracy and non-violence.
</P>
<P>
The UK government has said that Sinn Fein, political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), could take part in the elections
on May 30 and its representatives elected could also take part in
the forum. But this party could not enter the all-party
negotiations unless the IRA restores its ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeking $139 Million for Peace in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today issued an
appeal for 139 million U.S. dollars in humanitarian assistance to
support the transition to peace and reconstruction in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the Geneva office of U.N. Department of
Humanitarian Affairs, the 1996 humanitarian programme for Angola
has three main components: relief and resettlement of refugees,
assistance for the demobilization and social reintegration of
former combatants; and clearance of some 10 million land mines
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the resettlement programme, a framework will be provided
for assistance in reintegration of some 200,000 refugees expected
to return to Angola in the course of the year, as well as 700,000
internally displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Under the demobilization programme, food, health care and civic
education will be provided to the soldiers of former
anti-government forces who have begun to be disarmed at designated
quartering areas. At a later stage the programme will also provide
assistance to the former soldiers to help them adapt to civilian
life.
</P>
<P>
The Angola programme will also fund the training of a corps of
Angolan technicians and managers to address the land-mine issue,
including mine clearance, survey and marking.
</P>
<P>
The UN appeal said that if the peace process of Angola, which
began with the signing of the Lusaka peace agreement in November
1994, adopts a steadier pace in the coming months, it should be
possible to phase out most relief assistance by the end of 1996
and focus on the rehabilitation of Angola's war-shattered
infrastructure and social fabric.

<HEADLINE> Differences between Iraq, UN Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, Chairman of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, said
that a little but significant differences between Iraq and
UNSCOM remain although Iraq has provided the committee with large
amounts of information on its past weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus, who arrived here Thursday on a two-day visit to Iraq,
made the remarks in a press conference held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus has held talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, Minister of Oil Amir Mohammed Rashid and Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf and other senior officials on the
Iraqi-U.N. relations and the technical aspect of Iraq's weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said Aziz expressed concern over some aspects of April 11
UNSCOM report to the U.N. Security Council and his misgivings
about the procedures of the U.N. weapons inspection and the
targets of inspection, especially that of the Republican Guard
facilities which were subject to the U.N. inspection in early
March.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq should give us full right to inspect at any time and
wherever we like, while we fully respect Iraq's sovereignty,
security and dignity," said Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials said that their country met all its
requirements related to the articles of the U.N. Security Council
resolution No. 687, therefore, the Security Council should allow
Iraq to export oil under clause No. 22 of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
However, Ekeus said that he cannot give a time ceiling as to
the issue of lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He also said that this issue depended on Iraq's cooperation and
the Security Council's conviction that Iraq is clear of its
prohibited weapons production.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus asserted that neither his present round of talks nor the
work of UNSCOM has anying to do with the on-going talks in New
York between Iraq and the U.N. on the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
But he hinted that good ties between Iraq and the UNSCOM may
have good impact on other talks with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
It is difficult now to determine the date of the coming talks
between Iraq and the disarmament committee. However, the two sides
agreed to maintain continuous contacts, he added.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first of its kind for Ekeus this year.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The 19th ordinary
ministerial session of OAU Labour Commission opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) called on member states at the opening to
implement the Beijing declaration and platform of action,
especially those identified in the 16 critical areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Salim stressed the role of women in the building of the
continent, saying over 50 percent of the African population is
made up of women.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 percent of households in many African countries
are headed by women and "there can be no meaningful or
sustainable development in Africa without the active, full and
effective participation of women," the OAU chief added.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the session, Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister
Tamirat Layne said African countries need to bring their
fragemented economies together, make the best out of their own
resources and work hard to extricate themselves from
underdevelopment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Dr. K.Y. Amoako, UN Under Secretary General and Executive
Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) urged for
closer cooperation between ECA and OAU in a statement to the

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes Calls for Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz today welcomed calls for a cease-fire by U.S. President
Bill Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac, but stressed
that Israel has failed to comply with them.
</P>
<P>
"Until this moment, the calls have not produced any
effectiveness with Israel," the Lebanese foreign minister pointed
out, noting that Israel was still continuing air raids and
bombardments in Lebanon today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office this afternoon,
Boueiz said that contacts have started since Thursday, which were
embodied in the positions of Chirac and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I believe what is taking place now is an attempt to support
the calls (of the U.S. and French presidents) and to concretize
them to a real cease-fire on the ground," the foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on contacts between his government and
the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, Boueiz said:
"I believe there have been consultations and talks between the
Lebanese government and Hezbollah on the subject (of
cease-fire)."
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks were still "unsecretly" under way
between the Lebanese government and the resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister described a resolution issued by
the U.N. Security Council as "shameful" since it refrained from
clearly denouncing the Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the U.N. Security Council passed
unanimously a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of
hostilities without condemning any of the parties involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz also pointed that the Security Council resolution still
dealt in an acceptable way with other basical topics, including an
implementation of the resolution 425, a need for the (Israeli)
withdrawal and a necessity to respect Lebanon's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent U.S. proposal for a cease-fire in
Lebanon, Boueiz said that the proposal, based on what was called
the "July understanding," was aimed at coping with the situations
"opportunistly and phasedly."
</P>
<P>
He underlined that this proposal could not be a substitute for
the peace process, resolution 425 or any political proposal based
on the Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
Bouez attributed the U.S. proposal to a difficulty to achieve
a political solution in the next weeks because of the upcoming
Israeli elections and other international causes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the American suggestion was attempting to calm
down the atmosphere "within a certain framework" which was stemmed
from two ideas, namely, freeing the Israeli citizens inside its
border from the bombardments and freeing the Lebanese civilians
from the Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
"And the field conflict between the (fighting) parties should
be limited within certain frameworks" according to the
U.S. proposal, the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri left for Damascus, Syria,
this afternoon after meeting with President Elias Hrawi
and Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen and Christopher Begin Talks in Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hague, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his American counterpart
Secretary of State Warren Christopher met here today for the first
time this year to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues
of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the press along with Christopher before their talks,
Qian told reports that China has always maintained that to build a
healthy and stable relationship between China and the United
States serves the fundamental interest of the two countries and
the two peoples and also contributes to the peace and prosperity
in Asian Pacific and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He said, "some times ago Sino-US relations encountered some
difficulties which was something china did not wish to see".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope to make "candid, serious and pragmatic
talks" with Christopher, saying the only correct approach to
overcoming these difficulties is the strict observance of the
principles established in the three Sino-US Joint Communiques,
especially the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity and not interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Now Sino-US relations are at a crucial juncture which call for
a proper settlement of the problems existing in our bilateral
relations, especially the questions of Taiwan," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work together with the U.S. side to increase
dialogue, enhance trust, reduce troubles, develop cooperations and
have no confrontation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Christopher agreed with Qian and said that the United
States and China share many common fundamental interests in Asian
Pacific and all around the globe. He stressed that the U.S. wishes
to develop its relations and to enhance cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Christopher reaffirmed his government's
one-China policy and expressed the belief that the Taiwan issue
will be resolved peacefully by the parties on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also answered questions by the press on human
rights, Taiwan and the situation in the Korean Peninsula and U.S.
arm sale to Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma City Marks bombing Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people, standing
on the site of once a nine-story building in Oklahoma City Friday
morning, paused for 168 seconds of silence to mourn the 168 people
killed when a bomb exploded there one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
After a bell signaled the end of the silence, the names of the
victims were read in 10-second intervals while flowers and wreaths
were being laid by the mourners at the site where a field of grass
now stands in place of the rubble of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building.
</P>
<P>
Following the ceremony, a public memorial service was held at a
convention center near the site, at which Vice President Al Gore
repeated to say that "Terror will not triumph."
</P>
<P>
"The reason it will not is that because in our nation we settle
our differences with dialogue and debate," he said. "We do not
steal precious human lives to express our discontent."
</P>
<P>
With security heightened on the anniversary,
sharpshooters perched on nearby rooftops.
</P>
<P>
Security was also tightened today at federal facilities across
the country. In Atlanta, where the Summer Olympic Games will be
held, barricades blocked all but one entry into the underground
parking deck of the federal building there, an Associated Press
report said.
</P>
<P>
Soon After the bombing last year, two men, Timothy McVeigh and
Terry Nichols, were arrested. Being charged in the bombing, they
passed the anniversary in their cells. No trial date has been
scheduled, but it is expected to begin late this year or early in
1997.
</P>
<P>
As part of actions against terrorism, President Bill Clinton
called for a comprehensive anti-terrorism bill in the wake of the
bombing in Oklahoma City. The senate and House of Representatives
approved on Wednesday and Thursday the long-awaited bill, which is
expected to be signed by Clinton soon.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Bombardment on South Lebanon (by Shao Jie and Huang Xinwei) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Amid intensive international
efforts for a cease-fire agreement, Israel today continued
artillery shelling of southern Lebanon, once bringing traffic of
the country's north-south highway between Beirut and Sidon to a
standstill.
</P>
<P>
The artilleries of the Israeli occupation forces shelled almost
all towns and villages of the eastern and western sectors in
southern Lebanon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said Israeli war planes also attacked the
Rashidiyah Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon this
morning, leaving one person dead and five others wounded. Four
Lebanese civilians were wounded in another Israeli air raid in
Haush area in eastern Sour at 1:45 p.m. local time (1145 GMT)
today.
</P>
<P>
During a field trip to the south, Xinhua correspondents saw
several posts erected by the Lebanese army on the highway, which
are used to block the southward flow of vehicles for their safety.
</P>
<P>
Since 11:00 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), Israeli warships
sporadically shelled the area between Awali Bridge and the town
of Rmaile.
</P>
<P>
The Awali Bridge, four kilometers north of Sidon, is situated
on the country's south-north highway between Beirut and Sidon, the
main road that connects the capital with the south.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God) announced that it fired
Katyusha rockets at five Jewish settlements in northern Israel
between 2:00 to 2:45 p.m. local time (1100 to 1145 GMT) today,
but there were no immediate reports of the casualties.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said Hezbollah fired 12 volleys of Katyusha
rockets at northern Israel today.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Health Minister Ephraim Sneh
today inspected the Israeli-occupied area in southern lebanon, and
held talks with major-general Atoine Lahd, the commander of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army. The Israeli minister told
reporters that Israel would not stop its bombardment unless a
cease-fire agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
"The shelling of Katyusha rockets at northern Israel must be
stopped immediately. That is the most important," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Today is the ninth consecutive day of Israeli raids on
southern Lebanon. On Thursday afternoon, some 110 Lebanese
civilians were killed and 115 others wounded when the Israeli
troops bombarded a military camp of the U.N. peacekeeping forces
near the town of Kana, southern Lebanon. 15 Fijian soldiers were
also wounded in the shelling.

<P>
About 700 Lebanese civilians from Kana and nearby villages
were seeking refuge in the military camp of the Fijian contingent
during the bombardment, according to a Kana resident who was
still staying in the camp today.
</P>
<P>
It was the bloodest Israeli attack against Lebanese civilians
since the Jewish state was established in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the shelling came in response to the Katyusha
rockets attack on its troops in the occupied zone by Hezbollah
guerrillas only 300 meters away from the U.N. military camp in
Kana. But Hezbollah denied the Israeli claim, saying that its
guerrillas were nowhere near the camp.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli army officer said earlier today that the
Israeli troops knew that the U.N. military camp was there, but
"did not know there were hundreds of refugees in it."
</P>
<P>
In a visit to the military camp this morning, Xinhua
correspondents came across dozens of people who survived from the
attack. A Kana resident who only identified himself as Hilmma told
Xinhua that the Israeli shelling destroyed several houses in the
camp and killed more than 110 people.
</P>
<P>
One destroyed house was still burning this morning, some 60
civilians who hid in the house were killed by the Israeli
bombardment Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We thought we would be safe in the military camp of the
U.N. peace-keeping forces. I survived because I hid in another
house in the camp " he said. But his two sons were slightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
This morning, officers of the Fijian contingent asked the
Lebanese to leave their military camp to avoid deaths of more
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Timor Gokel, spokesman of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in
Lebanon, condemned the Israeli attack today, calling it a
"massacre." He said the U.N. forces had not received any warning
from Israel before the attack.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon announced today as a "day of national mourning" for the
Lebanese civilians killed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The small southern town of Kana today almost became a no-man's
land as most of the residents have evacuated to Sidon, Sour or
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Local residents are yearning for an early achievement of a
cease-fire agreement to avoid more casualties, civilian and
military alike.

JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian
Committee for Redeployment of forces in Hebron announced today
that the long-awaited Israeli redeployment from the West Bank
city will take place before Israel's general elections on May
29.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the committee, formed Thursday

attacks by Islamic militants in major Israeli cities in late
February and early March.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets Chirac and Other G-7 Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met today his French counterpart Jacques Chirac who will co-chair
Moscow nuclear security summit with Yeltsin, according to the
presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Kremlin, Yeltsin told Chirac that
the preparations for the summit were "successful" and "good
documents were prepared".
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the G-7 industrialized countries -- Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States -- and
Yeltsin agreed last fall to hold a G-8 summit in Moscow this
spring to tackle the nuclear security issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, ahead of the Saturday summit, Yeltsin also met
with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, President of the European Commission
Jacques Santer, British Prime Minister John Major and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the results of the bilateral meetings, Yeltsin's
spokesman Sergei Medvedev told a news conference that the leaders
discussed mainly the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and nuclear security issues.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the NATO expansion issue was of extremely
great importance and said: "We are extremely worried by the plans
for enlarging NATO eastward, but we are worried twice as much as
by the prospects for the penetration of nuclear weapons to Central
and Eastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out that Yeltsin would speak about the creation
of a nuclear free zone in Central and Eastern Europe during the
summit meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Medvedev, Chirac told Yeltsin that Rssia's
interests must be taken into consideration most scrupulously
whenever plans for NATO's eastward expansion are discussed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also told reporters that the situation in
Lebanon, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the final
transformation of the Group of Seven into the Group of Eight were
also discussed in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement on the European architecture of security
adopted as a result of their bilateral meeting, Yeltsin and Chirac
said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) should be the bulwark of the European architecture of
security.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) jointly with the West-European Union
(WEU), NATO and Russia -- "an inalienable part of the European
security structure" -- should be its three main constituent parts,
the two leaders added.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthening of the OSCE and development of cooperation
between the three main constituent parts will play a particular
important role in the maintenance of security and stability in
Europe," the Russian and French leaders said, adding that "we have
a positive attitude to political consultations held between Russia
and France on problems of security."

<HEADLINE> Clinton "Somewhat Hopeful" of Cease-fire in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today expressed cautious optimism over a cease-fire between
Israel and militant Hizbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"We have direct contacts with all the parties involved. I think
they are looking for some way to stop the fighting so I am
somewhat hopeful," Clinton told reporters traveling with him to
attend a nuclear safety summit of the eight nations in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said that as the international community is
intensifying the mediation efforts, the parties involved in the
conflict "have got to agree to a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that they are neighbors and as we have seen in
the terrible events of the last few days, once someone starts the
spiral of violence it's hard to stop," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that it was "almost impossible" to prevent civilian
deaths in Lebanon in the current fighting, because Hizbollah was
launching rockets at Israel from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, who is accompanying
Clinton's three-nation tour, told reporters that Clinton and
leaders from the other seven nations might discuss the current
crisis in souther Lebanon at the summit.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were killed Thursday when Israel launched
shell attacks at a U.N. Interim Military base in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Refugees in Yugoslavia to Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Belgrade office of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today called on all
refugees and displaced persons coming from the former Yugoslavia
to register.
</P>
<P>
The registration, which is under way in Yugoslavia, is
voluntary and does not alter the current status of refugees and
displaced persons, but will be a source of information for the
UNHCR and the Serbian Commissioner for Refugees in finding
solutions for their assistance, the UNHCR said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The registration, which started in Serbia on April 15, is aimed
at getting precise information about the number of refugees and
displaced persons and registering whether they wish to stay in
Yugoslavia or return home. Registration in Montenegro, the other
republic of Yugoslavia, will start later this month.
</P>
<P>
Such information will help make plans for a local integration
and repatriation of refugees and displaced persons who decide to
return home or go to some other areas in Bosnia and Croatia, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2 million refugees and displaced persons in
the former Yugoslavia, most of whom were people of Bosnia who fled
to other places to escape the bloody war in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to available information, there are some 700,000
refugees and displaced persons in Yugoslavia, 500,000 of whom get
humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns Israeli Bombardment in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
today condemned Thursday's Israeli bombardment on southern
Lebanon, saying the Israeli act has destroyed human civilization
and violated the international law and human rights.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at an extraordinary cabinet session at
the Presidential Palace this afternoon. Hrawi presided over the
meeting which was attended by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The 40-minute meeting started at 5:30 p.m. local time
(14:30 GMT). At the start of the meeting, Hrawi asked all
cabinet members to stand up for two minutes to mourn over
the victims killed by Thursday's Israeli bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Some 110 Lebanese civilians were killed and 115 others were
wounded by the Israeli bombardment of an U.N. peace-keeping
force military camp near the town of Kana, southern Lebanon.
It was the bloodest Israeli attack against Lebanese civilians
since the Jewish state was established in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi said that Israel attempted to hinder Lebanon from
restoring its occupied lands. He added that the strategy of the
Israeli military operation has surpassed a "revenge."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel, through its bombardment, intended
to prove that it has the ability to obliterate Lebanon's
efforts for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz informed the cabinet meeting of
the diplomatic efforts currently underway to end the conflict and
of a newly-passed U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an
immediate cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
A final statement issued after the cabinet meeting expressed
the "strongest condemnation" of the Israeli massacre of
Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that any settlement would include
Lebanon's firm position calling for an implementation of the
U.N. Resolution 425, which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The statement said next Monday will be the "official mourning
day." All government organizations, schools and shops will be
closed that day to mourn for the victims killed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, in an interview with British TV Channel Six this
evening, denied that a cease-fire could be reached with
hours. "It would take sometime," he noted.

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Lebanon have
notified U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that they will
help seek an immediate cease-fire to end the spiraling fighting in
Lebanon, a U.S. State Department spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, who is traveling with

Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafk Hariri earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that Christopher will rush to the Middle

</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state plans to make his first stop in the
capital of Syria, Damascus, to see Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
Washington is convinced that Assad, whose country has been
keeping some 35,000 troops in Lebanon, can influence militant
Hezbollah guerrillas to abandon violence aimed at forcing Israel
to surrender a security belt inside the Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for those who have influence on Hezbollah to use
it," Burns said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rate Remains Unchanged in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A fall in petrol prices offset
rising house prices and higher food and leisure costs to leave
Britain's inflation unchanged last month, said the Office for
National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The headline annual rate of inflation was 2.7 percent in March,
the same as in February. The underlying rate of inflation, after
stripping out mortgage interest payments, was also unchanged at
2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The retail prices index rose 0.4 percent in March to 151.5
after a 0.5 percent rise in February. The figures were in line
with analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that upward pressures on the 12-month rate
included rising house and food prices.
</P>
<P>
Housing costs rose by 2.8 percent in the year to March. House
prices rose by 0.2 percent between February and March but this was
partly offset by a decline in mortgage interest payments.
</P>
<P>
Food price rises remained high, with large rises in the cost of
fresh vegetables and eggs. Household goods prices increased by 4.4
percent in the year to March as furniture prices rose more steeply
than last year.
</P>
<P>
The main downward effect came from a further drop in petrol
prices.
</P>
<P>
The petrol price war between retailers cut an average of two
pence off a gallon of petrol, leaving overall motoring costs last
month only 0.9 percent higher than those in the same month last
year.

<HEADLINE> British IFOR Command to Move to Banja Luka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Michael Portillo said today the command of the British troops
within the MATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) will move from
Gornji Vakuf to Banja Luka by late April.
</P>
<P>
Portillo told a press conference in Banja Luka after visiting
British IFOR troops that this Serb city "is an excellent location
since it enables the full functioning of the command, while the
presence of an airport is a bonus."
</P>
<P>
Gornji Vakuf is a Muslim-controlled town in central Bosnia
while Banja Luka is located in northwestern Bosnia and is the
biggest city in the Serb state of Republika Srpska. There has been
no IFOR command in the Serb territories so far as all the three
commands are based in Muslim-Croat federation territories.
</P>
<P>
"I came to see the possibility of normalizing civilian flights
because the establishment of normal communications from different
parts of Bosnia is a priority" for the reconstruction in the
country, said Portillo, who was in Banja Luka for a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
The British official added that the flight which brought him to
Banja Luka was practically the first civilian flight to this city
since the start of the civil war in Bosnia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
At the Banja Luka airport, Portillo held talks with Serb Prime
Minister Rajko Kasagic and Defense Minister Milan Ninkovic, the
Tanjug news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Condemns Israeli Air Raids in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government this evening
condemned the ongoing Israeli air raids and shelling of southern
Lebanon and called for an immediate cease-fire in the region.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry announcement said Athens strongly
disapproved of the "terrorism and blind violence against
civilians" while expressing its concern over what it called the
disproportionate "scope and intensity" of Israel's policy of
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
It said such an overreaction could jeopardize successes gained
in the recent Middle East peace process as well as its future
course.
</P>
<P>
Athens reiterated its position that the U.N. Security Council's

<HEADLINE> COMESA Chief Calls For Improving Ties With SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Bingu Mutharika
today called for strengthening the regional body.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the two-day COMESA meeting of the Council of
Ministers held here today, Mutharika urged for the establishment
of a new framework which would govern future ties between COMESA
and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
A joint COMESA-SADC ministerial committee had been appointed
to hold extensive consultations between the two regional bodies
to prepare documents for a joint summit scheduled later this year.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting rejected the proposal to split COMESA into
northern and southern parts, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some southern African countries have
suggested that COMESA, too large for its size, should be split
into northern and southern groups.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, grouping 23 states in the region, was born out of the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Holds Talks with Christopher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hague, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his American counterpart,
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, held talks here today to
exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian and Christopher first recalled the
common understanding reached by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
U.S. President Bill Clinton during their meeting in New York last
October.
</P>
<P>
The tow senior officials stressed that in conducting dialogues
between China and the United States the two sides should have an
exchange of views from a long-term and strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirmed their readiness to observe the principles
established in the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques, especially
the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity and no interference in each other's internal affairs,
and expressed the hope to make joint efforts to improve and
develop their bilateral relations on this basis.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that the Taiwan issue remains the "most important
and sensitive problem" in Sino-U.S. relations. Conducting this
issue cautiously and appropriately is the key to the normalization
and stable development of Sino-U.S. relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stated once again that the Taiwan issue is China's internal
affair, and that no foreign countries have the right to intervene.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's basic principle to Taiwan is "peaceful
unification and one country-two systems" and China has never
promised and cannot promise not to use force.
</P>
<P>
Christopher expressed during the meeting the understanding
by the U.S. government for China's concern on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. government is still standing by the
One-China policy and observes the principles established in the
three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques. The United States will not have
official relations with Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dwelling on the bilateral trade and economic relations, Qian
said that the two countries should develop a long-term and stable
trade and economic relationship on the bases of mutual
understanding and benefit and equality. Any practice of putting
presure on the other will be against the interests of both sides,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has persistently opposed interfering in
other country's internal affairs and making political conflicts in
the United Nations by using the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on international
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Prior to their meeting this afternoon, Qian and Christopher met
with pressmen from China and other countries.

<HEADLINE> US Confirms Missile Talks with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
officially confirmed that it would hold missile talks with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) this weekend in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to meet with a North Korean delegation in Berlin
April 20th and 21st for a preliminary round of discussions on
missile non-proliferation," U.S. State Department deputy spokesman
Glyn Davies told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the U.S. government had confirmed
the reported talks between Washington and Pyongyang on the missile
issue. Some U.S. news reports had said that the timetable for the
Berlin talks were fixed in February, but the U.S. State Department
spokesman had repeatedly refused to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
Davies said that the United States believes the DPRK has been
"proliferating various technologies that are harmful" to countries
like Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make as much progress as possible in bringing
North Korea on board with the notion of responsible
non-proliferation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPRK has stated that the U.S. allegations about
the DPRK's missile program were groundless.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the Berlin talks came less than a week
after U.S. President Bill Clinton proposed four-way talks on the
future of the Korean Peninsula among the United States, China,
South Korea and the DPRK when he visited South Korea last week.
</P>
<P>
Asked what Washington would do if the DPRK tried to broaden the
agenda beyond missiles, Davies said, "It's certainly the case that
we have no interest in direct security negotiations with North
Korea about the future of the Korean Peninsula. That action should
occur in the context of four-way talks."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation will be headed by U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for non-proliferation Robert Einhorn,
Department officials disclosed.

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are underway for
building a United Nations park on both banks of a historic river
running through Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The UN park construction plan was announced by the government
last year on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the United
Nations as part of the commemoration program in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 kilometer-long park along the Bagimati river was

<P>
A UN park development committee formed by the government
recently notified all government and private agencies not to
implement any building plan in the park area until a master plan
on the park is worked out.
</P>
<P>
The committee meanwhile has authorized a task force to submit a
report on the demarcation and other aspects of the park within a
month.

LHASA April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
Southwest China has launched its "9210 Meteorological Project" to
establish a meteorological information network.
</P>
<P>
The network will use such advanced technologies as satellite
communications, computers, data banks and program-controlled
telecommunications to achieve the goal of medium-speed
transmission, networking, and information-sharing.
</P>
<P>
The "9210" project, part of the meteorological information

Installation of facilities in six stations and one sub-station
in Tibet will begin in June. The project will consist of an
advanced meteorological telecommunication system, a computer
network and an environmental security system.
</P>
<P>
The project will enable Tibet to exchange meteorological
information with all parts of the country speedily, increasing
the transmission speed by more than 100 times.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is hit frequently by natural calamities, to which the
region's agricultural and animal husbandry sectors are
vulnerable. So the National Meteorological Bureau will invest more

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Drinking water rich in natural
iodine is to be given to Chinese children.
</P>
<P>
 China is to develop the iodine-rich underground water
facility in east China's Shandong Province and Anhui Province,
according to the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and
Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
A survey of children in ten big cities shows that about 80
percent of them are in need of iodine.
</P>
<P>
China is an iodine deficient country, which has to import
most of the pure iodine used in making iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered iodine bearing water in the two provinces
is located deep underground, and as a result is unpolluted. The
water also contains other trace elements necessary for humans.
</P>
<P>
According to medical tests on ten-year-old children who have
been drinking the iodine-rich water for a long time, their iodine
levels reached world standard level in 99 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency is a major problem for the health of chinese
people. And the development of iodine bearing water provides a
new way for China to eliminate iodine deficiency by the year
2000.

of the United States caught a foul ball in sixth inning during the
Atlanta Braves game against the San Diego Padres, a press report
said today.
</P>
<P>
Carter, sitting in a front-row box seat near the San Diego
dugout with his wife, Rosalynn, nabbed a foul hit by San Diego's
Ken Caminiti Friday night after it deflected off the screen behind
home plate and caromed to the third base side.
</P>
<P>
``He showed good hands,'' Braves catcher Javy Lopez said. `` The
ricochet slowed it down a little, but you've got to admire any
70-year-old man catching one in his bare hands.''
</P>
<P>
Carter received a standing ovation from the crowd for his grab.
</P>
<P>
Carter usually attends eight to 10 games a season as the guest
of Braves owner Ted Turner. On Friday, however, he was the guest
of Padres owner John Moores, who is a trustee at the Carter Center
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
``The president has visited us in the clubhouse a few times and
he is a good Braves fan,'' Lopez said. ``I remember when he threw
out the first ball in the World Series. I wanted to catch it, but
(Mike) Mordecai beat me to it.''
</P>
<P>
``It seemed strange to see him on the Padres side. He is
usually sitting with the Turners in the first-base box,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Cuts Annual Development Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has cut
tk 5.7 billion (142.5 million US dollars) off tk 115.3 billion
(2.882 billion US dollars) annual development program (ADP) for
fiscal year 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission of the country has taken the decision
after a 3-day special meeting on April 15-17 revising the current
ADP as the implementation of some projects faced serious
uncertainty due to political unrest and shortage of external and
internal resources, sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The ADP for 1995-1996 beginning last July 1 has been reduced by
20 percent, pruning a number of projects under 20 sectors financed
both by external and internal resources, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised annual development program, of the total
allocation, tk 70.7 billion (1.767 billion dollars) will be funded
by domestic resources while tk 44.6 billion (1.115 billion
dollars) will be financed by foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The highest allocation of tk 80.6 billion (2.015 billion
dollars) is for rural development and institutions.
</P>
<P>
The 1995-1996 ADP was originally approved by the former
parliament last year. Following the dissolution of the 6th
parliament and the resignation of the government of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) on March 30 this year, the country is now
under the leadership of a caretaker government led by Chief
Adviser Habibur Rahman with a main task of arranging next
parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Africa Sees Economic Achievements in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABIDJAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Africa's foreign trade volume
reached a record high in 1995 accompanied by the lowest inflation
level for four years, the African Development Bank (ADB) said in
its latest report.
</P>
<P>
But the bank also warned the continent faces major challenges,
including combating poverty, increasing agricultural production
to feed a growing population and curbing foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Africa registered a record 210 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
trade volume in 1995, including 111.7 billion dollars of imports,
and 98.5 billion dollars of exports, up 13.5 percent and 11.8
percent respectively over 1994, the report said.
</P>
<P>
African countries successfully curbed inflation in 1995, with
the average inflation rate down from 42 percent in 1994 to 26.6
percent, the lowest level in the past four years. Of the 53
African nations, Sechelles had the lowest inflation rate of 0.18
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of their improving financial situation, African
countries reduced the proportion of their budget deficits from an
average of 5.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994 to
an average of 3.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The overall GDP in Africa also grew by a record 2.9 percent in
1995. Economic growth rates in Kenya, Egypt, Uganda, Ethiopia,
Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire all exceeded 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and processing industries have become
increasingly vital to economic development and to increased
exports, especially in South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Zimbabwei,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Abidjan-based bank attributed these achievements to a
relatively stable political situation and strengthened regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But the report also listed several challenges to economic
revitalization in Africa, which is home to 700 million people,
half of them living in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
In some countries, it said, destabilizing political situations
still exist and corruption prevails among government officials.
</P>
<P>
The growth of per capita agricultural production in 1995, at 2
percent, still lags behind the continent's population growth rate,
and foreign debts continue to increase in Africa, reaching a
staggering 320.4 billion dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report added, most African countries remain
highly dependent on external markets, funds and technology.

HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Heads of Islamic mission
accredited to Zimbabwe last night reacted angrily to continuing
Israeli attacks against Lebanon, describing the assault as a
"crime against humanity".
</P>
<P>
The diplomats, in a statement, said they held an urgent

The attacks are reported to have claimed at least 100 lives
injured about 300 and displaced nearly 400,000 others.

The statement noted that those worst affected by the nine days
of continued Israeli bombardments of southern Lebanon were
innocent civilians -- children, women and elderly people.
</P>
<P>
"This latest aggression by the Israeli army is indeed a crime
against humanity and should be condemned by all peace-loving
people," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Zimbabwe government to join the
international community in efforts that seek a stop to this
carnage against the Lebanese people.

HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government has
slashed the planned maize imports of 180,000 tonnes to less than
50,000, in fear that huge maize inflows might affect the price
for the local maize, the daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Denis Nowman said the decision to
reduce the maize imports was taken to ensure that there would not
be "an overhang" that would distort the domestic market, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe expects to harvest 2.6 million tonnes of maize this
year against last year's 840,000 tonnes, and many farmers are
already making preparations to deliver the crop to the grain
maketing board and other buyers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are concerned that large quantities of poor quality
yellow maize may interfere with the local market unless sold at
import parity prices.

COLOMBO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
United National Party (UNP) and some member parties of the ruling
Peoples Alliance (PA) condemned the government of using islandwide
emergency regulations to postpone local government elections,
according to UNP sources today.
</P>
<P>
The elections to 300 local government bodies, municipal
councils, urban councils and village councils should have been
held in June last year but were postponed for one year till June
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, President Chandrika Kumaratunga has again postponed
the elections till the end of this year under the islandwide
emergency regulations.
</P>
<P>
The UNP protested when the emergency was declared on April 4
and charged that this was a ruse by the government to postpone the
elections in view of its waning popularity.
</P>
<P>
The UNP said the government is certain to lose the elections
because it had failed to keep any of its pledges after using the
emergency power to postpone the elections.
</P>
<P>
Some parties who are partners in the ruling People's Alliance
government have also condemned the president's decision to
postpone elections under the emergency regulations.

HANOI, April 20 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam has issued a circular to
reimburse import tax previously charged on the import of two kinds
of thread to comply with government regulations promulgated as

</P>
<P>
The ministry has asked relevant importers to send sufficient
documentation proving the import of the threads to the customs
office where they had their goods declared, so that their payment
can be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that eligible importers can either
receive full payment at one time or have future import taxes
deducted with an amount equivalent to the sum due to be
reimbursed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Develops Weed-fighting Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Corn yields on experimental
plots in Kenya have tripled due to an innovative weed-fighting
strategy developed by an Israeli scientist in collaboration with
Kenyan researchers.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Weizmann Institute of Science, these
results were reported earlier this week at the Sixth Parasitic
Weed Symposium in Cordoba, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The experiments focused on eradicating a parasitic weed
called Striga Hermonthica, or witchweed, which ravages grain crops
in several parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100 million farmers lose half their yields to
this parasite. In kenya alone it severely infests 80,000 hectares
of planted with corn, causing an estimated annual loss of 10
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Weeds also have an indirect but devastating effect on the
environment because farmers often encroach upon nature reserves in
search of uninfested land.
</P>
<P>
Witchweed thrives by attaching itself to the root of a
suitable host crop. It sends up a signal that says "feed me," and
sucks up not only the crop's energy but much of the soil's
fertilizer and water.
</P>
<P>
Until now, there has been no effective way to control
parasitic weeds. Farmers in Africa commonly remove them by hand,
but by the time the weeds emerge above-ground, they have already
drained the crop. Herbicides are ineffective for the same reason,
and they also enter the food chain.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jonathan Gressel of the Weizmann Institute's
Department of Plant Genetics proposed an innovative solution to
the parasitic weed problem, which relies on a new use for a
certain type of corn that has been biotechnogically developed in
the United States. This corn has a gene conferring resistance to
a herbicide and is therefore unharmed when sprayed by this
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
Rather than spraying entire fields, Professor Gressel has
suggested taking seeds that are resistant to a particular
herbicide and soaking them in it before planting. Once the crop's
plants sprout from seeds, the parasites unwittingly devour the
weed-killing chemical from the crop roots or surrounding soil,
and die. By the time the crops ripen, the herbicide has
disappeared and does not affect the food supply.
</P>
<P>
Scientists George Odhiambo and Gordon Abayo from the Kenyan
Agricultural Research Institute in Kisumu, in conjunction with
Joel Ransom of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center in Nairobi, have tested this approach for five seasons.
</P>
<P>
Witchweed infection was dramatically reduced in experimental
plots planted with herbicide-soaked seeds. As a result, crop
yields were more than three times higher compared with yields
from witchweed-infested plots planted with untreated seeds.

Eighteen-year-old Vargas won a victory in the Welterweight
division by scoring 17-14 over Augusta College student Brandon
Mitchem.
</P>
<P>
In the light heavyweight, Antonio Tarver, a gold medal hopeful
for the U.S. team that won three golds at Barcelona in 1992,

the U.S. boxing Athlete of the Year in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In flyweight, 20-year-old Eric Morel won the match over Ramases
Patterson with a 43-40 decision after the two battled to 15-15.
</P>
<P>
In the light welterweight division, Chicago's David Diaz scored

<HEADLINE> Dar Gas Turbines Grind To Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The four gas turbines
worth 68 million U.S. dollars installed at Ubungo power station
in Dar es Salaam have been shut down for over a month because of
lack of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The local press today qouted sources in the Ministry of Energy
and Minerals as saying that the Tanzania Electric Supplies Company
(TANESCO) had no funds to buy fuel for the generators.
</P>
<P>
To be worse still, the company is yet to pay import taxes to
the consumed fuel amounting to 1.8 billion Tanzania Shillings
(about 3.3 million U.S. dollars), according to the ministry
sources.
</P>
<P>
Between last October and February this year, TANESCO imported
50,000 tonnes of fuel whose import duty was 1.8 billion Tanzania
Shillings to run the trubines, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The gas turbines installed as an emergency power project (epp)
are said to be consuming about 100,000 U.S. Dollars of fuel a
day.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of TANESCO is also attributed to the fact that
most of its big customers who happen to be government ministries,
departments, parastatals and some private companies failed to pay
their bills which amounted to billions of shillings.

<HEADLINE> China Strives for Peace And Development In Asia: Kazak Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will give priority to
working for peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region,

interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a number of cooperation mechanisms have been

<HEADLINE> Sampras Reaches Japan Open Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras defended his world
number one ranking by rolling over Mark Woodforde of Australia on
Saturday to reach the final of the Japan Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The American, who regained the top spot by winning the Hong Kong
Open last weekend, stood firm in his service games to take a 7-6
(7/5), 6-4 victory over the doubles specialist in the semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Clay-court specialist Thomas Muster of Austria, who is playing
in Barcelona, would have had a chance to regain the number one
ranking if Sampras had lost the sem-final.
</P>
<P>
"Each time I played him, he does give me problems, especially
his change of pace from his heavy top spin forehand to hit a very
low slice," Sampras said of his match against Woodforde.
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have a big weapon, but he does everything really
well, he's a crafty, good solid player, he doesn't give you a
rhythm out there."
</P>
<P>
Woodforde, who has been enjoying the best year as a singles
player at 30, gained a break chance at 30-40 in the third game of
the first set.
</P>
<P>
But Sampras fired an ace to save what turned out to be the only
break point for Woodforde throughout the 102-minute match.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles action, defending champion Amy Frazier
booked a final place against local favourite Kimiko Date for a
re-match of last year's final.
</P>
<P>
The American, who stopped Date's fourth straight Japan title
last year, squandered two match points in the second-set
tie-breaker before getting better of Japan's Naoko Kijimuta 6-3,
6-7 (7/9), 6-1.

<HEADLINE> A Sustainable Ecosystem Urged In Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A researcher with the
Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) has called for
urgent stock assessment survey on Lake Victoria to ensure a
sustainable balanced ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Professor P. O. Bwathondi told a workshop on Lake Victoria
resources management in Dar Es Salaam on Friday that there were
fears that the number of fish species in the lake had decreased.
</P>
<P>
"With the increase in the fishing pressure and use of illegal
techniques, the number of fish in the lake will continue to
diminish," noted the researcher.
</P>
<P>
The professor pointed out that for the past few years, species
like alestes, labeo, bagrus, synodontis, clarias, schilbe and
propterus, have been declining in number in the lake.
</P>
<P>
The lake has 300 fish species according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
Professor Bwathondi said most of the lake ecosystem had been
disturbed by human activities, a situation, he said, should be
arrested through a regional approach.

TOKYO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- American Amy Frazier used two hours
to beat Japan's Naoko Kijimuta 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-1 here Saturday
to advance to the women's final of the Japan Open tennis
tournament.
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive year, Frazier will meet top seed
Kimiko Date of Japan in showdown final. Date won in 1994 - her
third consecutive Japan Open title - and Frazier won last year.
</P>
<P>
Frazier, the No. 3 seed, frequently hit winners into the
corners. But in the second-set tiebreaker, Frazier couldn't wound
up the match from 6-4.
</P>
<P>
She hit a backhand long and Kijimuta hit a forehand winner. Then,
with another match point at 7-6, Frazier double faulted. Two more
errors gave Kijimuta the set.
</P>
<P>
In the final set, Frazier raced to a 4-0 lead before being broken
once. Then she broke for the third time in the set and served out
to seal the tough match.
</P>
<P>
Date, ranked ninth in the world, reached the final with a 6-1,
6-3 victory over Japan's Ai Sugiyama, the fourth seed, on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Africa Sees Economic Achievements in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABIDJAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Africa's foreign trade volume
reached a record high in 1995 and achieved the lowest inflation
level for four years, a report by the African Development Bank
shows.
</P>
<P>
But the bank also warned the continent faces major challenges,
including combatting poverty, increasing agricultural production
to feed a growing population and curbing foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Africa registered a record 210 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
trade volume in 1995, including 111.7 billion dollars of imports,
and 98.5 billion dollars of exports, up 13.5 percent and 11.8
percent respectively from 1994, the report said.
</P>
<P>
African countries successfully curbed inflation in 1995, with
the average inflation rate down from 42 percent in 1994 to 26.6
percent, the lowest level in the past four years. Of the 53
African nations, Sechelles had the lowest inflation rate of 0.18
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of their improving financial situation, African
countries reduced the proportion of their budget deficits from an
average of 5.1 percent of gross domestic product in 1995 to an
average of 3.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The overall GDP in Africa also grew by a record 2.9 percent in
1995. Economic growth rates in Kenya, Egypt, Uganda, Ethiopia,
Ghana and Ivory Coast all exceeded 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and processing industries have became
increasingly vital to economic development and exports from these
sectors have increased, especially in South Africa, Egypt, Kenya
and Zimbabwei, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Abidjan-based bank attributed these achievements to a
relatively stable political situation on the continent and
strengthened regional cooperation,
</P>
<P>
But the report also listed several challenges to economic
revitalization in Africa, which is home to 700 million people,
half of them living in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
In some countries, it said, destabilizing political situations
still exist and corruption prevails among government officials.
</P>
<P>
The growth of per capita agricultural production in 1995, at
two percent, still lags behind the continent's population growth
rate, and foreign debts continue to increase in Africa, reaching a
staggering 320.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report added, most African countries remain
highly dependent on external markets, funds and technology.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Prosecutor Unveils Embezzlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Former President Rafael
Leonardo Callejas stole 1.5 million U.S. dollars from a special
oil fund during the last days of his mandate, Honduran prosecutors
said today.
</P>
<P>
Six days before leaving office in 1994, 500,000 dollars were
withdrawn from the oil fund and put into Callejas' personal bank
account, number 2101490, a report by the Public Magistracy, or
General Prosecutor Office (GPO) said.
</P>
<P>
The GPO is investigating every bank account transfer and why
officials of the previous regime deviated money from the oil
adjustment fund to the personal account of Callejas, who governed
Honduras from 1990 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 500,000 dollars transfer brings to 1.5 million dollars the
amount of money moved from the oil fund to Callejas' personal
account, said the GPO.
</P>
<P>
The Oil Adjustment Fund was created to compensate for rises in
the foreign prices of crude oil and to stabilize fuel prices in
the country, preventing any sudden increases.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Hails Shanghai Border Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The five-nation summit between
central Asian countries to finalise border talks will be one of
the major diplomatic events of the 20th century, Kazakh Foreign
Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai summit between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia
and Tajikistan, due to take place within the next six weeks, will
signal a satisfactory conclusion of extensive border talks which
began at the end of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Kazakhstan Pravda, Tokayev
said that the summit, the first of its kind, will be attended by
Presidents Jiang Zemin of China, Boris Yeltsin of Russia,
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzia and
Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the five leaders are expected to sign an
agreement aimed at strengthening each other's military confidence
in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, border talks between
the five countries has taken on added political significance said
Tokayev. Reducing military presence in each other's border areas
will help deepen trust between the five countries.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1994, Chinese Premier Li Peng signed with his Kazakh
counterpart Nazarbayev a demarcation treaty between the two
countries, said Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister also hoped that Kazakhstan's trade with
China will more than double from 1995's 350 million U.S. dollars
to 750 million dollars over the next one or two years.

<HEADLINE> French Population Growth Hits Record High Since World War Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- France's population has leapt to 58
million in the past 50 years after hovering around 40 million for
an equally long period of time, France's National Statistics
Bureau (INSEE) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A post-war "baby boom" and longer life expectancy explained
most of the sharp rise in the French population from 1946 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Average life expectancy had risen about 15 years in France
over the period, from 60 to 74 years for men and from 65 to 82
for women. The oldest person in the world, 121-year-old Jeanne
Calment, lives in southern France. The number of people aged over
65 had risen from 11 percent of the population in 1946 to 15
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Immigration accounted for about 25 percent of the population
gain, partly as France took in foreign work force to make up for
domestic labour shortage after World War Two, INSEE said.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the 1970s, the percentage of foreigners in
metropolitan France had been constant at about 6.5 percent,
matching the level reached in 1931 after a wave of immigration by
foreign workers in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
The end of French colonial rule prompted the return of 1.5
French expatriates after 1956, including an exodus of 650,000 when
Algeria won independence in 1962.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban religious
student militia claimed to have recaptured Cheghcheran, capital of
central Ghor province, according to local newspaper here today.
</P>
<P>
"The News" quoted Yar Mohammad Akhund, the Taliban's governor
in Herat in western Afghanistan, as saying Friday that the militia
in their latest offensive overran government forces in
Cheghcheran.
</P>
<P>
He said Ghor governor Khalili, who was installed by the Kabul
government, was captured in a wounded condition but later died on
board the plane when he was about to be evacuated to Herat for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Yar Mohammad said that about eight government troops were
killed, while some 100 others were taken prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Casualties on the Taliban side were only a few, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no independent confirmation of the latest
development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hectic diplomatic efforts are going on to find
peaceful solutions for war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
US Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs Robin Raphal
arrived in Kabul on Friday to start her first visit to Afghanistan
in six months.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul said she was expected to meet Kabul's
military commander Ahmed Masood, Foreign Minister Najibullah
Lafraie, Civil Aviation Minister Abdur Rahman and other top
officials.
</P>
<P>
She may also see President Burhanuddin Rabbani during her
36-hour stay in the capital, reports quoted a government official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Raphel was also expected to travel to the Taliban base in
southern Kandahar province as well as eastern city of Jalalabad
for talks with Taliban leaders and other factional leaders.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iran is also making intensified efforts to
bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allauddin Broujerdi, who is
currently visiting different parts of Afghanistan, flew into
Jalalabad and held talks with the Hezb-i-Islami leader Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
As for Pakistan, it will send its Foreign Secretary Najmuddin
Sheikh to Moscow "very soon", said a Foreign Office spokesman here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Besides bilateral relations, the Afghan issue will be on top of
the agenda for discussion between Pakistani and Russian officials.

This is Pakistan's first high level visit to Moscow in seven
years.

American countries and the United States will meet here on April
26 to discuss ways to deal with the European Union's (EU) banana
import quotas, a report in the local press said today.

BRUSSELS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A forum of European
non-governmental organizations ended here today with calls for
peace in Central Africa and Lebanon, better North-South
cooperation and a demand for the European Commission to scrap its
recent decision on chocolate.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 non-governmental representatives from the 15
member nations of the European Union (EU) attended the two-day
European Forum.
</P>
<P>
The forum passed a resolution asking the EU to make more
efforts to resolve conflicts in Central African countries such as
Rwanda and Burundi through negotiations and other peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the EU to take action to halt the fighting
between the Israelis and Hizbollah guerrillas, which has already
claimed the lives of over 100 civilians in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The forum pressed for better cooperation between the EU and
developing countries and more humanitarian aid for underdeveloped
nations.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the forum also strongly objected to the
European Commission's April 17 decision to allow chocolate to
contain up to five percent non-cocoa vegetable fats.
</P>
<P>
They said that this would reduce Europe's annual cocoa imports
by 62,500 metric tons to 125,000 metric tons, inflicting painful
financial losses on cocoa-producing countries.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will make a 25-part television
series to revitalize people's admiration for the country's first
military strategist.
</P>
<P>
Born in the Spring and Autumn period dating back 2,500 years
ago, Sun Wu is regarded the patriarch of Chinese military science,
and paid high worship for his renowned book, Sunzi Bingfa, on the
art of war.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the role of a great theorist, Sun once commanded
a crack troop of Wu Kingdom, in Southeast China, to destroy a much
stronger neighbor, Chu Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The TV series, involving 15 million yuan's investment, will
give "a panorama-like picture" of the war-ridden age when Sun
lived, while reproducing the legendary life of this giant of
military thought, said today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Sun's theories left a huge influence not only in China, but
also in other parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> Easy Access to Investment Funds in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Deposits in Guangzhou surged by
about 35 percent to nearly 180 billion yuan by the end of 1995,
because of impressive economic growth, meaning Guangzhou has a
huge pool of investment funds, an analyst here has explained.
</P>
<P>
Individual deposits grew to more than 94 billion yuan, with per
capita deposits reaching 16,000 yuan, six times the national
level. More than 70 percent are in fixed-term deposits.
</P>
<P>
"Individual savings have contributed greatly to the growth of
deposits," the analyst said. "They will remain the main source for
loans over the next few years," he said, noting that the more than
three billion yuan in individual cash and the financial service
network are two reasons for greater funds for development.
</P>
<P>
The use of funds for development has been thriving in
Guangzhou, which traded more than two million yuan worth of equity
in 1995, with more than six billion yuan raised through the local
lending center connected with over 130 financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Last year Guangzhou arranged nearly 170 billion yuan in loans,
up about 27 percent. Loans during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1990-1995) were 80 billion yuan more than in the Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1985-1990), accounting for more than 46 percent of
the total fixed asset investment of nearly 180 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The easy access to funds, as part of a fine investment
climate, has lured many entrepreneurs to Guangzhou," the analyst
noted.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou used more than two billion US dollars in foreign
investment in 1995, up 10 percent. It had 825 foreign-funded firms
from 39 countries and regions by the end of 1995, and foreign
capital is expected to account for 40 percent of the investment
over the next five years, according to an official with the
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The booming city is also popular with domestic investors who
not only are building restaurants and developing real estate, but
also venturing into retail sales by opening several large
department stores.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Shut Down 106 State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria said that it will shut
down 106 loss-making state-run enterprises within months as part
of efforts to rescue its industry and banking system.
</P>
<P>
The closures are just the start of a financial rescue plan
drawn up of late by the government, Ivan Angelov, economic adviser
to Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Central to the plan is allowing "hopeless" enterprises to go
bankrupt in order to save those considered "promising," Angelov
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government could not afford to delay industrial
restructuring because the country's banking sector, which bears
the bulk of the losses run up by state enterprises, is on the
brink of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said 60 percent of the 162-billion-leva (about 2 billion
U.S. dollars) in losses incurred by state enterprises from 1992 to
1995 was borne by the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The government will decide within one or two weeks which
enterprises will be closed and their liquidation will begin in May.
</P>
<P>
The move will leave about 17,000 employees idle in the
machine-building, electronic, chemical and textile
industries. They have been promised unemployment benefits and the
World Bank has agreed to grant the country 80 million dollars to
cushion the mass lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
Another 58 enterprises will be closed down if they fail to halve
their losses which amounted to 28.6 billion leva (343 million
dollars) by mid-1997, Angelov said.
</P>
<P>
He said a few banks will be declared bankrupt next week in
order to win loans from the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding seeks protection from husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) - Former skating star Tonya
Harding has received a court order protecting her from
 her husband of less than four months, whom she is seeking to
divorce.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here, a county judge in Portland on
Thursday signed the restraining order to keep Michael Smith, a
machinist, away from the former Olympic skating star.
</P>
<P>
Harding filed for divorce on April 10 from her second
husband, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple wed on
December 23 in a ceremony on a private boat.
</P>
<P>
She said he threatened her and on one occasion she had to
take refuge in a bathroom to escape him.
</P>
<P>
"He threatened to make me have pain and my family. He also
has come after me and he broke a table and would not let me
leave. I had to lock myself in a bathroom and he broke the
door at the end of March," Harding said in a affidavit filed
with the court.
</P>
<P>
Smith, whose marriage to Harding was his fourth, also
threatened to "ruin" her career, the skater alleged.
</P>
<P>
In local published reports Smith has said Harding only
married him for the money she received from tabloids that took
pictures at their wedding.
</P>
<P>
She has not commented on his charges.
</P>
<P>
Harding, 25, was a popular skating star until two years
ago when her then husband Jeff Gillooly was charged in an
attack on Harding's rival Nancy Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
Harding was cleared of any advance knowledge of the plot
to maim her rival. She pleaded guilty to hindering the
investigation and divorced Gillooly.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem today appealed to Israel and Lebanon to stop fighting and
make efforts to promote the peace process and construction in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In statements to a local radio station, Menem condemned
terrorism and said it is fundamental for the warring parties in
Middle East to end confrontation and war since there is no logical
explanation for their terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Menem said his country will send food and medicines to Lebanon,
aiming to alleviate the pains of the victims of the Israeli
offensive against towns in Southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government last night called the warring parties
in Israel and Lebanon to immediately end their fighting.
</P>
<P>
Israel is carrying on an offensive against the south of Lebanon
in retaliation for the attacks launched by Hizbollah, an
anti-Israeli Lebanese organization headquartered in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli assault has killed some 100 Lebanese refugees. On
Thursday, Israeli shelling of a U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
killed at least 75 and wounded 100 others, including three Fijian
peace-keepers, an act which has aroused condemnation from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
Menem called Spain's King Juan Carlos last night, suggesting he
study joint action which could lead to the solution of the
over-12-year crisis between Israel and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Lists Aids for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has adopted an anti-poverty strategy to help about four million
farmers rise from poverty by the end of this century, according to
an official with the provincial anti-poverty and development
office.
</P>
<P>
The province will soon start six programs designed for the
rural population, to improve power supply and road conditions and
develop some leading industries, as well as to popularize relevant
science and technology among the poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
The local government decided early this year to invest five
million yuan annually in the coming five years, to implement the
country's Project Spark, which is also a kind of anti-poverty
program launched by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to gain 80 billion yuan from the 10 leading
technological-support industries, and each of the prefectures has
been asked to develop one to three industries with output value of
five million yuan.
</P>
<P>
And the province has also invested about eight million yuan in
supporting the development of 133,000 ha of film-covered
high-yield maize in the poverty-stricken areas, to get enough food
for poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
Certain measure will also be taken to increase the water supply
of the province's water-short regions in the meantime.

TEGUCIGALPA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Central American

The two-day meeting in Copan, a Mayan archeological zone some

Salvador, which has lagged behind the development of the rest of
the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by the directors of the migration
bureaus of the Isthmus countries, since the Trifinio is inhabited

<HEADLINE> U.S. Confirms Missile Talks with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
officially confirmed that it would hold missile talks with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) this weekend in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to meet with a North Korean delegation in Berlin
April 20th and 21st for a preliminary round of discussions on
missile non-proliferation," U.S. State Department deputy spokesman
Glyn Davies told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the U.S. government had confirmed
the reported talks between Washington and Pyongyong on the missile
issue. Some U.S. news reports had reported that the timetable for
the Berlin talks were fixed in February, but the U.S. State
Department spokesman had repeatedly refused to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
Davies said that the United States believes DPRK has been
"proliferating various technologies that are harmful" to some
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make as much progress as possible in bringing
North Korea on board with the notion of responsible non-
proliferation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, DPRK has stated that the U.S. allegations about DPRK's
missile program were groundless.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the Berlin talks came less than a week
after U.S. President Bill Clinton proposed a four-way talks on the
future of the Korean Peninsula among the United States, China,
South Korea and DPRK when he visited South Korea last week.
</P>
<P>
Asked what Washington would do if DPRK tried to broaden the
agenda beyond missiles, Davies said:
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly the case that we have no interest in direct
security negotiations with North Korea about the future of the
Korean peninsula. That action should occur in the context of
four-way talks."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation will be headed by U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for non-proliferation Robert Einhorn,
Department officials disclosed.

<HEADLINE> France Deploys Troops in Capital of Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paris, April 19 (Xinhua) -- France sent troops into the capital
of the Central African Republic today to protect the country's
presidential palace and foreign residents after an uprising by
more than 100 soldiers demanding back pay.
</P>
<P>
The deployment in Bangui followed clashes between the mutinous
soldiers and forces loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse on
Thursday when several people were reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
Under a military agreement with the Central African Republic, a
former French colony, France maintains a 1,400-strong force in the
country, including 800 soldiers in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the French troops in Bangui will help restore
stability and secure the safety of foreign residents.
</P>
<P>
In addition to some 2,400 French citizens in the Central
African Republic, about 1,000 other foreigners, mainly from other
European Union nations, are resident in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released earlier today, the French Foreign
Ministry said France would "help all elected democratic
institutions to defend law and constitutional order."
</P>
<P>
Formerly part of French Equatorial Africa, the Central African
Republic is in the heart of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Patasse was elected president three years ago in the country's
first democratic polls since it gained full independence from
France in 1960.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today said
Russian military commanders should bear the blame for this week's
rebel ambush in Chechnya which left 76 dead, and Russian Defense
Minister Pavel Grachev said he was ready to step down.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebels loyal to separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev
attacked a convoy of Russian army trucks on a mountain road near
the village of Yarysh-Mardy on Tuesday, according to the Itar-Tass
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described the attack, in which 54 were wounded, as a
tragedy for Chechnya and for all of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, also criticised
Russian military commanders for the loss of the servicemen and
summoned Grachev to explain what had happened.
</P>
<P>
Grachev said that he was prepared to resign if the Duma
believed he should take the responsibility for the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, only the president has the right to sack the defence
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Duma passed a resolution today calling on Yeltsin to
declare a national day of mourning for the soldiers killed in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, Yeltsin unveiled a plan to end the 16-month
conflict, ordering a ceasefire and offering indirect talks with
Dudayev, but fighting has continued.

<HEADLINE> Spain Condemns Israeli for Shelling of Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Spain today condemned Israel for
its shelling of Lebanon, which killed over 100 civilians, and
called on warring parties to stop fighting and resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez Marquez said he was
shocked by Israel's shelling, but believed that the diplomatic
efforts made by the international community will lead to an
immediately ceasefire and an end to violence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Carlos Westendorp said the violent activities
have become uncontrollable and endanger the Middle East Peace
Process.
</P>
<P>
He said the European Union (EU) should make efforts to protect
the Middle East Peace Process and supported the two-day mission to
the region by Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli on behalf
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp suggested the delegation should put pressure on
warring parties to prevent the violence from escalating.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that those working for peace should gain
support from the international community, since enemies of peace
exist in both Israeli and Arab extremists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli shelling of south Lebanon Thursday killed more
than 100. In an attack on the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, at
least 45 were killed and 100 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel's assault has aroused widespread international
condemnation and an appeal to stop the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Torch Won't Pass Through Cobb County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic torch relay will
bypass a suburban county that adopted an anti-gay resolution three
years ago, organizers announced in Atlanta on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According press reports reaching here, Gay rights activists had
threatened demonstrations if Cobb County was included in the torch
relay, which begins in Los Angeles on April 27 and concludes in
Atlanta on July 19.
</P>
<P>
``It is our goal to make the torch relay an exciting and
memorable experience. We want to focus on the excitement of the
event and not be distracted by other issues,'' the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, ACOG pulled Olympic volleyball competition out of Cobb
County because of a furor over the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Cobb commissioners have refused to rescind the 1993 resolution,
which says ``lifestyles advocated by the gay community ... are
incompatible with the standards to which this community
subscribes.''
</P>
<P>
Bill Byrne, chairman of the county commission, did not
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jon-Ivan Weaver, co-chairman of the activist group Olympics Out
of Cobb, said, ``We have worked hard to make sure they uphold the
Olympic ideals. Cobb County is not a place that deserves the
Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> China's Forest Bases Fast Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a fast-growing
and high-yielding forest base in 16 southern and eastern provinces
and autonomous regions over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Such a large afforestation project, supported by World Bank, is
the largest of its kind in the world, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Technology has been comprehensively applied in the project,
said Sun Shujin, director of the World Band loan projects
management center under Ministry of Forestry. Thirty-three of the
ministry's 100 key items of technology played important roles.
</P>
<P>
The base, with 1.35 million ha of trees planted, accounts for a
large segment of the State's plan to plant 6.7 million ha of
fast-growing and high-yielding forests by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
With 274 million US dollars in loans from the World Bank and
166 million US dollars in domestic funds, the mature base will be
able to supply a stock volume of 216 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The new supply will help relieve the short supply of timber,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
By 1994, China had more than 3.3 million ha of fast-growing and
high-yielding forests. It began a campaign in 1988 to add 20
million ha of such plantations across the country within 30
years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Bulls' guard Ron
Harper, who has not missed a game this season, will sit out the
final two games before the playoffs after spraining his left
ankle, club officials said in Chicago in Friday.
</P>
<P>
Harper was injured during Chicago's 110-79 win over the Detroit
Pistons while battling for a loose ball late in the first
quarter. A teammate stepped on Harper's ankle as he fell out of
bounds. He was helped to the locker room for x-rays.
</P>
<P>
"He has very mild instability, maybe a little swelling,"
Chicago trainer Chip Schaefer said. "We're hoping he's back on
his feet by the first of next week."
</P>
<P>
If he is not, he could miss the club's playoff opener.
</P>
<P>
Harper will miss Chicago's home game against Indiana on
Saturday and the Bulls regular-season finale on Sunday in
Washington. He was averaging 7.5 points and 2.6 rebounds through
the Bulls' 70-9 season, the winningest campaign in NBA history.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Passes Law On Extradition of War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian parliament today
finally approved a law which allows war criminals wanted by the
international court in The Hague to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Law on Cooperation Between Croatia and The
Hague War Crimes Tribunal was adopted with 98 votes in favor, four
against and two abstentions by the House of Representatives, the
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Croatia has refused to extradite persons charged with war
crimes in the Bosnian war, citing constitutional terms which
prevent international bodies from taking over affairs under
Croatian jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation provides for the transfer of authority to
conduct criminal proceedings to The Hague tribunal and allows the
extradition of the accused.
</P>
<P>
Eight Croats have been indicted by the tribunal for atrocities
against Bosnian Muslims during the 1993 war between the two sides,
but only one of them is under the tribunal's custody. Also
indicted by the tribunal for war crimes are 44 Serbs and three
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the four-year Bosnian war which erupted in
early 1992, Bosnian Croats and Muslims fought as allies against
their Serb foes. But several months later they turned their guns
against each other over disputed territory. Washington pressured
them to rebuild a loose alliance in early 1994.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Shows Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corporation, the
leading software maker in the world, has brought encouraging news
to the PC market, which has been in a slump recently, with its
strong quarterly earnings Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
For the quarter ending March 31, the company reported earnings
of 562 million U.S. dollars, up from 396 million dollars in the
same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the 42 percent rise in earnings to the
active support of computer users. Microsoft's flagship Windows
family of software, which controls core functions of PCs, was
strong.
</P>
<P>
The company said about 70 percent of all new PCs were sold with
pre-installed Windows 95, which was officially released in August.
PC makers pay fixed royalties to Microsoft. Core PC programs like
spreadsheets and word processing also surged. Revenue topped 1
billion dollars for the first time, it said.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1997, Microsoft executives turned out
to be cautious, saying comparisons with the previous year, which
included the issuing of Windows 95 and associated applications,
would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that Microsoft's results, coupled with strong
earnings reported by Intel earlier this week, don't mean the
sluggish PC industry is set to rebound soon. Fierce competition
among PC makers and dealers would lead to lower profits, though
unit sales of PCs will grow fast, they said.

<P>
Since the signing of the Lusaka peace agreement in November
1994, peaceful conditions have gradually been restored to most
parts of Angola and soldiers of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola have begun to be disarmed at designated
"quartering areas."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the erratic pace of the peace process, insecurity
and the threat of land mines have prevented the majority of
war-displaced Angolans from returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
The current appeal provides for assistance to some 200,000
refugees expected to return to Angola in the course of the year,
as well as 700,000 internally displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
The renewed civil war that raged from 1992 to 1994 destroyed
much of the country's social and economic infrastructure and has
left a further 1.8 million of Angola's 12 million people dependent
on some form of humanitarian assistance.

In addition, the cultural exchanges between B.C. and China are
on the rise, which Clark said is of great importance to B.C. He
also noted the improvement of China's law and order, which will
smooth the way further for the growth of B.C.-China ties.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Qiao said that he is very pleased to come and
visit the scenic British Columbia Province.
</P>
<P>
He noted the development of China-Canada relations over the
past 26 years, adding that the political ties have been enhanced
and bilateral cooperation moved to more fields in more depth.
</P>
<P>
Last year, bilateral trade topped 4.2 billion U.S. dollars.
China and Canada have become each other's important trade and
investment partners. Qiao said he is pleased with these
developments.
</P>
<P>
Voicing agreement with Clark's remarks about B.C.'s "gateway"
role, the NPC chairman expressed the hope that the "gateway" will
open more wider in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
B.C. boasts many "firsts" in its relations with China. It is
the first Canadian province to develop relations with China, the
first place China set up its consulate general in Canada, and the
first stop for China's airlines that fly to Canada.
</P>
<P>
In addition, B.C. has twined with Guangdong Province and forged
sister-city ties with five Chinese cities. Qiao expressed the hope
that the relations between China and B.C. will be further
expanded.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon China's future plans for the next 15 years, Qiao
said that China's development needs international cooperation.
This, he said, will provide lots of new opportunities to
Sino-foreign economic cooperation, including China-B.C.
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that his province is ready to further strengthen its
cooperation with China in various fields.

VANCOUVER, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
met with Emery Barnes, speaker of the Legislative Assembly of
Canada's British Colombia (B.C.) Province, here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC), is on a two-day visit in
Vancouver, Canada's largest west coast city. He flew in from the
Saskatchewan capital of Regina Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Extended warm welcome from Barnes on behalf of the B.C. people
and Legislative Assembly, Qiao noted the fact that B.C. is among
the first of Canadian provinces to develop relations with China,
adding that it carries much weight in China-Canada relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada share many common languages, and encounter
little resistance in developing their relations, since both of
them are willing to further these ties with their eyes set on the
21st century, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao told the speaker that China's economy has entered a
promising phase of development, and that the World Bank also
expressed optimism about it.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that B.C. and the rest of Canada will
seize the opportunity and assume an active role in China's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he is convinced that China's economy will continue
its boom. This growth is in conformity with B.C.'s interests, he
added.
</P>

At noon, Qiao attended a luncheon given by Jack Austin,
president of the Canada-China Business Council.
