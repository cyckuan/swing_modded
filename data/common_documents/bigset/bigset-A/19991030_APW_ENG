<HEADLINE> GOP, White House Battle Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders and the White  
House traded charges of partisanship and obstructionism over the 
budget Saturday. Each side declared that only it has the wisdom to 
save Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the harsh words, the House's four top leaders pledged in  
a letter to President Clinton to cooperate ``to resolve our 
differences'' over spending bills to pay for government operations 
in the fiscal year that started Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, told the  
Republicans they should work with the administration ``to 
strengthen Social Security for the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the words in both letters were far from cordial.  
</P>
<P>
	The rhetoric flew in an atmosphere embittered by prospects of an  
election next year with control of the House in the balance. The 
GOP, which gained control in 1994 for the first time in 40 years, 
has a precarious majority of 222-211, with one Democrat-leaning 
Independent and one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' letter was signed by Speaker Dennis Hastert of  
Illinois, Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay of Texas, and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the House Republican 
Conference chairman. They said the GOP's best efforts were stymied 
by Democrats out ``to advance their political agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time since 1960 we funded the operations of the  
federal government without raiding Social Security and without 
raising taxes,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are excited about our success, we understand there is  
more work ahead. And we stand ready to work with you to resolve our 
differences,'' they wrote. ``However, we are greatly concerned 
about the efforts of congressional Democrats to obstruct our work 
in order to advance their political agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As we continue our work, we urge you to reject (such) attempts  
... and renew your commitment to saving 100 percent of the Social 
Security surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta repeated the administration's position that it was  
Clinton who, in his 1998 State of the Union Address, challenged the 
Congress to ``Save Social Security First.'' Podesta said Clinton's 
budget offering for this year would have done that through 2050. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has not yet acted on that proposal,'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	Far from rebuking House Democrats, Podesta said: ``Thanks to  
Democrats in Congress, we were able to stop a Republican tax cut 
that would have undermined Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed the $792 billion, and congressional leaders were  
unable to get the two-thirds majority necessary to override the 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta, citing the Congressional Budget Office, said the final  
GOP spending bills would spend more than $17 billion of the Social 
Security surplus. He added: 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a choice: you can continue with this pointless  
partisanship, or, as the president suggested in his meeting with 
you, work with us to strengthen Social Security for the 21st 
century.''

<HEADLINE> Students Said Inspired by Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The teen-agers accused of plotting a deadly  
attack at their high school laughed about the Columbine massacre 
and wanted to do the same thing at their high school, a friend 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They started talking about how they hated the world, and they  
wanted to do the same thing at South High School,'' 15-year-old 
Sarah Jedd said in Saturday's editions of The Plain Dealer. ``They 
said they wanted to be well-known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four white students have been arrested and seven others  
questioned in what was described as a racially motivated plot to 
carry out an attack at predominantly black South High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White closed South High on Friday after the  
parents of a student tipped off authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jedd said the four teens laughed about how Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before killing 
themselves last spring at Columbine High School in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The four teens were charged with two counts of inciting violence  
and one count each of false alarm, aggravated menacing-ethnic 
intimidation and inducing panic. Police took two guns from a 
student's house but did not say where they were found. 
</P>
<P>
	South High will open again on Monday with police officers in the  
school and hand-held detectors scanning students. The building will 
be searched before students arrive.

head victory over Comic Strip in the $110,80 Knickerbocker Handicap 
at Aqueduct Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old colt, recently recovered from foot problems,  
showed his top form while carrying 114 pounds with Jose Santos over 
1 1/8 miles on the turf course in 1:49. He earned $66,480 for the

and $2.10 and Nat's Big Party was $2.70 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle Cherie, a 6-1 shot ridden by John Velazquez, won the

Velazquez also was aboard Snit, the winner of last year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle Cherie carried 112 pounds over 1 1/8 miles in 1:50 and earned  
$66,000 for Bellemeadows Farm and Lael Stable. It was the second

<HEADLINE> Nevada Tells Tyson To Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's act has worn thin in Nevada.  
</P>
<P>
	State boxing regulators released Tyson's $8.7 million purse  
Friday, but not before telling his handlers they should take future 
fights elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice is to pack Mike Tyson's bags up and take this act on  
the road,'' commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta said. ``I'm not so sure 
we need him in the state of Nevada any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Athletic Commission voted 4-0 to release the purse  
and not punish Tyson for a late blow that prematurely ended his 
fight last Saturday against Orlin Norris at the end of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	And commissioners warned that Tyson will have a tough time  
getting a new boxing license when his expires Dec. 31, and 
suggested he find another place to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not prepared to have any hoodlums fight in the state of  
Nevada,'' commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly frustrated at having to deal with Tyson outside the ring  
once more, commissioners spent little time at the 30-minute hearing 
going over the circumstances surrounding the premature ending of 
last Saturday's fight between Tyson and Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they tried to send a message that Nevada would not  
tolerate rules being broken in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson did not appear at the hearing, which was in sharp contrast  
to the lengthy proceedings a year ago that won him the right to box 
again after being banned from the sport for biting Evander 
Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Dan Goossen told commissioners that he also thought it  
was a good idea for Tyson to fight elsewhere, at least for awhile. 
Goossen said plans were underway to do just that, even before the 
latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking to take Mike out of the state of Nevada and go  
other places including out of the country,'' Goossen said. ``Those 
plans are still on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson tentatively is scheduled to fight Shannon Briggs on Feb.  
26 at Madison Square Garden. He also may fight before that, 
possibly on Dec. 11, against an unnamed opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's handlers are reportedly also trying to arrange a fight  
in England or Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's hearing, The Nevada Athletic Commission upheld  
referee Richard Steele's action of deducting two points from Tyson 
as the sole punishment for hitting Norris after the bell at the end 
of the first round of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris fell, dislocated his knee and was unable to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Ghanem said the commission was worried about Tyson's actions  
both against Norris and in January when he twisted Francois Botha's 
arm at the end of the first round of their fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to watch him closely,'' Ghanem said. ``But I don't  
think he'll ask to fight here for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's ruling in the ring that the left hook that dropped  
Norris after the bell sounded was not deliberate. That was the key 
factor in Tyson avoiding any penalties for the late blow, which 
ended the fight when Norris dislocated his knee on the way down to 
the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made the call right there and the call was appropriate,''  
commissioner Glen Carano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's attorney Jim Jimmerson noted that no other fights had  
been disciplined outside the ring for hitting after the bell. He 
brought up Felix Trinidad as an example, noting Trinidad hit Oscar 
De La Hoya after the bell twice during their welterweight 
unification bout and was not even penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the heat of the moment, the intensity of the moment,''  
Jimmerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson said after the fight that he did not hear the bell, even  
though it rang five times as Steele moved in to try and separate 
the fighters in the middle of the ring.

<HEADLINE> Web Cam Seeks Ghost in Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- On a cold winter morning in 1937, a  
janitor grabbed his flashlight and headed down into the pitch-black 
basement of the Willard Library to stoke the coal furnace. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, so the story goes, he was stopped cold in his tracks  
by the ghostly vision of a woman dressed in gray, from the veil 
covering her face down to her shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a number of Willard staff members have reported  
seeing the shadowy ``Lady in Grey'' or witnessing weird happenings 
among the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	And now anyone can try for a sighting. The Evansville Courier &AMP;  
Press has installed a video camera in the 114-year-old library and 
still pictures are posted on the newspaper's Web site every 30 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ghostcam'' was intended to generate more traffic at the  
Internet site during the Halloween season, said James Derk, new 
media editor for the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	But the page has been so popular -- it had been loaded more than  
173,000 times as of Thursday and overall traffic at 
Courierpress.com is up 40 percent -- that Derk wants to continue it 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really exploded beyond all expectations, which is good,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors are encouraged to point out pictures that they believe  
contain images of the ghost, and to share ghost stories. 
</P>
<P>
	One image, digitally enhanced several times, appears to show the  
gray form of a woman returning a book to a shelf. In another, what 
appears to be a shadowy head is half-hidden behind a computer 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Derk is at a loss to explain how the camera, which is mounted on  
a bookshelf about 8 feet above the floor, ended up pointing in a 
different direction one day. All of the library workers said they 
hadn't touched it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think something is out there, to paraphrase 'The X-Files,'''  
Derk said. ``We stand ready and willing to believe.''

<HEADLINE> Outgoing Head: UN Panel Rebounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- UNESCO, a troubled U.N. organization, has  
ceased being an ivory tower for intellectuals and is helping the 
world cope with the pressures of globalization, its retiring 
director general said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's Federico Mayor, a biochemist who has headed the U.N.  
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization for the past 12 
years, also said the 187-nation institution now is recognized a 
leading proponent of freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor said in an interview he would advise his probable  
successor, Japan's Koichiro Matsuura, that the best way to get the 
United States to rejoin UNESCO is to focus more sharply on issues 
such as illiteracy and education spending by developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsuura, Japan's ambassador to France, is expected to be  
endorsed Nov. 15 by the organization's governing board, which is 
based in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain left UNESCO in 1984 and 1985,  
charging the organization was corrupt, mismanaged and opposed to 
Western free press ideals. Britain returned last year but President 
Clinton has said budget constraints prevent the United States from 
rejoining. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials say Mayor has done a good job getting  
UNESCO back to the democratic principles on which it was founded 
after World War II -- promoting human rights and the free flow of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say UNESCO remains hobbled by top-heavy and  
inefficient management. They also contend Mayor spent too much of 
the $544 million biannual budget on special advisers and 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Associated Press by telephone from New  
York, the 65-year-old Mayor reviewed his accomplishments and 
answered criticism of his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNESCO has ceased being an ivory tower and is now  
reinvigorated on the spot in the field listening to the wishes of 
officials and ordinary people and trying to counterbalance the 
technological, financial and economic imperatives that govern 
globalization,'' Mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the organization, which in the early 1980s debated a  
Soviet- approved attempt to establish a ``new world information 
order,'' now ``is recognized throughout the world as the 
institution at the forefront of freedom expression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Koven, the European representative of the World Press  
Freedom Committee, said Mayor does not get enough credit for this 
accomplishment and has made UNESCO respectable again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He turned the organization around on press freedom,'' Koven  
said, ``and took a courageous stand against China when it 
threatened to boycott the organization after UNESCO gave a press 
freedom award to Gao Yu, a jailed Chinese journalist'' who was 
released earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor said unlike other U.N. agencies that deal with a single  
issue such as health or agriculture, UNESCO was like a university, 
managing programs that ranged from education and cultural heritage 
to preserving the world's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	He said even though the United States was not a member, UNESCO  
had a wide range of contacts with American schools, universities 
and scientific organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way to get the United States to come back is to keep  
accomplishing our mission in the best way we can without looking 
for pats on the back,'' Mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering critics of his management, he said independent audits  
by Congress' investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, and 
the Canadian government largely have been favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been disagreements on staff policies but this  
happens at other international organizations as well,'' ' Mayor 
said. ``I have reduced staff by 1,100 posts, a third, since I took 
over but I need to use consultants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said after leaving UNESCO he would establish a private  
foundation. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel Looks To Promote Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- In addition to saving itself, the  
International Olympic Committee is out to save the world. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel discussing reforms to the Olympic movement Saturday  
devoted as much time to the question of Olympic truces as it did to 
finances and anti-drug controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``In areas of conflict during the Olympic Games, the IOC should  
implement the proper measures in order to symbolize or enforce the 
Olympic Truce,'' read a proposal put before the 80-member reform 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The word ``enforce'' met immediate objections from former U.S.  
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a member of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many conservatives in America will go crazy when they see  
this,'' said Kissinger, who secured a promise that the offending 
word would be dropped. The IOC already is under fire by members of 
the U.S. Congress over the recent corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	After much debate, former U.N. Secretary-General Boutros  
Boutros-Ghali came up with a revised set of recommendations that 
the IOC should contact warring parties six months before the start 
of the Olympics in a bid to convince them to observe a truce for 
the duration of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ceremony would then evoke IOC actions in favor of a  
truce in the hopes this might be a first step toward a durable 
peace, according to the plan to be put to IOC members in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of Olympic truces is based on tradition observed  
during the games in ancient Greece and is warmly supported by IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch claimed that representations by the IOC and the  
Japanese government one week before the start of the Nagano Winter 
Olympics in February 1998 persuaded the United States to delay 
planned attacks on Iraq for refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attack never came because during the games, U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan had time to go to Baghdad and 
convinced Iraqi leaders that Security Council resolutions should be 
respected,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the idea of an Olympic truce.''

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Paper Cites McCain for Temper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The largest newspaper in John McCain's home state  
is questioning whether the Republican senator has the temperament 
to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic, in an editorial running in Sunday  
editions, criticizes McCain for a ``volcanic'' temper it says he 
has unleashed on other politicians, reporters and even the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the presidency, it  
is time the rest of the nation learned about the John McCain we 
know in Arizona,'' the newspaper says in the editorial, a copy of 
which was provided to The Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is also reason to seriously question whether he has  
temperament, and the political approach and skills, we want in the 
next president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Johnson, The Republic's senior vice president/news and  
executive editor, said Saturday the newspaper decided to run the 
editorial partly out of frustration that the American electorate is 
not getting the complete McCain story from the national media. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very much to be admired and applauded about John  
McCain,'' Johnson said in a telephone interview with the AP. ``But 
there is a less full-bodied portrayal at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying McCain's temper is a legitimate campaign issue, The  
Republic notes in its editorial that he has unleashed his temper on 
several top Arizona officials -- including Gov. Jane Hull, former 
Gov. Rose Mofford and former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	It also cites heated disagreements with fellow senators and says  
McCain has called some reporters who asked tough questions 
``liars'' and ``idiots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Dan Schnur on Saturday did not deny that his  
boss gets angry, adding that questions about his temperament are 
fair game. But Schnur portrays McCain's anger as passion-driven, 
rather than some major character flaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voters ought to decide for themselves if they want a candidate  
who gets angry when they seen an injustice, or would they rather 
have someone who rolls over and hides,'' Schnur says. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial was prompted by a recent New York Times article in  
which Mrs. Hull spoke of McCain's temper, pretending to a hold a 
telephone receiver inches from her ear for effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, who has endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said her  
relations with McCain were ``not particularly warm'' and that his 
temper is ``something that John has to keep control of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain blamed the Bush campaign for helping plant the story and  
said the hothead portrayal was inaccurate. ``But do I insult 
anybody or fly off the handle or anything like that? No, I don't,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic calls McCain's reaction to Mrs. Hull's comments  
``hogwash'' and says McCain ``is running dangerously close to 
sanctimony in his bid for the presidency, depicting himself as the 
last honorable politician in America.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Senators at Chafee Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- President Clinton, more than half the  
Senate and other dignitaries celebrated the late Sen. John H. 
Chafee on Saturday as one of the country's great politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, one of the last Republican moderates in the Senate, died  
of congestive heart failure last Sunday at age 77. 
</P>
<P>
	A horse-drawn carriage, accompanied by six Marine pallbearers,  
carried Chafee's body from the Rhode Island State House to Grace 
Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral drew 51 of Chafee's Senate colleagues, along with 14  
former senators, President and Mrs. Clinton, three members of 
Clinton's Cabinet, and many state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the biggest turnouts of national figures for the  
funeral of a U.S. senator -- a reflection of the admiration Chafee 
earned during his four decades of public service, including 23 
years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a reputation for honesty and integrity, and for choosing  
compromise over partisan politics, and former Sen. John Danforth of 
Missouri said the nation needs more politicians like Chafee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In politics there is a premium on finding issues that divide  
us because divisiveness is a vote-getter,'' said Danforth. ``John 
Chafee bound us together. That's why he was universally respected 
in the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was a former secretary of the U.S. Navy, governor of  
Rhode Island for six years, and before that a member of the Rhode 
Island Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, he spearheaded efforts to protect the environment  
and expand health care and child care. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the senator's sons, Zechariah Chafee, recounted his  
father's life -- as a champion wrestler at Yale, a Marine who fought 
at Guadalcanal and in the Korean War, his six years in the Rhode 
Island Legislature, six years as Rhode Island governor, and then 23 
years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was age 8, he saved a friend from drowning after the pal  
had fallen through ice on a frozen pond. That friend, Bruce 
Sundlun, grew up to become a Rhode Island governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a man, what a life,'' Zechariah Chafee, an assistant U.S.  
attorney, told the mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	One of John Chafee's other sons -- Warwick Mayor Lincoln Chafee --  
is a candidate for his father's seat in the Senate.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KATO, Japan (AP) -- Ryoken Kawagishi made four consecutive birdie  
putts in a bogey-free round of 6-under-par 66 Saturday that gave 
him a one-stroke lead after 54 holes of the $1.9 million Philip 
Morris Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawagishi, pursuing his first victory on the Japanese tour since  
1995, birdied the second hole then began a rampage on the par-5 
fourth at the 7,176-yard ABC Golf Club. He finished the third round 
14 under at 202. 
</P>
<P>
	One shot behind Kawagishi entering the final 18 holes Sunday is  
second-round leader Katsunori Kuwabara, who had a 69 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaname Yokoo and Myanmar's Zaw Moe were at 205. Yokoo had a 67  
Saturday, and Moe carded a 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, seeking his fourth win this year, had a

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A son of NAACP President Kweisi Mfume could  
face up to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to drug 
conspiracy and weapons charges and admitting he sold cocaine for 
more than two years in the nation's capital.

	Ronald T. Gray, 29, entered the plea Thursday in U.S. District  
Court here to a grand jury indictment charging him with three

<HEADLINE> No. 11 Wisc. 35, Northwestern 19 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Although Wisconsin rolled to another win,  
Northwestern at least forced Ron Dayne to work for four quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne rushed for 162 yards and two touchdowns, and Jamar  
Fletcher returned an interception 93 yards for a score as No. 11 
Wisconsin struggled before beating Northwestern 35-19 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin (7-2, 5-1 Big Ten) won its fifth straight game and  
remained directly behind unbeaten No. 2 Penn State in the 
conference race. The Badgers made two key interceptions that helped 
cover up a poor defensive performance, and the Wildcats (3-5, 1-4) 
hung in gamely before the Badgers' rushing attack wore them down. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne, who played the entire game for the first time in four  
weeks, needs 321 yards in Wisconsin's final two games against 
Purdue and Iowa to break Ricky Williams' major-college career 
rushing record. He is 124 yards from passing Tony Dorsett for 
second place on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	On a gorgeous day at Ryan Field -- which was about two-thirds  
full of Wisconsin fans -- Dayne's 5-yard touchdown run early in the 
fourth quarter put the game away. It was the 68th TD of his career, 
tying him with Indiana's Anthony Thompson for the Big Ten career 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers' offensive line, so impressive over the last month,  
struggled against Northwestern's defense. Wisconsin freshman 
quarterback Brooks Bollinger, who improved to 5-0 as a starter, 
rushed for one touchdown and threw for another. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern outgained the Badgers 213-193 through the first  
three quarters and did a solid job containing Dayne and his line. 
But the Wildcats threw two disastrous interceptions and committed 
too many penalties, allowing Wisconsin to win handily, if not 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne had 81 rushing yards in the first quarter, including 24 on  
a touchdown run through a huge hole opened by his offensive line. 
Dayne sprinted untouched into the end zone to make the score 14-0, 
but after that run, Northwestern's defense began to find holes in 
the Badgers' massive offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern had its only scoring chance of the first half when  
it capitalized on a partially blocked Wisconsin punt and drove to 
the Badgers' 6 in the final minute, but Mike Echols intercepted Zak 
Kustok's pass into double coverage in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne committed a rare fumble -- just the ninth of his entire  
career -- on the first play of the second half, and Tim Long's 
22-yard field goal cut the Badgers' lead to 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats were driving again when Fletcher intercepted a  
tipped pass at his own 7, ran 50 yards up the left sideline, 
reversed field and ran for the opposite corner of the end zone. 
With five yards to go, Fletcher threw a wicked shoulder shake at 
the last Northwestern tackler and pranced into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher, a sophomore, has already returned four interceptions  
for touchdowns in his career, tying the Big Ten record. He picked 
off two passes in the Badgers' win over Michigan State last week 
and has five on the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne's second touchdown made the score 28-3 with 11 minutes to  
play. Northwestern made a quick touchdown drive capped by Damien 
Anderson's 8-yard TD run with 6:51 to play, but an onsides kick 
failed and Bollinger hit Chris Chambers with a 24-yard touchdown 
pass with 4:35 left to make it 35-11. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern added a final touchdown, capping an 80-yard drive  
with Ian Miller's 1-yard TD reception with 43 seconds left. The 
Wildcats were successful on a two 2-point conversions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin left tackle Chris McIntosh started his 47th game for  
the Badgers, breaking the school record for starts.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Ship Move Abandoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Rough seas from the fall's first major  
storm have postponed efforts to remove the beached stern section of 
the freighter New Carissa until spring, a salvage official says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gonna sit for the winter,'' said Joseph Coyne, onshore  
operations manager for Donjon Marine Co. Inc. of Hillside, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews had tried for the past three weeks to beat the coming  
winter and pull the 120-foot stern section off the sand using 
towlines and two powerful tugs. Last week, the rusting hulk was 
turned toward the sea, and by Monday it had been moved some 225 
feet toward the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lines had to be cut Tuesday when the storm lashed the  
coast with heavy rains and wind gusts of more than 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather is what halted the towing operation, and they  
can't do anything else with it in the winter,'' said Melinda 
Merrill, a spokeswoman for Donjon Marine and another salvage 
company, Fred Devine Diving &AMP; Salvage of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 639-foot ship drifted aground Feb. 4 while anchored during a  
storm waiting to enter Coos Bay to pick up a load of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	After it was set afire with napalm to burn off as much heavy  
fuel oil as possible, the ship broke in two. About 70,000 gallons 
of oil leaked out, soiling beaches and killing several snowy 
plovers, a threatened shore bird. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger bow section was towed out to sea and, after it broke  
loose from a tug and drifted ashore 80 miles north in Waldport, it 
was towed away again and sunk with a torpedo fired by a Navy 
submarine.

<HEADLINE> Akamai Shares Soar in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares in Internet technology company Akamai  
Technologies Inc. surged more than 450 percent in initial trading, 
the fourth-best IPO ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai closed Friday at $145.18 3/4 on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market after it was initially priced at $26 a 
share and opened at $110. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock's 458 percent increase from its initial price ranks it  
fourth, behind theglobe.com (606 percent), Foundry Networks (525 
percent) and Marketwatch.com (474 percent), financial market 
researcher Securities Data Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamai sold 9 million shares to raise more than $1.3 billion.  
Its closing share price gave it a stunning market value of more 
than $13 billion -- even though Akamai had sales of just $1.3 
million and lost $28.3 million in the first nine months of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamai (pronounced AH-kuh-my) is Hawaiian for intelligent,  
clever and cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Formed last year, it offers Yahoo! and other Web destinations a  
service that delivers the most image-intensive portions of their 
Web pages -- such as advertisements with colorful moving images -- 
through a speedier route than the public Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The service answers a common complaint that graphic-intensive  
Web pages take too long to download and can cause computers to 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the Akamai service is ``immense,'' said Ullas Naik,  
an analyst with FAC EquitiesFirst Albany, a Boston-based investment 
firm. ``It's going to keep growing significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To provide the service, Akamai owns a global network of 1,475  
computer servers and rents space on them to Web companies such as 
Yahoo! These Web destinations use the servers to store graphic-rich 
information closer to Internet users' computers, circumventing part 
of the crowded public information highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akamai technology is based on the initial work of F. Thomas  
Leighton, a math professor at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, and one of his students, Danny Lewin. 
</P>
<P>
	Leighton is Amakai's chief scientist. The company's chief  
executive, George H. Conrades, was a senior vice president of 
International Business Machines Corp. and president of Internet 
pioneer BBN Corp., which he sold to GTE Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with investments in Akamai include Apple Computer  
Inc., network equipment supplier Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft 
Corp.

<HEADLINE> Reds Acquire Bichette From Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Faced with the loss of cleanup hitter Greg  
Vaughn to free agency, the Cincinnati Reds acquired left fielder 
Dante Bichette from the Colorado Rockies on Saturday for Jeffrey 
Hammonds and Stan Belinda. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies also sent the Reds $1.9 million to make up the  
difference in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Bichette hit 34 homers and drove in 133 runs for  
the Rockies last season. The Reds are counting on him to replace 
Vaughn, who hit 45 homers and drove in 118 runs but is unaffordable 
as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammonds was a backup outfielder last season and Belinda was a  
middle reliever after coming back from a diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette, one of the original Rockies, was the franchise's  
career leader in hits and runs. His trade marks the latest major 
change for the franchise, which had general manager Bob Gebhard 
retire last August and manager Jim Leyland retire following a 72-90 
season, the second-worst in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds are coming off a 96-win season for which Vaughn was  
largely responsible both as a clubhouse leader and in that he 
carried the team in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds missed out on the playoffs by losing a one-game  
tiebreaker for the NL wild card to the New York Mets and were 
determined to get another proven cleanup hitter. Vaughn filed for 
free agency last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Bowden thinks Bichette, who hits for higher  
average and strikes out less than Vaughn, can fill his role. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a notch below Greg defensively, but he's adequate,''  
Bowden said. ``He's a better hitter than Greg Vaughn. Greg Vaughn 
has a little more power. They both produce runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds began talking to the Rockies about Bichette last season  
and at one point were working on a five-player deal, Bowden said. 
The last snag was the money: The Reds had a $35 million payroll 
last season and aren't expected to increase it substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Vaughn out of the picture. Initial talks with his  
agent indicated he was looking for a huge pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was looking for four or five years in the $10 million to  
$12 million range (per year),'' Bowden said. ``We're not able to do 
that financially.''

	Tavarez spent much of the past season on the disabled list with

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' Rison Arrested for Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Andre  
Rison was one of six people arrested Saturday for fighting outside 
a Kansas City nightspot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were called at about 2 a.m. to a disturbance outside  
the Have A Nice Day Cafe in the city's Westport entertainment 
district, police spokesman Floyd Mitchell said. Security guards 
detained several people before police made the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said the six were taken to policheadquarters and booked  
for disorderly conduct by fighting in public. No further details 
were released. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief spokesman Bob Moore said he had no information about the  
incident. He said it would be a personal matter involving an 
individual, not the team, and that the Chiefs' policy is not to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk about these issues,'' Moore said. ``Let the  
legal system run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rison, 32, signed with the Chiefs as a free agent in 1997, after  
being released by the Green Bay Packers. He played earlier for 
Jacksonville, Cleveland, Atlanta and Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rison, a five-time Pro Bowler, has not been a factor for the  
Chiefs this season, with only seven catches for 75 yards and no 
touchdowns. He caught 112 passes in his first season with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hampered with a hamstring injury last season, but started  
13 games and had 40 catches. 
</P>
<P>
	Rison could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Woman Saves Stranger's Life -- Twice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONDOVI, Wis. (AP) -- Long before they ever met, Elly saved  
Rhonda's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Elly's name had been on a national bone marrow donor list for  
two years when the Red Cross called. A 24-year-old woman was 
desperately ill with leukemia. Would she come in for a blood test? 
</P>
<P>
	Elly might be the one person among millions who could help this  
stranger. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, she would try.  
</P>
<P>
	Then the blood test results came back: She was a nearly perfect  
match. 
</P>
<P>
	Elly had her bone marrow extracted, and checked periodically on  
the progress of the woman, who had been given just a 1-in-5 chance 
of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the two women were barred from knowing each other's  
identity for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Elly Bertrand, the donor, and Rhonda Dietze Jensen,  
the recipient who beat the odds, became acquainted. It turned out 
that among the 3.7 million people on the bone marrow donor list, 
some of them continents away, these two women were practically 
neighbors: They lived 77 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	They wrote one another, called, met and became friends.  
</P>
<P>
	Five years passed, and Rhonda was sick again; her kidneys were  
failing. 
</P>
<P>
	The best option: a transplant.  
</P>
<P>
	The best donor candidate: Elly.  
</P>
<P>
	But Elly had already made one sacrifice. This surgery was more  
complicated, the recovery much longer. There were her three young 
sons to consider. What if something went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
	Rhonda didn't think she could dare approach her.  
</P>
<P>
	``How,'' she says, ``do you ask a person to save your life  
twice?'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Truth is, Elly had tried once before to be a Good Samaritan.  
</P>
<P>
	It was a baby boy who needed a marrow transplant she had read  
about in her local newspaper. Elly thought of her sons. And when 
she saw a photo of the baby with his deep blue eyes, she couldn't 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
	But she wasn't a match. Two years later, when the call came,  
Elly didn't hesitate. ``If I have good health, I might as well 
share it,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother was terrified. Co-workers said she was foolish, even  
crazy. A long needle stuck into your bone? For a mother, a husband, 
a child -- of course. 
</P>
<P>
	But a stranger?  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody told me they suck the bone marrow out of your spine,  
and you're going to be paralyzed,'' Elly remembers in her husky 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't deterred by those falsehoods, though she confesses  
that a photo of the needle and syringe made her flinch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Elly has always been stubborn, even as a child when she  
defied her mother's orders, and rode her favorite cow around their 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family pretty much knows if I'm going to do something,  
nothing will stop me,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father-in-law, Jim Bertrand, concurs. ``Once she's made up  
her mind,'' he says with a laugh, ``it's like laying up a brick 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So on a March day in 1994, Elly entered a Minneapolis hospital,  
two incisions were made into the back side of her pelvic area and 
marrow was extracted from her pelvic bones; it is a tedious 
process, with the substance sucked out almost by teaspoonful, until 
about a liter is drawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Three hundred miles away, a weak, pale, but hopeful Rhonda  
waited in her hospital bed in Milwaukee. She knew that was THE day. 
She eyed the clock, she wondered about the mysterious donor. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't know it then, but Elly, 35, and Rhonda, 30, had much  
in common, from their fresh-scrubbed looks and farm roots to their 
plainspoken ways. Both also are shy, preferring the sidelines to 
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, of course, one big difference: Elly was hearty enough  
to work two physical jobs; Rhonda was struggling to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of chemotherapy for her leukemia, Rhonda's doctors  
had suggested a marrow transplant. But there were no good matches 
among about a dozen relatives tested, including three siblings. The 
donor list was next. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Rhonda's chances of survival were just 20 percent. But  
she refused to be discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one person has made it in my situation, then I'll be the  
second,'' she told herself. ``As long as it's not zero percent, you 
think you'll be the one.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A cooler with a bag of flesh-colored liquid arrived in Rhonda's  
hospital room at 12:10 a.m. Her family took pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	This was, after all, a momentous delivery -- the promise of life  
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks, Rhonda's white blood count rose. But complications  
followed: Fluid built up in the sac around her heart. She had 
double vision, blood in her urine. She threw up almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	And the grafted bone marrow cells started attacking her body;  
medication to stop that blocked the blood flow to her hip bones and 
Rhonda needed surgery to replace both hips. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rhonda was lucky. She says she was one of just three  
survivors among more than 20 bone marrow recipients she had seen 
come and go from the Milwaukee hospital within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	At her one-year checkup, Rhonda was handed an envelope  
containing a piece of paper with Elly's name, address and phone. 
She was shocked to discover her donor lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	All those months, Elly had been itching to meet Rhonda.  
</P>
<P>
	But now that she knew her donor's name, Rhonda wondered what she  
would say. ``Thank you'' is for a birthday gift or flowers. But for 
saving a life, it just doesn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither woman remembers who made the first move, but they began  
exchanging letters, snapshots and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered they enjoyed the same things: the fragrance of  
lilacs, the calm of camping under the stars, the company of cats 
and dogs, the comfort of Sundays in church. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more alike than we thought we would be,'' Rhonda says.  
``We both have faith in God that he'll lead us in the right 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took Rhonda's sister, Brenda McKay, to unite the two women.  
When she planned Rhonda's bridal shower, she knew there would be 
the typical toasters and blenders, so she arranged a special gift: 
Elly. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, Elly attended Rhonda's wedding; she received a  
standing ovation when the pastor called her to the bridal table to 
salute her -- attention that still makes her wince with 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	As the friendship deepened, Rhonda's health worsened.  
</P>
<P>
	Radiation she needed before her transplant had scarred her  
kidneys. At first, they worked at 30 percent of normal, then 20 
percent, then 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Something had to be done. Dialysis was a possibility. But a  
kidney transplant offered better prospects for long-term survival. 
Two family members were tested. But there was a better candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the woman who was Rhonda's genetic twin.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	After Rhonda told her kidney transplant doctor she knew her  
marrow donor, the next question was obvious: 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think you'd consider asking her?''  
</P>
<P>
	``No way!'' Rhonda replied.  
</P>
<P>
	She smiles and her cheeks flush as she recalls that conversation  
and jokes that she feared Elly might say: ``What do you want next? 
My arm?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there were serious reasons for reservations: A kidney  
transplant is major surgery, far more invasive than extracting bone 
marrow. It is a four- to five-hour operation with a six-week 
recovery. It can leave a foot-long scar. 
</P>
<P>
	And while thousands of people donate bone marrow to strangers,  
live kidney donations to non-family members are very unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	But after consulting with family and Helen Nelson, transplant  
coordinator at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, 
Rhonda decided she had to ask. The only question was how. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided against a personal visit, thinking it would put too  
much pressure on Elly for an immediate answer. ``All I wanted to do 
was inform her ... give her a chance to think about it, talk about 
it, pray about it, make her decision,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Rhonda four months to craft a five-page letter. Nowhere  
in it did she directly ask for a kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been praying about how to go about telling you,'' she  
wrote Elly. ``I feel bad pressuring you with my situation when you 
already have done so much for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is a lot to digest and that you will need time  
with your family. ... But I felt that for my own peace of mind I 
had to at least ... give you the option to decide if this would be 
something you would be willing to consider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She pasted a sticker at the bottom of the letter that read:  
``Nothing sweeter than a friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elly already had heard from Rhonda's sister about her kidney  
problems; no one mentioned a transplant, but Elly had her 
suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew her immune system was mine now,'' Elly says, ``and I  
was probably her best bet, but I kind of dismissed that thought. I 
didn't want to think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after receiving Rhonda's letter, Elly called the hospital  
transplant coordinator that same day, requesting information. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nelson urged Elly not to rush into a decision -- especially  
considering her family and her job, milking cows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking away one of your kidneys,'' she cautioned. ``You  
work on a farm, You could fall off a ladder. ... You have three 
young kids. This is nothing you drop everything to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elly consulted with friends and family. She was thrilled when  
her husband, Randy, who had two relatives undergo kidney 
transplants, didn't try to dissuade her. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a big decision,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But some of her five siblings objected, peppering her with tough  
questions: What if your other kidney fails? What if a brother or 
sister needs one? What if one of your sons needs one? 
</P>
<P>
	``I could `what if' myself until I'm blue in the face,'' she  
told Ms. Nelson. ``You can't live today wondering what's going to 
happen tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 11, to mark the five-year anniversary of the bone  
marrow transplant, Elly sent Rhonda a vase of silk lilacs with a 
note: ``I've kind of made my decision but my family's against it. 
Pray for them to go my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhonda burst into tears reading the note, but tried not to get  
her hopes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Elly underwent extensive tests, including a physical and a  
psychological exam. 
</P>
<P>
	After she passed, she called Rhonda and asked: ``Are you busy on  
May 5?'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The night before surgery, Helen Nelson gave Elly a ``Precious  
Moments'' figurine of an angel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get to meet many people like her in my job,'' she  
says. ``She just felt this was something she was put on this earth 
to do. She made a huge impact on me. I just get teared up thinking 
about her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That same night, Rhonda, was nervous. Elly, the bone marrow  
donor, had been a stranger. Elly, the kidney donor, was a friend. 
``I knew who I was putting through the misery,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was successful; six hours after Elly returned to her  
room, she was walking -- a necessary regimen to prevent 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Within five days, she was home. Six weeks later, Elly was back  
in the barn, milking cows, kneeling more and bending less. She also 
works a second job, making trusses in a factory. 
</P>
<P>
	And she rejects any suggestions that her good deed was heroic.  
</P>
<P>
	``It made me feel worthwhile,'' she says with a shrug. ``I guess  
I just like to help people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Rhonda and her family feel otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
	``We always let her know she's special,'' says Rhonda's sister,  
Mrs. McKay, who brought her casseroles during her recuperation. 
``But you can't repay her. How many times can you say `thank you' 
for giving this great gift of life to our family?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhonda, who is a teacher, has tried. She has called, sent cards  
and letters. ``I think she knows the way I feel,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhonda pauses for a moment, then turns toward Elly, and quietly  
adds: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just thankful that God made someone that's this kind of  
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their bond, she adds, will last all their lives.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's a part of me.''

<HEADLINE> US Companies Stuck in Money Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big U.S. corporations are becoming entangled  
in complex schemes in which Colombian drug cartels use legitimate 
international trade to launder an estimated $5 billion a year in 
illicit profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities are warning company officials to  
watch for signs they may be receiving drug money in payment for 
legal goods they make and export. U.S. Customs Service employees 
are training companies how to detect and avoid the schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly signed an  
information-sharing agreement with his Colombian counterpart 
designed to aid investigations of drug trafficking and the 
money-laundering schemes, which use a process known as the 
black-market peso exchange system. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a sophisticated variation on the basic process of money  
laundering, in which illicit profits from criminal activities are 
moved through a series of bank accounts to make them appear to be 
legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-market peso exchange, which involves purchase of U.S.  
products -- notably home appliances, consumer electronics and 
cigarettes -- for export to Colombia, is the biggest, most efficient 
money-laundering system in the Western Hemisphere, government 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect system,'' Kelly said in a recent interview.  
``It ostensibly looks like a legitimate business deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian peso brokers, who act as middlemen in the scheme, give  
Colombian importers IOUs in exchange for pesos. The pesos are used 
to buy U.S. dollars from drug cartels, providing the cartels with 
clean, usable currency. Then, the brokers use the dollars to buy 
U.S. goods and smuggle them into Colombia on behalf of the 
importers, who thereby avoid high government tariffs and taxes on 
foreign currency exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-year undercover investigation by Customs agents into a  
scheme by the Mateus group of Colombia culminated in July with 
indictments against 34 people in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, New 
Jersey, New York and Texas; seizure of 1,160 pounds of cocaine and 
$4.5 million in cash; and freezing of 65 bank accounts around the 
United States that allegedly were used to launder drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 34 have agreed to plead guilty, but are still due  
in court, along with the other defendants, on Nov. 8 in federal 
court in Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is a prime example of major U.S. corporations getting  
entangled in the money-laundering web, Customs officials say. As 
part of the drug scheme, members of the Colombian group allegedly 
ordered money to be wired to accounts in the names of Bell 
Helicopter Textron Inc., Intel Corp., Microdata Solutions Corp. and 
MicroTel International Inc., among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cox, a spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron in Fort Worth,  
Texas, said the company did nothing wrong: ``We are as much a 
victim here as anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Clara, Calif., Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy had no  
comment on the matter. There is no listing for Microdata Solutions 
in the Tampa, Fla., area, where authorities said the company is 
headquartered, and law enforcement officials did not have a contact 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	MicroTel's chief financial officer, Randolph Foote, said his  
Ontario, Calif.-based company ``has absolutely no knowledge of 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working undercover and posing as money launderers, Customs  
agents followed the Colombians' instructions and wired drug money 
to the companies' accounts, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that any of the U.S. companies did wrong or  
should have known about the money's illicit origins. But the case 
provides an intriguing possible parallel with a huge alleged 
money-laundering scheme involving the Bank of New York, in which 
Russian companies and individuals -- including organized-crime 
figures -- are suspected of funneling billions of dollars through 
the big U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian and Russian cases are unrelated.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in New York have charged a former vice  
president of the bank, her husband and a Russian business associate 
with conspiring to transmit $7 billion illegally from Russia 
through the bank. The three have denied wrongdoing. The Bank of New 
York, which has been cooperating in the investigation, was not 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe part of the money channeled through the  
Bank of New York could have come from thousands of small- to 
medium-sized Russian businesses that spirited funds through 
offshore companies to avoid huge taxes. The illegal practice is 
widespread in Russia, where taxes are punitive, rules often change 
and tax officials say as many as 99 percent of businesses skirt 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, in Colombia, the black-market peso exchange system is  
used by drug gangs to evade the country's import and foreign 
currency laws and tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bank of New York case, several well-known corporations,  
including General Electric Co., Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc., 
Nestle SA, Volkswagen AG and DaimlerChrysler AG, received money 
wired from Bank of New York accounts that are under investigation, 
according to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts in question were owned by a small company called  
Benex International Co. Inc. of New York, which acted as a transfer 
service for Russian importers in an apparent attempt to avoid 
Russian taxes and import duties. Benex and its Russian owner were 
named as defendants in the federal indictment. The owner, who now 
lives in London, is married to the former Bank of New York vice 
president, who also was charged.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Skaters Win at Sprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- China's Yang Yang sprinted past Canada's  
Annie Perrault on the second lap and went on to win Saturday's 
women's 500-meter race at the short-track speed skating World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrault, the Olympic gold medalist in 1998, took the lead  
quickly but couldn't hold off Yang. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrault won the 500 in a World Cup meet in Montreal last week  
only to be disqualified for stretching -- lifting a skate off the 
ice in an effort to edge an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I finished second,'' Perrault said. ``It was nice for me.  
It was a very clean race. I started in front, but she passed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yang was clocked in 45.305 seconds, while Perrault came in at  
45.474. 
</P>
<P>
	Chikage Tanaka of Japan was third at 45.522 and Dandan Sun of  
China fourth in 45.755. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaijun Li of China won the men's 500-meter sprint at Provo's  
Peaks Ice Arena in 42.772. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arena will play host to some Olympic hockey games in  
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Dong-Sung Kim of Korea was second in 42.940, narrowly edging  
Apolo Ohno of the United States, who was clocked in 42.944, while 
Takehiro Kodera of Japan was fourth in 43.545. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges advanced Ohno, the 17-year-old world junior champion,  
into the final after he was fouled in a semifinal race. Takafumi 
Nishitani of Japan, the reigning Olympic champion, was charged with 
the infraction and disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Starting From Scratch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Since he was struck by a van last June, Stephen  
King says he has had to start from scratch as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this one awful minute when I sat there and I  
thought, 'I can't do this. I don't know how to do this anymore,'' 
King said in an interview with NBC's Katie Couric to be aired 
Monday. Excerpts were released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 52, of Bangor, Maine, has had multiple surgeries and faces  
a long rehabilitation. He was hit by the van while walking along a 
country road. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview suggests King has had much more difficulty writing  
than was previously revealed. In late July, he said he had begun 
writing an hour-and-a-half a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first it was as if I'd never done this in my life,'' he  
said. ``It was like starting over again from square one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, King said he is just happy to be alive.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that to still be able to walk and talk and  
occasionally crawl on my belly like a reptile has made me intensely 
grateful to be alive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Hire Baylor To Manage Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Baylor has been hired to manage the Chicago  
Cubs, taking over an injury-plagued team that went from the 
playoffs to last place. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, the hitting coach of the Atlanta Braves last season  
after six years as manager of the Colorado Rockies, had been 
courted by several major league teams, including the Anaheim Angels 
and Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no announcement by the Cubs, his hiring was  
confirmed to The Associated Press by a senior major league team 
official who spoke on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which  
reported in its Sunday editions that Baylor had agreed to a 
four-year deal averaging $1.3 million and that the hiring will be 
announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Sun-Times reached Baylor at his California home on  
Saturday and he confirmed the move. The Sun-Times said the 
announcement wouldn't be made until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor managed the Rockies to the playoffs in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	``The stability of the Cubs, and Wrigley Field won me over,''  
Baylor was quoted as saying by the Journal-Constitution. ``It's a 
great move for me to make. I've been in the league now for six 
years as a manager and as a coach. I know the league now. In the 
American League, I don't know as much, watching the slugfests over 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor played his entire 19-year major league career in the AL.  
He spent six years with the Angels, winning the MVP award in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs fired Jim Riggleman after finishing last in the NL  
Central with the third-worst record in baseball (67-95), ahead of 
only the Florida Marlins (64-98) and Minnesota Twins (63-97). 
Chicago qualified for the playoffs in 1998 as the wild card team, 
where they were swept by the Braves in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	His hiring also increases the number of minority managers as  
Baylor, who is black, joins Felipe Alou of the Montreal Expos, 
Dusty Baker of the San Francisco Giants and Jerry Manuel of the 
Chicago White Sox. He will be the first black to manage the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been criticized by some for not hiring more  
minority executives.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bradley Gaining on Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley is trailing Vice President Al  
Gore but has cut the margin, in the Democratic presidential race, 
says a poll released Saturday. The margin between Gore and Bradley 
has fluctuated in polls in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Newsweek poll suggests Gore favored by 40 percent of  
registered Democrats or those who lean toward voting Democratic, 
while Bradley was the favorite of 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-percentage-point lead represents a drop from the vice  
president's 49-26 margin in the same poll a week ago. Bradley had 
cut the gap to 12 points in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll early 
this month, but Gore doubled his lead in that poll earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newsweek poll also suggests Pat Buchanan's entry into the  
Reform Party could lure Republican voters away from GOP candidates, 
including top contender George W. Bush. The Texas governor, 
however, continues to hold a big lead, 63 percent to 12 percent for 
Arizona Sen. John McCain and 9 percent for publisher Steve Forbes 
in the race for the GOP nomination. Other candidates were in low 
single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-way race among Gore, Bush and Pat Buchanan, the poll  
found Bush favored by 46 percent of voters, Gore 39 percent and 
Buchanan 7 percent. In a Bush-Bradley-Buchanan race, Bush got the 
nod from 43 percent, Bradley 38 percent and Buchanan 8 percent. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bocelli Makes American Opera Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *AN AP ENTERTAINMENT REVIEW   	
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli stepped from  
the confines of pop music to the grand stage of opera this weekend, 
singing the lead in Massenet's ``Werther'' at the Detroit Opera 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	His silky voice leading the way, Bocelli courted music critics  
and aficionados of fine arts in his much anticipated North American 
opera debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clad largely in evening gowns and suits, those who came to  
listen appeared receptive, applauding the moment Bocelli took the 
stage Friday night astride a white horse, opposite mezzo-soprano 
Denyce Graves. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli had the romantic title role, hoping to swoon a score of  
critics who were at the opera house to judge whether the 
best-selling singer who made his name in pop could carry the day in 
live opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviews were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	After initially voicing doubts about Bocelli's capacity to  
maintain his sound and amplitude, Opera Magazine's Michael H. 
Margolin said Bocelli's performance improved as it went along. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time for him working on a stage like this,''  
Margolin said. ``I think the man should be given a medal of bravery 
for just doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just seven months ago, Bocelli himself questioned aloud whether  
he could, saying at the time that he didn't feel ``credible enough 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have to suffer a little while longer,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was younger, if I had shown up to audition in an opera  
house, they would have suggested I check into a lunatic asylum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli has said that if opera proved a comfortable fit, he  
wouldn't mind forsaking his pop career. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer, who was blinded by a soccer injury at age 12, has  
made inroads, evident in works that last week held the top two 
spots on classical's Top 10 charts: ``Aria-The Opera Album'' and 
``Viaggio Italiano.'' Both albums have been certified gold, which 
means at least 500,000 copies of each have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The international chart-topper has sold millions of pop and  
classical records, was nominated in January for a Grammy for best 
new artist and has performed for President Clinton and Pope John 
Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	His albums include opera arias, though his smooth-sounding  
ballads have some believing he's more akin to pop diva Celine Dion, 
with whom he has performed a duet, than the acclaimed Three Tenors. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Bocelli took on a full-length role, he starred as  
Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's ``La Boheme'' in a production on the 
Italian island of Sardinia. In ``Werther,'' he sang the title role 
in the tragic opera about a man who kills himself after the woman 
he loves marries another. The opera is based on a 1774 novel by 
Goethe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Opera performed a new production of ``Werther,''  
directed by Mario Coraddi. The set was rented from the San Diego 
Opera Company. Christopher Schaldenbrand sang the role of Albert 
and Ying Huang was Sophie. 
</P>
<P>
	About 96 percent of the tickets have been snapped up for  
Bocelli's six planned performances here through Nov. 14. Tickets 
range from $50 to $250, dwarfing the typical price at the Detroit 
Opera House of $18 to $98.

<HEADLINE> No. 5 Florida 30, No. 10 Georgia 14 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Steve Spurrier did his Vince Dooley  
impression Saturday. It worked, and Spurrier earned his 100th 
victory as Florida's coach in the most fitting way possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the 30-14 win come against Georgia, the team he  
loves to beat most, but it came in the same manner the Bulldogs 
used to stick it to the Gators for all those years. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind a defense that shut out No. 10 Georgia (6-2, 4-2  
Southeastern Conference) in the second half and an offense more 
suited to the ground than the Fun 'N Gun, the fifth-ranked Gators 
won their ninth of the last 10 in this series and took control of 
the SEC East. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Gators (7-1, 5-1) beat Vanderbilt next Saturday and South  
Carolina the following week, they'll go back to the SEC title game 
for the first time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, they'll celebrate a victory in one of the nation's  
most storied rivalries, best known as ``The World's Largest Outdoor 
Cocktail Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's version was a watered-down affair, a game bogged  
down by steady rain in the first half, sputtering offense in the 
second, and silly penalties and a number of stalled drives the 
whole way through. 
</P>
<P>
	It was entertaining nonetheless, with a pair of defenses being  
pushed to their limits time and again and Florida's coming out 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in the second half, Georgia took over inside the Florida  
40 trailing 16-14. Both times, the Gators refused to budge. On the 
second drive, Keith Kelsey forced a fumble by Jasper Sanks at the 
Florida 10 and Bennie Alexander recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida gained the field-position advantage on the next drive,  
then struck one possession later, when Bo Carroll burst through the 
right side for a 30-yard touchdown and a 23-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	On Georgia's next drive, Alex Brown forced another turnover at  
the Georgia 2. Doug Johnson ran in on the next play and a game that 
had been much closer was suddenly out of hand. Brown also had an 
interception on Georgia's final drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll finished with 113 yards on 13 carries and accounted for  
most of the offense in the second half. Despite Spurrier's threats 
to the contrary, Johnson lasted the entire game. He threw for all 
of his 234 yards in the first half, however, as the game turned 
into a defensive struggle, more reminiscent of 1969 than 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators shut down Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter, holding  
him to 6-for-23 passing for just 76 yards. He had more success 
running, especially in the first half, when he sliced through the 
Florida defense on a pair of option plays for two scores and a 
14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida regained the lead on a 10-play, 72-yard march for a  
16-14 lead late in the first half. From there, the defense took 
over, as Florida allowed only 14 first downs and 231 yards in 
offense, just 53 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost somewhere in that effort, Florida's Darrell Jackson caught  
six passes for 141 yards, his sixth straight 100-yard receiving 
game, which ties Carlos Alvarez for the school record.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's becoming a fall tradition: The New York  
Yankees winning the World Series and being rewarded with a parade 
along Manhattan's Canyon of Heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This stuff never gets old,'' Yankee manager Joe Torre said at  
a City Hall event following the parade Friday. ``This one seemed 
even better. I think you appreciate it more each time you do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of New York Yankees fans lined the road for the team's  
third ticker tape parade in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making this a yearly tradition!'' shouted Charlie Hine,  
a UPS employee from Connecticut who took off from work for the 
second straight year to cheer his team. ``We'll be back next 
year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir generously estimated the crowd  
at 3.6 million, topping the crowds for the 1996 and 1998 parades. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, with their four-game sweep of the Atlanta  
Braves, the Yankees established themselves as the team with the 
most World Series championships in the 1990s. It was the 
franchise's 25th world title -- dwarfing the runnerup St. Louis 
Cardinals' nine titles -- leading many to call the Bronx Bombers the 
team of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, riding on the upper level of  
a double-decker bus, cheerfully celebrated the sweep by waving a 
broom. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran designated hitter Chili Davis puffed on a victory cigar,  
while oft-suspended Darryl Strawberry -- who later broke down in 
tears while speaking at City Hall -- videotaped the madly-cheering, 
face-painted crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	World Series MVP Mariano Rivera, the unhittable reliever, had a  
float all to himself. Yogi Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher, paraded 
in a vintage car. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five minutes before the parade's noon start, fans were  
lined six- and seven-deep on the sidewalks along the financial 
district's narrow streets. Many revelers along the parade route, 
which runs less than a mile from the Battery to City Hall, never 
got to see the actual parade. 
</P>
<P>
	At its height, the crowd around City Hall, where each Yankees  
player was given a key to the city, stretched several blocks to the 
Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Grimsley and her friend JoAnna DelVecchio, both 16,  
donned their Derek Jeter jerseys and ditched school for the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he notices us. I would like to marry him one day.''  
Grimsley said of the Yankee shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, he's going to marry me!'' shouted DelVecchio as they both  
started laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't the only students taking the day off. High school  
attendance was down about 17 percent from an average day, the Board 
of Education said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were six arrests during the parade. One man was accused of  
igniting small fire in the ankle-deep paper along the street. A 
woman was charged with indecent exposure for appearing topless on a 
balcony above the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Young, a spokesperson for the Department of Sanitation,  
estimated that 50 tons of refuse might have been collected along 
the route, compared to 43.9 tons at last year's Yankee parade. She 
added that the exact number would not be known until the refuse was 
weighed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the City Hall ceremony, Yankee Stadium organist Eddie  
Layton played, and country musician Clint Black performed a song 
with specially written lyrics honoring the champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher David Cone, a potential free agent after this season,  
was serenaded was a chant of ``One more year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How about two more years?'' Cone asked.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's administration was less gracious toward Democratic  
state assembly members who voted to repeal New York's commuter tax 
-- a move that cost the city an estimated $210 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said the invitations were rescinded to  
send a message: Don't vote against the city's interests. 
Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Yankees fan from upstate, said he took 
away this message: ``He puts the rude in Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Yankees fans clearly enjoyed the day, some already were  
thinking about next season. One man walking along the parade route 
held up a simple handwritten sign that read: 
</P>
<P>
	``Cheer up. Only 103 days to pitchers and catchers.''

<HEADLINE> Macedonian Divisions At Crossroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TETOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- It may be banned, but for Nexhmedin  
Lika, the Albanian-language university in this western Macedonian 
town is very much a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We study here in our own language,'' the 22-year-old Albanian  
student said. ``The Macedonian state will have to accept that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clandestine university is one of many signs of the ethnic  
divisions in this impoverished country of 2 million, where voters 
will choose a new, largely ceremonial president on Sunday from 
among six candidates, including two ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic divisions in Macedonia, the only former Yugoslav republic  
to have been spared war, have widened after the conflict in 
neighboring Kosovo, where 78 days of NATO bombing forced Serb 
troops and police to withdraw and turn the province over to NATO 
and the United Nations in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of Serbian rule over Kosovo's ethnic Albanians has  
encouraged Macedonia's ethnic Albanians -- estimated at 25 percent 
of the population -- to push for more rights from the Slavic 
majority, including the right to use Albanian flags, symbols and 
language in western Macedonia where they form a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	``A crisis like the one in Kosovo always revives existing  
problems,'' Arben Xhaferi, an ethnic Albanian leader, warned in an 
interview with The Associated Press. ``An ethnic uneasiness can 
reach monstrous dimensions. So far, we have managed to avoid any 
clashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia's government, however, is reluctant to meet the ethnic  
Albanians' demands. The country's Slavic majority fears that 
concessions would lead to a division of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgoing President Kiro Gligorov expressed fear for his  
country's experiment in ethnic tolerance amid the Balkans' ethnic 
polarization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have, maybe naively, believed that a peaceful policy,  
without participation in any war, and creation of an independent 
Macedonia, can change something,'' Gligorov said this week. ``But I 
was proven wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Tetovo, a Slav resident, Tomislav Stojanoski, grumbled that  
ethnic Albanians have virtually taken over the town and others in 
the region. ``Ethnic relations are being preserved artificially,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojanoski claims the Macedonian government already wields  
little authority over the west of the country, which borders Kosovo 
and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Slavs, he expressed fears that Albanians, with their  
higher birthrate, would over time dominate Macedonia. ``We will 
become a minority in our own country,'' he complained. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tetovo, the Albanian-language university operates freely  
despite a formal ban. Red and black Albanian national flags are a 
feature of campaign rallies by the two ethnic Albanian presidential 
candidates -- Muarem Nexhipi and Muhamed Halili-- whose speeches are 
replete with support for an independent Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Graffiti with the letters ``UCK,'' the Albanian language  
initials of the Kosovo Liberation Army, can be seen scrawled on 
walls here and elsewhere in western Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orthodox Christian Slavs and Muslim Albanians appear to live  
separate lives, mingling as little as possible. In the capital 
Skopje, the communities live on separate sides of the Vardar river 
and do not mix. 
</P>
<P>
	With profound differences in language, religion and culture  
between the two communities, ethnic Albanian leaders say their 
people identify more and more with Kosovo and Albania rather than 
the Macedonian state. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, political analyst Ljubomir Frckovski believes the  
divisions are not yet so great that they cannot be overcome through 
tolerance and dialogue -- so long as the government does not 
overreact with a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is weird but tolerant,'' he said. ``It is  
important to survive this period when Kosovo is still an open 
wound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the tensions, there have been relatively few serious  
ethnic incidents since independence in 1991. One of them occurred 
more than two years ago when ethnic Albanians clashed with the 
police trying to prevent them from putting up Albanian flags on 
municipal buildings in Tetovo and Gostivar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian mayors of the two towns were arrested. They were  
recently granted amnesty by the new center-rightist government, 
despite objections from Gligorov, a sign that Macedonian leaders 
themselves are divided over how to deal with the ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Xhaferi said Macedonian Albanians do not want independence like  
their ethnic kinsmen in Kosovo, only greater rights. He said the 
government -- which includes his Democratic Party of Albanians -- 
must promote justice for the Albanians, rather than try to suppress 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here,'' he said. ``An idyllic situation that  
Macedonians wake up one day and there are no Albanians cannot 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel Can't Decide on Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic  
Committee's reform panel failed Saturday to resolve the crucial 
issue of whether members should be banned from visiting bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel endorsed a series of other key proposals,  
including the appointment of 15 athletes to the IOC and the 
introduction of an eight-year term of office and re-election 
process for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a member of the  
IOC 2000 reform commission, believes the reform package will 
satisfy the IOC's critics in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more has been achieved than many ... thought  
possible,'' he said. ``I think we're making good progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-member task force, set up in the wake of the Salt Lake  
City bribery scandal, examined 50 proposals drafted by its 
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The final recommendations will be submitted to the full IOC  
general assembly at a special session in Lausanne Dec. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to appear before  
Congress Dec. 15 to testify about the reforms. Congress has 
threatened sanctions unless the IOC enacts significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of visits to bid cities dominated the meeting, which  
was completed in one day instead of the scheduled two. But, in a 
defeat for Samaranch, the commission failed to endorse the 
recommendation for a blanket ban. 
</P>
<P>
	With no consensus reached, Samaranch decided to submit two  
proposals to the December meeting: one calling for no visits, and 
the other -- suggested by Kissinger -- allowing for visits on a 
tightly-controlled basis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the revelations of improper inducements stemming from Salt  
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, the IOC banned visits 
during the bidding for the 2006 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But many members argued Saturday that visits should be  
reinstated, under restrictions, so that delegates could make an 
informed choice on host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Sithole, an IOC member from Zimbabwe, said a ban on visits  
would suggest the IOC doesn't trust its members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes criminals of all of us,'' he said. ``I don't think I  
shouldn't be able to visit the cities because someone is afraid 
that someone might slip something into my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Austrian member Philip von Schoeller: ``This decision  
proves that those who have remained loyal to the organization are 
not to be trusted. They are regarded as potential crooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also opposing a ban on visits was former U.N. Secretary General  
Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should leave as much freedom as possible,'' he said. ``We  
should trust the members and let them act. I don't think adding a 
prohibition on visits is going to help enhance the image of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there were just as many delegates arguing in favor of a ban.  
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is in the public eye as never before,'' British member  
Craig Reedie said. ``I think we have to be responsive to public 
opinion. The only way we can do that in the short term is by not 
visiting bid cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, who chaired a  
working group on the site selection process, said: ``The downside 
of visiting the cities far outweighs the positive benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz and others said members should rely on the findings of  
a special evaluation commission -- made up of IOC and non-IOC 
technical experts -- which will continue to visit cities and prepare 
a detailed report on each bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform group endorsed a recommendation Saturday for the  
introduction of a bid selection procedure, requiring prospective 
bid cities to meet certain criteria before being allowed to submit 
a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger proposed that those members who feel a need to visit a  
bid city be allowed to do so -- but only in organized groups, for a 
specified time period, and at the expense of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no lavish entertainment and gifts and so forth --  
this must be guaranteed,'' Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch repeated his adamant opposition to visits but said he  
would accept whatever the members decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I am right, sometimes I am not right,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While some reforms will require a two-thirds vote for passage,  
Samaranch said the ban on visits would only need a simple majority 
because it wouldn't entail changing the Olympic Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, the commission endorsed a proposal for an age  
limit of 70. But the rule will apply only to future members, while 
the existing 100-plus delegates will continue to be covered by the 
80 age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight-year terms of office will be introduced for all members,  
including current delegates. After eight years, members can seek 
re-election by the IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	There was long debate -- but no consensus -- on the recommendation  
for IOC presidents to be limited to a single eight-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Many delegates objected, saying presidents should have a chance  
to run for a second term of four or eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would put both proposals to the December  
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other recommendations approved Saturday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- the IOC to have a maximum of 115 members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 15 active athletes to be appointed as full IOC members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- the renovated IOC to include 15 presidents of international  
federations and 15 presidents of national Olympic committees or 
continental associations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 70 members to be elected on an individual basis.  
</P>
<P>
	-- creation of a special selection committee to screen candidates  
for IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	-- the executive board to be expanded from 11 members to 15, with  
a permanent seat reserved for athletes.

	More Than 50 Dead in Fire in SKorea  
</P>
<P>
	INCHON, South Korea (AP) -- Four electricians were in police  
custody early Sunday for allegedly ignoring safety rules while 
working in a building where a fire killed at least 54 people. 
Police say the blaze, which also injured 70, started by electric 
sparks. The fire swept quickly through the building in Inchon, the 
country's third largest city, which is located 30 miles west of 
Seoul on the Yellow Sea. Many victims were believed to have 
suffocated from toxic smoke. Most were trapped inside a 
second-floor bar and a billiard parlor on the third floor, police 
said. Saturday's fire is the worst since a hotel fire killed 88 
people in Seoul in 1974. 

</P>

	Mexico Flood Victims Want Reparation  
</P>
<P>
	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Residents of Mexico's southeastern  
state of Tabasco today demanded compensation from the government 
for damage to their homes from flooding and mudslides. They say the 
government's decision to release water from hydroelectric dams was 
responsible for the destruction of their homes. The regional 
director of the Nation Water Commission, Jose Luis Adame, denied 
that the release of water was mishandled. ``We are not 
responsible,'' he said. Flood gates had to be opened, government 
officials said, in order to prevent the dam from breaking and 
causing an even greater disaster. 

</P>
<P>
	Sudan President Warns of U.S. Attack  
</P>
<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan's president said Saturday that all  
government agencies will be required to send employees for military 
training to prepare for the United States' ``coming aggression.'' 
Omar el-Bashir said the country faced external threats masterminded 
by the United States, which he accused of trying to block Sudan's 
development. El-Bashir did not say how many people each department 
will be required to offer for the training program. And he did not 
say why he thought the United States would attack.

	Honduras Braces for Storm  
</P>
<P>
	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Northern Honduras was on alert as  
Tropical Depression Katrina approached today, exactly a year after 
the country was hit by Hurricane Mitch. Katrina, with sustained 
winds of near 30 mph, had nowhere near the force of Mitch, which 
killed nearly 10,000 in Central America, including more than 5,600 
in Honduras alone. But it could dump 5 to 10 inches of rain in 
parts of Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, and there was a 
danger of flash floods and mudslides in mountainous areas, 
according to the U.S. National Weather Service in Miami.

	3 Die in Versailles Plane Crash  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A small airplane crashed Saturday in the grounds of  
the palace at Versailles outside Paris, killing all three people on 
board. No one else was hurt. The three victims, two men and a 
woman, were killed on impact. The single-engine plane crashed near 
a farm on the palace's grounds in a part of the park that is 
usually not visited by tourists, authorities said. For reasons that 
were not immediately clear, the airplane descended shortly after it 
took off from a runway in Saint-Cyr-l'Ecole, near the palace. 

</P>
<P>
	Aggressive Guard Gets 20 Years  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An overzealous security guard intent on protecting  
parking spots for bank customers was sentenced to 20 years for 
killing a driver delivering frozen chickens next door. Carlos 
Valdes, 69, and relatives asked for leniency, but Circuit Judge 
Marc Schumacher imposed what may amount to a life term for a man 
with a heart condition because Valdes failed to take full 
responsibility. Even at sentencing yesterday, Valdes faulted the 
unarmed victim, Abraham Oliden, 35, as the aggressor.

	Woods Leads Tour Championship  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Tiger Woods showed no effects from a stinger he  
suffered hitting a rock, finishing off a round of 66 in a series of 
rainstorms and adding a 4-under 67 in the cool, blustery afternoon 
to take a three-stroke lead at Champions Golf Club. Woods was at 
13-under 200 and in great position to win his third straight 
tournament and seventh in his last 10 starts. He has won the last 
10 times after having at least a share of the lead after 54 holes. 
Meanwhile, remembrances of Payne Stewart, one of six people killed 
in a freak plane crash on Monday, were still evident. 

</P>
<P>
	No. 14 Ala. 35, No. 20 So. Miss 14  
</P>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Shaun Bohanon ran for two touchdowns,  
Reggie Myles returned one of his two interceptions for a score and 
Freddie Milons had a 65-yard punt return for a touchdown to lead 
No. 14 Alabama to a 35-14 victory over No. 20 Southern Mississippi 
today. It was the eighth consecutive victory for the Crimson Tide 
(6-2) over Southern Miss (5-3).

<HEADLINE> US Companies Stuck in Money Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big U.S. corporations are becoming entangled  
in complex schemes in which Colombian drug cartels use legitimate 
international trade to launder an estimated $5 billion a year in 
illicit profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities are warning company officials to  
watch for signs they may be receiving drug money in payment for 
legal goods they make and export. U.S. Customs Service employees 
are training companies how to detect and avoid the schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly signed an  
information-sharing agreement with his Colombian counterpart 
designed to aid investigations of drug trafficking and the 
money-laundering schemes, which use a process known as the 
black-market peso exchange system. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a sophisticated variation on the basic process of money  
laundering, in which illicit profits from criminal activities are 
moved through a series of bank accounts to make them appear to be 
legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-market peso exchange, which involves purchase of U.S.  
products -- notably home appliances, consumer electronics and 
cigarettes -- for export to Colombia, is the biggest, most efficient 
money-laundering system in the Western Hemisphere, government 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a perfect system,'' Kelly said in a recent interview.  
``It ostensibly looks like a legitimate business deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian peso brokers, who act as middlemen in the scheme, give  
Colombian importers IOUs in exchange for pesos. The pesos are used 
to buy U.S. dollars from drug cartels, providing the cartels with 
clean, usable currency. Then, the brokers use the dollars to buy 
U.S. goods and smuggle them into Colombia on behalf of the 
importers, who thereby avoid high government tariffs and taxes on 
foreign currency exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-year undercover investigation by Customs agents into a  
scheme by the Mateus group of Colombia culminated in July with 
indictments against 34 people in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, New 
Jersey, New York and Texas; seizure of 1,160 pounds of cocaine and 
$4.5 million in cash; and freezing of 65 bank accounts around the 
United States that allegedly were used to launder drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight individuals charged have pleaded guilty and are scheduled  
to go on trial Nov. 8 in federal court in Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is a prime example of major U.S. corporations getting  
entangled in the money-laundering web, Customs officials say. As 
part of the drug scheme, members of the Colombian group allegedly 
ordered money to be wired to accounts in the names of Bell 
Helicopter Textron Inc., Intel Corp., Microdata Solutions Corp. and 
MicroTel International Inc., among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cox, a spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron in Fort Worth,  
Texas, said the company did nothing wrong: ``We are as much a 
victim here as anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Clara, Calif., Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy had no  
comment on the matter. There is no listing for Microdata Solutions 
in the Tampa, Fla., area, where authorities said the company is 
headquartered, and law enforcement officials did not have a contact 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	MicroTel's chief financial officer, Randolph Foote, said his  
Ontario, Calif.-based company ``has absolutely no knowledge of 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working undercover and posing as money launderers, Customs  
agents followed the Colombians' instructions and wired drug money 
to the companies' accounts, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that any of the U.S. companies did wrong or  
should have known about the money's illicit origins. But the case 
provides an intriguing possible parallel with a huge alleged 
money-laundering scheme involving the Bank of New York, in which 
Russian companies and individuals -- including organized-crime 
figures -- are suspected of funneling billions of dollars through 
the big U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian and Russian cases are unrelated.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in New York have charged a former vice  
president of the bank, her husband and a Russian business associate 
with conspiring to transmit $7 billion illegally from Russia 
through the bank. The three have denied wrongdoing. The Bank of New 
York, which has been cooperating in the investigation, was not 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe part of the money channeled through the  
Bank of New York could have come from thousands of small- to 
medium-sized Russian businesses that spirited funds through 
offshore companies to avoid huge taxes. The illegal practice is 
widespread in Russia, where taxes are punitive, rules often change 
and tax officials say as many as 99 percent of businesses skirt 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, in Colombia, the black-market peso exchange system is  
used by drug gangs to evade the country's import and foreign 
currency laws and tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bank of New York case, several well-known corporations,  
including General Electric Co., Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc., 
Nestle SA, Volkswagen AG and DaimlerChrysler AG, received money 
wired from Bank of New York accounts that are under investigation, 
according to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts in question were owned by a small company called  
Benex International Co. Inc. of New York, which acted as a transfer 
service for Russian importers in an apparent attempt to avoid 
Russian taxes and import duties. Benex and its Russian owner were 
named as defendants in the federal indictment. The owner, who now 
lives in London, is married to the former Bank of New York vice 
president, who also was charged.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Delay Dismays Safety Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety investigators say they are  
dismayed the Boeing Co. would study fuel tank problems on its jumbo 
jets but then fail for years to disclose their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, in today's editions, quotes National Safety  
Transportation Board officials as saying the Boeing report could 
have helped them focus on the problem -- fuel tank overheating -- 
that was an apparent factor in the explosion of TWA Flight 800 over 
Long Island Sound in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Post, Boeing produced the report in 1980 but  
did not give it to the NTSB until this June. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-volume report focused on a key issue that preoccupied  
TWA Flight 800 investigators -- excess heat from the air 
conditioning bay of its E-4B jet, the military version of its 747, 
possibly creating highly flammable fuel vapors in the plane's 
central fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement Friday, the NTSB expressed  
``displeasure'' and ``dismay'' about Boeing's delay. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boeing spokesman said today that the differences between the  
two versions of the airframe make the report largely irrelevant to 
the TWA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Young said the report was missed by investigators in the  
company's commercial airplane group because it dealt with a 
military aircraft. The company's procedures have been changed so 
that will not happen again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, although the relevance of that (report) is  
questionable, we wish we had found it earlier and passed it 
along,'' Young said. ``There didn't seem to be any realization on 
the military side (of the company) that the investigation was 
relevant or potentially relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, which conducts congressional  
probes, in recent months has been interviewing employees at Boeing 
and the Air Force, which commissioned the 1980 report. The Post 
quoted sources as saying the investigators have no evidence of an 
intentional cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was too important to fall through the cracks,'' Sen.  
Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the subcommittee that 
oversees airline disaster investigations, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said the TWA 800 tragedy could have been prevented if  
Boeing had volunteered its report after a 1990 fuel tank explosion 
on different model Boeing jet, a Philippines Airline 737, at the 
Manila airport, killed eight people. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB said it did not learn of the 1980 report until last  
March, when it was listed on the agenda for a meeting of an Air 
Force task force studying the safety implications of the TWA Flight 
800 explosion for the E-4B. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB is hoping to complete by next spring its report on the  
TWA Flight 800 explosion, which killed all 230 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Rams and Titans Playing Like Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sunday's Rams-Titans game is a microcosm of the wacky 1999 NFL  
season -- a big game between two teams whose only recent notoriety 
has come from changing cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each week has been some kind of test,'' said coach Dick  
Vermeil, whose Rams (6-0) are the season's most pleasant surprise 
after going 22-42 their first four seasons in St. Louis. ``I think 
our players are looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams and Titans (5-1) have arrived at this point in markedly  
different ways, although both have had relatively easy schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis, with former Arena Leaguer Kurt Warner throwing 18  
touchdown passes, is outscoring its opponents by an average of 
nearly 26 points. The Titans have two victories by three points and 
two others by one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher has a decision to make at  
quarterback. Steve McNair, who missed the past five games after 
back surgery, might be ready to start. If he's healthy, he will, 
even though Neil O'Donnell is 4-1 in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no question about the Rams' starter.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner, left unprotected in last spring's expansion draft, is on  
a pace to tie Dan Marino's single-season record of 48 TD passes. He 
has plenty of help, led by Marshall Faulk, who has run for 312 
yards in the past two weeks, and Isaac Bruce, who has eight TD 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
	All this leads to a lot of hoopla, although Fisher is trying to  
keep things low-key. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can overkill, you can overload, you can spend too much  
time on an opponent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Did anyone say ``Super Bowl Preview?''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, Buffalo is at Baltimore, Carolina at  
Atlanta, Chicago at Washington, Cleveland at New Orleans, 
Jacksonville at Cincinnati, the New York Giants at Philadelphia, 
San Diego at Kansas City, New England at Arizona, Miami at Oakland, 
Dallas at Indianapolis, Minnesota at Denver, and Tampa Bay at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle is at Green Bay Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh, the New York Jets and San Francisco are off.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
             *Seattle (4-2) at Green Bay (4-2) (Monday night)    	
</P>
<P>
	The main story is the return of Mike Holmgren to the city where  
he built a Super Bowl champion and, like Vince Lombardi, got a 
street named after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren views this as a test for his Seahawks against what he  
says is one of the NFL's premier teams. In truth, Green Bay's 31-3 
win over San Diego last week was its first decisive victory. Brett 
Favre had to pull out the first three with game-winning drives in 
the final minute. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Dallas (4-2) at Indianapolis (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' last two road games were 13-10 losses to the Eagles and  
Giants, but their 38-20 win over Washington left them in a tie with 
the Redskins for the NFC East lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts already have more victories than they had in each of  
the past two 3-13 seasons. Two ways to measure their progress: the 
Colts are favored, and Pat Summerall and John Madden are doing the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis is using history as an incentive.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about Dallas, they've been a dominant team in  
this league for a number of years,'' coach Jim Mora said. 
``Whenever you play them, it's special. I think everybody feels 
this way.'' 

</P>
<P>
                   *Minnesota (3-4) at Denver (2-5)    	
</P>
<P>
	This was supposed to be last year's Super Bowl until the Vikings  
blew the NFC title game to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings finally showed signs of offense last week, beating  
the 49ers 40-16 with Jeff George at quarterback for Randall 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright light for injury-ravaged Denver is Olandis Gary, a  
late-round pick from Georgia -- just like the injured Terrell Davis 
-- who has run for 214 yards the past two weeks. 

</P>
<P>
                     *Miami (5-1) at Oakland (4-3)    	
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard remains in for Dan Marino for the Dolphins, while  
Rich Gannon, the Raiders' quarterback, has a broken finger on his 
left hand. Gannon wants to play; coach Jon Gruden probably will 
start Bobby Hoying. 
</P>
<P>
	This game will almost surely be close. All seven Raiders games  
have been decided by a touchdown or less. The Dolphins beat Denver 
by 17 the opening week, but their other four wins are by a total of 
10. 

</P>
<P>
                  *San Diego (4-2) at Kansas City (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	These are two of the four plus-.500 teams in the AFC West  
(everyone but Denver). And they are two of the half-dozen or so 
teams responsible for the dearth of scoring -- both play excellent 
defense but plod on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have had 10 passes intercepted the past two weeks,  
seven thrown by Erik Kramer and three by Jim Harbaugh. That's 
dangerous against the Chiefs, whose plus-9 turnover differential 
leads the league. 

</P>
<P>
                   *Tampa Bay (3-3) at Detroit (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Tony Dungy finally is replacing Trent Dilfer with Eric Zeier.  
``It's not a one-game thing,'' Dungy said. ``I don't like to make 
quarterback changes quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a key game in the bunched NFC Central, where 1 1/2 games  
separate the top (Lions and Packers) from the bottom (Vikings and 
Bears). The Bucs have problems when they head north -- they've lost 
at Green Bay and Minnesota this season and last year went 1-3 on 
the road in the division. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Chicago (3-4) at Washington (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Dan (The Fan) Snyder, the Redskins' owner, went ballistic after  
his team lost in Dallas, and threatened more firings. Imagine what 
might happen if they lose this. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Jauron has the Bears playing about as well as anyone could  
ask. They're another team that plays them close -- none of their 
games has been decided by more than a touchdown. 

</P>
<P>
                 *Cleveland (0-7) at New Orleans (1-5)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Browns seem a throwback to the expansion teams of yore, like  
Tampa Bay, which lost its first 26 games. The Saints are playing 
just as poorly and Mike Ditka admits he's coaching in a befuddled 
manner. His clock management the past two weeks has been atrocious. 
</P>
<P>
	Of note: The Bucs' first-ever win, in 1977, was a 33-14 victory  
over the Saints. 

</P>
<P>
                *Jacksonville (5-1) at Cincinnati (0-6)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars had last week off and may get back their two best  
offensive players, Mark Brunell and Fred Taylor. But the sad fact 
is that they hardly need them until the playoffs. The defense is 
playing well and the schedule is full of games like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati is falling apart.  
</P>
<P>
	``Things that could have been taken care of maybe three or four  
years ago are now catching up with this team,'' said offensive 
tackle Willie Anderson of the Bengals, losers of 102 games this 
decade. ``You have some guys on this team that are good, 
NFL-caliber players, and you have some at certain key positions 
that maybe they're not.'' 

</P>
<P>
              *New York Giants (4-3) at Philadelphia (2-5)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Giants turned over the ball five times in their first  
meeting and still won, 16-15. That seemed to inspire the Eagles, 
who ran off their first two-game winning streak since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	New York lost both free safeties, Percy Ellsworth and Shaun  
Williams, in its 31-3 victory over New Orleans last week. It 
probably was a good time for those injuries -- the Eagles' passing 
offense is the worst in the league. 

</P>
<P>
                  *New England (5-2) at Arizona (2-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' only ``blowout'' was a 12-point win over poor  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are without Jake Plummer, who broke a finger  
against the Redskins. But Plummer had been having a bad year 
anyway, and Dave Brown, his backup, has 53 NFL starts, making him 
experienced, if not necessarily accomplished. 

</P>
<P>
                   *Buffalo (4-3) at Baltimore (2-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	The banged-up Bills have lost two in a row and miss wide  
receiver Eric Moulds, out with a hamstring injury for another few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least they have Doug Flutie. The Ravens are going to  
their third quarterback, Tony Banks; Scott Mitchell and Stoney 
Case, have only four touchdown passes and 10 interceptions between 
them. 

</P>
<P>
                   *Carolina (2-4) at Atlanta (1-6)    	
</P>
<P>
	Dan Reeves has the Falcons still trying, but Jamal Anderson's  
absence really showed when Atlanta failed on three attempts from 
the 1-yard line at the end of Monday night's 13-9 loss in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina? ``We haven't quite got the mentality that it takes to  
win on a consistent basis,'' said quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who 
once was a backup on Dallas' Super Bowl teams.

<HEADLINE> Mars Polar Lander Fixes Flight Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Mars Polar Lander successfully  
performed a 12-second thruster firing Saturday to fine tune its 
flight path to arrive on the Red Planet's south pole on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary data showed that the adjustment, which began at  
10:28 a.m. PDT, achieved the desired change in trajectory, said 
Mary Beth Murrill, spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists and engineers had checked -- and double-checked -- the  
thruster firing process in order to avoid a repeat of the problem 
that doomed NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Trajectory correction maneuvers are routine in solar system  
flights but the procedure for Mars Polar Lander has come under 
greater scrutiny since the loss of its companion mission in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Astronautics, which was participating in the  
Climate Orbiter mission, sent files of data in English units of 
measurement to JPL navigators who were expecting metric units. The 
undetected problem led the craft too close to Mars on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Another trajectory correction maneuver on the Polar Lander is  
scheduled for Nov. 30, three days before the lander enters the 
atmosphere and sets down on rolling plains near the Martian south 
pole.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Perfect At Skate America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- From her first big tests at UCLA  
to her first big test of the figure skating season, Michelle Kwan 
is one busy woman. One productive one, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a freshman at UCLA, is no newcomer to bigtime skating  
events. Or to perfect marks. On Friday night, she swept the panel 
of nine and got a perfect 6.0 from the Russian judge in winning the 
short program at Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out there thinking that this is cool,'' the two-time world  
champion and 1998 Olympic silver medalist said. ``It's a good 
change. This week, I'm at Skate America. Last week, I was doing 
midterms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's given me a better perspective. I'm having more fun,  
letting it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She let go to Beatles music for the first time in her career --  
albeit Jeff Beck's searing interpretation of ``A Day in the Life.'' 
She was as smooth as freshly cleaned ice. Kwan nailed a double axel 
to start off, hit a lovely triple lutz-double toe loop combination, 
and a triple toe. Her spins were precise and her trademark spirals 
were long and exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have that competitive feeling, even though I have  
school to juggle,'' said Kwan, who has put up with a hectic pace of 
school and practice sessions at two rinks. ``I know I can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Carroll, coach of the three-time U.S. champion, seemed  
stunned by which judge gave Kwan the 6.0 -- her 21st in 
Olympic-eligible competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian, that's got to be a first,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Second heading into tonight's free skate, worth two-thirds of  
the total score, was Sarah Hughes, the 14-year-old rising star from 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's leader Alexei Yagudin of Russia wasn't quite as impressive  
as Kwan, but he also swept the judges. Yagudin, coming off an ankle 
injury, has a shaky triple axel-double toe combination and his 
spins were slow. But he did land a quadruple toe and he has a 
special presence on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was injured and I didn't want to come here,'' he said. ``But  
then I felt better and decided I wanted to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion edged Americans Michael Weiss and  
Tim Goebel, even though he is using the season's first major 
international competition as a tune-up -- he will get no points here 
in the Grand Prix series because he will compete in two other 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know which of the competitions I get points. Is this  
one?'' he said, drawing laughs. ``I don't think about points. 
People expect me to skate well all the time. I try to make the 
people happy to see me skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss stepped out of his quad, but had a strong triple  
axel-triple toe combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, who became a father for the second time last week and has  
been fighting a sore ankle and a sinus infection, was pleased with 
his opening performance of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an interesting couple of weeks for me,'' he said.  
``It's a big step to know with things not going smoothly, I can put 
out a short program that was solid. It's a big help for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada was just behind  
Goebel, mainly because Goebel hit his quad salchow and Stojko 
didn't attempt a quad. Stojko also put his hand down on a triple 
axel combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel was more impressed that he had strong artistic marks,  
previously a weak area. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time ever, my artistic marks substantially  
improved in some cases. It was definitely a change I needed,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's biggest surprise came in pairs, with two-time world  
champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze fourth in the 
short program. She fell on side-by-side triple toe loops, and then 
went down again on a throw triple loop. 
</P>
<P>
	That left plenty of room for Canadians Jamie Sale and David  
Pelletier to win the short. Even though they form the No. 2 couple 
in Canada, Sale and Pelletier easily outdistanced more established 
pairs from Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very strong competition,'' Pelletier said. ``Eight  
teams are here and six were in the top 10 at worlds. We are very 
surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not at all surprising -- as if there ever are any stunners in ice  
dancing -- the leaders after the compulsories and original dance 
were favorites Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia.

<HEADLINE> Big Waves Take Bride in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Five days after he promised to  
stand at her side through good times and bad, Eamon Stookesberry 
did the last thing he could for his wife, Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple were taking pictures 20 feet above the pounding  
Pacific surf when 10-foot waves crashed above them and swept her 
out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Stookesberry dove in after his wife, and touched her hand  
briefly before the turbulent sea tore them apart about 50 yards 
from shore, a Coast Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, this is really bad water here, but I'll die with  
her before I let her go,'' Stookesberry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As rescuers worked to reach her, ``we saw her swimming and  
staying afloat for 10 to 12 minutes,'' said Dorothy Maras-Ildiz, 
manager of the nearby Old Bath House restaurant. ``But then a huge 
set of waves came up, three or four of them, one behind the other 
and I thought, oh no, because she was getting weaker. And then, a 
few minutes later, we saw her floating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers first pulled Stookesberry, 28, from the 56-degree water  
into their boat before reaching Mrs. Stookesberry, 23. She was 
pronounced dead at a hospital. Her husband was treated for 
hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions that took Mrs. Stookesberry's life hit the Santa  
Cruz and Monterey areas right around high tide, spawning giant 
waves that crashed under sunny skies amid balmy temperatures that 
lured big-wave surfers to the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Several got in trouble, including 20-year-old Danny Jordan of  
San Jose, who died surfing in waters near Capitola. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard in Monterey knew of four surfers who were in  
distress at the same time. ``Between the radios and the phones, it 
was nonstop,'' Petty Officer Robert Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a bouquet of yellow spider mums lay across the  
computer keyboard at Mrs. Stookesberry's desk in an Alamo doctors' 
office where she worked as a receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot where the Stookesberrys were taking pictures is a rocky  
outcropping called Lovers Point. Ocean spray flew over the top of 
the 40- and 50-foot Monterey cypress trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's breathtaking,'' Maras-Ildiz said, ``but nothing you  
should be standing near. Landlubbers don't understand the force. 
Rule one is you never turn your back on the ocean.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Delay Dismays Safety Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Federal officials say they have no evidence that  
Boeing Co. intentionally covered up a 19-year-old safety report 
that could have clued investigators in to what caused the crash of 
TWA Flight 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board told  
aides to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, that the report by Boeing -- 
commissioned by the Air Force to look into problems with the 
military version of Boeing's 747 -- could have directed them to the 
fuel tanks immediately rather wasting months searching for evidence 
of a missile attack or bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI spent over a year following reports of suspicious  
streaks in the sky, feared to be a surface-to-air missile, before 
announcing in November 1997 that mechanical failure was to blame. 
All 230 people on board Flight 800 died. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement Friday, the NTSB expressed  
``displeasure'' and ``dismay'' about the three-year delay between 
the crash and the discovery of the report this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said they only learned of the report's  
existence in March after it was listed on the agenda for an Air 
Force task force studying the safety implications of the Flight 800 
explosion. Boeing turned the report over to the NTSB in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-volume report focuses on whether excess heat from air  
conditioners in Boeings E-4B military jet could create highly 
flammable fuel vapors in the central fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Young, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said  
Saturday that differences between the E-4B and the 747 made the 
report largely irrelevant to the TWA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The E-4B, for example, has four air conditioning units under the  
fuselage, compared with three in a standard 747, and the air 
conditioners often run for long periods in the E-4B while it is on 
the ground, Young said. The E-4B also burns a different fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was overlooked by employees in the commercial  
airplane division because it dealt with a military aircraft, Young 
said. He said the company's procedures have since been changed to 
prevent that from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, although the relevance of that (report) is  
questionable, we wish we had found it earlier and passed it 
along,'' Young said. ``There didn't seem to be any realization on 
the military side (of the company) that the investigation was 
relevant or potentially relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, which conducts congressional  
probes, has been interviewing employees at Boeing and the Air Force 
and has found no evidence of an intentional cover-up, Grassley 
aides said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is chairman of the subcommittee that oversees airline  
disaster investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	After being briefed by the GAO Friday, Grassley said the TWA 800  
tragedy could have been prevented if Boeing had brought it out 
after a 1990 fuel tank explosion on a Philippines Airline Boeing 
737 at an airport in Manilla. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's a matter of public safety, the ethic for both  
manufacturers and regulators must be to overreport,'' Grassley said 
Saturday. ``If the NTSB had been given the 1980 report and others, 
it could have pressed the FAA to set the very standards finally 
proposed this week for airplane fuel tanks. The document, 
regardless of what it says, should have been reported to the 
NTSB.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday announced  
proposed regulations to make airplane fuel tanks less susceptible 
to explosions by requiring that new planes contain fuel systems 
that minimize flammable vapors and that aircraft makers develop new 
maintenance programs for fuel tanks within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB hopes to complete its report on the crash of Flight 800  
by next spring.

<HEADLINE> Court: Atlanta Can Sue Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The city can go ahead with its lawsuit against  
gun makers, a judge ruled, forcing the industry to open its files 
for the first time to one of the local governments suing it for the 
effects of gun-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulton County Judge Gino Brogdon's decision Wednesday came  
almost three weeks after an Ohio judge threw out a similar lawsuit 
by Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's suit, like those of 26 other cities or counties that  
have sued the industry, came after successful suits against the 
tobacco industry by states. In those cases, the industry had to 
open secret files, revealing damaging information about decisions 
on product safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the effect on the gun industry? Fear,'' said Mark  
Kadish, a Georgia State University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge allowed Atlanta to pursue its claims that guns are  
defectively designed and fail to incorporate safety devices. The 
judge said the city must prove that the industry was negligent, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after Atlanta's suit was filed in February, the  
General Assembly passed a law banning such suits by Georgia cities 
and towns. The city argued that a phrase allowing the law to take 
effect retroactively was never printed in the final copy of the 
state code. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith &AMP; Wesson argued that the law should nullify the suit, but  
Brogdon did not address that claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mixed result,'' said Anne Kimball, a Smith &AMP; Wesson  
attorney. ``We continue to believe that Brogdon will dismiss the 
entire suit.''

<P>
	Florida passed its biggest hurdle on the road to the SEC  
championship game -- by running the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Bo Carroll ran 30 yards for a second-half touchdown and the  
Gators held Quincy Carter to 73 yards passing as No. 5 Florida beat 
No. 10 Georgia 30-14 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, coach Steve Spurrier's 100th at Florida, put the Gators  
(7-1, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) in control of the league's East 
Division. Wins over Vanderbilt and South Carolina are all the 
Gators need to reach the league's title game for the first time in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	At Jacksonville, Fla., Spurrier's Gators won against the team he  
loves to beat most. The defense shut out Georgia (6-2, 4-2) in the 
second half and the offense ground out yardage over the final 30 
minutes. Get this -- Florida had zero net yards passing in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can get that feeling where we need to put it on the  
ground,'' Spurrier said. ``When our defense is playing like they're 
playing, I can just say, `Hang onto the ball, fellows, and 
hopefully we'll break one here and there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The game was played in a steady rain, with silly penalties and a  
number of stalled drives making if frustrating for all involved. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Gators ahead 16-14, Carroll's TD run put Florida in  
control. 
</P>
<P>
	On Georgia's next drive, Alex Brown forced a turnover at the  
Georgia 2. Doug Johnson, who threw for his 234 yards in the first 
half, ran in on the next play and a game that had been close was 
suddenly out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll finished with 113 yards on 13 carries.  
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games, it was No. 2 Penn State 27, Illinois 7;  
No. 4 Tennessee 30, South Carolina 7; No. 6 Kansas State 48, Baylor 
7; No. 7 Georgia Tech 48, North Carolina State 21; No. 11 Wisconsin 
35, Northwestern 19; and No. 12 Texas 44, Iowa State 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it was No. 13 Marshall 41, Northern Illinois 9; No. 14  
Alabama 35, No. 20 Southern Mississippi 14; No. 15 Michigan 34, 
Indiana 31; Air Force at No. 16 BYU 27, Air Force 20; No. 17 East 
Carolina 19, Houston 3; No. 18 Purdue 33, Minnesota 28; No. 21 Ohio 
State 41, Iowa 11; No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M 21, Oklahoma State 3; No. 23 
Miami 28, West Virginia 20; and Colorado 38, No. 24 Oklahoma 24. 
</P>
<P>
	In night games, it was No. 1 Florida State at Virginia; No. 3  
Virginia Tech at Pittsburgh; co-No. 8 Nebraska at Kansas; and No. 
25 Mississippi at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-No. 8 Mississippi State and No. 19 Michigan State did not 	
play on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 2 Penn State 27, Illinois 7 	
</P>
<P>
	At Champaign, Ill., Rashard Casey, replacing an ineffective  
Kevin Thompson, threw for one TD and ran for another as the Nittany 
Lions (9-0, 5-0 Big Ten) won their 11th straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson threw three interceptions, and coach Joe Paterno put  
Casey in late in the third quarter with the Lions ahead 10-7. Penn 
State's defense was led by end Courtney Brown, who had four sacks 
against Kurt Kittner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illini, who upset Michigan last week, fell to 4-4, 1-4.  
</P>
<P>
                  *No. 4 Tennessee 30, South Carolina 7

	TARKUMIYA, West Bank (AP) -- Assailants opened fire on a bus  
traveling through the West Bank on Saturday, injuring five 
Israelis. Police suspected Palestinians in the attack, which came 
two days before of a major peace summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. leaders were scheduled to meet  
Monday in Oslo, Norway, to open talks on a final peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, the Likud opposition party accused Prime  
Minister Ehud Barak of conceding too much in the peace process 
without insisting the Palestinian Authority stamp out militant 
groups, Israel army radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was traveling from the settlement of Kiryat Arba when  
the attackers opened fire near the Palestinian village of 
Tarkumiya, police spokesman Rafi Yaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 20 minutes after we left, we heard about five shots,''  
said Michael Strauss, a passenger on the bus. ``They were probably 
shot from a car parked at the side of the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the bullets hit the lower part of the bus, and  
most of the injuries were in the legs, Strauss said. The bus 
continued traveling until it reached a nearby army base, where 
authorities and rescue services were alerted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded were taken to a hospital in Jerusalem, Yaffe said.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred near a long-awaited land link for  
Palestinian travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The route, 
which uses existing Israeli roads, opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli hard-liners had warned that the route traveled by  
thousands of Palestinians would be used by terrorists to carry out 
attacks against Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli troops began extensive searches in the area for the  
attackers but did not immediately arrest any suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis on the bus, residents of towns inside Israel, had  
spent the Jewish Sabbath in Kiryat Arba to show solidarity with the 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak and Arafat are scheduled to officially open the final  
status talks in Oslo. President Clinton is to direct the 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak took office in July and immediately renewed the peace  
process, which was largely frozen under his predecessor, Benjamin 
Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has demanded the Palestinians fight anti-Israeli groups,  
but has taken a more moderate stance toward the Palestinians than 
Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Death Sentence Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A man who was the first person sentenced to death  
by the United States under a 1988 federal drug law had his sentence 
overturned by a judicial panel that ruled he was not properly 
defended by his attorney during sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled 2-1 in favor of David Ronald Chandler of Piedmont, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was sent back to the lower court for resentencing and  
Chandler's conviction for arranging the slaying of an informant 
still stands. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Doug Jones in Birmingham, Ala., had not decided  
whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's trial attorney, Drew Redden, testified at an appeals  
hearing that he made ``very little'' effort to sway the jury to 
spare Chandler's life. Two judges wrote that the jury that 
sentenced him did not hear witnesses and evidence that showed a 
``more admirable'' side of Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was convicted in 1991 of operating a large marijuana  
ring in northeast Alabama and arranging the murder of Marlin 
Shuler, a member of his network who became a government informant. 
The man who killed Shuler is serving 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was the first person sentenced under the 1988 Anti-Drug  
Abuse Act, which allows the death penalty for killings associated 
with a criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	His execution has been on hold since last year, when the court  
agreed to hear his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The last federal execution was 36 years ago, when Victor Feguer  
was hanged in Iowa for kidnapping and killing a doctor.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Delay Dismays Safety Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Federal officials say they have no evidence that  
Boeing Co. intentionally covered up a 19-year-old safety report 
that could have clued investigators in to what caused the crash of 
TWA Flight 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board told  
aides to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, that the report by Boeing -- 
commissioned by the Air Force to look into problems with the 
military version of Boeing's 747 -- could have directed them to the 
fuel tanks immediately rather wasting months searching for evidence 
of a missile attack or bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI spent over a year following reports of suspicious  
streaks in the sky, feared to be a surface-to-air missile, before 
announcing in November 1997 that mechanical failure was to blame. 
All 230 people on board Flight 800 died. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement Friday, the NTSB expressed  
``displeasure'' and ``dismay'' about the three-year delay between 
the crash and the discovery of the report this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said they only learned of the report's  
existence in March after it was listed on the agenda for an Air 
Force task force studying the safety implications of the Flight 800 
explosion. Boeing turned the report over to the NTSB in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-volume report focuses on whether excess heat from air  
conditioners in Boeings E-4B military jet could create highly 
flammable fuel vapors in the central fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Young, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said  
Saturday that differences between the E-4B and the 747 made the 
report largely irrelevant to the TWA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The E-4B, for example, has four air conditioning units under the  
fuselage, compared with three in a standard 747, and the air 
conditioners often run for long periods in the E-4B while it is on 
the ground, Young said. The E-4B also burns a different fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was overlooked by employees in the commercial  
airplane division because it dealt with a military aircraft, Young 
said. He said the company's procedures have since been changed to 
prevent that from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, although the relevance of that (report) is  
questionable, we wish we had found it earlier and passed it 
along,'' Young said. ``There didn't seem to be any realization on 
the military side (of the company) that the investigation was 
relevant or potentially relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, which conducts congressional  
probes, has been interviewing employees at Boeing and the Air Force 
and has found no evidence of an intentional cover-up, Grassley 
aides said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is chairman of the subcommittee that oversees airline  
disaster investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	After being briefed by the GAO Friday, Grassley said the TWA 800  
tragedy could have been prevented if Boeing had brought it out 
after a 1990 fuel tank explosion on a Philippines Airline Boeing 
737 at an airport in Manilla. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's a matter of public safety, the ethic for both  
manufacturers and regulators must be to overreport,'' Grassley said 
Saturday. ``If the NTSB had been given the 1980 report and others, 
it could have pressed the FAA to set the very standards finally 
proposed this week for airplane fuel tanks. The document, 
regardless of what it says, should have been reported to the 
NTSB.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday announced  
proposed regulations to make airplane fuel tanks less susceptible 
to explosions by requiring that new planes contain fuel systems 
that minimize flammable vapors and that aircraft makers develop new 
maintenance programs for fuel tanks within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB hopes to complete its report on the crash of Flight 800  
by next spring.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Clarke: Keep Status Quo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Leave it to the Philadelphia Flyers to find  
themselves battling turmoil at the same time they're battling for 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers steadied themselves after an 0-5-1 start that put  
some early tarnish on their Stanley Cup hopes. A four-game winning 
streak, including three shutouts, sent them back to the top of the 
standings. Things should be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from it.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Lindros is out with a persistent, mysterious illness. Coach  
Roger Neilson survived rumors about his job, but can't shake a 
virus he's had for a month. General manager Bob Clarke looks ready 
to pounce as he stands ominously in the executive box during games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite body language to the contrary, Clarke said Friday he's  
not going to panic -- and that means forget about trading No. 88. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trading Lindros,'' Clarke said in his New Jersey  
office, one day after the Flyers, playing without Lindros, blew a 
4-0 lead in the third period before coming back to beat Colorado 
5-4 in overtime. ``We're not trading anybody. Teams ask about a lot 
of players, but it doesn't mean you're trading them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also doesn't mean that players are immune to the rumblings,  
especially Lindros. He and his father, Carl Lindros, who is also 
his agent, make no secret of their belief that the Flyers have 
entertained trade offers for one of the most dynamic players in the 
game. Before the season, Lindros lamented having been ``shopped 
around the league'' in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lindros and longtime linemate John LeClair are signed  
only through this season, there is no indication Clarke has 
anything in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers have more pressing concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	With forwards Rod Brind'Amour and Keith Jones sidelined with  
injuries, the Flyers started 0-5-1, the worst start in their 
32-year history. They promptly won four straight, quieting the 
alarm, but glaring weaknesses resurfaced the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, trying to play despite his illness, had one of the  
worst games of his career Tuesday night in a 5-2 loss to Vancouver 
in which the Canucks overwhelmed Philadelphia with speed. Lindros 
and LeClair were on the ice for four Vancouver goals, and each made 
a glaring turnover that led to a score. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has four goals in 11 games and is minus-5. LeClair  
played better Thursday night, but has four goals in 12 games and is 
minus-7. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lindros home in bed Thursday night, the Flyers blew a 4-0  
lead against the Avalanche by allowing four goals on eight shots in 
8:09. Valeri Zelepukin saved them with a goal that was supposed to 
be a pass with 8.2 seconds left in OT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got good people in this locker room who stick  
together,'' said Mark Recchi, the Flyers' best player so far with a 
team-high five goals and 18 points. ``That's why we got through 
that 0-5-1. The concern was very minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke was a conspicuous presence throughout the game, standing  
and pacing around his box high above the ice. He said nothing 
should be gleaned from that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit lots of times,'' Clarke said. ``It's just however I feel  
that night, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, whose season was cut short last year by a scary,  
draining bout with a collapsed lung, has been sick for more than a 
week. Doctors are calling it a virus, and Clarke shot down 
speculation that Lindros was anemic. He's questionable for 
Saturday's home game against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors tell us that he is not anemic,'' Clarke said. ``He  
has a virus and is very run down, which is what a virus does to 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson, who has been sick for a month, is considering Clarke's  
offer to take a couple of days off during the team's upcoming road 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke suggested that Neilson, whose girlfriend lives in Dallas,  
should fly there Sunday and rest before rejoining the team 
Wednesday in Anaheim. Assistants Wayne Cashman and Craig Ramsay, 
both with head coaching experience, would run practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson is wary, and rightfully so. Only two weeks ago he was  
being bombarded with questions about his job security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always a little skeptical of being sent away, so I  
probably won't go,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke made only a minor change Friday. Rookie defenseman Mark  
Eaton will be sent to the minors and defenseman Andy Delmore will 
join the team for the four-game road trip that begins next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides standing, pacing and hoping, that's all from upstairs --  
for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't replace Lindros. We can't replace Brind'Armour,''  
Clarke said. ``You hope other people step up. That's all you can 
do.''

	Last Indonesian Ship Leaves E.Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Under cover of darkness, the last  
Indonesian troop ship sailed out of Dili's nearly deserted harbor 
today, ending a bloody 24-year military engagement in East Timor. 
In an extraordinary farewell gesture, East Timor's rebel leader 
clasped hands with senior Indonesian military officers today as 
Indonesian forces spent their final hours in the territory. 
Peacekeeping troops sealed off the docks and kept a wary eye on a 
crowd of East Timorese who have been jeering and taunting the 
departing troops in recent days.

	Taliban: Bin Laden Wants To Leave  
</P>
<P>
	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, wanted by the United  
States for the bombing of two American embassies last year, has 
asked for permission to leave Afghanistan, the ruling Taliban 
religious army said today. Bin Laden's departure could lift the 
threat of U.N. sanctions on Afghanistan, where he has been living 
for years. A Clinton administration official said the U.S. 
government had seen the report of bin Laden's request, but that it 
``falls far short'' of the U.N. resolution that the militia deliver 
him for trial.

	Boeing Delay Dismays Safety Panel

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety investigators say they are  
dismayed that Boeing would study fuel tank problems on its jumbo 
jets but then fail for years to disclose their findings. The 
Washington Post, in today's editions, quotes National Safety 
Transportation Board officials as saying the Boeing report could 
have helped them focus on the problem -- fuel tank overheating -- 
that was an apparent factor in the explosion of TWA Flight 800 over 
Long Island Sound in 1996. According to the Post, Boeing produced 
the report in 1980 but did not give it to the NTSB until this June.

be required to report the incident to the public, President Clinton 
said today. Current federal regulations require disclosure only by 
companies that release of large amounts of extremely toxic 
chemicals, like mercury and PCBs. The new rules, Clinton said in 
his weekly radio address, will help communities force polluting 
companies to act more responsibly.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In the worst fire in 25 years, a blaze  
raged through a four-story building crowded with young weekend 
shoppers and diners today in northwestern South Korea, killing at 
least 54 people, many of them teen-agers, police said. Seventy 
people were injured, some of them seriously. Police reduced the 
death toll from 57, but said it may rise again because some of the 
injured people were in critical condition. The fire broke out 
around in Inchon, South Korea's third largest city, 30 miles west 
of Seoul.

find new ways to get refugees out of Chechnya as Russian jets and 
artillery continued to shower bombs and shells on the battered 
republic. Despite international calls for an end to the war, 
Russian forces kept up their bombardment of the capital Grozny, 
concentrating their fire on suspected guerrilla positions in the 
northern and southern outskirts. Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja 
Halonen, who led a European Union delegation to refugee camps 
today, urged Russia to open its borders and allow people to flee

	2 Churches Settle Salvation Debate

<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Ending an almost 500-year debate that started when  
Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to a church door, the Lutheran 
and Roman Catholic churches plan to sign a joint declaration 
tomorrow putting aside their differences over the way humanity 
achieves salvation. The dispute centers on the question of how to 
get to heaven. Catholics believe that people's actions can make a 
difference, while Lutherans believe salvation is based on faith 
alone. At the heart of the agreement is a statement that faith is 
essential in salvation.

Mitchell said. Rison, 32, signed with the Chiefs as a free agent in 
1997, after being released by the Green Bay Packers.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 Michigan 34, Indiana 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Hayden Epstein kicked a 20-yard field  
goal with 18 seconds to play as No. 15 Michigan withstood the upset 
bid of Indiana 34-31 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten) had to bat down a ``Hail Mary'' pass  
in the end zone on the game's final play to avoid losing a third 
consecutive regular-season game for the first time since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana (4-5, 3-3) battled back from a 17-0 second quarter  
deficit to lead 24-17 on a 9-yard pass from Antwaan Randle El to 
Jerry Dorsey with 12:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines responded quickly, moving 65 yards in four plays  
to tie the score again on Tom Brady's 7-yard pass to Bennie Joppru. 
Brady set up the score with a 46-yard completion to David Terrell. 
Michigan then moved 66 yards in eight plays to regain the lead on a 
4-yard run by Anthony Thomas, who had career highs of 42 carries 
and 197 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas had five carries for 42 yards and two receptions for  
eight yards on the drive. Randle El, who threw for four touchdowns 
to claim the school record for a season with 16, kept the upset bid 
alive by hooking up with Dorsey for a 70-yard TD pass as he 
sprinted to his left, pump faked and uncorked the ball to his open 
receiver with 4:59 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan took over on its 25 and moved downfield with the help  
of Brady completions of 13 yards to Terrell, 14 to Marcus Knight 
and 23 to Thomas. A 15-yard face mask penalty on an incomplete pass 
by Brady and a holding penalty by O.J. Spencer against Terrell also 
helped set up the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El wasn't finished. He gained 14 on a pass to Versie  
Gaddis, rushed for 12 and then threw the final pass to Dorsey, 
which was broken up by DeWayne Patmon and James Whitley. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who moved from 18th to 14th on Michigan's all-time  
career rushing list, ran for three TDs while going over the century 
mark for the 10th time. His previous single-game high was 183 yards 
at Hawaii in 1998 as a sophomore. He now has 2,289 career yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Sticking mainly to the ground, Michigan moved 77 yards in 11  
plays following the opening kickoff to score on a 1-yard run by 
Thomas. The drive's big play was a 36-yard completion from Brady to 
Knight on a third-and-12 near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines got the ball back when Craig Osika fumbled on  
Indiana's second play from scrimmage and the Wolverines recovered 
at Indiana's 35. A 7-yard run by Thomas gave Michigan a 
first-and-goal at the 4, but the Wolverines settled for a 22-yard 
field goal by Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited to 34 yards in the first quarter, Indiana had Michigan's  
Cato June block Drew Hagan's punt and the Wolverines took over on 
the Hoosiers' 15. Thomas, who had 113 yards rushing in the first 
half, made it 17-0 with a 15-yard run on Michigan's next play. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana began its comeback by driving 80 yards in eight plays,  
scoring on Randle El's 7-yard pass to Kris Dielman in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoosiers trailed 17-10 when Andy Payne kicked a 23-yard  
field goal at the end of the first half and neither team scored 
again until Randle El hit fullback Jeremi Johnson on fourth down 
play from the 1 with 13:20 to play. Thomas fumbled the following 
kickoff and the Hoosiers moved ahead for its only lead of the game 
after taking over on the Michigan nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El was 18 of 34 for 290 yards. Dorsey had five catches  
for 154 yards. Brady, who played the entire game for the first time 
this season, was 17 of 29 for 226 yards. Terrell had 100 yards on 
six receptions for the Wolverines.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Woman Wins First Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIGNES, France (AP) -- Switzerland's Sonja Nef overcame a fragile  
knee and weak nerves Saturday, winning the season's opening World 
Cup giant slalom for her first career triumph in the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Nef, who had built a reputation of posting brilliant opening  
runs then bottoming out in the second, didn't flinch Saturday. She 
compiled two solid performances for an aggregate time of 2 minutes, 
31.39 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work I've been doing with my mental trainer over the past  
year has paid off,'' Nef said after collecting her first win since 
1996. ``He helped me overcome my emotional sensibility and helped 
me put less pressure on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After taking a .42-second lead in the opening run, many expected  
Nef to crumble in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	But she remained relaxed, ignoring the fog and the pelting, wet  
snow to post the fastest second run in 1:15.55, and finish a 
stunning 1.61 seconds ahead of her nearest rival, Sweden's Anna 
Ottosson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottosson, who had a two-run time of 2:33.00, was followed by  
Austria's Anita Wachter at 2:33.51. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup overall and giant slalom champion Alexandra  
Meissnitzer of Austria veered off course in the opening run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachter, a 16-year veteran of the women's circuit, trailed by  
1.51 seconds after the first run, but had a sensational second run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first run wasn't so good for me,'' said Wachter, the 1993  
overall World Cup champion and winner of 18 World Cup races. 
``Visibility was very poor and I was afraid to go fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the second leg I took many risks. I'd been aiming for  
top-five so a podium finish is a good start to my season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To many, Nef's victory was surprising.  
</P>
<P>
	Nef, who had been training alone the past three years because a  
weak knee prevented her from keeping up with the rest of the Swiss 
team, repeatedly had failed to convert a solid first run into a 
victory. Last year, she posted top-five finishes five times in the 
giant slalom, including two podium places. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably the only top skier who wasn't seeing a sports  
psychologist,'' said Nef, whose only other career victory was in a 
slalom at Sestriere, Italy, in 1996. ``I figured you don't want to 
be with someone who makes you start analyzing things too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for the past two years I was stuck between second and  
fifth place in all my races. I figured I needed to find a way to 
break out of my rut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer was Heinz Graf, a driving teacher from Lucerne,  
Switzerland, and a former sports trainer who now helps athletes 
deal with the stress of competition in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nef described herself as ``emotionally sensitive,'' and ``unable  
to cope with difficult situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Poor press reviews and criticism would bother me,'' said Nef,  
the fourth-place finisher in the World Cup giant slalom standings 
last year. ``I've since learned to build a wall between myself and 
the outside world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the two runs Saturday, Nef relaxed with teammates at a  
restaurant on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to think about the race or the possibility of  
winning my first giant slalom,'' Nef said. ``That seemed to have 
worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Nef's nerves were tested on the slopes, many skiers had  
theirs challenged on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
	Several racers, including Ottosson, were trapped for about a  
half-hour in one of the gondolas on the way to the top of the 
course before the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little scary,'' said Ottosson, who was stranded along  
with another dozen racers in the ski lift. ``We were all so close 
together in the cabin and it was taking so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the scariest thing was that we were afraid the race would  
start without us.''

<HEADLINE> San Francisco's Japantown Fading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- During World War II, Sam Seiki was among  
thousands of Japanese Americans forced from their homes in 
Japantown and into internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation dealt the bustling Japantown enclave a blow from  
which it never quite recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got talked into a lot of things we didn't want,'' said  
Seiki, 76. ``If the government said go, we went. ... We aren't 
boisterous people so we didn't dissent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seiki isn't sitting quietly anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, Seiki is among those who have returned to Japantown and  
now support efforts to bring back more traditional Japanese 
institutions to revitalize the four-block area that at its height 
was an enterprising 30-block ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a multigenerational, multicultural feeling we're  
trying to promote,'' said Sandy Mori, who is on a task force 
organizing the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Kintetsu and Miyako malls, the centerpiece of  
Japantown, are a sushi lover's paradise dotted with 
Japanese-language bookstores and music shops, at least 22 
businesses are Korean-owned, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual Cherry Blossom Festival draws foot traffic every  
summer, but ``going out of business'' signs are not uncommon in 
family-owned shops. The shops often close when young, American-born 
children don't want to take over, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japantown also has become less important as a cultural center as  
the population becomes more integrated. Among Asians marrying in 
the United States, the Japanese have the highest rate of 
outmarriage, with 60 percent marrying outside their race, according 
to federal researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The forced internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans  
left many residents unable to reclaim their homes because 
discriminatory laws never allowed them to actually own them, 
forcing their American-born friends and children to act as 
surrogate buyers. Many of those homes were torn down in the 
post-war redevelopment boom of the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologically, internment shattered the community, leaving  
many Japanese Americans wary of demonstrating any sense of 
cohesiveness and with a desire to assimilate. Many moved into other 
San Francisco neighborhoods or out of the city altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clustering in the ethnic enclave made people seem un-American  
or suspicious,'' said Lane Hirabayashi, a professor of ethnic 
studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``This stigma echoed down to the third and fourth generation  
folks,'' Hirabayashi said. ``It's difficult to quantify but 
something we have to factor into why going back to Japantown might 
not be a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Tatsuno, who owns San Jose's Nichei Bei Busan general store  
opened by his father in San Francisco in 1902, said the evolving 
community is inevitable. Although his son married a woman from 
Japan, his three daughters all married non-Japanese men. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our family is changing. We're living in America. It's composed  
of not just Japanese -- it's everyone,'' said Tatsuno, 86, who left 
Japantown in 1947 and decided to start fresh in San Jose after his 
toddler son died. ``That's the way it is. The United States is 
international.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The country's Japanese also are increasingly American. According  
to the 1990 census, of all Asians living in the United States, 
nearly 70 percent of Japanese descent were born in this country, 
while 60 percent or more of members of other Asian groups living 
here were born in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic neighborhoods retain their character more if there is  
that influx, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Seiki, who has learned in America to stand up for his  
rights, there is no reason to live anywhere else but in Japantown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was determined to stay here even after I came back. Things  
change but you have that feeling: This is home, I belong here.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Marketing 'Terminator' Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Missouri farmer Bill Christison cuts $20,000  
off the annual cost of growing soybeans by saving seed from one 
year's crop to plant the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
	So he does not like the idea that seed companies could stop him  
from doing that by genetically engineering seeds to block 
reproduction. Worse, to Christison, the federal government invented 
a ``terminator'' process for rendering seeds sterile and now 
actively is trying to get it to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that the U.S. government will wake up and look at  
what they are facilitating here,'' Christison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department researchers say the terminator process is  
misunderstood and has applications that could benefit farmers all 
over the world. The same technique that renders seeds sterile by 
turning certain genetic traits on and off also could be used to 
make plants resistant to drought or pests, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents of genetic engineering in the United States and  
especially in Europe have made the terminator issue a symbol of 
what they see as the evils of biotechnology. To them it is immoral 
for the U.S. government to promote and profit from such an 
invention, even if private companies are developing terminator 
processes of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The department developed the terminator technology at a  
laboratory in Texas and secured a joint patent last year with 
Scott, Miss.-based Delta &AMP; Pine Land Co., the world's largest 
cotton seed company, which co-sponsored the research. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is officially known as the ``technology protection  
system.'' The terminator nickname is a reference to the on-screen 
robotic killer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monsanto Co., seeking Justice Department approval to acquire  
Delta &AMP; Pine Land, recently announced it would not use terminator 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government is continuing research and is close to  
finishing negotiations on a marketing license with Delta &AMP; Pine 
Land for commercializing the technology, Agriculture Department 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	If Monsanto refuses to use the technology, the department would  
have the right to find another company that would. Officials will 
not say what they will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``First we have to see if Monsanto's purchase goes through. It's  
too hypothetical to be talking about,'' said department spokesman 
Andy Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has no plans to relinquish the patent, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``As co-holders of the patent we are in the room and in  
discussions with D&AMP;PL about whether or if or how there would be any 
commercialization. We think it's important that we be there to 
represent the public interest,'' Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
	One critic of genetic engineering, Hope Shand, research director  
of Rural Advancement Foundation International, said: ``The specter 
of genetic seed sterilization is particularly alarming given the 
rapid rate of consolidation of the global seed industry. Seed is 
the first link in the food chain. Whoever controls the seed has a 
stranglehold on the food supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's terminator research ``is a misallocation of  
precious ... research dollars and will benefit only a handful of 
big corporations,'' said Adam Goldberg, a spokesman for Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In developing countries, it is common for farmers to save seed  
from year to year. Christison, who is president of the National 
Family Farm Coalition, estimates that 25 percent of U.S. producers 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetically engineered crops, which are making up an increasing  
share of U.S. production, cannot be reproduced legally. Farmers 
also buy new seeds each year for corn and hybrid versions of other 
crops because they lose their special characteristics after the 
first generation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, an estimated 57 percent of the soybeans,  
38 percent of the cotton and 30 percent of the corn planted this 
year was genetically engineered, either to resist pests or 
herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA believes seed companies must be allowed to protect  
investments in new varieties of seeds if they are to continue 
developing crops that are hardier, more nutritious and require 
fewer applications of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the terminator process is still several years away  
from being commercially available, said Sandy Miller Hayes, a 
spokeswoman for department's Agricultural Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, it has been shown to work only in tobacco, which is  
used as a model plant species in agricultural research, and in 
cotton. The first applications likely would be in cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be used only in crops that do not cross-pollinate, such  
as cotton, soybeans and wheat, she said. In cross-pollinating 
plants like corn, fields of nonterminator varieties could be made 
sterile.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Paper Cites McCain for Temper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The largest newspaper in John McCain's home state  
is questioning whether the Republican senator has the temperament 
to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic, in an editorial running in Sunday  
editions, criticizes McCain for a ``volcanic'' temper it says he 
has unleashed on other politicians, reporters and even the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``If McCain is truly a serious contender for the presidency, it  
is time the rest of the nation learned about the John McCain we 
know in Arizona,'' the newspaper says in the editorial, a copy of 
which was provided to The Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is also reason to seriously question whether he has  
temperament, and the political approach and skills, we want in the 
next president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Johnson, The Republic's senior vice president/news and  
executive editor, said Saturday the newspaper decided to run the 
editorial partly out of frustration that the American electorate is 
not getting the complete McCain story from the national media. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very much to be admired and applauded about John  
McCain,'' Johnson said in a telephone interview with the AP. ``But 
there is a less full-bodied portrayal at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying McCain's temper is a legitimate campaign issue, The  
Republic notes in its editorial that he has unleashed his temper on 
several top Arizona officials -- including Gov. Jane Hull, former 
Gov. Rose Mofford and former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	It also cites heated disagreements with fellow senators and says  
McCain has called some reporters who asked tough questions 
``liars'' and ``idiots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Dan Schnur on Saturday did not deny that his  
boss gets angry, adding that questions about his temperament are 
fair game. But Schnur portrays McCain's anger as passion-driven, 
rather than some major character flaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voters ought to decide for themselves if they want a candidate  
who gets angry when they seen an injustice, or would they rather 
have someone who rolls over and hides,'' Schnur says. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial was prompted by a recent New York Times article in  
which Mrs. Hull spoke of McCain's temper, pretending to a hold a 
telephone receiver inches from her ear for effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, who has endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said her  
relations with McCain were ``not particularly warm'' and that his 
temper is ``something that John has to keep control of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain blamed the Bush campaign for helping plant the story and  
said the hothead portrayal was inaccurate. ``But do I insult 
anybody or fly off the handle or anything like that? No, I don't,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic calls McCain's reaction to Mrs. Hull's comments  
``hogwash'' and says McCain ``is running dangerously close to 
sanctimony in his bid for the presidency, depicting himself as the 
last honorable politician in America.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Fire Destroys Aquarium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A fire sparked by two explosions gutted  
an aquarium in this seaside town Saturday night, killing at least 
three dozen animals. 
</P>
<P>
	A few survived, including a turtle, an 18-foot African rock  
python and three alligators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ocean City Aquarium was closed for the day when the fire  
started. Investigators had not determined the cause of the 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Christina Arsenis said she called authorities around  
8:15 p.m. after she heard the blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a huge fire. You couldn't see the houses on the street  
for all the smoke,'' said Arsenis, who lives three doors down from 
the aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the buildings around the 4-year-old facility were  
threatened by the blaze, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 iguanas and 24 snakes were killed. Firefighters  
spotted the python slithering through the building as they were 
putting out the last of the flames.

<HEADLINE> School Wants Apology Over Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The head of an East Harlem school says Miramax  
Films should apologize for a new Meryl Streep film that depicts the 
school as plagued by violence and shoddy teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, we probably should not have used the name of  
the school,'' Elizabeth Clark, senior vice president of Miramax, 
said in response to objections raised by some educators about 
``Music of the Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which opened Friday, stars Streep as Roberta Guaspari,  
who received widespread notice for teaching violin at the Central 
Park East 1 elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators say the film misrepresents the school, citing scenes  
such as a drive-by shooting, a racially hostile parent and an 
incident involving a student with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking it very seriously,'' said Larry Speigel, the  
school's assistant director. ``There's a lot of dissension about 
what has happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School director Jane Andreas, who said she has not seen the  
film, said others had told her the school and its ``vibrant and 
wonderful neighborhood are portrayed as very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the initial credits, (Miramax) should make an apology  
saying, `This is a misrepresentation,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music of the Heart'' tells how, after a school board  
threatened to cut off funding for Guaspari's program, concert 
violinists Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman and Arnold Steinhardt 
stepped in to help by performing with her students at a Carnegie 
Hall benefit. Her violin program is now partially supported by a 
foundation, Opus 118. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clark of Miramax said the film's producers had not intended  
to create a false impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not really about the actual school,'' she said. ``The  
school is just the canvas. The story is about how she (Ms. 
Guaspari) saved the music program. ... There is no violence that 
occurs in the school. It's a fictionalized school, and the name 
shouldn't have been used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name was used because the film ``is the story of Roberta  
Guaspari's life, and that is the school that she taught at,'' Ms. 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nuances about why the school is so different are not what  
the movie is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Guaspari, who was a consultant on the film, no longer  
teaches at CPE1 and holds classes at another area school, Ms. 
Andreas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated calls seeking comment from Ms. Guaspari were referred  
to Miramax, which did not make her available. In a Miramax 
statement, Ms. Guaspari said she was ``very proud'' of the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unusual for filmmakers to take a true story and  
expand on it to include composite and invented characters and 
fictionalized events for dramatic purposes,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times previously had quoted Ms. Guaspari as saying  
almost every calamity that befalls pupils in the film was a 
fabrication. ``You need to know that the environment they portrayed 
is not like our school,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Seeks Catholic School Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Cheered on by thousands of children and  
teachers, Pope John Paul II on Saturday called for equal funding 
for Catholic schools in one of the biggest rallies at St. Peter's 
Square in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates ranged as high as 200,000 for the lively crowd, which  
filled the piazza and spilled out onto the long boulevard leading 
into the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's bishops and John Paul have pressed for government  
financial help for Catholic schools through tax credits to parents 
or other means. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent moves in that direction ``unfortunately were not  
enough,'' John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnout from across Italy far surpassed the prediction of  
80,000. Politicians attended as well, with Italy's education 
minister among those applauding when John Paul urged parity between 
state and church schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the current setup ``ever less bearable,'' John Paul said  
the solution was ``full recognition of legal and economic parity 
between state and non-state schools, overcoming the old objections, 
which are foreign to the basic values of the European cultural 
tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of state support for church schools has divided  
Italy's center-left government. Leftist opponents to the funding 
sent schoolchildren marching through Rome in their own, much 
smaller demonstrations earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's rally -- on a sunny autumn morning -- drew a rare,  
wide smile from the pope, whose face as he has aged has stiffened, 
which some attribute to Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A little boy and girl approached the papal throne to present  
bouquets of flowers, then milled about, as if unwilling to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul laughed out loud, leaning forward to stroke the  
children's faces.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Delay Dismays Safety Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Federal officials say they have no evidence that  
Boeing Co. intentionally covered up a 19-year-old safety report 
that could have clued investigators in to what caused the crash of 
TWA Flight 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board told  
aides to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, that the report by Boeing -- 
commissioned by the Air Force to look into problems with the 
military version of Boeing's 747 -- could have directed them to the 
fuel tanks immediately rather wasting months searching for evidence 
of a missile attack or bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI spent over a year following reports of suspicious  
streaks in the sky, feared to be a surface-to-air missile, before 
announcing in November 1997 that mechanical failure was to blame. 
All 230 people on board Flight 800 died. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement Friday, the NTSB expressed  
``displeasure'' and ``dismay'' about the three-year delay between 
the crash and the discovery of the report this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said they only learned of the report's  
existence in March after it was listed on the agenda for an Air 
Force task force studying the safety implications of the Flight 800 
explosion. Boeing turned the report over to the NTSB in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-volume report focuses on whether excess heat from air  
conditioners in Boeings E-4B military jet could create highly 
flammable fuel vapors in the central fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Young, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said  
Saturday that differences between the E-4B and the 747 made the 
report largely irrelevant to the TWA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The E-4B, for example, has four air conditioning units under the  
fuselage, compared with three in a standard 747, and the air 
conditioners often run for long periods in the E-4B while it is on 
the ground, Young said. The E-4B also burns a different fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was overlooked by employees in the commercial  
airplane division because it dealt with a military aircraft, Young 
said. He said the company's procedures have since been changed to 
prevent that from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, although the relevance of that (report) is  
questionable, we wish we had found it earlier and passed it 
along,'' Young said. ``There didn't seem to be any realization on 
the military side (of the company) that the investigation was 
relevant or potentially relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, which conducts congressional  
probes, has been interviewing employees at Boeing and the Air Force 
and has found no evidence of an intentional cover-up, Grassley 
aides said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is chairman of the subcommittee that oversees airline  
disaster investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	After being briefed by the GAO Friday, Grassley said the TWA 800  
tragedy could have been prevented if Boeing had brought it out 
after a 1990 fuel tank explosion on a Philippines Airline Boeing 
737 at an airport in Manilla. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's a matter of public safety, the ethic for both  
manufacturers and regulators must be to overreport,'' Grassley said 
Saturday. ``If the NTSB had been given the 1980 report and others, 
it could have pressed the FAA to set the very standards finally 
proposed this week for airplane fuel tanks. The document, 
regardless of what it says, should have been reported to the 
NTSB.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday announced  
proposed regulations to make airplane fuel tanks less susceptible 
to explosions by requiring that new planes contain fuel systems 
that minimize flammable vapors and that aircraft makers develop new 
maintenance programs for fuel tanks within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB hopes to complete its report on the crash of Flight 800  
by next spring.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Toxic Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that use even the smallest amounts  
of highly toxic chemicals will be required to report the use to the 
public, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Current federal regulations require only companies that use  
large amounts of extremely toxic chemicals, like mercury and 
dioxin, to disclose their use. The new rules, Clinton said in his 
weekly radio address, would force companies that use much smaller 
amounts to follow the same disclosure guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll require companies to inform the public even if they're  
using smaller quantities,'' the president said, ``in some cases 
just 10 pounds a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that lowering the amount for disclosure will help  
communities force polluting companies to act more responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	``By requiring industries to tell communities how much they  
pollute the air and water, we empower citizens to fight back, and 
create a powerful incentive for industry to pollute less,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private watchdog  
group, praised the new rules action but said they contained ``some 
serious flaws.' It cited the absence of lead, a substance known to 
hinder children's development, from the list of substances. 
</P>
<P>
	On another environmental topic, Clinton criticized the  
Republican-sponsored Interior Department spending bill, which he 
said ``is laden with provisions that would benefit special 
interests at the expense of our public interest and our 
environment.'' He promised to veto the bill if it is sent to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I am taking action to protect communities against toxic  
chemicals, Congress is giving special interests license to pollute 
our public lands,'' Clinton said. ``While I'm taking action to save 
some of our most treasured places, Congress is putting other 
precious lands at greater risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also announced that the non-profit Wildlands  
Conservancy is donating to the federal government an additional 
14,000 acres of the Joshua Tree National Park in California. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said he plans to begin negotiating with Congress to  
purchase the Baca Ranch in New Mexico, which has one of the world's 
largest herds of wild elk.

<HEADLINE> 13-Year-Old Said Incapable of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A murder case against one of the youngest  
defendant's in U.S. history -- a boy accused at age 11 of shooting a 
man outside a convenience store -- is as flawed as the ``piece of 
junk'' rifle that fired the fatal shot, his attorney told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Friday, attorney Geoffrey Fieger said  
Nathaniel Abraham had no intent to kill anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be zero evidence that he had any motive to kill  
Ronnie Greene,'' Fieger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was killed outside a Pontiac party store on Oct. 29,  
1997. Prosecutors say Nathaniel knew exactly what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Lisa Halushka said Nathaniel even told his girlfriend  
prior to the killing that ``I'm gonna shoot somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A clearer intent was never spoken,'' the prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel, now 13, is being tried as an adult on first-degree  
murder charges. If convicted, he could get life in prison without 
parole, be held in a juvenile center until he turns 18, or receive 
a blended sentence in which he would be held until age 21 and then 
re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel also is on trial on charges of firing at neighbor  
Michael Hudack hours before Greene was shot once in the head 
outside the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger said Greene was killed by a bullet that bounced off a  
tree, adding that the rifle was defective and even a marksman 
aiming at Greene would have missed him with that gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nathaniel had a .22-caliber rifle ... it had no stock, it is a  
piece of junk,'' Fieger said. ``It couldn't shoot straight if it 
had wanted to. This is a broken weapon. It can't be aimed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said Nathaniel was standing about 100 yards away  
when the shot was fired. On Friday, prosecutors said tests now show 
the shot was fired from about 66 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel's lawyers also have maintained that the boy, a slow  
learner, could not have understood his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudack and Oakland County's medical examiner testified later  
Friday before proceedings were recessed until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudack said he was home when he heard a noise resembling a  
firecracker. When he went outside, he said, something whizzed past 
his face. He said he looked to his left and spotted Nathaniel and 
another boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nate was holding something in his hand. It appeared to be a  
gun,'' Hudack testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Under defense questioning, Hudack acknowledged he couldn't say  
with certainty who fired at him and that ``I don't know that 
(Nathaniel) was trying to shoot me or if he was shooting at the 
garage.''

<HEADLINE> Germans Ban Cell Phone Use in Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Don't drink and drive. But don't speak and drive?  
That too, after a German law banning the use of cell phones while 
driving takes effect next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's transport minister told a newspaper that the  
government plans to fine drivers $32 for talking on a cell phone 
without using a hands-free device like a speakerphone. 
</P>
<P>
	No exact date was given for the law banning ``handys,'' as cell  
phones are called in German, to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both hands on the wheel, eyes on the street -- that's the only  
way to increase safety,'' Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt said 
in an interview to be published Sunday in Bild am Sonntag. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine  
found that talking on a phone while driving quadrupled the risk of 
an accident and was almost as dangerous as being drunk behind the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other countries have banned the use of cell phones while  
driving. In the United States, the Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn, 
Ohio began fining drivers last month under a cell phone driving 
ordinance believed to be the first in the country.

<HEADLINE> Taliban: Bin Laden Wants To Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, wanted by the United  
States for the bombing of two American embassies last year, has 
asked for permission to leave Afghanistan, the ruling Taliban 
religious army said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden's departure could lift the threat of U.N. sanctions on  
Afghanistan, where he has been living for years. The Taliban has 
resisted pressure from the United States to hand him over to be 
tried on charges of planning the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania that killed 224 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has threatened to impose sanctions on  
Afghanistan if it did not turn over bin Laden by Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Taliban spokesman Tayyab Agha said that bin Laden asked for  
permission to leave Afghanistan in a letter Friday to the Islamic 
movement's reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden asked the Taliban to provide him security while he is  
moving out and not disclose his destination, Agha told The 
Associated Press by telephone from the southern Afghan city of 
Kandahar. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking the Taliban's permission to leave is viewed as just a  
courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration official, who insisted on anonymity,  
said the U.S. government had seen the report of bin Laden's 
request, but that it ``falls far short'' of the U.N. resolution 
that the militia deliver him for trial in the United States or 
another able country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal remains the same -- that bin Laden be brought to  
justice,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is consensus among the Taliban leadership that if bin  
Laden wants to leave Afghanistan, he won't be stopped, Agha said. 
He said the leaders would meet in the next few days to discuss the 
issue, but also said the Taliban was prepared to protect him in 
``days to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agha insisted the Taliban did not pressure bin Laden to leave.  
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps Osama wants to leave Afghanistan because he feels that  
the country is facing a lot of hardships because of his stay 
here,'' Agha said. ``We have provided shelter to Osama for so long 
and resisted the American pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saudi-born bin Laden, believed to be in his mid-30s, first  
came to prominence in Afghanistan in the 1980s, fighting alongside 
the U.S.-backed mujahedeen against Russian forces. After the war, 
he built up a movement opposed to the U.S. military presence in 
Saudi Arabia and emerged as a hero of Islamic resistance to U.S. 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, the United States fired Tomahawk missiles on  
Afghanistan, targeting bin Laden's alleged camps for training 
Islamic militants. Bin Laden is also on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted 
List, and the U.S. government has offered a $5 million reward for 
information leading to his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Turkish security forces have been put on alert  
against possible attacks by bin Laden supporters on U.S. and 
British targets there, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency 
reported today. Bin Laden's supporters reportedly have entered the 
country over the past three months with false passports, the agency 
said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force DB Knocked Unconscious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Air Force defensive back Tony Metters was  
knocked unconscious and was removed by ambulance during the fourth 
quarter of BYU's 27-20 victory over Air Force on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Metters, a 6-foot, 185-pound junior safety from Mansfield,  
Texas, was injured on a 57-yard scoring pass from Kevin Feterik to 
Margin Hooks with 10:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Metters and Wes Glisson converged on Hooks as the ball arrived,  
and the collision put both Air Force players on the ground. Hooks 
kept his balance and outraced three other defenders to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	After the play, Metters lay on the turf 12 minutes as trainers  
from both teams attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said Metters had a bloody nose but, after  
regaining consciousness, was able to move his arms and legs. He was 
taken to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center for a precautionary 
neurological examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials later said tests showed no brain damage and Metters  
returned to the Air Force Academy in Colorado with the team.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Clown Max Patkin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAOLI, Pa. (AP) -- Max Patkin, known as the Clown Prince of  
Baseball for his goofy antics in an oversized uniform at minor 
league games, died Saturday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Philadelphia native had been hospitalized with a  
ruptured aorta for a week and died unexpectedly of an aneurysm at 
Paoli Memorial Hospital, his daughter Joy Tietsworth said. Patkin 
had been living with her for several years in Exton. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkin, who starred as himself in the minor league movie  
classic, ``Bull Durham,'' was a minor league pitcher before World 
War II. He began clowning around in lopsided games while in the 
service, catching the attention of Bill Veeck, who hired him as a 
comic coach to boost the attendance of the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Indians began to win and did not need Patkin to draw  
crowds, Veeck got him started with minor league ballclubs. Though 
Patkin always wanted to return to pitching, he was convinced by Joe 
DiMaggio among others to continue with his rubber-faced slapstick, 
which became a baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his most famous routines was to mimic the first baseman  
as he went through infield warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Patkin fell on the dugout steps at Fenway Park and  
injured an ankle, snapping what he estimated to be a streak of more 
than 4,000 consecutive games over 50 years without missing an 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Patkin made headlines when he was robbed on camera  
while filming a television special in downtown Philadelphia. Patkin 
helped ensure a lenient sentence by asking the judge to go easy on 
the man, who took $35 from Patkin's hand and ran off. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans remember Patkin handing out baseball cards of himself.  
Doctors said Patkin was handing out his cards from his hospital bed 
the night before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great father. I love him dearly. And I'm really going  
to miss him,'' Tietsworth said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Announces Arms Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon announced arms deals Friday with  
Israel, Egypt, South Korea and Norway worth more than $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal valued at $508 million, Israel will buy 24 AH-64  
Apache attack helicopters converted to the latest model, called the 
Apache Longbow, equipped with more sophisticated targeting and 
radar systems. The sale, subject to congressional review, includes 
480 Hellfire II laser-guided missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Pentagon said the proposed sale will give  
Israel a better capability to attack armored vehicles, ``provide 
for the defense of vital installations'' and provide better close 
air support for its ground forces. It said the deal would not 
affect the region's basic military balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel also is proposing to buy 518 heavy trucks for $117  
million. The 10-ton trucks will be used to carry artillery 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Egypt is for two Gulfstream IV-SP aircraft, valued  
at $180 million, to be used to transport national leaders. Egypt 
also is requesting to buy 239 Humvee utility vehicles for $30 
million to replace jeeps and to outfit with TOW anti-tank weapon 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway, a NATO ally of the United States, will pay $2.6 billion  
for 30 F-16 fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea is buying 20 F-16s, minus the engines, for $379  
million. It has not decided whether to buy Pratt &AMP; Whitney 
F-100-PW-200 or General Electric F-110-GE-129 engines to power the 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea also will buy 29 multiple-launch rocket systems,  
which are long-range artillery, plus associated equipment for $498 
million. The weapons are needed to counter North Korean long-range 
artillery and rocket systems, the Pentagon said in justifying the 
deal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Destroyer for Chafee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton announced today he is  
honoring the late Sen. John Chafee by naming a warship after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving the White House to attend Chafee's funeral in  
Providence, R.I., Clinton said the 40th ship of the Arleigh Burke 
class of guided-missile destroyers will honor the Rhode Island 
Republican who died of heart failure Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given Senator Chafee's long association with the sea -- with  
the Marine Corps, the Navy and the great maritime state of Rhode 
Island -- I can think of no better way to honor his many 
contributions than to name a warship in his honor,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Burke-class destroyers are among the Navy's  
most technologically advanced ships. The one named for Chafee, who 
died Sunday night at Bethesda Naval Hospital in suburban Maryland, 
will ``carry on Senator Chafee's legacy of honorable service to our 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to military service in two wars, Chafee served as  
secretary of the Navy under President Nixon and was in the Senate 
from 1976 until his death. Many members of the Senate were joining 
Clinton at the funeral.

<HEADLINE>  Swiss Woman Wins First Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIGNES, France (AP) -- Switzerland's Sonja Nef overcame a fragile  
knee and weak nerves Saturday, winning the season's opening World 
Cup giant slalom for her first career triumph in the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Nef, who had built a reputation of posting brilliant opening  
runs then bottoming out in the second, didn't flinch Saturday. She 
compiled two solid performances for an aggregate time of 2 minutes, 
31.39 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work I've been doing with my mental trainer over the past  
year has paid off,'' Nef said after collecting her first win since 
1996. ``He helped me overcome my emotional sensibility and helped 
me put less pressure on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After taking a .42-second lead in the opening run, many expected  
Nef to crumble in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	But she remained relaxed, ignoring the fog and the pelting, wet  
snow to post the fastest second run in 1:15.55, and finish a 
stunning 1.61 seconds ahead of her nearest rival, Sweden's Anna 
Ottosson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottosson, who had a two-run time of 2:33.00, was followed by  
Austria's Anita Wachter at 2:33.51. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup overall and giant slalom champion Alexandra  
Meissnitzer of Austria veered off course in the opening run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachter, a 16-year veteran of the women's circuit, trailed by  
1.51 seconds after the first run, but had a sensational second run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first run wasn't so good for me,'' said Wachter, the 1993  
overall World Cup champion and winner of 18 World Cup races. 
``Visibility was very poor and I was afraid to go fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the second leg I took many risks. I'd been aiming for  
top-five so a podium finish is a good start to my season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To many, Nef's victory was surprising.  
</P>
<P>
	Nef, who had been training alone the past three years because a  
weak knee prevented her from keeping up with the rest of the Swiss 
team, repeatedly had failed to convert a solid first run into a 
victory. Last year, she posted top-five finishes five times in the 
giant slalom, including two podium places. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably the only top skier who wasn't seeing a sports  
psychologist,'' said Nef, whose only other career victory was in a 
slalom at Sestriere, Italy, in 1996. ``I figured you don't want to 
be with someone who makes you start analyzing things too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for the past two years I was stuck between second and  
fifth place in all my races. I figured I needed to find a way to 
break out of my rut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer was Heinz Graf, a driving teacher from Lucerne,  
Switzerland, and a former sports trainer who now helps athletes 
deal with the stress of competition in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nef described herself as ``emotionally sensitive,'' and ``unable  
to cope with difficult situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Poor press reviews and criticism would bother me,'' said Nef,  
the fourth-place finisher in the World Cup giant slalom standings 
last year. ``I've since learned to build a wall between myself and 
the outside world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the two runs Saturday, Nef relaxed with teammates at a  
restaurant on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to think about the race or the possibility of  
winning my first giant slalom,'' Nef said. ``That seemed to have 
worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Nef's nerves were tested on the slopes, many skiers had  
theirs challenged on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
	Several racers, including Ottosson, were trapped for about a  
half-hour in one of the gondolas on the way to the top of the 
course before the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little scary,'' said Ottosson, who was stranded along  
with another dozen racers in the ski lift. ``We were all so close 
together in the cabin and it was taking so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the scariest thing was that we were afraid the race would  
start without us.''

<HEADLINE> Starzz Sign Extension With WNBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Starzz, who have battled low  
attendance for the last three years, signed a three-year contract 
extension with the WNBA on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel what happened towards the end of last season gave us a  
legitimate cause for recognizing the talent that we have,'' Starzz 
owner Larry Miller said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller signed the contract during a news conference Friday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz were 15-17 last season but went 8-3 down the stretch  
with Korie Hlede and Cindy Brown in uniform. The two were acquired 
from Detroit for Wendy Palmer and Olympia Scott-Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Coach) Fred Williams did a nice job of getting that talent  
under control and managing it, making us really start to play 
competitively,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams took over as manager after Frank Layden resigned last  
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's average attendance last season was 7,544, a figure that  
beat only Charlotte's 7,081. Washington led the league with 15,306 
and the WNBA averaged 10,207 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz sold 3,000 season tickets last season, up slightly  
from the year before, but still well short of the league goal of 
5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin O'Connor, the new vice president for basketball operations  
for the Utah Jazz, said he was eager to work with the Starzz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to making our Utah team one of the better  
teams in the league,'' O'Connor said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- UNESCO, a troubled U.N. organization, has  
ceased being an ivory tower for intellectuals and is helping the 
world cope with the pressures of globalization, its retiring 
director general said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's Federico Mayor, a biochemist who has headed the U.N.  
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization for the past 12 
years, also said the 187-nation institution now is recognized a 
leading proponent of freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor said in an interview he would advise his probable  
successor, Japan's Koichiro Matsuura, that the best way to get the 
United States to rejoin UNESCO is to focus more sharply on issues 
such as illiteracy and education spending by developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsuura, Japan's ambassador to France, is expected to be  
endorsed Nov. 15 by the organization's governing board, which is 
based in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain left UNESCO in 1984 and 1985,  
charging the organization was corrupt, mismanaged and opposed to 
Western free press ideals. Britain returned last year but President 
Clinton has said budget constraints prevent the United States from 
rejoining. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials say Mayor has done a good job getting  
UNESCO back to the democratic principles on which it was founded 
after World War II -- promoting human rights and the free flow of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say UNESCO remains hobbled by top-heavy and  
inefficient management. They also contend Mayor spent too much of 
the $544 million biannual budget on special advisers and 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Associated Press by telephone from New  
York, the 65-year-old Mayor reviewed his accomplishments and 
answered criticism of his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNESCO has ceased being an ivory tower and is now  
reinvigorated on the spot in the field listening to the wishes of 
officials and ordinary people and trying to counterbalance the 
technological, financial and economic imperatives that govern 
globalization,'' Mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the organization, which in the early 1980s debated a  
Soviet- approved attempt to establish a ``new world information 
order,'' now ``is recognized throughout the world as the 
institution at the forefront of freedom expression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Koven, the European representative of the World Press  
Freedom Committee, said Mayor does not get enough credit for this 
accomplishment and has made UNESCO respectable again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He turned the organization around on press freedom,'' Koven  
said, ``and took a courageous stand against China when it 
threatened to boycott the organization after UNESCO gave a press 
freedom award to Gao Yu, a jailed Chinese journalist'' who was 
released earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor said unlike other U.N. agencies that deal with a single  
issue such as health or agriculture, UNESCO was like a university, 
managing programs that ranged from education and cultural heritage 
to preserving the world's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	He said even though the United States was not a member, UNESCO  
had a wide range of contacts with American schools, universities 
and scientific organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way to get the United States to come back is to keep  
accomplishing our mission in the best way we can without looking 
for pats on the back,'' Mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering critics of his management, he said independent audits  
by Congress' investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, and 
the Canadian government largely have been favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been disagreements on staff policies but this  
happens at other international organizations as well,'' ' Mayor 
said. ``I have reduced staff by 1,100 posts, a third, since I took 
over but I need to use consultants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said after leaving UNESCO he would establish a private  
foundation. 
</P>
<P>

	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Moore, who finished second in last  
year's Marlboro 500 at California Speedway, may miss Sunday's race 
after being injured in an off-track incident Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Canadian driver was leaving the Player's  
Forsythe Racing motor home on a scooter when he was struck by a 
car. The driver said she had been blinded by the morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore sustained a minor fracture of the forefinger of his right  
hand as well as lacerations on the same hand and a bruised right 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
	He was held out of the scheduled practice and qualifying on  
Saturday, but was later given the opportunity by CART to go onto 
the two-mile oval by himself to see how it felt to drive with the 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	After six laps, three of them above 219 mph, Moore said he  
planned to drive in Sunday's race. Moore will start last in the 
27-car field. 
</P>

<P>
	SAYING GOODBYE: Sunday will apparently be the final CART race  
for longtime star Al Unser Jr., who is parting company with 
Marlboro Team Penske and is expected to switch to the rival Indy 
Racing League in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, who drove his first CART race in 1982, is second only to  
fellow second-generation driver Michael Andretti in victories with 
31 and is a two-time series champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always enjoyed racing with Al, so it will be weird to  
not have him on the same track,'' Andretti said. ``I think Al 
really helped build our series and he will definitely be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, who has gone 69 races since his last victory, will start  
10th in Sunday's race, his 273rd CART race.

	LONG TERM: CART and California Speedway have signed a five-year  
contract extension with the intent of having the season-ending race 
at the Fontana track each season through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Craig, president and CEO of CART, said the sanctioning  
body has now come to agreement on contract extensions of three to 
five years with six tracks, including California, Mid-Ohio, 
Cleveland, Long Beach, Road America and Surfers Paradise, 
Australia.

	MARIO'S AWARD: Longtime open-wheel racing star Mario Andretti,  
who retired from CART after the 1995 season, has been honored by 
CART with a new award in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural CART All-Star Team will be announced in February,  
with the driver amassing the most votes presented with the new 
Mario Andretti Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that racing was my work, but also the joy of my  
life,'' said Andretti. ``It is the ultimate compliment to me that 
CART looks back at thos years and finds them so meaningful and 
worthy of recording. I am genuinely appreciative of everyone who 
continues to acknowledge my part in racing history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy itself was created by noted Western artist Elie  
Hazak, who specializes in bronze sculpture. It is a 38-inch tall, 
95-pound blend of bronze, marble and walnut that represents 
Andretti's years in racing with a globe, an olive tree and replicas 
of the various types of cars Andretti has driven.

as CART's chief stewart. The former Champ Car driver will stay on 
next season as a consultant and then retire. ... Firestone, which

<HEADLINE> Report: Y2K Violence Threat Real </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An FBI report prepared for the nation's law  
enforcement officials says the threat of violence by extremists to 
mark the new millennium is ``very real,'' The Washington Post 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau said in a written statement on Oct. 20 that it was  
preparing the report, entitled Project Megiddo, and would share it 
with police chiefs at their upcoming convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the document analyzes ``the potential for  
extremist criminal activity in the United States by individuals or 
domestic groups who attach special significance to the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported in Sunday's editions that it had obtained a  
copy of the report, which FBI officials have said might eventually 
be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	The first official audience is to be a closed-door meeting of  
the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Charlotte, 
N.C., on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat posed by extremists as a result of perceived events  
associated with the Year 2000 is very real,'' the Post quoted the 
report as saying. ``The volatile mix of apocalyptic religious and 
(New World Order) conspiracy theories may produce violent acts 
aimed at precipitating the end of the world as prophesied in the 
Bible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said that while most of the report focuses on domestic  
threats, one portion is devoted to Jerusalem, where the FBI says an 
influx of tourists making pilgrimages and millennial cults will add 
to the danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israeli officials are extremely concerned that the Temple  
Mount, an area already seething with tension and distrust among 
Muslims and Jews, will be the stage for violent encounters between 
religious zealots,'' the Post quoted the study as saying. 
``Additionally, several religious cults have already made inroads 
into Israel, apparently in preparation for what they believe to be 
the endtimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research report is named Megiddo after an ancient  
battleground in Israel cited in the Bible's New Testament as the 
site of a millennial battle between forces of good and evil. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said earlier it would examine ideologies ``which  
advocate or call for violent action beginning in the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Such ideologies motivate violent white supremacists who seek  
to initiate a race war; apocalyptic cults which anticipate a 
violent Armageddon; radical elements of private citizen militias 
who fear that the United Nations will initiate an armed takeover of 
the United States and subsequently establish a One World 
Government, and other groups or individuals which promote violent 
millennial agendas,'' the FBI said in its earlier statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also outlines indicators of potential violence,  
possible preparations for violence and possible targets of 
millennial extremists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is with fringe, hate or apocalyptic groups or lone  
wolf members of them who may pose a threat,'' FBI spokesman Bill 
Carter said. ``We're not focusing on militias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the report, the Post said agents have discovered that in  
preparation for the new millennium, certain individuals have been 
acquiring weapons, storing food and clothing, raising funds, 
procuring safe houses, preparing compounds, surveying potential 
targets and recruiting converts to their cause.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Feared Dead in Cyclone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALESHWAR, India (AP) -- A cyclone battered a broad swath of  
eastern India for a second day Saturday, knocking out power and 
telephone lines and flattening thousands of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds may have died, said officials in Orissa state, which  
bore the brunt of the storm. While the storm was weakening as it 
moved inland, it wasn't possible to assess the death toll and 
property damage because the area was still inaccessible and cut off 
from communication. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are treating it as a national calamity,'' Prime Minister  
Atal Bihari Vajpayee said. He said the government planned 
assistance equaling $23 million to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 1.5 million people have been displaced or affected by  
the storm. Just two weeks ago another cyclone battered Orissa, 
killing 100 people and injuring 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds must have perished,'' Press Trust of India news  
agency quoted Orissa state Chief Minister Giridhar Gamamg as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue operations were thwarted as the storm pounded the area  
for a second day, dumping rain from eastern India to Bangladesh and 
parts of Myanmar. Air force helicopters and ground troops, loaded 
with food packets, waited for a break. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway leading south from Baleshwar on the state border  
with West Bengal was littered with fallen eucalyptus trees and 
swamped with water. Long lines of trucks lined up on the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
	Local reports said two-thirds of Baleshwar district was  
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 300 army engineers and doctors dispatched by land from  
West Bengal began rescue and relief work, Press Trust of India 
quoted officials as saying. On Friday, 2,000 army soldiers were 
flown to Bhubaneswar, Orissa's state capital, for rescue 
operations, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclone packed 155-mph winds as it crossed the coast at the  
port of Paradwip early Friday, according to R.R. Kelkar, 
director-general of the Indian Meteorological Department. 
Paradwip's port area was damaged considerably, Star News TV 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday, the storm had weakened as it slowly moved inland.  
The cyclone was 20 miles northeast of Bhubaneswar early Saturday 
and moving in a northwesterly direction with winds dropping to 
about 36-42 mph, Kelkar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclone uprooted trees, knocked down utility poles and  
flooded large parts of the coast. Waves reached 13-15 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Calcutta, capital of West Bengal, said 200  
fishermen had not returned home and feared they may have drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen cyclones form every year in the Bay of Bengal,  
but this one had grown since it originated Oct. 25 in the middle of 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
	India recorded cyclones of similar intensity in 1990, 1989 and  
in 1977, he said. The cyclone in 1977 killed an estimated 10,000 
people in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh.

<HEADLINE> Bush Relies on Capitol Hill Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Republican presidential front-runner  
George W. Bush roiled GOP House members this fall by criticizing 
their budget plans, Rep. Roy Blunt stepped forward to calm the 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
	At a private meeting of the rank and file, the Missouri  
Republican stressed that such public faultfinding is rare, and 
occasional disagreements are inevitable, according to one lawmaker 
who attended. ``He said it wasn't meant as a slight against 
anyone,'' this lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt made his defense in his capacity as the Bush campaign  
point man in the House. He is half of a team -- Sen. Paul Coverdell 
of Georgia is his partner -- that is responsible for smoothing the 
way for the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're friends of mine,'' Bush said in a recent interview.  
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell, 60, is a former state party chairman now in his  
second Senate term, a member of the GOP leadership. He has 
long-standing ties to the Bush family and was Peace Corps director 
in the administration of Bush's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt, 49, has risen rapidly in only his second term in the  
House. He was tapped this year to serve as the GOP's chief deputy 
whip after his predecessor in that post, Rep. Dennis Hastert, was 
elevated suddenly to speaker. GOP officials say Hastert had been in 
line to be the Bush campaign's point man in the House, and Blunt 
inherited that portfolio when he moved into the whip's 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Given Bush's status, he and his campaign organization are in  
touch regularly with Republicans in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say that when they were together in Florida recently,  
Bush thanked House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas for his 
restrained response to the budget controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert dispatched top aides to Austin this year to meet with  
campaign aides. Also, Bush's political director, Maria Cino, once 
was a top aide to former Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., who remains close 
to Hastert and the powerful GOP Whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Blunt and Coverdell say there has been no attempt to  
coordinate legislative initiatives with the Bush campaign, although 
communication back and forth is plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously work at being a source of information,'' says  
Coverdell. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial task for Blunt and Coverdell was to line up support  
for the Texas governor. Thus far, about 160 House members and 29 
senators have enlisted publicly -- there are others as yet 
unannounced -- backing that dwarfs any other GOP presidential 
contender's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The endorsement part of this hasn't been the hardest job I've  
ever taken on,'' Blunt says with evident understatement. About 80 
Republicans, he said, ``had gone on record before there was a 
record to go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell notes that at a similar stage in the 1988 campaign,  
Bush's father had only a single Senate endorsement even though he 
was a sitting vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tasks are less public.  
</P>
<P>
	When the governor was on the verge of announcing his views on  
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, for example, GOP officials say 
Coverdell quietly made sure the campaign knew that 20 of 29 of his 
supporters in the Senate opposed the pact. Bush came out against 
the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also say an effort is in the works to encourage Senate  
supporters of Bush to activate their political networks on the 
governor's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, Coverdell has not had to handle the type of blowup  
that confronted Blunt this fall when Bush parted company with a GOP 
plan that would change a tax program designed to benefit the 
working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs  
of the poor,'' Bush said at the time. The comment angered many 
House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to coming to Bush's defense, Blunt arranged for  
Republicans to meet a few weeks later to talk with senior campaign 
strategist Karl Rove. 
</P>
<P>
	Rove, too, sought to reassure lawmakers about Bush's intentions,  
Blunt said. He added that at least one other lawmaker observed that 
while Bush's comments were a rarity for him, other GOP hopefuls, 
Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes among them, routinely criticize the 
Republican majority in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	A more typical task for Blunt was triggered by Elizabeth Dole's  
decision to drop her own presidential campaign. He quickly was on 
the phone to half a dozen lawmakers who had endorsed her. In a few 
hours, all had swung behind the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, when Bush was in Washington earlier this fall, Blunt  
arranged for a small group of uncommitted House members to sit with 
him. The session took place in a hotel suite fit for a 
front-runner, with a grand piano in one room and a commanding view 
of the Washington skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy Blunt came after me for months,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller  
of Illinois, one of the group that met with Bush that day. ``I 
said, how could I endorse someone for president if I've never had a 
conversation with him either in person or on the phone?''

<HEADLINE> School Wants Apology Over Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The head of an East Harlem school says Miramax  
Films should apologize for a new Meryl Streep film that depicts the 
school as plagued by violence and shoddy teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, we probably should not have used the name of  
the school,'' Elizabeth Clark, senior vice president of Miramax, 
said in response to objections raised by some educators about 
``Music of the Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which opened Friday, stars Streep as Roberta Guaspari,  
who received widespread notice for teaching violin at the Central 
Park East 1 elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators say the film misrepresents the school, citing scenes  
such as a drive-by shooting, a racially hostile parent and an 
incident involving a student with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking it very seriously,'' said Larry Speigel, the  
school's assistant director. ``There's a lot of dissension about 
what has happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School director Jane Andreas, who said she has not seen the  
film, said others had told her the school and its ``vibrant and 
wonderful neighborhood are portrayed as very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the initial credits, (Miramax) should make an apology  
saying, `This is a misrepresentation,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music of the Heart'' tells how, after a school board  
threatened to cut off funding for Guaspari's program, concert 
violinists Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman and Arnold Steinhardt 
stepped in to help by performing with her students at a Carnegie 
Hall benefit. Her violin program is now partially supported by a 
foundation, Opus 118. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clark of Miramax said the film's producers had not intended  
to create a false impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not really about the actual school,'' she said. ``The  
school is just the canvas. The story is about how she (Ms. 
Guaspari) saved the music program. ... There is no violence that 
occurs in the school. It's a fictionalized school, and the name 
shouldn't have been used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name was used because the film ``is the story of Roberta  
Guaspari's life, and that is the school that she taught at,'' Ms. 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nuances about why the school is so different are not what  
the movie is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Guaspari, who was a consultant on the film, no longer  
teaches at CPE1 and holds classes at another area school, Ms. 
Andreas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated calls seeking comment from Ms. Guaspari were referred  
to Miramax, which did not make her available. In a Miramax 
statement, Ms. Guaspari said she was ``very proud'' of the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unusual for filmmakers to take a true story and  
expand on it to include composite and invented characters and 
fictionalized events for dramatic purposes,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times previously had quoted Ms. Guaspari as saying  
almost every calamity that befalls pupils in the film was a 
fabrication. ``You need to know that the environment they portrayed 
is not like our school,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Curators Seek Rockwell Reinvention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Perhaps the most recognized American painter of  
the 20th century, Norman Rockwell has always been loved by the 
masses but dismissed as pedestrian by most in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
	Curators of a new touring exhibit, which features the largest  
collection of his paintings outside the Norman Rockwell Museum in 
Stockbridge, Mass., hope to make Rockwell as popular in the 
galleries of New York and Los Angeles as he is in middle America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the people who dismiss him only know him through the  
magazine covers and have never seen his work in person,'' exhibit 
co-curator Anne Knutson said during a break from preparations at 
Atlanta's High Museum of Art, where the seven-city tour begins Nov. 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	``But hopefully they'll come so they can see for themselves that  
he was a classically trained artist and his painting technique was 
outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Saturday Evening Post covers Rockwell is famous for  
started out as full-size paintings and will hang in the exhibit 
entitled ``Pictures for the American People.'' A companion book 
also is available, featuring essays by several art critics and even 
one by his son Peter, a model for several of Rockwell's paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell, who left the Post in the mid-1960s for Look Magazine,  
died in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit features all the whimsy, detail and Americana  
Rockwell is known for, along with several pieces painted in the 
1960s and showcasing the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ms. Knutson, Rockwell would finish his paintings on  
deadline and send them via courier -- sometimes still wet -- from his 
home in Massachusetts to Philadelphia, where they would be 
photographed and shrunk for the cover shots. In some places, the 
actual covers will hang next to the paintings to allow for closer 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors will find a safety pin protruding from ``Babysitter,  
Babysitter'' and pieces of gravel incorporated into the artist's 
account of a moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the true Rockwell,'' Ms. Knutson said of the  
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	However, art historian Ann-Sargent Wooster says the exhibit may  
not be enough to convince longtime Rockwell critics who downplay 
the importance of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of artists and art critics got into the field to revolt  
against just what Rockwell was doing,'' said Wooster, a professor 
at the School of Visual Arts in New York. ``Heck, there's a 
darkness to Disney movies now that isn't even in Rockwell's work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already 30,000 tickets have been sold two weeks before the show,  
which will travel to Chicago, Washington, San Diego, Phoenix, 
Stockbridge, Mass., and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will certainly bring in some people who ordinarily don't  
go to museums,'' said co-curator Maureen Hart Hennessey of the 
Rockwell Museum. ``But not only are we trying to reach new 
audiences, but introduce the whole Rockwell to people who only know 
part of his work.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Trying To Shed 'Wooden' Tag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Call it the vice presidential pause, a  
campaign ailment afflicting only the No. 2 man trying to become No. 
1. The chief symptom is a nagging stiffness of style. Untreated, it 
can make a candidate wooden, unpersuasive, even boring. 
</P>
<P>
	The diagnosis is by Al Gore, who says he was suffering from it  
until he cured himself of taking momentary timeouts in campaign 
speeches to consider whether a position he was taking would 
conflict with White House policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that split second of internal vetting, it goes with that  
job, I'm done with that,'' Gore said, in an overtime 
question-and-answer session after his debate with Bill Bradley, a 
formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination. ``And 
it feels liberating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may be done with the habit of pausing to check his answers  
against presidential policy but obviously he is not done with that 
job. The vice presidency carries constraints when the man holding 
it runs on his own; and this time, there is the added burden of 
voter weariness with President Clinton and scandal. But it also has 
advantages; no vice president who sought his party's nomination has 
been denied it since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is not breaking with the policies of the administration in  
which, the president says, he has been a partner, not just a 
deputy. His problem is to be independent of the past without being 
disloyal to his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence is fine, but only the vice president could have  
arranged to have three members of the Clinton Cabinet come to 
Hanover Wednesday night to praise his performance in his first 
debate with Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	So Gore looks for openings, as in his repeated comments about  
the pesky pause to check a campaign position against Clinton 
policy, the habit he said was one of the reasons for his image 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got that stiff-and-wooden rap in the House and  
Senate,'' Gore said earlier, in an interview with The Associated 
Press. ``It has been as vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly did not pause before answering the first question  
he got in the debate, about scandals in government. ``I understand 
the disappointment and anger you feel toward President Clinton,'' 
he said, although the name had not been mentioned. ``I felt it 
myself.'' But he said that Americans want to focus on the future 
now, that Clinton is his friend and that during the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, he had been working for continuity and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	It all fits the month-old remodeling effort to spruce up the  
candidate and the campaign against the Bradley challenge. Gore said 
it has led him back to the kind of open, and open-ended, campaign 
sessions he held when he first ran for Congress, in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the Dartmouth College debate into one, inviting  
questions before the television cameras went on, and at the end, 
asking anybody who still had unanswered questions to stay in the 
hall and he would answer them. About 100 did. Gore spent an hour 
and a half with them, perched on the front edge of the stage. It 
took on the flavor of a campus bull session. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told them that while he would rather have been unopposed  
for the 2000 nomination, the stiff competition from Bradley has 
been good for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began to change my way of campaigning ... to shed some of  
the approaches that I had adopted as vice president,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is backing Gore, but the vice president hedges about the  
role of the president the rest of the way. ``He'll help me in the 
future,'' Gore said in the AP interview. ``I don't know how. We 
haven't talked about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Gore and his campaigners have talked about, constantly,  
since Sept. 29, is the campaign makeover that shifted headquarters 
from Washington to Nashville, Tenn., set the vice president about 
demanding a weekly diet of debates with Bradley and began the new 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who supports Gore, welcomes  
the new strategy. ``I have been one of the people advocating that 
he needs to be himself -- he needs to get out of the role of vice 
president,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that is his official role. His challenge is to get beyond  
it, to convince voters that he can offer change. For the vice 
president, it is a balancing act. Bradley does not have to prove 
that he would be a change. He is new. 
</P>
<P>
	Hence, the Gore campaign overhaul. ``He's much more Al Gore the  
person,'' Shaheen said. ``I think people saw the real Al Gore,'' 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said after the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	That does leave the question of what took him so long.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, he has been though seven campaigns for Congress and  
vice president, and a brief, futile one for president in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	So this is not a new line of work.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Witness: Shepard Provoked Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A man testified he was angered by a sexual  
advance by gay college student Matthew Shepard inside the same bar 
that Shepard later met up with his alleged killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael St. Clair was the first defense witness called in the  
murder trial of Aaron McKinney. The defense opened its case Friday. 
McKinney, 22, is charged with robbery, kidnapping and murder, and 
could be sentenced to death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys are trying to convince the jury McKinney is guilty  
of manslaughter rather than murder. They have argued that he 
snapped during a drunken, drug-induced rage after a sexual advance 
by Shepard triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Clair told jurors Shepard asked to sit with him inside the  
Fireside Lounge on Oct. 6, 1998, before making a sexual suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really offensive to me,'' St. Clair said. ``It set off  
something inside. It made me angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard later met McKinney and Russell Henderson at the bar,  
where St. Clair said he saw the three leave together. Prosecutors 
say the two lured Shepard out of the bar, took him to a remote area 
where they robbed and beat him. He was left to die tied to a fence 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, 22, is serving two life sentences after pleading  
guilty to murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense testimony began, attorneys asked the judge to  
allow them to use the ``gay panic'' strategy, contending it is 
crucial for jurors to understand why the roofer beat Shepard to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``These life experiences may say how he reacted that evening,''  
defense attorney Dion Custis said in a hearing after prosecutors 
rested their case. ``That is for a jury to decide, not the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha countered that such testimony would give  
others an excuse to kill people they don't like, such as 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have a conspiracy of two people who go out and  
pretend to be homosexuals and commit a robbery and claim homosexual 
panic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Barton Voigt said he would rule on the issue Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, prosecutors rested their case against McKinney.  
</P>
<P>
	During four days of testimony, prosecutors drew a timeline of  
the events, culminating in the playing of McKinney's jailhouse 
confession, in which he described in detail how Shepard was beaten.

<HEADLINE> Tucson To Vote on Water Restriction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- It took 20 years and billions of dollars to  
bring Colorado River water across the desert to thirsty Tucson. It 
took only three years, a funny taste and some burst pipes for 
voters to say ``no, thank you,'' and permanently restrict its use. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucson residents go to the polls again Tuesday, this time to  
decide whether to direct water officials to dump the once-prized 
water into dry stream beds to replenish their groundwater, with 
natural filtration. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the outcome, the 1995 ban on pumping it through  
their taps will remain in effect, even as the city keeps on paying 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballot question is not an easy one in a desert city whose  
groundwater supply is dwindling at the same time rapid growth is 
steadily bringing in more thirsty people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Control of water is power here. There's a lot of people  
fighting over that power,'' said Rich Wiersma, executive vice 
president of the Citizens Alliance for Water Security, which 
supports the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucson is the largest city in the nation still entirely  
dependent on groundwater for its drinking supply. Groundwater also 
irrigates the golf courses and lush lawns replacing the natural 
desert terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades ago, a 336-mile canal called the Central Arizona  
Project was created to pump Arizona's share of the Colorado River's 
water to Phoenix, Tucson and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.7 billion cost of that project is shared among local,  
state and federal governments. Tucson pays $7 million a year toward 
that cost, whether it uses all of its share of the water or not. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Tucson Water first tried to send Colorado River water  
to half its customers in 1992 -- roughly 240,000 people at the time 
-- the utility failed to treat the water to match existing supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the water is more corrosive because it has more  
dissolved salts and minerals -- and it scoured old iron pipes and 
pumped rust and smelly sediment out of people's faucets. In some 
cases, pipes burst. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra minerals also gave the water a stronger taste,  
required bathers to use more soap and built up quickly in 
appliances such as evaporative coolers that are used to air 
condition homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a very serious error in the treatment method,'' Tucson  
Water spokesman Mitch Basefsky said. ``Ever since we've been 
dealing with outrage and mistrust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Basefsky says it is very good water, and notes that about  
25 million people in California, Nevada and Phoenix use and drink 
it each day. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because of the problems, deliveries in Tucson were  
halted in 1994 and the following year voters approved a ballot 
measure that bans Tucson Water from delivering directly to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	So, while the city is still paying its share of the project, it  
is drawing only about 18 percent of its allotted share of the 
water; most of it goes to recharge the city's aquifer and the rest 
is used for farm irrigation. What Tucson doesn't use goes through 
other communities' faucets. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the ballot measure, Proposition 200, argue that by  
pouring Tucson's allotment into stream beds and washes, the 
funny-tasting water would seep into underground aquifers while 
being filtered naturally. Then, the city's wells could bring it 
back to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the plan is scientifically flawed and that any  
water that does trickle underground would end up far away from city 
wells. In essence, it would be throwing the water away. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents have just about given up on Colorado River water.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had nothing but trouble -- odor, stuff coming out, it  
stopped up our cooler. It was a mess,'' said Bill Staggs. ``I 
wouldn't want to take a chance on it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, however, he and other residents may not have a  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	City attorneys are already prepared to challenge Proposition  
200. They argue that the ballot measure violates the state 
Constitution and city charter by withholding elected officials' 
salaries for noncompliance, limiting when the measure could be 
repealed or amended, and requiring more than a simple majority of 
the City Council and mayor to raise water rates. 
</P>
<P>
	And, left as it is, Tucson's groundwater supply could be used up  
by the year 2020, said Barbara Tellman, a senior research 
specialist at the University of Arizona Water Resources Research 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a finite supply of water,'' she said. ``As growth  
continues, we will run out. The question is how soon.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Senators at Chafee Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- President Clinton, about half the U.S.  
Senate and a host of other dignitaries arrived in Rhode Island 
today for the funeral of deceased U.S. Sen. John H. Chafee. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnout of national figures was among the largest ever for  
the funeral of a U.S. senator -- a reflection of the admiration the 
moderate Republican earned during his four decades of public 
service, including 23 years in the Senate. Chafee died Sunday of 
heart failure at age 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee's flag-draped coffin was removed today from the Rhode  
Island State House, where the late senator lay in state since 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Marine Corps pallbears then placed the coffin onto a  
carriage, and two horses pulled the carriage through downtown 
streets lined with people paying their last respects 
</P>
<P>
	Following the carriage on foot were Chafee's five adult  
children, including Warwick Mayor Lincoln Chafee, who is running 
for his late father's seat in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight black limousines completed the procession, carrying  
Chafee's wife, Virginia, and her grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Yagudin Wins at Skate America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Placement was secondary to  
Timothy Goebel. He was too busy making history. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Goebel became the first figure skater to hit three  
quadruple jumps in one program Saturday night, there was no room 
for disappointment in being runner-up to two-time world champion 
Alexei Yagudin at Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel, the first American to complete a quadruple in  
competition last year, nailed a quad salchow-triple toe loop 
combination, a quad toe loop and a solo quad salchow. At the end of 
his jumping jack performance, which moved him from third place to 
second, he covered his face with his hands for a long time and 
seemed to have trouble catching his breath. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the audience was breathless, too, at what it had  
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like hitting three grand slams in one game,'' said  
Goebel, 19, of Rolling Meadows, Ill. ``One is awesome. Two is rare, 
and three has never been done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't believe I did three quads. It was so unreal.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was real enough that many were left wondering why he didn't  
win. But Goebel, beginning just his second year in senior 
competition after a stellar junior career, still lacks artistry. 
His presentation marks dropped him below Yagudin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian wasn't great, but he also hit some difficult  
elements, including a triple axel-triple toe combination and seven 
triples in all. He cut his quad toe loop to a double toe, but still 
was first with six judges. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. champion Michael Weiss had a rough night, falling on his  
first two jumps, dropping him to fourth behind three-time world 
champion Elvis Stojko of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday, Michelle Kwan went after her fourth title in the  
first major international event of the season. Kwan, a two-time 
world winner, three-time U.S. champion and 1998 Olympic silver 
medalist, led heading into the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, that rarest of occurrences in figure skating,  
a stunning upset, was pulled off by Canadians Jamie Sale and David 
Pelletier. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-ranked team in their home country and with only two  
international competitions on their resume, Sale and Pelletier beat 
two-time world champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze in 
pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a big relief for both of us,'' Pelletier said.  
``We've been wanting to win an international for a long time. 
Coming here and winning is one big relief, but I don't think it 
will change anything. I don't see ourselves being any different 
because we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With some unique lifts and two superb throws, Sale and Pelletier  
swept the seven judges in the free skate, worth two-thirds of the 
total score. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, 1998 Olympic silver 
medalists, had a rough go and wound up third behind France's Sarah 
Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult because it is 2,100 meters,'' Sikharulidze  
said of the mile-high altitude that most pairs skaters said had a 
big effect. ``This is a new program and the first competition, and 
that's why it was difficult, too. And normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the skating was bad. We'll look forward to skating  
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three American couples struggled. U.S. champs Danielle and  
Steve Hartsell even messed up a death spiral when she lost an edge 
and her brother fell on top of her. They wound up last out of 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman were fifth, one spot in front of  
Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn. the 1994 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Canadians were done with their routine to ``Love  
Story,'' Pelletier got down on his knees and covered his face with 
his hands. Then he pumped his fists to the crowd, and was joined in 
doing so by Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the audience was reacting, but we are in our own  
world, too,'' Pelletier said. ``You have to focus on the program 
until the end. She is dying, like in the movie, so I can't go like 
this.'' And he pumped his arms again. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an upset of lesser proportions in ice dancing, where  
veterans Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio beat Russians 
Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh. American champions Naomi Lang 
and Peter Tchernyshev were third.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Returns Dubious Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has returned a $1,000  
check from a foreign-born donor because the money is linked to a 
business with possible ties to organized crime in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Questions were raised about the source of the contribution and  
the check was returned,'' Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the first 
lady's Senate campaign, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The questionable donation came from Darina Pavlova, a  
naturalized U.S. citizen who is married to Ilia Pavlov, a U.S. 
resident alien. Pavlov is chief executive of Multigroup, Bulgaria's 
largest private holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	Multigroup is alleged to be linked to criminal activity in  
Bulgaria, although no formal charges have been filed, according to 
U.S. News &AMP; World Report, which cited a confidential cable sent by 
the U.S. Embassy in Bulgaria to Washington officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Pavlova made the donation during an Oct. 22 fund-raiser for  
Mrs. Clinton in Washington. About 300 people attended the event, 
including several celebrities. Mrs. Pavlova came to the party with 
an invited guest, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's campaign returned the money a week later, shortly  
after an inquiry by the magzine. Wolfson, however, said all 
donations are screened to ensure they are legal and appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New  
York, Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent in the Senate race, returned a 
$2,000 donation after learning it came from the son of slain mob 
boss Paul Castellano.

<HEADLINE> Iowa, N.H. Caucuses Put at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- This year's fight over the presidential  
nomination calendar could lead to the end of the 
first-in-the-nation status of Iowa and New Hampshire, Iowa 
Democratic Chairman Rob Tully said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is it's going to be tough for us in 2004 to retain  
this,'' Tully said. ``There's a lot of animosity around the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a fight occurs every four years over the lineup of  
primaries and caucuses, this year's battle saw a split between Iowa 
and New Hampshire that could doom both, Tully said at a television 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	The two parties use different systems to set their political  
calendars. Democrats establish national party rules, which spell 
out the calendar. Republicans let each state sort through the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In past election cycles, Republicans and Democrats in Iowa and  
New Hampshire have worked together to fend off challenges from 
other states seeking the attention that comes during early 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, things went differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Iowa went through four different dates for its precinct  
caucuses, forced to move earlier in the process as other states 
moved up. The final move came when Iowa set its events for Jan. 24 
after New Hampshire surprised everyone by picking Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, the maneuvering in New Hampshire that forced us  
to go to the 24th has added fuel to the fire,'' said Tully, a 
member of the Democratic National Committee's special panel that 
deals with the political calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you from personal experience that there are people  
on that committee who are salivating to get rid of Iowa and New 
Hampshire,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Skaters Win at Sprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- China's Yang Yang sprinted past Canada's  
Annie Perrault on the second lap and went on to win Saturday's 
women's 500-meter race at the short-track speed skating World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrault, the Olympic gold medalist in 1998, took the lead  
quickly but couldn't hold off Yang. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrault won the 500 in a World Cup meet in Montreal last week  
only to be disqualified for stretching -- lifting a skate off the 
ice in an effort to edge an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I finished second,'' Perrault said. ``It was nice for me.  
It was a very clean race. I started in front, but she passed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yang was clocked in 45.305 seconds, while Perrault came in at  
45.474. 
</P>
<P>
	Chikage Tanaka of Japan was third at 45.522 and Dandan Sun of  
China fourth in 45.755. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaijun Li of China won the men's 500-meter sprint at Provo's  
Peaks Ice Arena in 42.772. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arena will play host to some Olympic hockey games in  
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Dong-Sung Kim of Korea was second in 42.940, narrowly edging  
Apolo Ohno of the United States, who was clocked in 42.944, while 
Takehiro Kodera of Japan was fourth in 43.545. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges advanced Ohno, the 17-year-old world junior champion,  
into the final after he was fouled in a semifinal race. Takafumi 
Nishitani of Japan, the reigning Olympic champion, was charged with 
the infraction and disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' Rison Arrested for Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Andre  
Rison was one of six people arrested Saturday for fighting outside 
a Kansas City nightspot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were called at about 2 a.m. to a disturbance outside  
the Have A Nice Day Cafe in the city's Westport entertainment 
district, police spokesman Floyd Mitchell said. Security guards 
detained several people before police made the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said the six were taken to police headquarters and  
booked for disorderly conduct by fighting in public. No further 
details were released. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief spokesman Bob Moore said he had no information about the  
incident. He said it would be a personal matter involving an 
individual, not the team, and that the Chiefs' policy is not to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk about these issues,'' Moore said. ``Let the  
legal system run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rison, 32, signed with the Chiefs as a free agent in 1997, after  
being released by the Green Bay Packers. He played earlier for 
Jacksonville, Cleveland, Atlanta and Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rison, a five-time Pro Bowler, has not been a factor for the  
Chiefs this season, with only seven catches for 75 yards and no 
touchdowns. He caught 112 passes in his first season with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hampered with a hamstring injury last season, but started  
13 games and had 40 catches. 
</P>
<P>
	Rison, who has an unlisted telephone number, could not be  
immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rison went to four straight Pro Bowls beginning in 1990 with  
Atlanta. But when the Chiefs signed him prior to the 1997 season, 
he had played for four different teams in two seasons and was 
branded by many as a clubhouse problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1997, Rison was arrested and charged with disorderly  
conduct in Lawrenceville, Ga., after refusing to get out of his car 
after a traffic stop. Rison was released from custody after paying 
a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Rison and Deion Sanders, then a member of the San  
Francisco 49ers, were fined $7,500 each by the NFL for a fight in 
which they traded slaps and punches in the middle of the field 
during a game between the Falcons and the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over this season as the Chiefs' head coach, Gunther  
Cunningham initiated a new policy requiring the team to stay 
together in a hotel the night before a home game. The move was 
aimed at curbing the tendency of many players to frequent the 
Westport area on Saturday nights.

mixed-race family in northern England directed by newcomer Damien 
O'Donnell, was awarded the Golden Ear of Corn for best picture at 
the Valladolid Film Festival in Spain on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Roth won the second-place Silver Ear of Corn for his far  
darker journey into family life and incest in ``The War Zone,'' the 
actor's debut as a director. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Basset, who plays the Caucasian wife of a Pakistani  
shopkeeper in ``East is East,'' was named as best actress by the 
jury of the international film festival, held yearly in this 
north-central Spanish city. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese actor/director Beat Takeshi was named best actor for  
his role in his own film ``Kikujiro,'' a humorous journey of 
self-discovery marking a departure from the gangster focus of his 
previous movies.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Wins Japanese GP Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUZUKA, Japan (AP) -- Two-time Formula One champion Michael  
Schumacher, who has the pole for the season-ending Japanese Grand 
Prix, could be a valuable blocker Sunday for Ferrari teammate Eddie 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the Irishman who has a chance to give the Italian  
automaker its first series driving championship in 20 years. But 
Schumacher, who won the title twice while he was with Benetton, 
could be the key to Irvine's success. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Schumacher would love to win the race, the most  
important thing he can do is make sure McLaren's Mika Hakkinen does 
not. Hakkinen, the defending series champion, starts second. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory gives him the title. A second-place finish and a  
result of fourth of better by Irvine gives him the crown. Hakkinen, 
who trails Irvine by four points, cannot win the title by finishing 
third or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see how we can improve his situation for tomorrow,''  
Schumacher said Saturday. ``That is one strategy, and at the moment 
things look good for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher is the focus because Irvine crashed after qualifying  
fifth, meaning the Irishman would have to pass four cars -- no easy 
task on the 3.644-mile Suzuka circuit -- to reach the front. If 
Schumacher wins and Hakkinen is second, Irvine will have to get by 
only the Jordan of Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who starts fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	That might prove the easiest of his tasks. Should Frentzen move  
up a spot, Irvine might encounter David Coulthard, Hakkinen's 
teammate, who starts third. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard is excited about his possible role in the  
season-finale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obviously beneficial for the team that Eddie has had a  
bad qualifying session, so maybe I will be able to help a little 
bit in the race, to try and give Mika the four plus points that he 
needs,'' Coulthard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's pole, achieved when he got around the twisting road  
course in 1 minute, 37.470 seconds, was the 23rd of his career. It 
certainly is the most important of the year for Ferrari, which last 
took the constructors title in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by Schumacher could achieve that even if Irvine fails  
to win the driving title. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen would already be the champion had an appeals court not  
overruled race officials who disqualified the 1-2 Ferrari finish 
two weeks ago in the Malaysian Grand Prix. He knows what he wants 
to do Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go to the starting grid and see what happens at the lights,''  
he said of the procedure that sends each field toward the vital 
first turn. ``Once they change we can start planning. Those are the 
first tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was not hurt, but his car was damaged after he lost  
control at a curb, skidded off the track into the tire barrier and 
spun three times.

<HEADLINE> Fire at S.Korea Store Kills 57 </HEADLINE>

</P>

                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A fire raged through a four-story  
building crowded with young weekend shoppers and diners today in 
northwestern South Korea, killing at least 57 people, many of them 
teen-agers, police said. It was the worst fire in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy people were injured, some of them seriously. Police said  
the death toll may rise further because some of the injured people 
were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out around 7 p.m. in Inchon, South Korea's third  
largest city, 30 miles west of Seoul. The blaze gutted the building 
packed with restaurants, karaoke clubs, a beer bar and billiard 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims were teen-agers or in their early 20s,  
police said. The building was located in the city's central 
commercial district, which was bustling with young people on the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire engines rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire in 40  
minutes, police said. The cause of the fire was still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the dead were found in a second-floor beer bar and  
third-floor billiard room, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire spread so quickly that by the time we got into the  
beer bar, we found many people already dead. They appeared to have 
suffocated from the smoke,'' said local police chief Park 
Myong-hwan. ``Many of the bodies were found clustered near the 
bar's main door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV footage showed firefighters picking through the scorched  
stores and restaurants. Police carried injured people to ambulances 
and raced to nearby hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many people carried out of the building, but  
there were not enough ambulances and so firefighters left them on 
the pavement and rushed back inside to get more people out,'' 
witness Woo Sung-hwan, 43, told the national news agency Yonhap. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire is the worst since a hotel fire killed 88 people in  
Seoul in 1974. Three years before that, another hotel fired killed 
165 people in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	KBS television said the fire appeared to have broken out in an  
underground karaoke shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers were renovating the shop and were using paint thinners,  
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a blast and then saw smoke filling up the building and  
people scrambling out,'' said another witness, Park Hyun-sok, told 
the all news cable channel, YTN. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames raced quickly upward, burning plastic furniture and  
carpets, the reports said. Toxic smoke quickly filled the building, 
which lacked big windows. The smoke trapped people in upper floors 
because it moved up the stairs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, dozens of family members were wailing and praying  
outside the intensive care unit of the city's Inha University 
Hospital, where many victims were hospitalized, according to TV 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
	Running short of beds, doctors and nurses laid some of the  
bodies on the floor covered with white sheets, the footage showed.

<HEADLINE> Director Didn't Want Jolie for Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The director and producer of the serial-killer  
thriller ``The Bone Collector,'' due out Friday, readily admit 
Universal Studios executives didn't want Angelina Jolie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old daughter of actor John Voigt, known for her  
Barbie-doll figure, tattoos and knives, had quit acting and was 
attending film school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted an 'established' actress,'' director Phillip Noyce  
tells Entertainment Weekly in its Nov. 5 edition. 
</P>
<P>
	It took some heated arguments -- with Noyce and producer Martin  
Bregman both fighting for Jolie -- and a serious slash to the film's 
budget to get Universal to agree, adds Bregman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bregman says he faced similar problems getting then-unknown  
Michelle Pfeiffer into ``Scarface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knew who she was,'' he says. ``Angie's enormously  
gifted, and I usually get what I want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jolie, who appeared in the TNT miniseries ``George Wallace'' and  
the HBO film ``Gia,'' plays a stuntwoman in ``The Bone Collector'' 
who tracks a serial killer for a quadriplegic cop played by Denzel 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Yankees the Team of the Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe Torre talks about the ghosts that seem to live in every nook  
and cranny of Yankee Stadium, permanent reminders of the history 
and aura that hangs over the place. 
</P>
<P>
	While managing this team of the decade and franchise of the  
century to its 25th World Series championship, Torre reflected on 
what it means to wear the Yankee pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got this job, I felt a little strange putting on  
the Yankee uniform because of all the tradition that went with 
being a part of this organization,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled in his first spring training as manager how Reggie  
Jackson, Goose Gossage and Ron Guidry showed up as instructors. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those people, it's special,'' Torre said. ``There's a lot  
of history, a lot of pride involved with being part of this 
organization. You feel an obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's because Yankee Stadium seems more like a baseball  
museum than it does a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Out beyond the left field fence is Monument Park, a tribute to  
the players who created the tradition. Before each game he pitches, 
Roger Clemens goes out there to touch Babe Ruth's monument. Catcher 
Jorge Posada does the same to the one honoring Thurman Munson. 
</P>
<P>
	The monuments and plaques for all the old Yankees are bridges  
from the past to the present, a roadmap through a legacy of winning 
that is unmatched in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' World Series titles are a benchmark of excellence,  
16 more championships than any other baseball team, nine more than 
any NFL or NBA franchise. Only the 23 Stanley Cups won by the 
Montreal Canadiens in the NHL come close. 
</P>
<P>
	All around the Stadium, there are reminders of this team's rich  
and glorious history; pictures of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech; of 
Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle; of Yogi Berra and Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The players wore No. 5 patches on their uniform sleeves this  
season to honor DiMaggio, who died in March, and black arm bands in 
memory of Catfish Hunter, who died in September. It was Joe D. who 
uttered the words that seem to sum up the franchise's history so 
well: ``I thank the good Lord for making me a Yankee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a sentiment shared by many through the years because being  
a Yankee usually means winning. From the time Ruth arrived in New 
York in 1920 and revolutionized baseball with the long ball, the 
Yankees have been the yardstick against which other teams are 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
	The success has resulted in 36 American League championships in  
78 years -- almost one every other year. That is a remarkable ratio 
made even more impressive by two significant dry spells. The 
Yankees went without a pennant from 1964-76 and again from 1981-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth's Yankees had Murderers' Row and earned the nickname the  
Bronx Bombers. They swept the Series in 1927 and 1928, and again in 
1932 when The Babe's called shot left a permanent imprint on the 
event. Like those teams, Torre's Yankees have won 12 straight World 
Series games. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's Yankees duplicated the back-to-back sweeps in  
1938-39. Torre's Yankees also achieved back-to-back sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the Casey Stengel dynasty began, delivering 10 pennants  
in 12 years. There were two sets of five straight championships -- 
1949-1953 and 1960-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees established their dominance at a simpler time in  
baseball history. When they began beating up the baseball world, 
teams advanced directly from regular-season league championships to 
the World Series. Now, getting to the ultimate goal is more 
complicated because of the land mines in the divisional playoffs 
and League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Yankees had to beat 15 other teams for the  
championship. Now they must beat 29. Still, they seem to find a 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	They are resilient and opportunistic, as different from the  
teams that preceded them as Muhammad Ali was from Joe Louis. They 
win with jabs instead of knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said they are a perfect team for New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special city,'' he said. ``There's a lot of energy.  
I think that's what the Yankees feed off, the energy of the city. I 
think it's a combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their tradition goes beyond winning.  
</P>
<P>
	Some years ago, a rookie showed up in training camp and  
requested uniform No. 3. It was quietly explained to him that No. 3 
belonged to Ruth and no longer was available -- along with 14 other 
numbers the Yankees have retired to honor the heroes who wore them. 
</P>
<P>
	No team has taken more numbers out of circulation. That's  
because no team has had as many players it needed to honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at all the pictures hanging here,'' Torre said. ``Ruth  
and Gehrig and DiMaggio, all the grace and elegance. There's a 
certain elegance about wearing a Yankee uniform and the way guys 
did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many uniforms have changed over the years and the Yankees  
have maintained their style and their class of the pinstripe, no 
names on the back, just the Yankees. You don't have to be in 
baseball or even be a sports fan to know who the New York Yankees 
are.''

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Co. Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Sweepstakes company American Family  
Enterprises says bankruptcy protection will help it settle dozens 
of lawsuits alleging deceptive advertising over the sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which runs a sweepstakes plugged by Dick Clark and  
Ed McMahon, also said it had reached an agreement in principle to 
settle the lawsuits, which have been consolidated in federal court 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping in the next week we'll be able to announce a  
settlement,'' said company spokesman Rich Tauberman. He said terms 
remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	American Family said the bankruptcy would not disrupt  
agreements, entered over the last year, that paid a total of $6.9 
million to 40 states and the District of Columbia to resolve 
allegations over sweepstakes advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jersey City company said the Chapter 11 reorganization,  
filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, also would not affect its 
sweepstakes or magazine subscription operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's next drawings, for $1 million on Nov. 24 and for  
$10 million on Jan. 31, are still scheduled, all entries are valid 
and all prizes will be awarded, said Susan Caughman, president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	She said all of the money for its contests ``have been  
pre-funded and are held in trust by federally insured independent 
financial institutions until the award date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No prize winners have been affected,'' Tauberman said.  
``People can still buy magazines. There is no impact for 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures on the privately-held firm's assets and liabilities, and  
its largest creditors, were not available, Tauberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Family is sponsor of the American Family Publishers  
sweepstakes, whose past mailings had been criticized for giving 
people the impression they had won or needed to buy a subscription 
to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate, reacting to reports of people who spent  
thousands of dollars to buy magazines in attempts to win, or who 
traveled to pick up prizes they mistakenly believed they had won, 
voted 93-0 in August to put new restrictions on the sweepstakes 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has not yet acted on similar legislation.  
</P>
<P>
	Another major sweepstakes operator, Publishers Clearing House,  
has been sued by nine states over its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	In settling complaints from the states, American Family admitted  
no wrongdoing, but agreed to change its marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will refrain from telling people they are  
winners or members of a group of finalists unless that is actually 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	It agreed to send special notices to customers who buy large  
numbers of magazines during a single year reminding them that no 
purchase is necessary to enter the sweepstakes. It will also make 
it clearer on entry forms that no purchase is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The company must also disclose the estimated odds of winning as  
prominently as it does prize amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	American Family is owned by TAF Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of  
Time Inc. and a group of investors.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: School Closing Overblown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A school closed for one day because of a threat  
of violence from a group of teens was never in danger, says a 
lawyer for two youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Shields, who represents a brother and sister who were  
questioned in the alleged threat, contends that Mayor Michael R. 
White overreacted in canceling classes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``South High School is not Columbine,'' Shields said in  
reference to the nation's deadliest school shooting last April. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no weapons at school, no violent acts. We understand  
there may have been some talk from one child regarding some actions 
against other students, but that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shields also noted that no charges have been filed against his  
clients, a 14-year-old boy and his 15-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did arrest four other students and questioned seven other  
teens Friday in the alleged plot, which White said may have been 
motivated by racial bias. Seventy percent of South's 1,500-student 
population is black. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor declined to comment on a report that the attack  
planned for Friday was similar to the one by Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold at Columbine in Littleton, Colo. Armed with guns and bombs, 
the two teen-aged gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher before 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	At South, the 11 students -- all suspended for 10 days -- are  
white and planned to disrupt the school with ``violent acts,'' 
according to the mayor, who said only that the students felt 
alienated. 
</P>
<P>
	White said the students planned to get weapons from an area gang  
but are not gang members. Police found two guns at one student's 
home but would not say where. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the students questioned, Sarah Jedd, 15, said the four  
who were arrested, all boys, had maps of South High with shooting 
positions. She said her name was included on the maps, but she 
wanted no part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so unfair that I got dragged into this,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	White would not elaborate on details of the alleged plot or  
confirm a report by The Plain Dealer that the students gave written 
statements to police that they planned to use guns and homemade 
explosives to kill teachers, administrators and fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the massacre was planned for just before noon  
Friday, when students would open fire in the cafeteria and the 
principal's office. The students also planned a suicidal shootout 
with police in a school courtyard, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	White didn't disclose the names of those arrested but The Plain  
Dealer, citing juvenile court records, identified them today as 
Adam Gruber, 14, and 15-year-olds John Borowski, Benjamin Balducci 
and Andy Napier. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Napier was the ringleader and that his  
parents have admitted him to MetroHealth Medical Center for a 
psychiatric evaluation. The other three are in juvenile detention. 
</P>
<P>
	Each is charged with two counts of inciting violence and one  
count each of false alarm, aggravated menacing-ethnic intimidation 
and inducing panic. If convicted, they could be incarcerated until 
they are 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Byrd-Bennett, head of the 77,000-student school  
district, says classes will resume at South High on Monday with 
heightened security. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Columbine, authorities around the country have charged  
students with planning or threatening to carry out similar acts. 
The National Safety Center estimated at least 3,000 copycat bomb 
threats were made in the weeks after Columbine -- about five times 
the usual number. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, for example, Monmouth Regional High School in Tinton  
Falls, N.J., was closed because someone scrawled on a bathroom 
wall: ``The Trench Coat Mafia is here. Everyone is going to die the 
29th'' -- a reference to the group Klebold and Harris were 
associated with. The school was searched and will reopen Monday, 
but police had not found the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Snohomish, Wash., police said a freshman was in juvenile  
detention after allegedly threatening to blow up his high school. 
Authorities found three, 6-inch-long homemade pipe bombs at his 
home. After being tipped by other students, police arrested the boy 
without incident when he arrived at Snohomish High School on 
Friday. No bombs were found in the school.

<HEADLINE> Haunted Houses Pushing Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORCROSS, Ga. (AP) -- As a smoke machine billows out  
sweet-smelling mist and the overhead speakers cackle and moan, four 
preteen boys try to maintain a brave facade. 
</P>
<P>
	But as costumed actors pop out from behind corners at the  
``Netherworld'' haunted house, the boys grab at each other's shirts 
so hard they almost rip the seams. Even adults in the group shriek. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was plenty scared, but it was fun,'' said 11-year-old Drew  
Stipe, who made it through the 40-minute attraction with two 
friends, his older brother and his parents. ``But I wouldn't send 
the younger kids into there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Therein lies the dilemma faced by operators of increasingly  
popular haunted houses -- how scary should they get? 
</P>
<P>
	Most operators have responded by meeting the demand for  
increased realism, and that means most haunted houses are now for 
teens and adults only. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually harder to not scare little kids too much than it  
is to really scare the adults,'' said Joe Jensen, creative director 
for Chicago-based Haunted America Inc., an Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still the family farms that have the spooky pumpkin  
patches or scary hay rides, but they are disappearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's left are professionally done houses such as Netherworld,  
which is tame compared to some presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	The theme of the Atlanta-area ``Chambers of Terror'' is what  
would happen if all the Y2K alarmists are right. It presents car 
wrecks, diseases escaping from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and other calamities that might result if the world's 
computers melt down as the clocks turn to the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Flags theme parks around the country offer ``Alice Cooper's  
Brutal Planet,'' where no one under the age of 10 is allowed in. 
But the chain also offers the family-oriented ``Looney Toons Spooky 
Town'' for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so at ``Statesville,'' outside Chicago. The haunted house  
features a body writhing in a crackling electric chair and prison 
inmates hissing threats while pleading desperately for freedom as 
they grope through cell bars. 
</P>
<P>
	It's based on the nearby Stateville Correctional Center -- a  
prison that has housed the likes of serial killer John Wayne Gacy 
and mass murderer Richard Speck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God, I was so scared,'' said 18-year-old Nanci Bowne,  
laughing and shaking after bursting out a side exit halfway through 
the labyrinth. ``I lost my friends in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joliet-area farmer Paul Siegel terrifies his guests with the  
psychological horror of villains based -- at least in part -- on real 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted it to be different than the typical haunted house  
with Dracula or Freddy Krueger,'' Siegel said. ``I thought, I'm 
next to Stateville, and what's more scary than the feeling of being 
locked inside a prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Churches also have embraced the Halloween season by offering  
scary venues with a message. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some churches that employ the concept -- scaring people  
into accepting religion -- have drawn criticism for depicting 
violent acts, rape, abortion and, most recently, the Columbine High 
School shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Heights Church in Stockbridge, Ga., is running its  
``Tribulation Trial'' for the seventh year, recreating scenes from 
the Apocalypse based on the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really try to scare people,'' said Dave Roberts, an  
education pastor with the church. ``We really want people to see 
what it would be like if they were left behind after the Second 
Coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the attraction is recommended for kids 10 and older  
because of its realism. 
</P>
<P>
	Netherworld co-owner Billy Messina said he doesn't give age  
guidelines, but a sign at the front says it is not recommended for 
small children. Everyone is charged a full $12 admission. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to bring a five-year-old through and then have to  
leave because they're scared, they're out the money,'' Messina 
said. ``That's the best deterrent I could think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claudia Stipe, who accompanied her sons into Netherworld, said  
this is the first year they've really done something spooky as a 
family for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	She lamented the bygone days of spooky pumpkin patches and scary  
hay rides. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, the stuff was rated G or PG, and now it's  
all R-rated,'' Mrs. Stipe said. ``Other than trick or treating, 
there's just nothing out there to offer kids.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Marketing 'Terminator' Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Missouri farmer Bill Christison cuts $20,000  
off the annual cost of growing soybeans by saving seed from one 
year's crop to plant the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
	So he does not like the idea that seed companies could stop him  
from doing that by genetically engineering seeds to block 
reproduction. Worse, to Christison, the federal government invented 
a ``terminator'' process for rendering seeds sterile and now 
actively is trying to get it to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that the U.S. government will wake up and look at  
what they are facilitating here,'' Christison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department researchers say the terminator process is  
misunderstood and has applications that could benefit farmers all 
over the world. The same technique that renders seeds sterile by 
turning certain genetic traits on and off also could be used to 
make plants resistant to drought or pests, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents of genetic engineering in the United States and  
especially in Europe have made the terminator issue a symbol of 
what they see as the evils of biotechnology. To them it is immoral 
for the U.S. government to promote and profit from such an 
invention, even if private companies are developing terminator 
processes of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The department developed the terminator technology at a  
laboratory in Texas and secured a joint patent last year with 
Scott, Miss.-based Delta &AMP; Pine Land Co., the world's largest 
cotton seed company, which co-sponsored the research. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is officially known as the ``technology protection  
system.'' The terminator nickname is a reference to the on-screen 
robotic killer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monsanto Co., seeking Justice Department approval to acquire  
Delta &AMP; Pine Land, recently announced it would not use terminator 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government is continuing research and is close to  
finishing negotiations on a marketing license with Delta &AMP; Pine 
Land for commercializing the technology, Agriculture Department 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	If Monsanto refuses to use the technology, the department would  
have the right to find another company that would. Officials will 
not say what they will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``First we have to see if Monsanto's purchase goes through. It's  
too hypothetical to be talking about,'' said department spokesman 
Andy Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has no plans to relinquish the patent, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``As co-holders of the patent we are in the room and in  
discussions with D&AMP;PL about whether or if or how there would be any 
commercialization. We think it's important that we be there to 
represent the public interest,'' Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
	One critic of genetic engineering, Hope Shand, research director  
of Rural Advancement Foundation International, said: ``The specter 
of genetic seed sterilization is particularly alarming given the 
rapid rate of consolidation of the global seed industry. Seed is 
the first link in the food chain. Whoever controls the seed has a 
stranglehold on the food supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's terminator research ``is a misallocation of  
precious ... research dollars and will benefit only a handful of 
big corporations,'' said Adam Goldberg, a spokesman for Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In developing countries, it is common for farmers to save seed  
from year to year. Christison, who is president of the National 
Family Farm Coalition, estimates that 25 percent of U.S. producers 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetically engineered crops, which are making up an increasing  
share of U.S. production, cannot be reproduced legally. Farmers 
also buy new seeds each year for corn and hybrid versions of other 
crops because they lose their special characteristics after the 
first generation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, an estimated 57 percent of the soybeans,  
38 percent of the cotton and 30 percent of the corn planted this 
year was genetically engineered, either to resist pests or 
herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA believes seed companies must be allowed to protect  
investments in new varieties of seeds if they are to continue 
developing crops that are hardier, more nutritious and require 
fewer applications of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the terminator process is still several years away  
from being commercially available, said Sandy Miller Hayes, a 
spokeswoman for department's Agricultural Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, it has been shown to work only in tobacco, which is  
used as a model plant species in agricultural research, and in 
cotton. The first applications likely would be in cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be used only in crops that do not cross-pollinate, such  
as cotton, soybeans and wheat, she said. In cross-pollinating 
plants like corn, fields of nonterminator varieties could be made 
sterile.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Race Crucial to Both Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- In a largely rural part of Washington  
state best known for its peas and lentils, political money is 
flowing and TVs are echoing with attack ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The race is for only one seat in the state Legislature -- the  
state's only legislative election this year -- but it's crucial to 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	If voters in the 9th District break their six-decade Republican  
trend and go Democrat, it will put the divided House in Democrat 
control. The Senate and the governor's office are already held by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's a big deal,'' said Republican state Rep. Clyde  
Ballard, a co-speaker since the two parties must share power in the 
House, which is split 49-49. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have poured money into the race between incumbent  
state Rep. Don Cox, a 59-year-old educator and Republican, and 
Democrat Mike Connelly, a lawyer and school board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was appointed to the seat in January to succeed another  
lawmaker who was appointed to a state Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th District has roughly 150,000 people in a region called  
the Palouse, where farms on rolling hills grow peas, lentils and 
wheat. It stretches from Cheney to Clarkston along the southern 
half of the Washington-Idaho border. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't elected a Democrat since 1936.  
</P>
<P>
	Cox, a Washington State University faculty member and retired  
Colfax school superintendent, has raised $170,000 from a number of 
corporations, political action committees, individuals and the 
Republican Party, according to state records. 
</P>
<P>
	Connelly, 45, the son of U.S. Attorney Jim Connelly, has raised  
about $114,000 from labor organizations, other lawyers, individuals 
and state Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Each candidate also has benefitted from large cash infusions  
from independent expenditure campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it,'' Cox said Wednesday. ``With the money comes  
a lot of tension. I just think it's unfortunate that we've gotten 
this much attention in a local, citizen-legislature type race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connelly offers himself as an independent Democrat who would use  
his status as tiebreaker to work for better educational funding, 
health care reform and to benefit farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox's campaign commercials portray him as a defender of  
education who opposed Democratic sponsored tax increases and 
supports equitable funding for rural schools.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Toxic Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By WILLIAM C. MANN    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will require fuller reports  
from industry about toxic chemicals released into the environment 
so the public can learn more about companies' potential to pollute, 
President Clinton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tighter rules, effective Jan. 1., apply to 27 substances  
and, for the first time, cover the industrial byproduct dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his weekly radio address, also announced two other  
executive actions, both land acquisitions: 14,000 acres in a 
California desert national park and a 95,000-acre ranch in New 
Mexico where one of the world's largest herds of elk roams free. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also repeated a threat to veto the Interior Department  
spending bill if the Republican-controlled Congress does not remove 
provisions on logging in national forests, oil production, and 
toxic-waste mining rules on federal lands. The president also wants 
more money for voluntary community river restorations. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP believes the bill is friendly to the environment while  
protecting Social Security, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of 
the House Republican Conference, said in a statement responding to 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chemical rules from the Environmental Protection Agency  
will apply to a company based on the amount of ``persistent 
bioaccumulative toxics'' it uses. Those are chemicals that do not 
break down easily and build up in the environment to the point 
where they are passed through the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the simplest but most potent tools in our fight against  
pollution is public information,'' Clinton said. ``By requiring 
industries to tell communities how much they pollute the air and 
water, we empower citizens to fight back and create a powerful 
incentive for industry to pollute less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proof, he said, is that industry's toxic pollution has fallen  
almost 50 percent in the decades since reporting requirements took 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Current rules require release reports by companies that  
manufacture or process more than 25,000 pounds or use more than 
10,000 pounds of toxic chemicals a year. The new rules will require 
reports by companies that use 100 pounds a year, or, for some 
especially dangerous chemicals, 10 pounds a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For dioxin, companies using as little as one-tenth of a gram  
must announce releases. Dioxin is produced by the burning of waste, 
especially plastics and chlorine-based chemicals. It has been 
linked to cancer and birth defects and was an ingredient of the 
defoliant Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sierra Club welcomed the rules as ``a major step in assuring  
Americans of a clean, healthy environment.'' The U.S. Public 
Interest Research Group found some ``some serious flaws'' that 
``will still allow a significant amount of pollution to go 
unreported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The land acquisitions followed Clinton's order to the Forest  
Service two weeks ago to protect more than 40 million acres of 
roadless areas in national forests. The White House said almost 150 
million public and private acres across the nation have been 
protected or enhanced in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton linked the acquisitions with Saturday's fifth  
anniversary of his signing of the California Desert Act in 1994 to 
preserve that fragile environment. Saturday's donation of 14,000 
acres in the Joshua Tree National Park came from the nonprofit 
Wildlands Conservancy to mark the anniversary, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has agreed to preserve New Mexico's Baca  
Ranch, which Washington is to buy from its Texas owners for $101 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., introduced legislation in 1997 to  
allow the Forest Service to buy the property. Congress approved $40 
million last week as a down payment on the purchase, but the money 
is in the Interior bill that Clinton says he will veto. The money 
is expected to be in whatever compromise bill finally reaches the 
president's desk.

<HEADLINE> Christian Lawyer Urged for Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A Christian lawyer who had represented a student  
injured in the Columbine High School shootings has warned the boy's 
family against hiring Jewish lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver lawyer Anthony Sturniolo confirmed he sent a letter dated  
Oct. 14 to the family, whom he declined to identify, after the 
family decided to hire Michigan lawyer Geoffrey Fieger and local 
co-counsel Howard Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he felt it was important for a Christian lawyer to  
represent Christian families, he told The Denver Post in Saturday's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Sturniolo wrote: ``You have hired two Jewish  
attorneys, and Mr. Fieger in the past has been quoted openly 
ridiculing anyone who believed in Jesus. I know that you are 
committed Christians and I do not want you to be led astray to a 
position that might be a poor witness to our Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was trying to make sure his former clients knew their  
lawyers are not Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could be Muslims, Buddhists or anything,'' Sturniolo  
said. ``It was a shock to me that this has become a Jewish issue. I 
never intended it to be anti-Semitic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sturniolo did not return calls from The Associated Press on  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger is part Jewish but was raised in the Unitarian Church.  
Zucker is Jewish by birth and by practicing faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger, best known for representing assisted-suicide advocate  
Dr. Jack Kevorkian, said a complaint should be filed with the 
Colorado Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the personal attacks I've heard, nobody has ever  
engaged in this type of blatant religious bigotry,'' Fieger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Aisenberg, former president of the Colorado Bar Association  
and a 15-year member of its ethics committee, said Sturniolo's 
statements in the letter could be considered questionable under the 
state's legal ethics rules.

<HEADLINE> No. 18 Purdue 33, Minnesota 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota coach Glen Mason got booed at home,  
first for playing it safe and then for risking it all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Gophers fell to No. 18 Purdue 33-28 Saturday after  
Mason chose to run out the final two minutes of the first half and 
then try an onside kick with nearly three minutes left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to get in at halftime. The last thing I  
wanted to do was give Purdue the ball back with time on the 
clock,'' Mason said. ``They're too good. I heard everybody booing. 
I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he also didn't care about the catcalls from the miffed  
Metrodome crowd when he went for an onside kick with 2:43 remaining 
after the Golden Gophers had cut Purdue's lead to 33-28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to take a chance of not getting the ball back,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was the air attack working for Purdue, but the  
Boilermakers' ground game was equally effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees completed 28 of 41 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns  
and gained 51 yards on seven rushes, a total diminished when he 
fell to one knee thrice in the waning seconds of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet they were expecting us to air it out because that's what  
we did the past two years,'' said Brees who needed just three 
quarters to amass 522 yards passing and six touchdowns in a 56-21 
rout of the Golden Gophers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were giving us the running game,'' Brees said. ``We'll  
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mason said it was a pick-your-poison kind of day.  
</P>
<P>
	``They spread you out and there's only certain ways you can line  
up,'' he said. ``If you overplay, he runs the quarterback draw on 
you. If you put too many guys inside, he'll beat you on the deep 
one. If you play them honest and try to cover the whole thing, they 
run that little out route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees brought the Boilermakers (6-3, 3-3 Big Ten) back every  
time Minnesota pulled within striking range. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers (5-3, 2-3) who lost their third straight close  
conference game at home, broke free for three fourth-quarter 
touchdowns, the last on Ron Johnson's leaping 12-yard catch with 
2:43 left. 
</P>
<P>
	But Purdue tight end Tim Stratton recovered the onside kick and  
Brees made sure that Minnesota didn't get another chance, moving 
the Boilermakers inside the 10 before running out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees's 8-yard TD toss to Randall Lane with 5:22 left made it  
33-21 after Thomas Hamner's 60-yard romp had pulled the Gophers 
within five. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Montrell Lowe's 2-yard dive put the Boilermakers up  
19-7 and capped a 77-yard drive in which Brees scrambled for 10 
yards and ran for 20 on two draws. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were giving it to us,'' Brees said. ``They were trying to  
put a whole lot of guys out in coverage, so we took advantage of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Billy Cockerham's 1-yard keeper pulled Minnesota to 19-14  
with 14 minutes left, the Boilermakers needed just six plays to 
respond. Brees hit Vinny Sutherland with a 51-yard pass and Lowe, 
who ran 28 times for 127 yards, took it in from the 1 for a 26-14 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Hamner's longest career run, an untouched 60-yard  
scamper that put the exclamation point on his fifth straight 
100-yard rushing day, which broke Paul Giel's school record of four 
straight in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamner finished with 166 yards on 20 rushes.  
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers took the opening possession 83 yards for a  
touchdown but led just 10-7 at halftime. Chris Daniels had 13 
catches for 101 yards, nearly half of that yardage coming on the 
opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota committed two costly turnovers in the second quarter,  
including Cockerham's interception at midfield 2:46 before 
halftime. After the Gophers held and got the ball back with two 
minutes left, Mason chose to run out the clock rather than risk 
another interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason, who spent last week watching film of Brees nearly ending  
Penn State's unbeaten season and shot at the national title, was 
content to play it safe. ``I was willing to go into halftime with 
that score right there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockerham didn't mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't want to give that offense the ball back,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's why they tried the onside kick 90 minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism Chief Stresses Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael A. Sheehan once kicked down doors to  
confront terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later his mission is the same, but his technique has  
changed: He recently led diplomatic overtures to Afghanistan's 
ruling Taliban army in hopes of winning its help in seizing 
suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	And diplomacy on Capitol Hill will be needed if Sheehan is to  
address what he calls the ``unconscionable'' 36 percent reduction 
by Congress in the budget of the U.S. counterterrorism office. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired Army lieutenant colonel is the nation's latest  
coordinator for counterterrorism -- a post that carries the rank of 
ambassador at large in the State Department. He is the point man in 
the government's efforts to prevent attacks like last year's 
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 
people, including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan, 44, is a veteran of world hot spots: Central America,  
Korea, Somalia. In Panama, he was the leader and youngest member of 
a U.S. Army Special Forces counterterrorism ``door-kicking team'' 
whose actions he says he cannot discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	But while tough talk and swift action are still part of fighting  
terrorism, so is persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bread and butter of what we do is diplomacy,'' Sheehan  
said in an interview after the Senate approved his appointment with 
no dissent. ``We try to depoliticize terrorism around the world, 
criminalize its behavior and work with other countries to close off 
terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task includes building an international consensus against  
terrorist organizations, isolating states that sponsor or shelter 
them, and sharing information with law enforcement officials in 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes the economic sanctions recently imposed by President  
Clinton against the Taliban government in Afghanistan for harboring 
bin Laden, the suspected terrorist mastermind behind the embassy 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	And it includes military force, such as last year's U.S. missile  
assaults against camps in Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan after 
the embassy bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Office of Coordinator for Counterterrorism is located  
at the intersection of military might and diplomatic finesse, 
prospective coordinators are drawn from either arena. Sheehan, a 
military veteran, succeeded a career member of the foreign service, 
Philip Wilcox Jr., who held the post from 1994 until his retirement 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised in New Jersey, Sheehan joined the military after  
high school and began a career that would send him around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	After Panama, Sheehan served as a company commander in an Army  
unit on the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. He 
then worked as a military adviser in El Salvador before seeking a 
master's degree in international relations at Georgetown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	There he took a class taught by now-Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, who would become a major influence on his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked with Albright in New York after she became U.S.  
ambassador to the United Nations in 1993. As part of United 
Nation's peacekeeping efforts, Sheehan spent seven months in 
Mogadishu, Somalia's ravaged capital, in 1993 and 1994, and four 
months in Haiti in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright became secretary of state in 1997. When the job of  
counterterrorism coordinator -- reporting directly to her -- became 
vacant last year, she named Sheehan to the post on an acting basis 
while his nomination worked its way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Albright  
``hand-picked Ambassador Sheehan for this post precisely because he 
has a unique combination of field experience and Washington policy 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying in July before the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, Sheehan said international terrorism has changed since 
1980, when Americans were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran, Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups involved in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in  
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, ``are more in the mold 
of the new terrorist threat -- groups that are often self-financed 
with less direct linkage to state sponsors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy bombings put terrorism on the front burner in  
Congress. The House in July unanimously authorized $1.4 billion for 
security upgrades at embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan said the challenge will be maintaining that attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the type of effort that we have to sustain over  
the long time -- indefinitely really,'' he said. ``You can become 
exhausted if you're at a heightened state of security all the 
time.''

<HEADLINE>  Golfer Payne Stewart Is Eulogized  </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Everything that mattered to Payne Stewart  
was on a table beneath the pulpit where his wife, his closest 
friends and his pastors paid tribute during a gripping memorial 
service that capped a tragic week. 
</P>
<P>
	On the far right was an oil painting of the Stewart clan,  
dressed in blue jeans and denim shirts, and a photo of them on a 
rafting trip. One picture was taken just nine days ago, Stewart and 
10-year-old Aaron at the Father-Child tournament before the Disney 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne was passionate about a lot of things, none stronger than  
his passion for being a good father,'' Tracey Stewart said Friday. 
``And he was a great father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the far end of the table was a black Bible with Stewart's  
name written in gold, and the ``WWJD'' bracelet -- What Would Jesus 
Do -- that he wore during his U.S. Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to remember a man who made the world a happier  
place,'' J.B. Collingsworth, his pastor, said. ``Heaven is never 
going to be the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle was a gold chalice that stands only 17 inches  
high, dwarfed by the trophies Stewart won from the PGA Championship 
and the U.S. Open, but perhaps the most important prize to him of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryder Cup almost never leaves the PGA of America  
headquarters, but there could be no better showcase than the 
memorial service for Stewart, one of six people killed when his 
Learjet crashed Monday in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart was a vicious competitor. He only played to  
win,'' Paul Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	With tears and laughter, Stewart was remembered for his passion  
for living at a church where he finally found his peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The best tribute of all came from Azinger, who donned a tam  
o'shanter cap and rolled up his trousers to knickers-length, 
revealing a pair of argyle socks in honor of his close friend's 
trademark look. 
</P>
<P>
	A party is what Tracey Stewart wanted for her 42-year-old  
husband, who was among six people killed on Monday when his Learjet 
flew uncontrolled across the country before crashing into a field 
in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	She remembered him as ``the most beautiful looking man I'd ever  
seen'' when they first fell in love, and as a father who was a line 
judge at 13-year-old Chelsea's volleyball match, who watched 
10-year-old Aaron catch a touchdown pass two days before the fatal 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a big part of his career, too. She noticed his head  
moving over his putts in the third round of the U.S. Open. The next 
day, taking that tip, he made three crucial putts on the final 
three holes to win the championship in spectacular fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shared laughter, tears, victories and defeats,'' she said  
in a eulogy that caused about 3,000 people at the First Baptist 
Church in Orlando to crumble, overcome by a week packed with 
tragedy and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will always be my soulmate and my best friend,'' she said.  
``We love you. Let the party in heaven begin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 PGA Tour players and officials were at the  
service. They included Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, former PGA Tour 
commissioner Deane Beman, former Ryder Cup captains Ben Crenshaw, 
Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins, and most of the field from the Tour 
Championship in Houston, such as Tiger Woods, David Duval and Davis 
Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	When the service ended, they formed a line down both sides of  
the center aisle of the church -- a protective wall for Mrs. Stewart 
to walk through. She held her head high and greeted them later at a 
private reception. 
</P>
<P>
	There was laughter and tears during the two-hour service, which  
caused the PGA Tour to shut down tournaments in Texas and 
Mississippi so players could honor Stewart. About 100 players were 
at the service, along with their wives and some caddies. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournaments will resume today.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love the guy,'' Fred Couples said. ``It's so easy to say  
now. Looking around at all the people, it was a beautiful ceremony. 
I feel our hearts were lifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was only one round of applause -- when Azinger, his close  
friend, reconfigured his outfit to look like Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured it would take Payne Stewart to get me in a suit, but  
I never thought I would stoop to this,'' he joked. ``I felt 
pressure this morning knowing he would be watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A song that country singer Vince Gill wrote this week was  
played. Christian singer Michael W. Smith was a featured 
attraction, along with a video presentation that captured some of 
Stewart's 18 victories around the world and recent interviews about 
his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to a special place when I die,'' he said in the  
interview played on a big screen in the church. ``But I want to be 
sure my life is special while I'm here.''

<HEADLINE> Greeks Promise To Protect Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Demonstrators planning large anti-American  
protests will be kept a safe distance from President Clinton during 
his visit to Greece next month, a senior law enforcement official 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will be able to demonstrate if they want to (but)  
foreign guests of the state must be protected,'' Dimitris 
Efstathiadis, general secretary of Greece's public order ministry, 
told private Flash radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's Nov. 13-15 visit follows a surge of anti-American  
feeling created by NATO's 78-day bombing campaign against 
Yugoslavia. During the conflict, many people in NATO-member Greece 
sympathized with fellow-Orthodox Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Protest groups, many supported by Greece's Communist Party,  
staged near daily demonstrations over Kosovo and are planning large 
protest rallies during Clinton's trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Student groups, however, on Saturday abandoned plans to  
reschedule an annual Nov. 17 march to commemorate a student 
uprising to coincide with Clinton's stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Police sources said at least 5,000 officers will be involved in  
the security operation, blocking off large areas of central Athens 
to demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Clinton) must be allowed to follow his program as planned,  
visiting members of the Greek government and seeing the Acropolis 
as well as attending various other planned events.'' Efstathiadis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details of Clinton's schedule have not been announced.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Holds on to High Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- He trails George W. Bush by 63 percentage  
points in the latest poll and by nearly that many millions in 
campaign dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, vows to continue the presidential  
candidacy he called ``the longest of the long shots'' when he 
entered the race in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some don't want to give me a chance at all, but nobody who  
knows me feels that way,'' said Hatch, who noted -- proudly -- that 
he's moved from 11th place at the bottom of the pack of Republican 
presidential candidates into fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	While that is true, the gain was largely a product of attrition.  
</P>
<P>
	A field that began with 12 candidates now has six Republicans  
and Pat Buchanan, who left the GOP on Monday to seek the Reform 
Party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, former Vice President Dan Quayle, Lamar  
Alexander and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio have dropped out. New 
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith became an independent before dropping out 
but recently has made overtures about returning to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said the chance that the front-running Bush might spend  
$100 million made it ``virtually impossible'' for him to win the 
nomination. Dole also cited the fund-raising disadvantage as a 
reason for quitting. The odds against Hatch are even longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gallup poll found 66 percent of Republicans surveyed backing  
Bush, the Texas governor, and 3 percent of them supporting Hatch. 
The Oct. 21-24 survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bush has raised more than $57 million to Hatch's $1.3  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most candidates are swimming away from their sinking ships,  
and Senator Hatch is still swimming toward his,'' said Alex 
Castellanos, a Republican media consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has tried to sell himself as the GOP's ``Plan B'' should  
Bush falter. But Sen. John McCain of Arizona holds second place now 
that Dole is gone, although he trails Bush by 50 points or more, 
according to the latest national polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Bush falters it's not going to be Hatch; it's not going to  
be (Steve) Forbes. It's going to be McCain,'' said Rich Galen, a 
Washington-based GOP strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch accuses Bush and McCain of abandoning their conservative  
roots to woo moderates. But he says he doesn't see Republicans 
flocking to McCain's bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not the way he has run down the Republicans,'' said Hatch,  
referring to McCain's strident criticism of senators who disagreed 
with his failed legislation to overhaul federal campaign finance 
laws. ``He's moving toward the moderate to liberal people in the 
party, and it's going to be a conservative electorate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Hatch said he would throw out the tax code,  
disband the Internal Revenue Service, rebuild the military, give 
local communities control over schools and appoint judges who he 
believes aren't activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are starting to catch on that I'm the only candidate  
with common-sense conservative ideas and the experience to be 
effective from day one,'' said the 23-year Senate veteran and 
Judiciary Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch spokesman Jeff Flint said the campaign plans television  
ads leading into the Iowa caucuses next Jan. 24 and New Hampshire 
primary on Feb. 1. The push is funded in part by federal matching 
dollars the campaign expects to qualify for early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Matching funds don't indicate a viable candidacy, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Hatch expects to collect about $1 million in federal funds,  
leaving him well behind the rest of the field but adding life to a 
frugal campaign that so far has spent about $1 million -- almost as 
much as he has raised since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He seems convinced he will be in the race for the long haul.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a marathon, not a sprint,'' said Hatch, who admitted  
there may be a time to stop running but believes the campaign is 
working well now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things keep going the way they are, you bet your life I  
will be around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others aren't so convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a pretty smart guy and at some point his family and staff  
are going to get together and say, 'Bush isn't going to collapse 
...,' and he's going to get out like the gentleman he is,'' said 
Galen, the Republican strategist.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bradley Gaining on Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley is trailing Vice President Al  
Gore but has cut the margin, in the Democratic presidential race, 
says a poll released Saturday. The margin between Gore and Bradley 
has fluctuated in polls in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Newsweek poll suggests Gore favored by 40 percent of  
registered Democrats or those who lean toward voting Democratic, 
while Bradley was the favorite of 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-percentage-point lead represents a drop from the vice  
president's 49-26 margin in the same poll a week ago. Bradley had 
cut the gap to 12 points in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll early 
this month, but Gore doubled his lead in that poll earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newsweek poll also suggests Pat Buchanan's entry into the  
Reform Party could lure Republican voters away from GOP candidates, 
including top contender George W. Bush. The Texas governor, 
however, continues to hold a big lead, 63 percent to 12 percent for 
Arizona Sen. John McCain and 9 percent for publisher Steve Forbes 
in the race for the GOP nomination. Other candidates were in low 
single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-way race among Gore, Bush and Pat Buchanan, the poll  
found Bush favored by 46 percent of voters, Gore 39 percent and 
Buchanan 7 percent. In a Bush-Bradley-Buchanan race, Bush got the 
nod from 43 percent, Bradley 38 percent and Buchanan 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	When Buchanan is not in the mix, Bush was a 53 percent to 39  
percent choice over Gore. Bush was favored over Bradley, 49 percent 
to 41 percent, in a head-to-head matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was based on interviews with 630 registered voters last  
Thursday and Friday. It was conducted by Princeton Research 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4  
percentage points, was conducted after the first televised debate 
between Gore and Bradley. But few registered voters were aware of 
the forum, pollsters found.

<HEADLINE> China Approves Anti-Cult Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By CHARLES HUTZLER    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Calling Falun Gong an unprecedented threat to  
communist rule, China's legislature paved the way Saturday for 
leaders of the banned spiritual movement to be given lengthy prison 
terms and the death penalty at upcoming trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly unanimous passage of a new anti-cult law by the  
legislature's executive committee inside the Great Hall of the 
People came as defiant Falun Gong followers trickled into adjacent 
Tiananmen Square for a sixth day of peaceful, largely passive 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Embarrassed by the demonstrations and under orders to quash  
them, police widened their security net to capture thousands of 
Falun Gong followers who have slipped into Beijing from around the 
country. Uniformed police questioned people on streets, and 
plainclothes officers trained high-powered binoculars on the vast 
square. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 followers were taken away from the square. One woman  
cried, and she and several others separately pressed hands in a 
gesture of prayer after they were placed inside a police minibus. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Foreign Ministry telephoned several foreign news  
organizations, warning them not to contact Falun Gong members. 
Security agents followed foreign reporters. One agent carried a 
travel bag with a hidden camera. Operated by a handheld remote 
control, the camera's motorized film drive audibly whirred with 
every picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
	By tightening the law on cults, the communist government sped up  
the trials of principal members already in custody. But the need 
for new measures shows how threatened Chinese leaders feel by Falun 
Gong and how undaunted its followers remain more than three months 
into a ban on the widely popular group. 
</P>
<P>
	In passing the law 114-0 with two abstentions, senior  
legislators called Falun Gong ``unprecedented in the 50-year 
history of the People's Republic in terms of its size of 
organization, influence, number of illegal publications as well as 
the damages it brought to the society,'' the government's news 
agency, Xinhua, said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the vote, the Standing Committee of the National People's  
Congress ordered police and prosecutors on ``full alert of cult 
activities and smash them rigorously,'' Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The law revises a section of the criminal code to make leaders  
of Falun Gong and other group's labeled cults liable for 
prosecution for murder, fraud, endangering national security and 
other crimes punishable by more than the 2- to 7-year prison terms 
allowed for most organizers under the current statute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a directive issued immediately after passage of the law,  
China's chief prosecutors agency and the Supreme People's Court 
identified as offenses key activities Falun Gong has been accused 
of: illegal assembly, resisting bans, organizing across provincial 
lines and causing deaths by preventing medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter charge would open the way for leading members to be  
tried for murder, a death-penalty offense. Falun Gong practitioners 
are not to take medicine. The government has blamed the group for 
1,400 deaths, many of them among people who refused to be treated 
for illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	An offshoot of traditional schools of slow-motion exercise that  
channel unseen forces of nature to the body, Falun Gong blends in 
ideas from Buddhism and Taoism. Its practice is believed to promote 
health and morality and has drawn anywhere from 2 million 
followers, the Communist Party figure, to tens of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Already the government has accused 13 principal members for  
disseminating state secrets, and one, Xu Xinmu, could be tried in 
the coming week, human rights groups report. Over the next two 
months, up to 50 leaders could be put on trial with a few given the 
death penalty, a Communist Party source said. 
</P>
<P>
	For rank-and-file members, the law encourages local governments  
to show leniency and ``to educate those deceived while punishing a 
small number of cult leaders,'' Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who recant their beliefs and withdraw from cults are not  
to be prosecuted, the prosecutors and Supreme People's Court 
directive said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, police in northeastern Jilin province sentenced  
without trial 12 women followers, all school teachers, to labor 
camps, mostly for one-year terms, the Hong Kong-based Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. 
They join more than 100 other followers in the province's labor 
camps.

<HEADLINE> Devils Crash An Opening-Night Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Once again, the New Jersey Devils played the role of spoilers.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in a month, the Devils ruined the opening of  
a new arena when they beat the Carolina Hurricanes 4-2 on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys knew what was going to happen coming in,'' said  
Devils coach Robbie Ftorek, referring to the 30-minute opening 
ceremonies at the Hurricanes' Raleigh Entertainment and Sports 
Arena. ``They just went out and got themselves loosened up and went 
right to our game plan and did a heck of a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, the Devils also beat Atlanta when the  
Thrashers opened their new Philips Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually the other team is pretty psyched up and it makes it  
tougher on us, but we did a pretty good job,'' defenseman Scott 
Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, it was Chicago 4, Detroit 2; Buffalo 3, Florida 2 in  
overtime; and Anaheim 5, Washington 2. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey scored three goals in a three-minute span early in  
the third period to break open the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe was sharp for the first 40  
minutes as the Hurricanes led 1-0 heading to the final period. But 
Irbe let in a soft goal from the blue line by 26-year-old rookie 
Brian Rafalski 51 seconds into the period. Krzysztof Oliwa and Petr 
Sykora followed with scores shortly thereafter as the crowd of 
18,730 turned quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	A tip-in by Bates Battaglia with 11:22 left brought the crowd  
back into the game. But the Devils, the best road team in hockey a 
season ago with an NHL-record 28 wins, held on down the stretch and 
scored an empty-net goal by Randy McKay with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Archie looked unbeatable for 40 minutes and then all of the  
sudden they were able to beat him three times in a short span,'' 
Carolina captain Ron Francis said. ``Our guys had some great 
chances late, but we just didn't get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Blackhawks 4, Red Wings 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Doug Gilmour scored his 400th career goal and Steve Passmore  
made 37 saves as the visiting Blackhawks beat Detroit, ending the 
Red Wings' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean McAmmond, Bryan McCabe and Bryan Muir also scored for the  
Blackhawks, who won their second straight after an 0-4-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne and Chris Chelios had Detroit's goals as the Red  
Wings (7-2-1) lost for the first time in eight games since a 3-2 
loss to Dallas in their second game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Sabres 3, Panthers 2, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Sanderson scored with 5.5 seconds left in overtime to lead  
the Sabres over the visiting Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson took a pass from Curtis Brown and fired the puck past  
Florida goaltender Trevor Kidd for his fourth career overtime goal 
and first for the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Stu Barnes scored the tying goal with 18 seconds left in  
regulation, knocking in a loose puck during a scramble in front of 
the Florida net with the Buffalo goaltender pulled for an extra 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres lost their most prominent player when goaltender  
Dominik Hasek reaggravated a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it doesn't feel good,'' said Hasek, who watched the  
five-minute overtime from the bench before heading to the dressing 
room for treatment. ``I hope I'll feel better in a day or so, but 
right now it's pretty painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Mighty Ducks 5, Capitals 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Anaheim, Paul Kariya scored the first and last goals of the  
game as the Mighty Ducks beat the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Between his first- and third-period goals, Kariya and his  
linemates continued to make life miserable for the Capitals, whom 
the Ducks routed 7-1 on Oct. 19 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya added two assists as he, right wing Teemu Selanne and  
center Matt Cullen combined for 10 points to torment Washington 
goalie Olaf Kolzig. Selanne scored his sixth goal of the season and 
added three assists, and Cullen had two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time that Kariya and Selanne had four points  
apiece as teammates.

	Boeing Delay Dismays Safety Panel  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Federal officials say they have no evidence that  
Boeing Co. intentionally covered up a safety report that may have 
helped investigators determine what caused the TWA Flight 800 crash 
in 1996. But the NTSB said in a statement Friday it was unhappy 
about the three-year delay between the crash and the discovery of 
the report this spring. The report focuses on whether excess heat 
from air conditioners in Boeings E-4B military jet could create 
highly flammable fuel vapors in the central fuel tank. A Boeing 
spokesman said today that differences between the E-4B and the 747 
made the report largely irrelevant to the TWA investigation.

	Students Said Inspired by Columbine

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A friend of the teens accused of plotting a  
deadly attack at their high school said they laughed about the 
Columbine massacre and wanted to replicate the rampage in 
Cleveland. Sarah Jedd, 15, said in Saturday's Plain Dealer that the 
students wanted to be ``well known.'' Four white students have been 
arrested and seven others questioned in what was described as a 
racially motivated plot to carry out an attack at predominantly 
black South High School. Mayor Michael R. White closed South High 
Friday after the parents of a student tipped off authorities.

	BERLIN (AP) -- A Jewish leader on Saturday criticized the amount  
German industry wants to pay former Nazi laborers as ``shameful,'' 
but a spokesman for the companies said they had no plans to raise 
their $3.2 billion offer. The public arguments cast further doubt 
that talks to settle on an amount, planned for next month in Bonn, 
would go forward. The German government and lawyers have both said 
they believe the meeting scheduled for Nov. 16-17 likely will be

	Georgia Leader Vows Economy Reform

	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- President Eduard Shevardnadze promised  
Saturday -- the day before Georgia's parliamentary election -- that 
the former Soviet republic would see a ``180-degree turn'' in its 
gloomy economic situation. His Union of Citizens of Georgia party 
was favored to win elections Sunday. Its closest rival is the 
Georgian Renaissance Union, headed by popular regional leader Aslan 
Abashidze. The campaign has been dominated by discussion of the 
economy. While Georgia's standard of living has improved since 
Shevardnadze took office in 1992, following a bloody rebellion that 
devastated the economy.

Clocks shift back one hour at 2 a.m. Sunday, local time, giving an 
extra hour of sleep to most people tonight, but an extra hour of 
work to those on the overnight shift. The change also means it will 
be dark an hour earlier on Halloween, calling for extra caution on 
the part of drivers and those watching the children on their

	Cubs Hire Baylor To Manage Team

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Baylor has been hired to manage the Chicago  
Cubs, taking over a last-place team that was plagued by injuries 
last season. Baylor, the hitting coach of the Atlanta Braves last 
season after six years as manager of the Colorado Rockies, had been 
courted by several major league teams, including the Anaheim Angels 
and Milwaukee Brewers. While there was no announcement by the Cubs, 
his hiring was confirmed to The Associated Press by a senior major

	LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Eric Crouch's 49-yard touchdown pass to  
Bobby Newcombe with 3:24 left lifted No. 8 Nebraska to a 24-17 
victory over Kansas on Saturday, giving the Cornhuskers their 31st 
consecutive victory over the Jayhawks. Crouch also ran for one 
score and Newcombe returned a punt 86 yards for another TD for 
Nebraska (7-1, 4-1 Big 12), which trailed 9-0 at halftime. Kansas 
dropped to 3-6 and 1-4. Correll Buckhalter ran for 116 yards on 22 
carries for Nebraska, which won despite a lost fumble at Kansas' 
1-yard line and two missed field goals by Josh Brown.

<HEADLINE> Benes Opts Out of Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Andy Benes threw the first pitch for the Arizona  
Diamondbacks. Now, he probably has thrown his last for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old right-hander exercised an option that allowed  
him out of the final year of his contract and filed for free agency 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes, a veteran of 10 major league seasons, was 27-25 in his  
two seasons with the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel that he made a tremendous contribution to the  
Diamondbacks, particularly in our first year,'' general manager Joe 
Garagiola Jr. said. ``He will always be an important part of that 
first-year story and certainly was a contributor to our success 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benes was 13-12 last season with a 4.81 ERA for the NL West  
champions. He struck out 141 and walked a team-high 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes was due to make $6 million from the Diamondbacks next  
season. His decision frees up that money for the team to use to 
pursue other free agents. It also likely opens the way for Brian 
Anderson to move into next year's starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes' final few weeks with the team were touchy ones.  
</P>
<P>
	After his last start, a 9-3 victory over Colorado, he refused to  
answer questions from reporters, apparently upset he had not been 
treated fairly by the media. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, Benes was left off the playoff rotation in  
favor of Anderson and was sent to the bullpen for the first-round 
series against the New York Mets. He did not pitch an inning as the 
Diamondbacks were eliminated by the Mets 3-1 in the best-of-5 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Olson, the Diamondbacks' closer their first year, also  
filed for free agency. Olson had 30 saves in 1998, but lost his job 
this season after a rocky start. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 9-4 with a 3.71 ERA and 14 saves and Matt Mantei,  
obtained from Florida, finished as the closer, getting 32 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes signed an $18 million, three-year contract with the  
expansion Diamondbacks in 1998, with a clause that allowed him out 
after two years if he chose. He was the starter in the team's first 
game, on March 31, 1998, against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a reputation of being a strong late-season pitcher.  
Benes' career record after the All-Star break is 74-47. He won six 
of his last seven decisions this year. In 1998, he allowed three 
runs in his last six starts. His best game with Arizona came in 
Cincinnati on Sept. 13, 1998, when he threw a no-hitter for 8 1-3 
innings before giving up a single to Sean Casey. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes has a career record of 131-119 with a 4.13 ERA with San  
Diego, Seattle, St. Louis and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that he might try to return to St.  
Louis, where his brother Alan has come back from major arm surgery 
to pitch for the Cardinals. Andy Benes was 18-10 for St. Louis in 
1996 and 10-7 for the Cardinals in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A standout pitcher at the University of Evansville, Benes was  
the No. 1 pick overall, by San Diego, in the 1988 amateur draft and 
was a member of the U.S. Olympic team that year.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Baylor has been hired to manage the Chicago  
Cubs, taking over a last-place team that was plagued by injuries

<P>
	Baylor, the hitting coach of the Atlanta Braves last season  
after six years as manager of the Colorado Rockies, had been

</P>
<P>
	It also was reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which  
reported in its Sunday editions that Baylor had agreed to a 
four-year deal averaging $1.3 million and that the hiring will be 
announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor led the Rockies to the playoffs in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	``The stability of the Cubs and Wrigley Field won me over,''  
Baylor was quoted as saying by the Journal-Constitution. ``It's a 
great move for me to make. I've been in the league now for six 
years as a manager and as a coach. I know the league now. In the 
American League, I don't know as much, watching the slugfests over 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor played his entire 19-year major league career in the AL.  
He spent six years with the Angels, winning the MVP award in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs fired Jim Riggleman after finishing last in the NL  
Central with the third-worst record in baseball (67-95), ahead of 
only the Florida Marlins (64-98) and Minnesota Twins (63-97). 
</P>
<P>
	His hiring also increases the number of minority managers as  
Baylor, who is black, joins Felipe Alou of the Montreal Expos, 
Dusty Baker of the San Francisco Giants and Jerry Manuel of the 
Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been criticized by some for not hiring more  
minority executives.

<P>
	TARKUMIYA, West Bank (AP) -- Assailants opened fire on a bus  
traveling through the West Bank on Saturday, injuring five 
Israelis. Police suspected Palestinians in the attack, which came 
two days before of a major peace summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. leaders were scheduled to meet  
Monday in Oslo, Norway, to open talks on a final peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, the Likud opposition party accused Prime  
Minister Ehud Barak of conceding too much in the peace process 
without insisting the Palestinian Authority stamp out militant 
groups, Israel army radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was traveling from the settlement of Kiryat Arba when  
the attackers opened fire near the Palestinian village of 
Tarkumiya, police spokesman Rafi Yaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 20 minutes after we left, we heard about five shots,''  
said Michael Strauss, a passenger on the bus. ``They were probably 
shot from a car parked at the side of the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the bullets hit the lower part of the bus, and  
most of the injuries were in the legs, Strauss said. The bus 
continued traveling until it reached a nearby army base, where 
authorities and rescue services were alerted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded were taken to a hospital in Jerusalem, Yaffe said.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred near a long-awaited land link for  
Palestinian travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The route, 
which uses existing Israeli roads, opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli hard-liners had warned that the route traveled by  
thousands of Palestinians would be used by terrorists to carry out 
attacks against Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli troops began extensive searches in the area for the  
attackers but did not immediately arrest any suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis on the bus, residents of towns inside Israel, had  
spent the Jewish Sabbath in Kiryat Arba to show solidarity with the 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak and Arafat are scheduled to officially open the final  
status talks in Oslo. President Clinton is to direct the 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak took office in July and immediately renewed the peace  
process, which was largely frozen under his predecessor, Benjamin 
Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has demanded the Palestinians fight anti-Israeli groups,  
but has taken a more moderate stance toward the Palestinians than 
Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Bagshot Wins California Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Bagshot found his way to the winner's  
circle for the first time in three years Saturday with a 1 1/2-length 
victory over Del Mar Gray in the $250,000 California Cup Classic at 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Cup, in its 10th year, is a series of 10 races  
worth more than $1.2 million for California-breds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagshot had lost 18 straight races and was without a victory  
since the I'm Smokin' Stakes at Del Mar in September 1996, when he 
was moved up from second on a disqualification. His only other win 
was in a maiden race in July 1996 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden for the first time by Chris Antley, Bagshot covered 1 1/8  
miles in 1:48 3-5 and paid $10.40, $4 and $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Mar Gray, trained by Bob Baffert, returned $3 and $2.20,  
while Smoky Cinder, one of two entries trained by Jenine Sahadi, 
was another 1 1/2 lengths back in third and paid $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing blinkers, Bagshot stayed off the early pace, then took a  
short lead into the second turn and drew clear under the 
left-handed whipping of Antley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a slow pace and I let him go ahead and run his race the  
whole way down the backside,'' Antley said. ``When I got into him 
left-handed, he fired. (Trainer) Paco Gonzalez told me to ride him 
aggressively, and that's what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the losses, Bagshot was frequently on the board last  
year. The 6-year-old finished in the money in seven of nine races 
and earned $364,000. He lost the Santa Anita Handicap and last 
year's Cal Cup Classic, both by one length. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought today would be his day,'' owner John Toffan said.  
``His last few races, he's shown some speed. It's nice to win this 
race. It's great for us because we breed a lot in California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bagshot has been on the sideline for most of the year since  
finishing third in an allowance race in February. He finished 
seventh in his comeback race on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett Gomez rode three winners on the 10-race card, including  
teaming with trainer Juan Garcia for victories with Chichim ($20) 
in the Distaff and Native Desert ($5.80) in the Mile. Gomez also 
won the Sprint with Love That Red ($6) in front of a crowd of 
31,047. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a mount in the Classic, so I have to win my share  
of the others, I guess,'' said Gomez, who won last year's Classic 
with Budroyale. 
</P>
<P>
	Native Desert covered one mile on the turf in 1:34 2-5 under  
high weight of 122 pounds and paid $5.80, $4.20 and $3. Macward 
returned $10.60 and $6, while High Tech Friend paid $4.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Cover Gal remained undefeated with a 2 1/2-length victory over  
Starring Me in the $125,000 Juvenile Fillies, making her 4-for-4 in 
her career. The 2-year-old covered 1 1-16 miles in 1:45 going two 
turns for the first time and paid $3, $2.60 and 2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the Juvenile Fillies, Fire Sale Queen lost  
jockey Martin Pedroza when she stumbled and nearly fell. She 
continued running well ahead of the field, but turning for home, 
Fire Sale Queen took a right turn and went over the rail. She was 
pinned between the rail and fence, but escaped serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners were Irrelevant in the 5 1/2-furlong Starter Sprint  
Handicap; J.R. Holmes in the 1 1/2-mile Starter Handicap; Feverish in 
the 1 1-16-mile Matron; Spacelink in the 1 1-16-mile Juvenile; and 
Lazy Slusan in the 1 1/8-mile Distaff Starter Handicap.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Reportedly Mulling Lopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- San Diego Padres first base coach Davey Lopes  
is a leading contender to be the Milwaukee Brewers' new manager, 
the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes has been invited Monday for a second interview with the  
Brewers, the newspaper said. The interview would include club 
president Wendy Selig-Prieb, who did not participate in the initial 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers declined comment on whether Lopes has been asked  
back. The newspaper based its report on an unidentified source 
``familiar with the search process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who might announce their choice for a new manager  
as early as next week, also could bring back New York Yankees third 
base coach Willie Randolph for another interview, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes has been San Diego's first base coach for five seasons.  
Before that, he spent four years as a dugout coach and first base 
coach with the Texas Rangers, and served for three years as a first 
base coach with the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees batting coach Chris Chambliss has also interviewed with  
the Brewers.

<HEADLINE> Yankees the Team of the Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe Torre talks about the ghosts that seem to live in every nook  
and cranny of Yankee Stadium, permanent reminders of the history 
and aura that hangs over the place. 
</P>
<P>
	While managing this team of the decade and franchise of the  
century to its 25th World Series championship, Torre reflected on 
what it means to wear the Yankee pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got this job, I felt a little strange putting on  
the Yankee uniform because of all the tradition that went with 
being a part of this organization,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled in his first spring training as manager how Reggie  
Jackson, Goose Gossage and Ron Guidry showed up as instructors. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those people, it's special,'' Torre said. ``There's a lot  
of history, a lot of pride involved with being part of this 
organization. You feel an obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's because Yankee Stadium seems more like a baseball  
museum than it does a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Out beyond the left field fence is Monument Park, a tribute to  
the players who created the tradition. Before each game he pitches, 
Roger Clemens goes out there to touch Babe Ruth's monument. Catcher 
Jorge Posada does the same to the one honoring Thurman Munson. 
</P>
<P>
	The monuments and plaques for all the old Yankees are bridges  
from the past to the present, a roadmap through a legacy of winning 
that is unmatched in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' World Series titles are a benchmark of excellence,  
16 more championships than any other baseball team, nine more than 
any NFL or NBA franchise. Only the 23 Stanley Cups won by Montreal 
hockey teams come close, but that total was achieved by two teams, 
the Canadiens and the Maroons. 
</P>
<P>
	All around the Stadium, there are reminders of this team's rich  
and glorious history; pictures of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech; of 
Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle; of Yogi Berra and Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The players wore No. 5 patches on their uniform sleeves this  
season to honor DiMaggio, who died in March, and black arm bands in 
memory of Catfish Hunter, who died in September. It was Joe D. who 
uttered the words that seem to sum up the franchise's history so 
well: ``I thank the good Lord for making me a Yankee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a sentiment shared by many through the years because being  
a Yankee usually means winning. From the time Ruth arrived in New 
York in 1920 and revolutionized baseball with the long ball, the 
Yankees have been the yardstick against which other teams are 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
	The success has resulted in 36 American League championships in  
78 years -- almost one every other year. That is a remarkable ratio 
made even more impressive by two significant dry spells. The 
Yankees went without a pennant from 1964-76 and again from 1981-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth's Yankees had Murderers' Row and earned the nickname the  
Bronx Bombers. They swept the Series in 1927 and 1928, and again in 
1932 when The Babe's called shot left a permanent imprint on the 
event. Like those teams, Torre's Yankees have won 12 straight World 
Series games. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's Yankees duplicated the back-to-back sweeps in  
1938-39. Torre's Yankees also achieved back-to-back sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the Casey Stengel dynasty began, delivering 10 pennants  
in 12 years. There were two sets of five straight championships -- 
1949-1953 and 1960-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees established their dominance at a simpler time in  
baseball history. When they began beating up the baseball world, 
teams advanced directly from regular-season league championships to 
the World Series. Now, getting to the ultimate goal is more 
complicated because of the land mines in the divisional playoffs 
and League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Yankees had to beat 15 other teams for the  
championship. Now they must beat 29. Still, they seem to find a 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	They are resilient and opportunistic, as different from the  
teams that preceded them as Muhammad Ali was from Joe Louis. They 
win with jabs instead of knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said they are a perfect team for New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special city,'' he said. ``There's a lot of energy.  
I think that's what the Yankees feed off, the energy of the city. I 
think it's a combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their tradition goes beyond winning.  
</P>
<P>
	Some years ago, a rookie showed up in training camp and  
requested uniform No. 3. It was quietly explained to him that No. 3 
belonged to Ruth and no longer was available -- along with 14 other 
numbers the Yankees have retired to honor the heroes who wore them. 
</P>
<P>
	No team has taken more numbers out of circulation. That's  
because no team has had as many players it needed to honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at all the pictures hanging here,'' Torre said. ``Ruth  
and Gehrig and DiMaggio, all the grace and elegance. There's a 
certain elegance about wearing a Yankee uniform and the way guys 
did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many uniforms have changed over the years and the Yankees  
have maintained their style and their class of the pinstripe, no 
names on the back, just the Yankees. You don't have to be in 
baseball or even be a sports fan to know who the New York Yankees 
are.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Fire Piersall From Minors Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jimmy Piersall, known for outrageous behavior in  
a career in baseball that's spanned more than four decades, says he 
was fired as a Chicago Cubs minor league instructor because of 
critical remarks he made about the team's management. 
</P>
<P>
	Piersall was fired Friday for ``issues relating to his  
performance in player development,'' said Cubs general manager Ed 
Lynch. ``We've always viewed his public comments separately from 
that as employee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Piersall says he thinks he was fired because of a remark he  
made on a radio program after Jim Riggleman was fired as manager of 
the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Piersall said ``two other guys'' should have been fired instead  
of Riggleman -- leaving little doubt he was talking about Lynch and 
Cubs president Andy MacPhail. 
</P>
<P>
	Piersall, 69, was told of the Cubs' decision by Jim Hendry, the  
team's director of player development and scouting. Piersall told 
the Chicago Tribune he didn't ask the reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me put it this way,'' Piersall said, ``I've been doing it  
for 14 years with the Cubs and eight years on 'The Score,' (WSCR-AM 
1160) and no one said anything. Now I'm having problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piersall has long been one of the true characters of baseball.  
To celebrate his 100th home run, he circled the bases running 
backward. He once threw a baseball and an orange at the exploding 
scoreboard at Comiskey Park. His nervous breakdown in 1952 was the 
basis for the film, ``Fear Strikes Out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piersall also worked with the late Harry Caray as a broadcaster  
for the White Sox.

<HEADLINE> Bruins 3, Sabres 0 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Sergei Samsonov scored two goals, and John Grahame  
made 26 saves to earn his first career shutout as the Boston Bruins 
beat the Buffalo Sabres 3-0 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After starting out the season without a victory in their first  
nine games, the Bruins are 4-0-1 since. The Sabres, who lost in the 
Stanley Cup Finals last year to the Dallas Stars, continued to 
struggle on the road as they remained winless in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle McLaren's slap shot from the blue line beat Sabres goalie  
Martin Biron at 8:46 of the first period as a Bruins power-play 
expired to give Boston a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston increased its lead 46 seconds later when Sergei Samsonov  
fired a wrist a shot from the slot over Biron's glove side after 
taking a backhand pass from Joe Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsonov scored his second goal of the game and fourth of the  
season when he converted another pass by Thornton to give the 
Bruins a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's best scoring opportunity came with less than five  
minutes remaining in the game, when Grahame (2-3-2) stopped Dixon 
Ward's rebound attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Biron made only his second start of the season for the Sabres,  
who were without five-time Vezina Trophy winner Dominik Hasek. 
Biron (2-1) finished with 31 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek did not play after reaggravating a groin injury on Friday  
night that forced him to miss 12 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Sabres do not know the status of Hasek, the Bruins  
expect to have No. 1 goalie Byron Dafoe in uniform next week. Dafoe 
signed a three-year deal Friday, after missing the first 12 games 
due to a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Grahame, who is battling with Robbie Tallas for the backup role  
now that Dafoe has returned, won his second NHL game in only his 
seventh NHL start.

<HEADLINE> Poisoned Treats Haunt Halloween </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A quarter-century has not erased the stain on  
Halloween left by the ``Candy Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Clark O'Bryan earned his sweet-sounding nickname most  
distastefully: He killed his 8-year-old son with cyanide-laced 
candy after a night of trick-or-treating, for $20,000 in insurance 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It profoundly affected the whole community, every child of  
trick-or-treating age,'' said Mike Hinton, then a Harris County 
prosecutor who sent O'Bryan to death row. ``There's no question it 
had a national effect on Halloween.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Oct. 31, 1974, the idea of carefully examining children's  
Halloween booty might have seemed like a paranoid waste of time. 
O'Bryan, a suburban Houston optician, shocked the city and the 
nation when it was discovered he replaced some of the sugary powder 
inside five Giant Pixy Stix with enough cyanide to kill two or 
three grown men each. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Timothy Marc O'Bryan ate the deadly confection and died  
shortly afterward. Four other children, including Timothy's younger 
sister, received the straws but did not ingest their contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Halloween changed forever once word of the slaying spread.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sure brought it into sharp focus that the potential is  
certainly there,'' said Mike Ellis, director of the Southeast Texas 
Poison Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis still frowns on random trick-or-treating, instead  
encouraging children to attend controlled activities. He suggests 
that the parents of children who go door to door either purchase 
candy to replace gathered sweets or ensure their kids visit trusted 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts recommend that parents closely inspect all candy  
collected. Hard, individually wrapped treats tend to be the safest 
from molestation. Hospitals and other agencies often provide free 
X-ray examinations of fruits and other sweets that might contain 
foreign objects. 
</P>
<P>
	In the notorious Houston case, O'Bryan clipped off one end of  
the package and crudely stapled the straw back together, a method 
that ironically might have saved one neighbor boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When police got to Whitney Parker's house, his parents almost  
died on the spot because they couldn't find the Pixy Stix,'' said 
Hinton, now a lawyer in private practice. ``They found him holding 
it asleep. His little fingers were not strong enough to get the 
staples out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said O'Bryan distributed the extra sticks to Whitney  
and two other neighborhood children to hide his motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was what was horrible, his willingness to sacrifice other  
kids to cover it up. That really shook us,'' said Bill Lanier, then 
a detective with the Pasadena police force. ``We got lucky getting 
that candy back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan never admitted to killing his son. He testified at his  
trial that he let Timothy eat the Pixy Stix before bedtime, giving 
him Kool-Aid when the boy said the candy tasted bitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy soon complained of searing stomach pains, threw up twice  
and collapsed, O'Bryan said. He died before arriving at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan -- dubbed ``Candy Man'' by his death row mates -- was  
executed on March 31, 1984. He made no mention of Timothy in his 
final written statement, but did write this vague passage: ``Also, 
to anyone I have offended in anyway during my 39 years, I pray and 
ask your forgiveness, just as I forgive anyone whose offended me in 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Pasadena-area resident Chris Berryhill said O'Bryan's  
legacy still lingers this time of year. Worse, he blames the local 
murder for spawning copycats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took all the fun out of Halloween. It really has,''  
Berryhill said. ``If I had a little child now, I would not allow 
them to pick up candy from someone and put it in their mouth. The 
fear it caused almost makes Halloween not worthwhile.''

</P>
<P>
	AUDUBON, N.J. (AP) -- Peter F. Finley, a longtime newspaper  
columnist and award-winning reporter whose career spanned three 
decades, died Wednesday from complications from a brain tumor. He 
was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, Finley scooped his colleagues while working for the  
Courier-Post of Cherry Hill when he cornered then-Gov. Richard 
Hughes in a restaurant men's room and landed an exclusive interview 
about yet-to-be announced plans for a summit between President 
Lyndon Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin. 
</P>
<P>
	The story earned Finley a national spot news award. Other press  
honors include an award from the Philadelphia Press Association for 
``Best Human Interest Story'' in 1970, a best writer award from the 
Philadelphia Press Association in 1978 and New Jersey Press 
Association awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley, who was a reporter and columnist at the Courier-Post for  
30 years, retired in the early '80s. He was known for his armchair 
columns about day-to-day life. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Diana, five sons, two  
daughters, 13 grandchildren, a brother and two sisters.

died Wednesday of injuries suffered in a traffic accident in

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julio Martinez, a former drug addict who  
eventually headed New York state's drug treatment program, died of 
cancer Thursday. He was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was a central figure in the restoration and expansion  
of drug treatment programs both locally and nationally, and in the 
shift from state-operated rehabilitation programs to 
community-based treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely because of his efforts, there are now nearly 1,000  
community based centers treating addicts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, whose family moved to the state from Puerto Rico when  
he was 2, became a heroin addict as a teen-ager but recovered in 
his early 20s. In 1966 he helped establish Phoenix House, a 
treatment facility operated by former addicts which is today the 
largest private drug treatment agency in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez headed the state drug-free agency from 1979 to 1989,  
but was forced to resign amid reports by state investigators that 
he had steered money for drug treatment programs run by his friends 
that failed to treat addicts. He denied the charges.

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Robert L. Mills, an Ohio State University  
professor emeritus and co-author of the 1954 Yang-Mills theory in 
mathematical physics, died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills retired from Ohio State in 1955 after 39 years there as a  
teacher of theoretical physics. He was vice chairman for 
undergraduate studies. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of New Jersey, Mills graduated with honors in  
mathematics from Columbia University in 1948 before earning 
graduate degrees at Cambridge University in England and at 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills and physicist Chen Ning Yang received the American Academy  
of Arts and Sciences' Rumford Prize in 1980 for their theory, which 
was centered around forces between nuclear particles.

high-tech industry, died in a car accident Oct. 13. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Raviv, who founded and led IBM's research activities in Israel  
for more than 25 years, died in the New Zealand crash that also 
killed his wife and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Raviv was head of the IBM Israel Scientific Center in Haifa and  
served as its first director when it became the Haifa Research 
Laboratory in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Poland in 1934, Raviv moved to what was then Palestine  
when he was 4. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in 
electrical engineering from Stanford University, then earned a 
master's degree in mathematics as well as a doctorate in electrical 
engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Raviv co-authored a technical paper in 1974 that was the basis  
for a key computer function that helped computers understand a 
human's natural language, translate between languages and 
synthesize speech.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Mining Permit Ban on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A ruling that banned the state from  
issuing strip mining permits for projects that use stream beds to 
dispose of rock and dirt has been put on hold while it is being 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II stayed his ruling until the  
U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals considers an appeal by the state 
Division of Environmental Protection, which issues permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Bailey, the DEP's lawyer, said he did not know how long the  
appeal process would take. 
</P>
<P>
	Haden delayed the implementation of his Oct. 20 order even  
though the state agency failed to meet the necessary criteria for 
one. He said he wanted to quiet the uproar since he issued the 
ruling that bans mining operations from dumping coal and dirt 
within 100 feet of a stream. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling so worried state officials that Gov. Cecil Underwood  
ordered a state hiring and spending freeze in preparation for what 
he said could be a statewide budget cut of as much as 10 percent 
because of a reduction in taxes from mining. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could all but shut down mountaintop removal mining, a  
strip mining technique used increasingly in Appalachia. The top of 
a ridge is sheared off, the coal is extracted, and the leftover 
rock and dirt are pushed into a nearby river valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal industry leaders warned that the ruling could also cripple  
traditional underground mining, which also disposes of waste in 
river valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood and state environmental officials said the ruling  
affects existing permits, though Haden said this week that his 
ruling applied only to future permits. 
</P>
<P>
	The DEP said it will decide Monday whether to allow coal  
companies with permits to resume operations. Last week, such 
companies were told they cannot expand the dumping of rock and dirt 
any farther into streams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely grateful to the judge,'' DEP Director Mike  
Castle said. ``We will move forward with caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haden also criticized state officials specifically for saying  
his ruling would cause economic havoc by shutting down strip mines 
and potentially stopping road building and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is the No. 2 coal-producing state, behind Wyoming.  
The coal industry accounts for 3 percent of all jobs in West 
Virginia, down from 9.5 percent in 1979. The nearly 19,000 jobs 
tied to the industry provided more than $950 million in wages in 
1998, with workers averaging $50,800 a year.

<HEADLINE> Status Quo Challenged in 1999 Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Heading into Tuesday's elections, some traditional political  
sure-shots are facing rare challenges: a Republican is in a 
neck-and-neck race to become Philadelphia's mayor, while a Democrat 
has a strong chance at winning the Mississippi governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia hasn't gone Republican in a half-century.  
Mississippi, like most of the traditionally Democratic South, has 
been turning steadily GOP. In the Midwest, Democrats are vigorously 
trying to end decades of Republican control in Indianapolis and 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	With presidential hopefuls swarming the first primary states,  
races for these and a smattering of other offices give political 
activists the chance to build momentum for the all-important races 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political community watches elections of this kind very  
closely,'' said Robert D. Holsworth, director of the Center for 
Public Policy at Virginia Commonwealth University. ``It has a 
potential ripple effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are gleeful about the chance of winning  
Philadelphia, hope to take control of all of Virginia's Legislature 
and expect to lock in Mississippi after Democrats last year shook 
the Southern GOP trend and won governorships in Alabama and South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two months, Republicans poured more than $1 million  
into state and local races, half of it in Mississippi's race for 
governor. Democrats didn't make their spending public. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say even if they don't win some races, the fact  
they're competing in Republican territory like the South and the 
Midwest proves their growing strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a year of surprise for Democrats. We're in  
contention in places we never thought we'd be,'' said Jenny Backus, 
a Democratic National Committee spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi's race for governor, after an affair dogged the  
end of married Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice's two terms, many saw 
an opportunity for Lt. Gov. Ron Musgrove, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Early polls showed a him in tie with former GOP Rep. Mike  
Parker, but a survey last week showed Parker creeping ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance of losing Philadelphia has President Clinton and  
other national politicians campaigning for Democrat John Street. 
Polls show Republican Sam Katz with an even chance to win a city 
that hasn't had a GOP mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, Republicans are within one seat of gaining control  
of the General Assembly for the first time in 140 years. If they 
do, the GOP would be in position to redraw congressional lines in 
2001, and build momentum for next year's expected challenge to 
two-term U.S. Sen. Charles Robb. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republican strongholds of Indianapolis and Columbus,  
Ohio, Democratic candidates have mounted strong campaigns. Neither 
city has gone Democrat in nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only other governor's race Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Paul  
Patton in Kentucky is favored to win a second term. In Louisiana, 
Republican Gov. Mike Foster won re-election earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Washington state, Democrats could gain control of the  
House if they win a special election for a House district along the 
Idaho border that has steadily voted GOP since 1936. The Senate and 
governor's office are now Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities with elections include Baltimore; Houston; Tucson,  
Ariz.; and San Francisco, where Mayor Willie Brown may be forced 
into a runoff by fellow Democrats. Allegheny County, which includes 
Pittsburgh, is choosing an executive. New Jersey's 80 Assembly 
seats are also up for election. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Bedford, Mass., two sanitation workers are running for  
mayor and city council on a platform to ``clean up the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While political activists watch those races closely, voters in  
several cities and states are paying more attention to a number of 
ballot referendums. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, a ballot question that would ban ATM bank fees  
is expected to pass easily, with the banking industry promising a 
court fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine voters will decide whether to ban a late-term abortion  
procedure that has been outlawed in several states, and whether to 
legalize marijuana for medical uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Missoula, Mont., will decide on a minimum hourly wage of $8,  
limited to city employees and businesses and groups who rely on 
city grants or tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	There are spending and tax questions for sports stadiums in St.  
Paul, Minn., Scottsdale, Ariz., Houston and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Ketchum, Idaho, voters are being asked whether the city  
should continue a mock six-gun shootout that is a tradition at the 
annual Wagon Days festival near the Sun Valley resort.

<HEADLINE> Starzz Sign Extension With WNBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Starzz, who have battled low  
attendance for the last three years, signed a three-year contract 
extension with the WNBA on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel what happened towards the end of last season gave us a  
legitimate cause for recognizing the talent that we have,'' Starzz 
owner Larry Miller said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller signed the contract during a news conference Friday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz were 15-17 last season but went 8-3 down the stretch  
with Korie Hlede and Cindy Brown in uniform. The two were acquired 
from Detroit for Wendy Palmer and Olympia Scott-Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Coach) Fred Williams did a nice job of getting that talent  
under control and managing it, making us really start to play 
competitively,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams took over as manager after Frank Layden resigned last  
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's average attendance last season was 7,544, a figure that  
beat only Charlotte's 7,081. Washington led the league with 15,306 
and the WNBA averaged 10,207 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz sold 3,000 season tickets last season, up slightly  
from the year before, but still well short of the league goal of 
5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin O'Connor, the new vice president for basketball operations  
for the Utah Jazz, said he was eager to work with the Starzz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to making our Utah team one of the better  
teams in the league,'' O'Connor said.

<HEADLINE> SLA History Allowed in Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The bombing conspiracy trial of an alleged  
former member of the Symbionese Liberation Army may become a forum 
for prosecutors to explore the history of the group in California, 
an undertaking which the defense said could last a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Jane Olson is to stand trial on 24-year-old charges she  
planted bombs under police cars for the radical group in 1975. The 
devices did not explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet while Ms. Olson has claimed she is being tried for all the  
SLA's crimes, the group's history may be relevant, Superior Court 
Judge James Ideman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems we are going to have the whole history of the  
Symbionese Liberation Army in California put on in this 
courtroom,'' Ideman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not issue a ruling that the group's activities  
would be fair game at trial. Instead, he offered the observation 
during a pre-trial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the prosecutors intend to try to show ``she  
should have known what she was getting involved in'' when she 
joined the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is best known for the February 1974 kidnapping of  
Patty Hearst, though earlier members of the group were convicted of 
killing Oakland schools chief Marcus Foster. There were also a 
series of bank robberies in Northern California. Ms. Olson is not 
charged with any of those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson, formerly Kathleen Ann Soliah, was not associated with  
the SLA when the group abducted Hearst from her Berkeley apartment. 
Now known as Patty Hearst Shaw, she has been ordered to testify at 
Ms. Olson's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Susan Jordan said that including the group's  
history would drag the trial out a year, a claim prosecutors 
disputed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson was indicted in 1976 and was a fugitive until June,  
when she was arrested in St. Paul, Minn., after being featured on 
TV's ``America's Most Wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was present for the proceeding but did not speak.

<HEADLINE> 2 Churches Settle Salvation Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By BURT HERMAN    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Ending an almost 500-year debate that started when  
Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to a church door, the Lutheran 
and Roman Catholic churches plan to sign a joint declaration on 
Sunday putting aside their differences over the way humanity 
achieves salvation. 
</P>
<P>
	The historic ceremony is to take place in Augsburg, where the  
document that outlines the foundations of the Lutheran church was 
drawn up in 1530 in what was a failed attempt to reconcile the 
differences that split Christianity during the Protestant 
Reformation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centers on the question of how to get to heaven.  
Catholics believe that people's actions can make a difference, 
while Lutherans believe salvation is based on faith alone. 
</P>
<P>
	While it seems arcane in today's world, the dispute set the  
stage for the division of Germany in the 17th century that sparked 
the Thirty Years War. Protestant princes and foreign powers battled 
the Roman Catholic empire of the Hapsburgs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the agreement to be signed Sunday is a statement  
that faith is essential in salvation: ``Together we confess: By 
grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of 
any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy 
Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to 
good works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 30 years of consultation among theologians, the two sides  
announced in June that they would sign the agreement on the day 482 
years after Luther posted his theses on the door of the Castle 
Church in Wittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Luther was protesting the granting of indulgences, which are  
pardons for sin granted by the Catholic church. Sales of 
indulgences were widely abused until their sale was banned in 1562 
by the Council of Trent, which also laid the ground for modern 
Catholicism in response to the Protestant Reformation. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders stressed that in no way were they trying to say  
that the historical disagreements on salvation were wrong, or that 
Luther's views were incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have tried to do in the dialogue has not been to pass  
judgment, neither on the Council of Trent nor Martin Luther,'' 
Cardinal Edward Idris Cassidy, president of the Vatican's 
Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, said at a Friday 
news conference in Augsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the two churches wanted to ``say what are Lutherans and  
Catholics able to say together today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two churches have been coming together more and more in  
recent decades, said Martin E. Marty, professor emeritus in history 
of modern Christianity at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Church bodies are always subtly changing -- they change more  
the way glaciers change than the way earthquakes change,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agreement marks a fundamental step forward because it  
has been endorsed by the highest authorities in both churches. 
``It's one thing to be told that's the mood, and another to be told 
this is what we formally set forth as our teaching,'' Marty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders said the agreement could pave the way for more  
cooperation at the parish level between the churches. Catholics and 
Lutherans could also work more closely on educational programs, 
particularly in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever Lutherans and Roman Catholics live together, let the  
world know that they are not enemies but sisters and brothers,'' 
the Rev. Ishmael Noko, general secretary of the Lutheran World 
Federation, said Friday in Augsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement won't mean any significant difference in the two  
churches' institutions, leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	And although the agreement marks a pivotal bridge between the  
fundamental beliefs of the world's 1 billion Roman Catholics and 
61.5 million Lutherans, they still disagree in other fundamental 
areas, especially the papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also differences on the Eucharist. Catholics believe  
in what is called transubstantiation, the doctrine that the bread 
and wine used in Holy Communion are changed into the blood and body 
of Christ. Protestants hold the doctrine of consubstantiation, that 
Christ is really present in the elements but they remain only bread 
and wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are future topics of discussion in bringing the two  
churches together on issues beyond justification, leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have overcome that problem -- that gives us hope and courage  
to go forward and overcome the questions which still remain before 
us,'' Cassidy said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A son of NAACP President Kweisi Mfume could  
face up to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to drug 
conspiracy and weapons charges and admitting he sold cocaine for 
more than two years in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald T. Gray, 29, entered the plea Thursday in U.S. District  
Court here to a grand jury indictment charging him with three 
counts of distributing powdered cocaine and three charges of using 
the telephone to arrange drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was arrested last May at his home by agents with the Drug  
Enforcement Administration. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb Jr. 
said DEA agents recovered a 12-gauge shotgun and drug paraphernalia 
after arresting Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Gray came to the attention of the DEA last  
spring after another area man was caught with drugs and said Gray 
had provided him with cocaine on at least 70 occasions, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray is one of five sons of Mfume, whose birth name was Frizzell  
Gray. Sentencing was scheduled for Feb. 11.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Actor Christopher Reeve may be paralyzed and in  
a wheelchair, but it doesn't stop him from getting under the skin 
of medical researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really quite a thorn in the side of scientists,'' Reeve  
says in an interview scheduled to air Monday on ``Dateline NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing well,'' Reeve, 47, says of the researchers.  
``They really are. But now we are down to the ugly part, 
unfortunately, which is patents, money. Who gets the credit? Who 
gets the Nobel Prize? ... That's contaminating the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them haven't seen somebody sitting in a wheelchair on  
a daily basis. They're in a lab and they see rats, and they see 
slides and test tubes, and they've got to be reminded that there 
are people waiting.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Time To Set Clocks Back One Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America falls back to standard time at 2 a.m.  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That means it's time to set the clock back one hour before  
retiring tonight, or risk being early for church or other 
activities Sunday except in all or part of three states. 
</P>
<P>
	It also means that dark will come an hour earlier on Sunday  
night -- Halloween when the little ones are out collecting goodies. 
Safety officials urge special care by drivers and parents because 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Daylight-saving time returns on April 2, 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, Hawaii and the part of Indiana in the Eastern time zone  
remain on standard time throughout the year, so there'll be no 
movement of the clocks there. The same applies in the U.S. 
territories of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.

Saturday when he was struck by a flare fired by a supporter of a

the Tanjug news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Star fans, angry at the flare believed to have been fired by

	Police said the country's Soccer Association was expected to  
take undisclosed measures against the club whose fans caused the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  IOC Panel Can't Decide on Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic  
Committee's reform panel failed Saturday to resolve the crucial 
issue of whether members should be banned from visiting bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel endorsed a series of other key proposals,  
including the appointment of 15 athletes to the IOC and the 
introduction of an eight-year term of office and re-election 
process for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a member of the  
IOC 2000 reform commission, believes the reform package will 
satisfy the IOC's critics in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more has been achieved than many ... thought  
possible,'' he said. ``I think we're making good progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-member task force, set up in the wake of the Salt Lake  
City bribery scandal, examined 50 proposals drafted by its 
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The final recommendations will be submitted to the full IOC  
general assembly at a special session in Lausanne Dec. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to appear before  
Congress Dec. 15 to testify about the reforms. Congress has 
threatened sanctions unless the IOC enacts significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of visits to bid cities dominated the meeting, which  
was completed in one day instead of the scheduled two. But, in a 
defeat for Samaranch, the commission failed to endorse the 
recommendation for a blanket ban. 
</P>
<P>
	With no consensus reached, Samaranch decided to submit two  
proposals to the December meeting: one calling for no visits, and 
the other -- suggested by Kissinger -- allowing for visits on a 
tightly-controlled basis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the revelations of improper inducements stemming from Salt  
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, the IOC banned visits 
during the bidding for the 2006 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But many members argued Saturday that visits should be  
reinstated, under restrictions, so that delegates could make an 
informed choice on host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Sithole, an IOC member from Zimbabwe, said a ban on visits  
would suggest the IOC doesn't trust its members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes criminals of all of us,'' he said. ``I don't think I  
shouldn't be able to visit the cities because someone is afraid 
that someone might slip something into my pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Austrian member Philip von Schoeller: ``This decision  
proves that those who have remained loyal to the organization are 
not to be trusted. They are regarded as potential crooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also opposing a ban on visits was former U.N. Secretary General  
Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should leave as much freedom as possible,'' he said. ``We  
should trust the members and let them act. I don't think adding a 
prohibition on visits is going to help enhance the image of the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there were just as many delegates arguing in favor of a ban.  
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is in the public eye as never before,'' British member  
Craig Reedie said. ``I think we have to be responsive to public 
opinion. The only way we can do that in the short term is by not 
visiting bid cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, who chaired a  
working group on the site selection process, said: ``The downside 
of visiting the cities far outweighs the positive benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz and others said members should rely on the findings of  
a special evaluation commission -- made up of IOC and non-IOC 
technical experts -- which will continue to visit cities and prepare 
a detailed report on each bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform group endorsed a recommendation Saturday for the  
introduction of a bid selection procedure, requiring prospective 
bid cities to meet certain criteria before being allowed to submit 
a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger proposed that those members who feel a need to visit a  
bid city be allowed to do so -- but only in organized groups, for a 
specified time period, and at the expense of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no lavish entertainment and gifts and so forth --  
this must be guaranteed,'' Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch repeated his adamant opposition to visits but said he  
would accept whatever the members decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I am right, sometimes I am not right,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While some reforms will require a two-thirds vote for passage,  
Samaranch said the ban on visits would only need a simple majority 
because it wouldn't entail changing the Olympic Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, the commission endorsed a proposal for an age  
limit of 70. But the rule will apply only to future members, while 
the existing 100-plus delegates will continue to be covered by the 
80 age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight-year terms of office will be introduced for all members,  
including current delegates. After eight years, members can seek 
re-election by the IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	There was long debate -- but no consensus -- on the recommendation  
for IOC presidents to be limited to a single eight-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Many delegates objected, saying presidents should have a chance  
to run for a second term of four or eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would put both proposals to the December  
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other recommendations approved Saturday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- the IOC to have a maximum of 115 members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 15 active athletes to be appointed as full IOC members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- the renovated IOC to include 15 presidents of international  
federations and 15 presidents of national Olympic committees or 
continental associations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	-- creation of a special selection committee to screen candidates  
for IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	-- the executive board to be expanded from 11 members to 15, with  
a permanent seat reserved for athletes.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Panel Can't Decide on Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic  
Committee's reform panel failed Saturday to resolve the crucial 
issue of whether members should be banned from visiting bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel endorsed a series of other key proposals,  
including the appointment of 15 athletes to the IOC and the 
introduction of an eight-year term of office and re-election 
process for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a member of the  
IOC 2000 reform commission, believes the reform package will 
satisfy the IOC's critics in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more has been achieved than many ... thought  
possible,'' he said. ``I think we're making good progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-member task force, set up in the wake of the Salt Lake  
City bribery scandal, examined 50 proposals drafted by its 
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The final recommendations will be submitted to the full IOC  
general assembly at a special session in Lausanne Dec. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to appear before  
Congress Dec. 15 to testify about the reforms. Congress has 
threatened sanctions unless the IOC enacts significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of visits to bid cities dominated the meeting, which  
was completed in one day instead of the scheduled two. But, in a 
defeat for Samaranch, the commission failed to endorse the 
recommendation for a blanket ban. 
</P>
<P>
	With no consensus reached, Samaranch decided to submit two  
proposals to the December meeting: one calling for no visits, and 
the other -- suggested by Kissinger -- allowing for visits on a 
tightly-controlled basis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the revelations of improper inducements stemming from Salt  
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, the IOC banned visits 
during the bidding for the 2006 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But many members argued Saturday that visits should be  
reinstated, under restrictions, so that delegates could make an 
informed choice on host cities.

<HEADLINE> No. 5 Florida 30, No. 10 Georgia 14 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Steve Spurrier did his Vince Dooley  
impression Saturday. It worked, and Spurrier earned his 100th 
victory as Florida's coach in the most fitting way possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the 30-14 win come against Georgia, the team he  
loves to beat most, but it came in the same manner the Bulldogs 
used to stick it to the Gators for all those years. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind a defense that shut out No. 10 Georgia (6-2, 4-2  
Southeastern Conference) in the second half and an offense more 
suited to the ground than the Fun 'N Gun, the fifth-ranked Gators 
won their ninth of the last 10 in this series and took control of 
the SEC East. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Gators (7-1, 5-1) beat Vanderbilt next Saturday and South  
Carolina the following week, they'll go back to the SEC title game 
for the first time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, they'll celebrate a victory in one of the nation's  
most storied rivalries, best known as ``The World's Largest Outdoor 
Cocktail Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's version was a watered-down affair, a game bogged  
down by steady rain in the first half, sputtering offense in the 
second, and silly penalties and a number of stalled drives the 
whole way through. 
</P>
<P>
	It was entertaining nonetheless, with a pair of defenses being  
pushed to their limits time and again and Florida's coming out 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in the second half, Georgia took over inside the Florida  
40 trailing 16-14. Both times, the Gators refused to budge. On the 
second drive, Keith Kelsey forced a fumble by Jasper Sanks at the 
Florida 10 and Bennie Alexander recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida gained the field-position advantage on the next drive,  
then struck one possession later, when Bo Carroll burst through the 
right side for a 30-yard touchdown and a 23-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	On Georgia's next drive, Alex Brown forced another turnover at  
the Georgia 2. Doug Johnson ran in on the next play and a game that 
had been much closer was suddenly out of hand. Brown also had an 
interception on Georgia's final drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll finished with 113 yards on 13 carries and accounted for  
most of the offense in the second half. Despite Spurrier's threats 
to the contrary, Johnson lasted the entire game. He threw for all 
of his 234 yards in the first half, however, as the game turned 
into a defensive struggle, more reminiscent of 1969 than 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators shut down Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter, holding  
him to 6-for-23 passing for just 76 yards. He had more success 
running, especially in the first half, when he sliced through the 
Florida defense on a pair of option plays for two scores and a 
14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida regained the lead on a 10-play, 72-yard march for a  
16-14 lead late in the first half. From there, the defense took 
over, as Florida allowed only 14 first downs and 231 yards in 
offense, just 53 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost somewhere in that effort, Florida's Darrell Jackson caught  
six passes for 141 yards, his sixth straight 100-yard receiving 
game, which ties Carlos Alvarez for the school record.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wants Fee Added to Phone Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators opened an investigation  
Friday into a request by AT&AMP;T Corp. to sharply increase fees that 
residential customers pay to subsidize phone service for the poor, 
people in expensive-to-serve areas and school Internet hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance company, filed a  
request Friday with the Federal Communications Commission seeking 
to increase the fee by almost 52 percent, from 99 cents a month to 
$1.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said late Friday that it would not let the proposed fees  
go into effect for now and opened an investigation to determine 
whether they are justified. If the FCC didn't act, the fees would 
have gone into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission ``stopped these charges pending the outcome of an  
investigation to determine the reasonableness of AT&AMP;T's increase,'' 
the agency said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T justified the proposed fee increase as fair and necessary  
to cover its increased costs in providing the subsidized services. 
The subsidy requirements are imposed by the government on 
long-distance and other companies, which pass them along to 
customers in various charges on their phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a complex matter and we will go over our numbers and  
justification with the FCC as soon as possible,'' a AT&AMP;T 
spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will give AT&AMP;T and all other interested parties an  
opportunity to weigh in on the matter before making a final 
decision. The commission is required to complete its investigation 
within five months, agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups assailed AT&AMP;T's request.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is an outrageous proposal,'' said Gene Kimmelman of the  
Consumers Union. ``It amounts to nothing more than price gouging to 
consumers, especially people who make few long-distance calls.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers Reportedly Mulling Lopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- San Diego Padres first base coach Davey Lopes  
is a leading contender to be the Milwaukee Brewers' new manager, 
the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes has been invited Monday for a second interview with the  
Brewers, the newspaper said. The interview would include club 
president Wendy Selig-Prieb, who did not participate in the initial 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers declined comment on whether Lopes has been asked  
back. The newspaper based its report on an unidentified source 
``familiar with the search process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who might announce their choice for a new manager  
as early as next week, also could bring back New York Yankees third 
base coach Willie Randolph for another interview, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopes has been San Diego's first base coach for five seasons.  
Before that, he spent four years as a dugout coach and first base 
coach with the Texas Rangers, and served for three years as a first 
base coach with the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees batting coach Chris Chambliss has also interviewed with  
the Brewers.

<HEADLINE>  Iraqi Opposition Meets in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A major Iraqi opposition group has convened its  
first meeting in seven years here, despite a boycott by other 
anti-Saddam Hussein organizations who say the group relies too 
heavily on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 delegates of the Iraqi National Congress began a  
three-day meeting Friday in the posh New York Sheraton Hotel. 
Speeches from David Scheffer, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War 
Crimes Issues; and Sens. Bob Kerry, D-Neb., and Sam Brownback, 
R-Kan., marked the first day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry, who sponsored the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act providing for  
arming Iraqi opposition groups, called for a change in U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are spending nearly $2 billion a year in the containment  
policy. We have a military strategy in place and it simply isn't 
working and it is unsatisfying to the American people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alluding to the fracture among anti-Saddam forces, Kerry said:  
``The fact that you can argue and disagree openly is a sign of 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer showed the audience a box of CD-ROMs he said contained  
more than 5 million pages of captured Iraqi documents that could be 
used to indict the Iraqi leadership for war crimes. He warned that 
the world is beginning to accept the Iraqi regime's propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saddam Hussein and his henchmen are still viewed by some  
governments as legitimate, tolerable leaders of a country somehow 
under siege by the international community,'' Scheffer said. ``In 
reality, these are thugs who terrorize what was once, and could 
again become, a great nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi National Congress members said they hoped the gathering  
would reaffirm their unity, define their vision for a future Iraq 
and begin a new drive to overthrow Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the speeches were unlikely to change any minds among  
the 11 Iraqi opposition groups that boycotted the conference. They 
derided the Iraqi National Congress for its reliance on Washington 
and for having no forces on the ground inside Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Damascus, Jawad Malki, a representative of the  
Islamic Dawa Party, said some Iraqi opposition parties were 
becoming puppets of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans deal with the Iraqi issue according to their  
goals,'' he said. ``They called for the meeting because they could 
not do anything on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayan Jabr, the Syria representative of the Iran-based Supreme  
Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, also said ``real 
opposition should be in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Overthrowing Saddam cannot be done miles away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The gathering in New York coincided with the announcement  
earlier this week that the United States will begin providing 
military support for Iraq's opposition forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Monday, four Iraqis opposition leaders are expected to  
begin classes on democracy in Florida, with more to follow. In what 
is being billed as ``non-lethal training,'' the Iraqis will study 
leadership skills, civil-military relations, legal issues and 
``political opposition skills,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he said, there would be no combat training. The focus  
instead was to be on ``organization building'' to help the 
opposition develop outside Iraq and possibly later inside the 
country.

<HEADLINE> CBS Gets Stay in Dragging Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- An appeals court has granted a temporary  
stay to a CBS News producer fighting a prosecution order to turn 
over a transcript of a complete interview with dragging death 
defendant Shawn Allen Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Mapes, a producer based in Dallas, was faced with either  
going to jail or handing over a transcript and outtakes from Dan 
Rather's interview with Berry that aired Sept. 28 on ``60 Minutes 
II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, who is white, is the third and final defendant to go on  
trial in the death of James Byrd Jr., who was black. Berry could 
get the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing Friday morning, Judge Joe Bob Golden told Ms.  
Mapes to turn over the transcript by 3 p.m. or report to Jasper 
County Jail. But the 9th Court of Appeals issued a stay just 
minutes after the deadline, preventing enforcement of the judge's 
order and setting another hearing for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mapes' attorneys have argued that handing over material that  
has not been broadcast violates First Amendment protections for the 
media and could compromise journalists' ability to report the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say they want to compare Berry's statements in the  
interview to others he gave during the investigation into the June 
7, 1998, death of Byrd, who was chained to the back of a pickup 
truck and dragged to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CBS interview, Berry said he tried to stop the attack on  
Byrd, but backed off when John William King threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
	King and Lawrence Russell Brewer, white supremacists who became  
friends in prison, were convicted and sentenced to death earlier 
this year in separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mapes testified the transcripts were at her house, about 200  
miles northwest of Jasper. She said she never had the raw 
videotapes in her possession and last saw them when Rather left for 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas prosecutors also have started proceedings to have Rather  
testify, a request that CBS News president Andrew Heyward said the 
company would fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the media distraction has benefited Berry was unclear,  
as jury selection reached the midway point in his trial Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether it's been good for us or not,'' said  
defense attorney Joseph C. Hawthorn. ``It's probably distracted the 
district attorney's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Guy James Gray said he was focusing on jury  
selection, and leaving the subpoena matter to other members of his 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five jurors -- five of them black -- have been qualified  
for the jury. Once 50 are accepted, a panel of 12 and two 
alternates will be selected.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 Michigan 34, Indiana 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- No. 15 Michigan continued its mastery  
of the Indiana Hoosiers -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden Epstein kicked a 20-yard field goal with 18 seconds to  
play as Michigan withstood the upset bid of Indiana 34-31 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten) had to bat down a desperation pass  
in the end zone on the game's final play to avoid losing a third 
consecutive regular-season game for the first time since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud of the character we showed in the fourth  
quarter,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said after his Wolverines 
brought their record over Indiana to 8-0 this decade with its 10th 
consecutive triumph over the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana (4-5, 3-3) battled from a 17-0 second-quarter deficit to  
lead 24-17 on a 9-yard pass from Antwaan Randle El to Jerry Dorsey 
with 12:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seniors had an opportunity to do something they haven't  
been able to do -- that's beat Michigan,'' Indiana coach Cam Cameron 
said. ``We put ourselves in a position to continue to work forward 
toward the things that we had to do this year in terms of our 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those goals was to produce the school's first winning  
season since it went 7-4 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a little more difficult,'' said Cameron, who  
finishes his third season at Indiana with a road game at Minnesota 
on Nov. 13 and a home game with archrival Purdue Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you give up a lead like that and then they took the lead,  
I thought we showed a lot of stuff,'' Carr said. ``It wasn't for 
sure the kind of game I like, the kind of game that was full of a 
lot of mistakes, but it is the kind of game where we found a way to 
win. That's what we needed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines responded quickly, moving 65 yards in four plays  
to tie the score again on Tom Brady's 7-yard pass to Bennie Joppru. 
Brady set up the score with a 46-yard completion to David Terrell. 
Michigan then moved 66 yards in eight plays to regain the lead on a 
4-yard run by Anthony Thomas, who had career highs of 42 carries 
and 197 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El, who threw for four touchdowns to set a school record  
of 16 for the season, kept the upset bid alive by hooking up with 
Dorsey for a 70-yard TD pass with 4:59 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan took over on its 25 and moved downfield with the help  
of Brady's completions of 13 yards to Terrell, 14 to Marcus Knight 
and 23 to Thomas. A 15-yard face mask penalty on an incomplete pass 
by Brady and a holding penalty by O.J. Spencer against Terrell also 
helped set up the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El wasn't finished. He gained 14 on a pass to Versie  
Gaddis, rushed for 12 and then threw the final pass to Dorsey, 
which was broken up by DeWayne Patmon and James Whitley. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who moved from 18th to 14th on Michigan's career rushing  
list, ran for three TDs while going over the century mark for the 
10th time. His previous high was 183 at Hawaii in 1998. He has 
2,289 career yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything to get that taste out of our mouth was good for us  
after losing two in a row,'' said Thomas. who played with a broken 
pinky on his right hand suffered in his last game. ``I'm not 
exhausted. I never want to come out of a game in a tiring 
situation. That's why I try to get myself in shape during the 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan moved 77 yards in 11 plays following the opening  
kickoff to score on a 1-yard run by Thomas. The drive's big play 
was a 36-yard completion from Brady to Knight on a third-and-12 
near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines got the ball back when Craig Osika fumbled on  
Indiana's second play from scrimmage. The Wolverines recovered at 
Indiana's 35. A 7-yard run by Thomas gave Michigan a first-and-goal 
at the 4, but Michigan had to settle for a 22-yard field goal by 
Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited to 34 yards in the first quarter, Indiana had Michigan's  
Cato June block Drew Hagan's punt and the Wolverines took over on 
the Hoosiers' 15. Thomas, who had 113 yards rushing in the first 
half, made it 17-0 with a 15-yard run on Michigan's next play. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana began its comeback by driving 80 yards in eight plays,  
scoring on Randle El's 7-yard pass to Kris Dielman in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoosiers trailed 17-10 when Andy Payne kicked a 23-yard  
field goal at the end of the first half and neither team scored 
again until Randle El hit fullback Jeremi Johnson on fourth down 
play from the 1 with 13:20 to play. Thomas fumbled the following 
kickoff and the Hoosiers moved ahead for its only lead of the game 
after taking over on the Michigan nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Randle El was 18-of-34 for 290 yards. Dorsey had five catches  
for 154 yards. Brady, who played the entire game for the first time 
this season, was 17-of-29 for 226 yards. Terrell had 100 yards on 
six receptions for the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my goals from the beginning was to play two  
quarterbacks because I felt if something happened in the latter 
part of the season, I wanted a guy who had enough snaps to be 
ready,'' said Carr, who has had reserve Drew Henson pass for 527 
yards and three TDs this year while completing 57 percent of his 
attempts. ``Drew is ready to do that. He's played well. He's 
learned a lot of things, yet today the situation dictated that I 
make a decision of what's best for our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a decision coach made, and I'm glad we won,'' said  
Brady, who had thrown for 200 yards in five straight games. ``If I 
play, or I don't play, I'm glad we won.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Acquire Bichette From Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Resigned to losing cleanup hitter Greg Vaughn  
as a free agent, the Cincinnati Reds acquired left fielder Dante 
Bichette from the Colorado Rockies on Saturday for Jeffrey Hammonds 
and Stan Belinda. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies also sent the Reds $1.9 million to make up the  
difference in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Bichette hit 34 homers and drove in 133 runs for  
the Rockies last season. The Reds are counting on him to replace 
Vaughn, who hit 45 homers and drove in 118 runs but is unaffordable 
as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammonds was a backup outfielder last season and Belinda was a  
middle reliever after coming back from a diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette, one of the original Rockies, was the franchise's  
career leader in hits and runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision for this team is a more athletic, more versatile  
group of contributors,'' Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd said. 
``This is the first step in that direction. It also gives us 
important payroll flexibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was the latest major change for the franchise, which  
had general manager Bob Gebhard retire last August and manager Jim 
Leyland retire following a 72-90 season, the second-worst in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave them everything I could,'' Bichette said. ``We part  
even and I still remain in their hearts and them in mine. It's 
emotional. I'll drop a few tears, I'm sure, because it was the bulk 
of my career and this is what I love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade wasn't a surprise. Bichette mentioned to the Rockies  
early last season that he missed his family, which lives in 
Orlando, Fla., and would welcome a trade to an East Coast team that 
had spring training in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds train in Sarasota, Fla., and narrowly missed out on the  
playoffs last season, satisfying Bichette. He waived his right to 
block the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family situation was the most important,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds are coming off a 96-win season for which Vaughn was  
largely responsible both as a clubhouse leader and in that he 
carried the team in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds missed out on the playoffs by losing a one-game  
tiebreaker for the NL wild card to the New York Mets and were 
determined to get another proven cleanup hitter. Vaughn filed for 
free agency last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Bowden thinks Bichette, who hits for higher  
average and strikes out less than Vaughn, can fill his role. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a notch below Greg defensively, but he's adequate,''  
Bowden said. ``He's a better hitter than Greg Vaughn. Greg Vaughn 
has a little more power. They both produce runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds began talking to the Rockies about Bichette during the  
season and at one point were working on a five-player deal, Bowden 
said. The last snag was the money: The Reds had a $35 million 
payroll last season and aren't expected to increase it 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Vaughn out of the picture. Initial talks with his  
agent indicated he was looking for a huge pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was looking for four or five years in the $10 million to  
$12 million range (per year),'' Bowden said. ``We're not able to do 
that financially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade with Colorado was finished when the Rockies agreed to  
give the Reds $1.9 million to offset his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette, who turns 36 on Nov. 18, is entering the second year  
of a three-year deal worth $21 million. He'll make $6.5 million in 
base salary each of the next two seasons and could make as much as 
$250,000 per year in performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammonds, 28, hit .279 with 17 homers and 41 RBIs in 123 games  
last season. He was the least-used member of a crowded outfield. 
He'll make $3.1 million in base salary next year, the last on his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Belinda lost his job as setup man after sitting  
out the end of last season after being diagnosed with multiple 
sclerosis. Biceps tendinitis forced him onto the disabled list as 
the start of this season, and he went 3-1 with a 5.27 ERA and two 
saves in 29 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds exercised their option and kept Belinda under contract  
for next season at $1.5 million.

</P>
<P>
	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Kamal Adham, an adviser to the late  
Saudi kings Faisal and Khaled, died Friday of a heart attack in 
Egypt. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Adham, a brother-in-law of Faisal, was in charge of Saudi  
intelligence for several years during the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The staunchly anti-communist King Faisal dispatched Adham to  
Egypt in 1970 to convince then-President Anwar Sadat to lessen his 
dependence on the Soviets. Adham's secret mediation is believed to 
have led Sadat to expel 16,000 Soviet military advisers from Egypt 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1975 to 1982, Adham served as adviser to King Khaled. He  
then went on to become a prominent businessman.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Richard Estrada, associate editor for The Dallas  
Morning News and a nationally syndicated columnist whose work 
appeared in 25 newspapers, died Friday of an apparent heart attack. 
He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	His weekly column was syndicated by the Washington Post Writers  
Group. His most recent column appeared on The News op-ed page 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He argued repeatedly for a coherent and enforceable U.S.  
immigration policy, and for the need for people, no matter their 
origin, to practice good citizenship,'' said Alan Shearer, 
syndicate general manager and editorial director. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born in Lordsburg, N.M., the son of Mexican immigrants.  
He was the first member of his family to receive a college degree, 
earning bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Texas 
at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined The News in 1988 after a varied career that included  
six years in the National Guards of New Mexico and Texas and 
part-time work as a schoolteacher in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his mother, four brothers, and a sister.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julio Martinez, a former drug addict who  
eventually headed New York state's drug treatment program, died of 
cancer Thursday. He was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was a central figure in the restoration and expansion  
of drug treatment programs in New York and nationally, and in the 
shift from state-operated rehabilitation programs to 
community-based treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely because of his efforts, there are now nearly 1,000  
community-based centers treating addicts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, whose family moved to the state from Puerto Rico when  
he was 2, became a heroin addict as a teen-ager but recovered in 
his early 20s. In 1966 he helped establish Phoenix House, a 
treatment facility operated by former addicts that is now the 
largest private drug treatment agency in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez headed the state drug-free agency from 1979 to 1989,  
but was forced to resign amid reports by state investigators that 
he had steered money for drug treatment programs run by his friends 
that failed to treat addicts. He denied the charges.

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Robert L. Mills, an Ohio State University  
professor emeritus and co-author of the 1954 Yang-Mills theory in 
mathematical physics, died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills retired from Ohio State in 1995 after 39 years as a  
teacher of theoretical physics. He was vice chairman for 
undergraduate studies. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of New Jersey, Mills graduated with honors in  
mathematics from Columbia University in 1948 before earning 
graduate degrees at Cambridge University in England and at 
Columbia. 
</P>

	Mills and physicist Chen Ning Yang received the American Academy  
of Arts and Sciences' Rumford Prize in 1980 for their theory, which 
was centered around forces between nuclear particles.

<P>
	PAOLI, Pa. (AP) -- Max Patkin, who was known as the Clown Prince  
of Baseball for his goofy antics in an oversized uniform at minor 
league games, died Saturday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Philadelphia native had been hospitalized with a  
ruptured aorta for a week and died unexpectedly of an aneurism, 
said his daughter, Joy Tietsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkin, who starred as himself in the minor league movie  
classic, ``Bull Durham,'' started off as a minor league pitcher 
before World War II. He started clowning around in lopsided games 
while in the service and was later hired as a comic coach to boost 
the attendance of the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Indians began to win and did not need Patkin to draw  
crowds, he got started with other minor league ballclubs. Though 
Patkin always wanted to return to pitching, he was convinced to 
continue with his rubber-faced slapstick, which has been a baseball 
tradition ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Patkin made headlines when he was robbed on camera  
while filming a television special in downtown Philadelphia. Patkin 
helped insure a lenient sentence by asking the judge to go easy on 
the man, who took $35 from Patkin's hand and ran off. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans remember Patkin handing out baseball cards of himself.  
Doctors said Patkin was handing out his cards from his hospital bed 
the night before he died.

area-educated scientist regarded as a pioneer of the Israeli 
high-tech industry, died in a car accident Oct. 13. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Raviv, who founded and led IBM's research activities in Israel  
for more than 25 years, died in a crash in New Zealand that also 
killed his wife and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Raviv was head of the IBM Israel Scientific Center in Haifa and  
served as its first director when it became the Haifa Research 
Laboratory in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Poland in 1934, Raviv moved to what was then Palestine  
when he was 4. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in 
electrical engineering from Stanford University, then earned a 
master's degree in mathematics as well as a doctorate in electrical 
engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Raviv co-authored a technical paper in 1974 that was the basis  
for a key computer function that helped computers understand a 
human's natural language, translate between languages and 
synthesize speech.

<HEADLINE> Yagudin Wins at Skate America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Placement was secondary to  
Timothy Goebel. He was too busy making history. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Goebel became the first figure skater to hit three  
quadruple jumps in one program Saturday night, there was no room 
for disappointment in being runner-up to two-time world champion 
Alexei Yagudin at Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel, the first American to complete a quadruple in  
competition last year, nailed a quad salchow-triple toe loop 
combination, a quad toe loop and a solo quad salchow. At the end of 
his jumping jack performance, which moved him from third place to 
second, he covered his face with his hands for a long time and 
seemed to have trouble catching his breath. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the audience was breathless, too, at what it had  
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like hitting three grand slams in one game,'' said  
Goebel, 19, of Rolling Meadows, Ill. ``One is awesome. Two is rare, 
and three has never been done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't believe I did three quads. It was so unreal.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was real enough that many were left wondering why he didn't  
win. But Goebel, beginning just his second year in senior 
competition after a stellar junior career, still lacks artistry. 
His presentation marks dropped him below Yagudin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian wasn't great, but he also hit some difficult  
elements, including a triple axel-triple toe combination and seven 
triples in all. He cut his quad toe loop to a double toe, but still 
was first with six judges. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. champion Michael Weiss had a rough night, falling on his  
first two jumps, dropping him to fourth behind three-time world 
champion Elvis Stojko of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday, Michelle Kwan went after her fourth title in the  
first major international event of the season. Kwan, a two-time 
world winner, three-time U.S. champion and 1998 Olympic silver 
medalist, led heading into the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, that rarest of occurrences in figure skating,  
a stunning upset, was pulled off by Canadians Jamie Sale and David 
Pelletier. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-ranked team in their home country and with only two  
international competitions on their resume, Sale and Pelletier beat 
two-time world champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze in 
pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a big relief for both of us,'' Pelletier said.  
``We've been wanting to win an international for a long time. 
Coming here and winning is one big relief, but I don't think it 
will change anything. I don't see ourselves being any different 
because we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With some unique lifts and two superb throws, Sale and Pelletier  
swept the seven judges in the free skate, worth two-thirds of the 
total score. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, 1998 Olympic silver 
medalists, had a rough go and wound up third behind France's Sarah 
Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult because it is 2,100 meters,'' Sikharulidze  
said of the mile-high altitude that most pairs skaters said had a 
big effect. ``This is a new program and the first competition, and 
that's why it was difficult, too. And normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the skating was bad. We'll look forward to skating  
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three American couples struggled. U.S. champs Danielle and  
Steve Hartsell even messed up a death spiral when she lost an edge 
and her brother fell on top of her. They wound up last out of 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman were fifth, one spot in front of  
Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn. the 1994 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Canadians were done with their routine to ``Love  
Story,'' Pelletier got down on his knees and covered his face with 
his hands. Then he pumped his fists to the crowd, and was joined in 
doing so by Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the audience was reacting, but we are in our own  
world, too,'' Pelletier said. ``You have to focus on the program 
until the end. She is dying, like in the movie, so I can't go like 
this.'' And he pumped his arms again. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an upset of lesser proportions in ice dancing, where  
veterans Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio beat Russians 
Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh. American champions Naomi Lang 
and Peter Tchernyshev were third.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Allies Split With NH Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Supporters of Reform Party presidential  
hopeful Pat Buchanan split with the state's Reform chapter on 
Saturday, saying they were being treated like second-class citizens 
by state party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to incorporate themselves as the Granite State Reform  
Party this week, said Shelly Uscinski, Buchanan's New England 
campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
	The rift came at state party convention in Manchester, at which  
the party elected officers. About 30 people seeking to follow 
Buchanan into the Reform Party disagreed with new bylaws that 
prevent new members from voting, Uscinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't allowed to vote. We weren't allowed to speak,''  
Uscinski said. ``There was a bit of shouting, a bit of a ruckus. 
... They were very exclusive in preventing the Buchanan folks from 
participating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan joined the party last week, citing differences with the  
GOP, which he said has abandoned conservative principles such as 
opposing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	State Reform Party spokesman John Talbott said the dispute  
concerned whether the chapter would endorse Buchanan for president. 
It refused because it has not yet given other possible candidates -- 
such as Donald Trump -- a chance to compete for the chapter's five 
delegates, Talbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state party convention was originally scheduled for Sept.  
25, but was postponed after Buchanan backers threatened to crash it 
and elect themselves officers, Talbott said. As a result, the state 
party changed its bylaws to prevent new members from voting for 30 
days, and rescheduled the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We implemented those changes, and they didn't like them,''  
Talbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said he did not understand the Buchanan supporters'  
strategy, since only one of the officers elected Saturday -- the 
chairman -- automatically becomes a delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	Daron Libby, of Londonderry, was re-elected chairman.

<HEADLINE> Rams and Titans Playing Like Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sunday's Rams-Titans game is a microcosm of the wacky 1999 NFL  
season -- a big game between two teams whose only recent notoriety 
has come from changing cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each week has been some kind of test,'' said coach Dick  
Vermeil, whose Rams (6-0) are the season's most pleasant surprise 
after going 22-42 their first four seasons in St. Louis. ``I think 
our players are looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams and Titans (5-1) have arrived at this point in markedly  
different ways, although both have had relatively easy schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis, with former Arena Leaguer Kurt Warner throwing 18  
touchdown passes, is outscoring its opponents by an average of 
nearly 26 points. The Titans have two victories by three points and 
two others by one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher has a decision to make at  
quarterback. Steve McNair, who missed the past five games after 
back surgery, might be ready to start. If he's healthy, he will, 
even though Neil O'Donnell is 4-1 in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no question about the Rams' starter.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner, left unprotected in last spring's expansion draft, is on  
a pace to tie Dan Marino's single-season record of 48 TD passes. He 
has plenty of help, led by Marshall Faulk, who has run for 312 
yards in the past two weeks, and Isaac Bruce, who has eight TD 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
	All this leads to a lot of hoopla, although Fisher is trying to  
keep things low-key. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can overkill, you can overload, you can spend too much  
time on an opponent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Did anyone say ``Super Bowl Preview?''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, Buffalo is at Baltimore, Carolina at  
Atlanta, Chicago at Washington, Cleveland at New Orleans, 
Jacksonville at Cincinnati, the New York Giants at Philadelphia, 
San Diego at Kansas City, New England at Arizona, Miami at Oakland, 
Dallas at Indianapolis, Minnesota at Denver, and Tampa Bay at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle is at Green Bay Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh, the New York Jets and San Francisco are off.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
             *Seattle (4-2) at Green Bay (4-2) (Monday night)    	
</P>
<P>
	The main story is the return of Mike Holmgren to the city where  
he built a Super Bowl champion and, like Vince Lombardi, got a 
street named after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren views this as a test for his Seahawks against what he  
says is one of the NFL's premier teams. In truth, Green Bay's 31-3 
win over San Diego last week was its first decisive victory. Brett 
Favre had to pull out the first three with game-winning drives in 
the final minute. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Dallas (4-2) at Indianapolis (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' last two road games were 13-10 losses to the Eagles and  
Giants, but their 38-20 win over Washington left them in a tie with 
the Redskins for the NFC East lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts already have more victories than they had in each of  
the past two 3-13 seasons. Two ways to measure their progress: the 
Colts are favored, and Pat Summerall and John Madden are doing the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis is using history as an incentive.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about Dallas, they've been a dominant team in  
this league for a number of years,'' coach Jim Mora said. 
``Whenever you play them, it's special. I think everybody feels 
this way.'' 

</P>
<P>
                   *Minnesota (3-4) at Denver (2-5)    	
</P>
<P>
	This was supposed to be last year's Super Bowl until the Vikings  
blew the NFC title game to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings finally showed signs of offense last week, beating  
the 49ers 40-16 with Jeff George at quarterback for Randall 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright light for injury-ravaged Denver is Olandis Gary, a  
late-round pick from Georgia -- just like the injured Terrell Davis 
-- who has run for 214 yards the past two weeks. 

</P>
<P>
                     *Miami (5-1) at Oakland (4-3)    	
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard remains in for Dan Marino for the Dolphins, while  
Rich Gannon, the Raiders' quarterback, has a broken finger on his 
left hand. Gannon wants to play; coach Jon Gruden probably will 
start Bobby Hoying. 
</P>
<P>
	This game will almost surely be close. All seven Raiders games  
have been decided by a touchdown or less. The Dolphins beat Denver 
by 17 the opening week, but their other four wins are by a total of 
10. 

</P>
<P>
                  *San Diego (4-2) at Kansas City (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	These are two of the four plus-.500 teams in the AFC West  
(everyone but Denver). And they are two of the half-dozen or so 
teams responsible for the dearth of scoring -- both play excellent 
defense but plod on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have had 10 passes intercepted the past two weeks,  
seven thrown by Erik Kramer and three by Jim Harbaugh. That's 
dangerous against the Chiefs, whose plus-9 turnover differential 
leads the league. 

</P>
<P>
                   *Tampa Bay (3-3) at Detroit (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Tony Dungy finally is replacing Trent Dilfer with Eric Zeier.  
``It's not a one-game thing,'' Dungy said. ``I don't like to make 
quarterback changes quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a key game in the bunched NFC Central, where 1 1/2 games  
separate the top (Lions and Packers) from the bottom (Vikings and 
Bears). The Bucs have problems when they head north -- they've lost 
at Green Bay and Minnesota this season and last year went 1-3 on 
the road in the division. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Chicago (3-4) at Washington (4-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Dan (The Fan) Snyder, the Redskins' owner, went ballistic after  
his team lost in Dallas, and threatened more firings. Imagine what 
might happen if they lose this. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Jauron has the Bears playing about as well as anyone could  
ask. They're another team that plays them close -- none of their 
games has been decided by more than a touchdown. 

</P>
<P>
                 *Cleveland (0-7) at New Orleans (1-5)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Browns seem a throwback to the expansion teams of yore, like  
Tampa Bay, which lost its first 26 games. The Saints are playing 
just as poorly and Mike Ditka admits he's coaching in a befuddled 
manner. His clock management the past two weeks has been atrocious. 
</P>
<P>
	Of note: The Bucs' first-ever win, in 1977, was a 33-14 victory  
over the Saints. 

</P>
<P>
                *Jacksonville (5-1) at Cincinnati (0-6)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars had last week off and may get back their two best  
offensive players, Mark Brunell and Fred Taylor. But the sad fact 
is that they hardly need them until the playoffs. The defense is 
playing well and the schedule is full of games like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati is falling apart.  
</P>
<P>
	``Things that could have been taken care of maybe three or four  
years ago are now catching up with this team,'' said offensive 
tackle Willie Anderson of the Bengals, losers of 102 games this 
decade. ``You have some guys on this team that are good, 
NFL-caliber players, and you have some at certain key positions 
that maybe they're not.'' 

</P>
<P>
              *New York Giants (4-3) at Philadelphia (2-5)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Giants turned over the ball five times in their first  
meeting and still won, 16-15. That seemed to inspire the Eagles, 
who ran off their first two-game winning streak since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	New York lost both free safeties, Percy Ellsworth and Shaun  
Williams, in its 31-3 victory over New Orleans last week. It 
probably was a good time for those injuries -- the Eagles' passing 
offense is the worst in the league. 

</P>
<P>
                  *New England (5-2) at Arizona (2-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' only ``blowout'' was a 12-point win over poor  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are without Jake Plummer, who broke a finger  
against the Redskins. But Plummer had been having a bad year 
anyway, and Dave Brown, his backup, has 53 NFL starts, making him 
experienced, if not necessarily accomplished. 

</P>
<P>
                   *Buffalo (4-3) at Baltimore (2-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	The banged-up Bills have lost two in a row and miss wide  
receiver Eric Moulds, out with a hamstring injury for another few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least they have Doug Flutie. The Ravens are going to  
their third quarterback, Tony Banks; Scott Mitchell and Stoney 
Case, have only four touchdown passes and 10 interceptions between 
them. 

</P>
<P>
                   *Carolina (2-4) at Atlanta (1-6)    	
</P>
<P>
	Dan Reeves has the Falcons still trying, but Jamal Anderson's  
absence really showed when Atlanta failed on three attempts from 
the 1-yard line at the end of Monday night's 13-9 loss in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina? ``We haven't quite got the mentality that it takes to  
win on a consistent basis,'' said quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who 
once was a backup on Dallas' Super Bowl teams.

<HEADLINE> No. 11 Wisc. 35, Northwestern 19 </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- The Wisconsin Badgers were bound to cool  
off eventually. When they did, Ron Dayne and Jamar Fletcher got 
them a win anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne rushed for 162 yards and two touchdowns, and Fletcher  
returned an interception 93 yards for a score as No. 11 Wisconsin 
struggled before beating Northwestern 35-19 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin (7-2, 5-1 Big Ten) won its fifth straight game and  
remained directly behind unbeaten No. 2 Penn State in the 
conference race, but the Badgers didn't always look like the team 
that routed Michigan State and Indiana the last two weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers offense that ran up 1,065 total yards in its last  
two games managed just 296, and Northwestern had nearly as many 
yards (347) as the Badgers allowed in the last two (350). A stiff 
north wind reduced Wisconsin's passing game to non-existence, and 
Wildcats tailback Damien Anderson rushed for 102 yards and a score. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Badgers made two key interceptions that helped cover up  
a poor defensive performance, and Dayne never quit working against 
the Wildcats' (3-5, 1-4) aggressive defense. Interceptions by 
Fletcher and Mike Echols killed two big Northwestern drives and led 
the Badgers to a relatively easy win on a difficult afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been playing so very well,'' said Wisconsin coach  
Barry Alvarez, who watched another game from the press box because 
of his sore knee. ``I don't know how long you can sustain that 
level of play. We were due for a game like this, just from the law 
of averages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne, who played the entire game for the first time in four  
weeks, needs 321 yards in Wisconsin's final two games against 
Purdue and Iowa to break Ricky Williams' major-college career 
rushing record. He is 124 yards from passing Tony Dorsett for 
second place on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``My offensive line is great,'' Dayne said. ``I love those  
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a gorgeous, breezy day at Ryan Field -- which was about  
two-thirds full of Wisconsin fans -- Dayne's 5-yard touchdown run 
early in the fourth quarter put the game away. It was the 68th TD 
of his career, tying him with Indiana's Anthony Thompson for the 
Big Ten career record. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin led 28-3 midway through the fourth quarter before  
Northwestern scored two late touchdowns. Freshman quarterback 
Brooks Bollinger passed for one score and ran for another. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely lost our intensity today,'' receiver Chris  
Chambers said. ``You try to avoid it, but games like this are going 
to happen. We just have to make sure it happens once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats threw disastrous interceptions, and their eight  
penalties for 64 yards allowed Wisconsin to win handily, if not 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We missed some opportunities, but still found ourselves in  
game late in third quarter,'' Northwestern coach Randy Walker said. 
``Good teams make the plays and capitalize. Three-and-five teams 
don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne had 81 rushing yards in the first quarter, including 24 on  
a touchdown run through a huge hole opened by his offensive line. 
Dayne sprinted untouched into the end zone to make the score 14-0, 
but after that run, Northwestern's defense began to win control of 
the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern had its only scoring chance of the first half when  
it capitalized on a partially blocked Stemke punt and drove to the 
Badgers' 6 in the final minute, but Echols intercepted Zak Kustok's 
pass into double coverage in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne committed a rare fumble -- just the ninth of his entire  
career -- on the first play of the second half, and Tim Long's 
22-yard field goal cut the Badgers' lead to 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats were driving again when Fletcher intercepted a  
tipped pass at his own 7, ran 50 yards up the left sideline, 
reversed field and ran for the opposite corner of the end zone. 
With five yards to go, Fletcher threw a wicked shoulder shake at 
the last Northwestern tackler and pranced into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty exhausted by then, so I was trying to lull him to  
sleep and then put on the jets,'' Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher, a sophomore, has already returned four interceptions  
for touchdowns in his career, tying the Big Ten record. He picked 
off two passes in the Badgers' win over Michigan State last week 
and has five on the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 28-3, Northwestern made a quick touchdown drive capped by  
Anderson's 8-yard TD run with 6:51 to play. But an onsides kick 
failed, and Bollinger hit Chambers with a 24-yard touchdown pass 
with 4:35 left to make it 35-11. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern added a final touchdown, capping an 80-yard drive  
with Ian Miller's 1-yard TD reception with 43 seconds left. The 
Wildcats were successful on a two 2-point conversions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin left tackle Chris McIntosh started his 47th game for  
the Badgers, breaking the school record for starts.

<HEADLINE> Web Cam Seeks Ghost in Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- On a cold winter morning in 1937, a  
janitor grabbed his flashlight and headed down into the pitch-black 
basement of the Willard Library to stoke the coal furnace. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, so the story goes, he was stopped cold in his tracks  
by the ghostly vision of a woman dressed in gray, from the veil 
covering her face down to her shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a number of Willard staff members have reported  
seeing the shadowy ``Lady in Grey'' or witnessing weird happenings 
among the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	And now anyone can try for a sighting. The Evansville Courier &AMP;  
Press has installed a video camera in the 114-year-old library and 
still pictures are posted on the newspaper's Web site every 30 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ghostcam'' was intended to generate more traffic at the  
Internet site during the Halloween season, said James Derk, new 
media editor for the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	But the page has been so popular -- it had been loaded more than  
173,000 times as of Thursday and overall traffic at 
Courierpress.com is up 40 percent -- that Derk wants to continue it 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really exploded beyond all expectations, which is good,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors are encouraged to point out pictures that they believe  
contain images of the ghost, and to share ghost stories. 
</P>
<P>
	One image, digitally enhanced several times, appears to show the  
gray form of a woman returning a book to a shelf. In another, what 
appears to be a shadowy head is half-hidden behind a computer 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Derk is at a loss to explain how the camera, which is mounted on  
a bookshelf about 8 feet above the floor, ended up pointing in a 
different direction one day. All of the library workers said they 
hadn't touched it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think something is out there, to paraphrase 'The X-Files,'''  
Derk said. ``We stand ready and willing to believe.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: Bush, Gore Too Similar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said  
Saturday he left the Republican Party because its front-runner, 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, does not offer voters an alternative on 
trade questions, foreign policy or opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who left the Republican Party last week to campaign  
for the Reform Party nomination for president, said Bush agrees too 
often with Democratic Vice President Al Gore on issues Republican 
supporters care about. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he switched parties so he could continue to  
emphasize his opposition to abortion and skepticism about U.S. 
trade agreements and foreign policy decisions that have sent troops 
where the United States has no national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is what this is about,'' Buchanan told an enthusiastic  
crowd of more than 250 people at a North Dakota Christian Coalition 
meeting here. ``It is about ... offering the American people a 
real, genuine, authentic choice of destinies for this country, and 
I just don't think we're getting that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his last Republican presidential campaign in 1996,  
Buchanan finished third in a field of eight candidates in North 
Dakota's presidential primary. He trailed Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and 
publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is optimistic about getting the Reform Party  
nomination, ``despite what the big fella in Minnesota thinks,'' a 
reference to Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former professional 
wrestler who is the nation's only Reform Party governor. Ventura 
has said he prefers someone else as the party's presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to win that. We may have to body-slam (Ventura)  
once or twice, but we're going to win it,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota Republicans are holding presidential preference  
caucuses on Feb. 29, while Democrats are holding caucuses of their 
own a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Baltrusch, chairman of the North Dakota Reform Party, said  
Saturday the party is considering organizing caucuses of its own, 
although no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan on Saturday repeated his promise to appoint U.S.  
Supreme Court justices who favor overturning Roe v. Wade, the high 
court's 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide. His 
statements on the subject drew a standing ovation from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bush also support the North American Free Trade  
Agreement, which is meant to create a free-trade area with Canada 
and Mexico, and the establishment of the World Trade Organization, 
Buchanan said. The WTO is an international body that judges trade 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tells the government of the United States, you've got to  
tell California to get rid of their 'Buy California' laws, because 
that violates trade rules,'' Buchanan said. ``This is an 
international institution that is above the sovereignty of the 
United States of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Haman of Harvey, the North Dakota Christian Coalition's  
state chairman, said much of Buchanan's message was welcome, 
particularly on abortion and NAFTA.

<HEADLINE> Germans Ban Cell Phone Use in Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Don't drink and drive. But don't speak and drive?  
That too, after a German law banning the use of cell phones while 
driving takes effect next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's transport minister told a newspaper that the  
government plans to fine drivers $32 for talking on a cell phone 
without using a hands-free device like a speakerphone. 
</P>
<P>
	No exact date was given for the law banning ``handys,'' as cell  
phones are called in German, to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both hands on the wheel, eyes on the street -- that's the only  
way to increase safety,'' Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt said 
in an interview to be published Sunday in Bild am Sonntag. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine  
found that talking on a phone while driving quadrupled the risk of 
an accident and was almost as dangerous as being drunk behind the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other countries have banned the use of cell phones while  
driving. In the United States, the Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn, 
Ohio began fining drivers last month under a cell phone driving 
ordinance believed to be the first in the country.

	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve  
Forbes continued his assault Saturday on GOP front-runner George W. 
Bush, saying the Texas governor's campaign amounted to little more 
than ``a backslap and a slogan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes and presidential rival Gary Bauer, courting voters in  
South Carolina's conservative Upstate region, tried to position 
themselves as the alternative to a moderate Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary is considered an early  
barometer of how candidates will do in the conservative South. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates spoke at a GOP convention in Greenville County,  
an area of South Carolina politically dominated by the Christian 
right. Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose wife, Cindy, spoke at the 
Greenville event, was scheduled to appear later Saturday at a 
reception in the lower part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he wants to be the issue-driven candidate rivaling  
Bush's lack of substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters are starting to notice,'' he said, referring to  
Bush's drop in New Hampshire polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has gone after Bush for skipping two New Hampshire  
debates, including one last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had a representative, Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas,  
speak to the convention on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he won't have to launch a series of attack ads at  
Bush. Instead, he'll put forth ads showcasing his issues and ideas, 
much like he did in 1996 against GOP front-runner Bob Dole. That 
should be damaging enough to Bush, whose ``compassionate 
conservatism'' message remains a mystery to voters, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What does this slogan mean,'' he said. ``As they used to say,  
where's the beef? And it comes from Texas. Where's the beef? What 
is he talking about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican House Speaker David Wilkins of Greenville, a Bush  
supporter, laughed off the candidates' attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not speaking for the governor, but I doubt seriously he'd  
trade places with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes and Bauer also struck at Bush on the abortion issue. Both  
said that opposition to abortion would be a requirement for any 
court appointment they would make as president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he's ``strongly pro-life'' but also thinks the  
nation isn't ready for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. 
He says he would refuse to apply litmus tests in appointing only 
judges who oppose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's criticism wasn't only for Bush. He blasted Forbes, the  
millionaire publisher who is financing his own campaign, for a flat 
tax plan that Bauer said would free big companies of taxes and 
burden working class Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``His proposal would destroy the Republican party,'' Bauer said,  
urging Republicans to return to the era of Ronald Reagan and 
embrace the ``little guy,'' not just corporate America.

<HEADLINE> Air Force DB Knocked Unconscious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Air Force defensive back Tony Metters was  
knocked unconscious and was removed by ambulance during the fourth 
quarter of BYU's 27-20 victory over Air Force on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Metters, a 6-foot, 185-pound junior safety from Mansfield,  
Texas, was injured on a 57-yard scoring pass from Kevin Feterik to 
Margin Hooks with 10:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Metters and Wes Glisson converged on Hooks as the ball arrived,  
and the collision put both Air Force players on the ground. Hooks 
kept his balance and outraced three other defenders to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	After the play, Metters lay on the turf 12 minutes as trainers  
from both teams attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said Metters had a bloody nose but, after  
regaining consciousness, was able to move his arms and legs. He was 
taken to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center for a precautionary 
neurological examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials later said tests showed no brain damage and Metters  
returned to the Air Force Academy in Colorado with the team.

<HEADLINE> Akamai Shares Soar in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares in Internet technology company Akamai  
Technologies Inc. surged more than 450 percent in initial trading, 
the fourth-best IPO ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai closed Friday at $145.18 3/4 on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market after it was initially priced at $26 a 
share and opened at $110. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock's 458 percent increase from its initial price ranks it  
fourth, behind theglobe.com (606 percent), Foundry Networks (525 
percent) and Marketwatch.com (474 percent), financial market 
researcher Securities Data Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamai sold 9 million shares to raise more than $1.3 billion.  
Its closing share price gave it a stunning market value of more 
than $13 billion -- even though Akamai had sales of just $1.3 
million and lost $28.3 million in the first nine months of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamai (pronounced AH-kuh-my) is Hawaiian for intelligent,  
clever and cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Formed last year, it offers Yahoo! and other Web destinations a  
service that delivers the most image-intensive portions of their 
Web pages -- such as advertisements with colorful moving images -- 
through a speedier route than the public Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The service answers a common complaint that graphic-intensive  
Web pages take too long to download and can cause computers to 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the Akamai service is ``immense,'' said Ullas Naik,  
an analyst with FAC EquitiesFirst Albany, a Boston-based investment 
firm. ``It's going to keep growing significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To provide the service, Akamai owns a global network of 1,475  
computer servers and rents space on them to Web companies such as 
Yahoo! These Web destinations use the servers to store graphic-rich 
information closer to Internet users' computers, circumventing part 
of the crowded public information highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akamai technology is based on the initial work of F. Thomas  
Leighton, a math professor at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, and one of his students, Danny Lewin. 
</P>
<P>
	Leighton is Amakai's chief scientist. The company's chief  
executive, George H. Conrades, was a senior vice president of 
International Business Machines Corp. and president of Internet 
pioneer BBN Corp., which he sold to GTE Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with investments in Akamai include Apple Computer  
Inc., network equipment supplier Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft 
Corp.

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Tenn. 30, South Carolina 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jamal Lewis ran for 146 yards, including  
a 70-yard touchdown, as No. 4 Tennessee beat South Carolina 30-7 
Saturday to extend the Gamecocks' losing streak to 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers (6-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) drove 63 yards  
for a touchdown with the opening possession and were never 
threatened by the punchless Gamecocks (0-9, 0-7), who have the 
nation's longest losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's only points came on a 24-yard touchdown pass  
from Mikal Goodman to Ben Fleming with 36 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's Tee Martin, who set several records against the  
Gamecocks last season when he completed 23 straight passes, was 
11-of-23 for 216 yards Saturday despite missing his favorite 
target, Cedrick Wilson, for most of the game. Wilson was injured on 
the first play of the Vols' second possession and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin threw a 24-yard screen pass to Onterrio Smith for a  
touchdown and a 71-yard screen to Donte' Stallworth that set up 
Phillip Crosby's 1-yard touchdown run. Martin was intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis moved the ball from the Tennessee 47 to the South Carolina  
24 on five consecutive runs to open the game before Martin hit 
Smith with the scoring pass to make it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis broke loose and raced 70 yards early in the second quarter  
for the longest run of his career. The score made it 14-0 and gave 
Lewis his 13th 100-yard game, tying Jay Graham's school record. The 
junior from Atlanta hurt his shoulder with five minutes left in the 
third quarter and did not return. His status, as well as that of 
Wilson, for next weekend's game against Notre Dame was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two field goals by Alex Walls put the Vols ahead 20-0 at the  
half and another field goal in the third quarter made it 23-0. 
Tennessee closed its scoring with Crosby's short run after the long 
pass to Stallworth. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, which came into the game with the least  
productive offense among the 114 Division I-A teams at 223 yards a 
game, gained 225 against Tennessee. All but 67 yards came in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks managed 11 first downs and rushed for 103 yards,  
led by reserve quarterback Carlos Spikes with 29. Spikes and 
Goodman combined to complete 8 of 17 passes for 122 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee gained 433 yards against a South Carolina defense that  
came into the game ranked ninth in the nation, yielding 281 yards a 
game.

<HEADLINE> Report: Y2K Violence Threat Real </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An FBI report prepared for the nation's law  
enforcement officials says the threat of violence by extremists to 
mark the new millennium is ``very real,'' The Washington Post 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau said in a written statement on Oct. 20 that it was  
preparing the report, entitled Project Megiddo, and would share it 
with police chiefs at their upcoming convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the document analyzes ``the potential for  
extremist criminal activity in the United States by individuals or 
domestic groups who attach special significance to the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported in Sunday's editions that it had obtained a  
copy of the report, which FBI officials have said might eventually 
be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	The first official audience is to be a closed-door meeting of  
the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Charlotte, 
N.C., on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat posed by extremists as a result of perceived events  
associated with the Year 2000 is very real,'' the Post quoted the 
report as saying. ``The volatile mix of apocalyptic religious and 
(New World Order) conspiracy theories may produce violent acts 
aimed at precipitating the end of the world as prophesied in the 
Bible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said that while most of the report focuses on domestic  
threats, one portion is devoted to Jerusalem, where the FBI says an 
influx of tourists making pilgrimages and millennial cults will add 
to the danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israeli officials are extremely concerned that the Temple  
Mount, an area already seething with tension and distrust among 
Muslims and Jews, will be the stage for violent encounters between 
religious zealots,'' the Post quoted the study as saying. 
``Additionally, several religious cults have already made inroads 
into Israel, apparently in preparation for what they believe to be 
the endtimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research report is named Megiddo after an ancient  
battleground in Israel cited in the Bible's New Testament as the 
site of a millennial battle between forces of good and evil. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said earlier it would examine ideologies ``which  
advocate or call for violent action beginning in the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Such ideologies motivate violent white supremacists who seek  
to initiate a race war; apocalyptic cults which anticipate a 
violent Armageddon; radical elements of private citizen militias 
who fear that the United Nations will initiate an armed takeover of 
the United States and subsequently establish a One World 
Government, and other groups or individuals which promote violent 
millennial agendas,'' the FBI said in its earlier statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also outlines indicators of potential violence,  
possible preparations for violence and possible targets of 
millennial extremists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is with fringe, hate or apocalyptic groups or lone  
wolf members of them who may pose a threat,'' FBI spokesman Bill 
Carter said. ``We're not focusing on militias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the report, the Post said agents have discovered that in  
preparation for the new millennium, certain individuals have been 
acquiring weapons, storing food and clothing, raising funds, 
procuring safe houses, preparing compounds, surveying potential 
targets and recruiting converts to their cause.

<HEADLINE> Enqvist Beats Agassi at Eurocard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Old nemesis Thomas Enqvist haunted  
Andre Agassi again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist upset the world's top-ranked player 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 in the  
semifinals of the $2.45 million Eurocard Open. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's final, Enqvist will play defending champion Richard  
Krajicek, who beat Greg Rusedski 6-4, 6-4 in a battle of big 
servers. 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist now holds a 4-2 career record against Agassi.  
</P>
<P>
	``I played one my best matches of the year,'' said Enqvist, who  
is ranked No. 18 in the world. ``I knew I had to play 100 percent 
today and I did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I moved very well. Against Agassi, it's important to serve  
well and I also attacked his second serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his winning record against Agassi, he said: ``I've  
been able to play him at those tournaments where I am playing 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi had been impressive in his previous three matches. But he  
appeared listless Saturday and couldn't impose his game from the 
baseline, except when he mounted a comeback from a break down in 
the second set. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he lost his serve in the opening game of the third set and  
never recovered. Agassi had one of his six double-faults in 
dropping the third game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next game, Enqvist fought back from 0-40 to win and  
Agassi's will appeared sapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek broke Rusedski's serve once in each set and that was  
enough to earn him his fifth -- and third straight -- final at 
Stuttgart, where he has won the title twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-seeded Dutchman thrives on fast indoor surfaces.  
</P>
<P>
	``I play good tennis here,'' he said. ``Even If I'm not playing  
great tennis sometimes, I win my matches here. Some events somehow 
have a magic thing for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indoor season is important for me and I always look  
forward to it. I'm hungry for success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rusedski, the fifth-seeded Briton, also is a proficient indoor  
player. He had won two big indoor events within the past month, the 
Grand Slam Cup and the tournament in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	But Krajicek had no lapses on his serve and Rusedski was unable  
to break serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't lift that extra level,'' Rusedski said.  
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek finished with 10 aces, while Rusedski had only four, a  
very low figure for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a solid performance, a performance I can be happy  
with,'' said Krajicek, a former Wimbledon champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved Krajicek closer to clinching a place in the  
eight-man, season-ending ATP Tour World Championship Nov. 23-28 at 
Hanover, Germany. Krajicek now is in ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek said qualifying for Hanover would make up for having a  
relatively poor season at Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my last chance to have the feeling that I've had a  
good year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusedski is far behind in the race to Hanover, Agassi already  
has qualified and Enqvist is in 10th place.

<HEADLINE> Auburn QB OK After Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Auburn quarterback Ben Leard was  
immobilized on a stretcher and removed from the field in the second 
quarter of the Tigers' 32-10 loss Saturday to Arkansas after he was 
tackled and knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	Leard returned to the sideline in the fourth quarter after being  
released from Washington Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	He was temporarily unconscious on the field after he was tackled  
and his head bounced off the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I got knocked out, I looked up and all I saw was 50,000  
faces,'' Leard said. ``I woke up and I was strapped down. I 
remember trying to throw the ball away and that's it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were rolling me off the field and I was on the stretcher  
and our guys were telling me they were going to pray for me,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was Leard's first since he separated his right shoulder  
against Mississippi on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Leard, a junior, was injured with 13:57 left in the second  
quarter and Auburn behind 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers made two first downs to reach Arkansas' 22 when Leard  
rolled right on second-and-18 with Chris Brooks in pursuit. Brooks 
wrapped his arms around Leard's legs as he threw. Leard's knees hit 
first, then his head impacted the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Leard started the season by hitting almost 72 percent of his  
passes, and was No. 1 in the nation in passing efficiency when he 
was hurt against Mississippi. He completed 5-of-8 passes for 41 
yards against Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``My shoulder is fine,'' Leard said in the locker room. ``You  
have to go through some bad things to get to the top. Hopefully, 
these are the bad things we have to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm letting these guys down by getting injured,''  
Leard said.

<HEADLINE> Reburial in Flooded N.C. Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Federal teams have begun reburying  
coffins unearthed by Hurricane Floyd's unforgiving floodwaters, as 
relatives of the dead endure the pain of saying goodbye once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I read about all the caskets coming out of the ground, I  
said 'Not mine,''' said John Ricks, of Dale City, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the coffins of his wife Elizabeth, and 9-year-old son  
David, killed in a traffic accident 21 years ago, floated to the 
surface when 20 inches of rain brought the Tar River to record 
levels, flooding Tarboro and Princeville and swallowing local 
cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricks bit his lip and wiped his eyes on Friday as he waited with  
other relatives for the caskets to be reburied. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a relief, and at the same time, it's like stirring stuff  
up again, because I never stopped loving them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's caskets were among 224 that floated away during the  
flooding. Boat crews corralled the caskets and tethered them to 
trees or anything else solid while the water remained high, then 
recovered them after it receded. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 state and federal employees joined volunteers in  
working to identify the remains in a warehouse used as an emergency 
morgue. Inside, gray caskets sat row upon row, most marked with 
``PV'' and a number, denoting their final destination as 
Princeville. Others bore markings for relocation to six other 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have dealt with floods numerous times in this state, but  
this is the first time we have dealt with anything of this nature, 
certainly on this scale,'' said Elaine Wathen, area coordinator for 
the state Emergency Management Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialists with the U.S. Public Health Service's Disaster  
Mortuary Operational Response Team used body markings, jewelry and 
pacemaker serial numbers in trying to identify the corpses. Wall 
charts listed amputated limbs, yellow hair and other features on 
unclaimed bodies -- something families never see. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst part of it is when you bury your family, you think  
that's their final resting place and then this happens,'' said Dean 
Snow of Richmond, Mo., a member of the mortuary team. ``It's pretty 
rough on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of those recovered, 175 caskets have been identified, officials  
say. About 20 are to be reburied each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Each casket gets a new headstone paid for by the government and  
is buried under 18 inches of earth. A red rose, purchased with the 
team members' personal funds, is placed on each fresh grave. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Ricks' reburial, the coffins of Elizabeth and David were  
gently brought into newly dug graves beside his two other children 
who also died in the wreck, and then a backhoe covered the graves 
with sandy soil. The family read the 23rd Psalm and sang ``Amazing 
Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It means everything to me,'' said Dorothy Whitehead, mother of  
Elizabeth. ``I'm so glad the government thought enough of these 
flooded people to put them back in a casket and rebury them.''

<HEADLINE> Eight-Year IOC Terms Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC members will face re-election  
after eight-year terms of office but current delegates will still 
be eligible to continue until the age of 80, under recommendations 
made today by an Olympic reform panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues of age limits and term limits dominated the debate at  
the morning session of IOC 2000, an 80-member task force set up by 
the International Olympic Committee in the wake of the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was examining 50 proposals drafted by its executive  
committee. The final recommendations will be submitted to the full 
IOC general assembly at a special session in Lausanne on Dec. 
11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission endorsed a proposal for an age limit of 70, but  
the rule will apply only to future members. The existing 100-plus 
delegates would continue to be covered by the 80 age limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as current members are concerned, the executive  
committee believes that their rights should be preserved,'' the 
document said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the only change in the  
status of current members would be the introduction of a renewable 
eight-year term of office. Members would come up for re-election in 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual members in place today can reach the limit of 80  
but will be re-elected every eight years,'' IOC executive board 
member Jacques Rogge said. ``It's a compromise. It's the price to 
pay to have a two-thirds majority (at the December session).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The age limit was raised in 1995 from 75 to 80 in order to allow  
Samaranch to seek another term. If the 70 limit were applied to 
today's members, 24 would have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we take the rights away of more than one-third of IOC  
members, we have no chance for the reforms to get through,'' said 
executive board member Marc Hodler. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest debate centered on the recommendation for future IOC  
presidents to be limited to one eight-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Many delegates objected, saying presidents should have a chance  
to run for a second term of four or eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek IOC member Lambis Nikolaou pointed out that there have  
been only seven presidents in the IOC's 105-year history. 
Samaranch, due to step down in 2001, has been in office since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the stability of the IOC,'' Nikolaou said. ``The IOC  
has survived two world wars and now it seems like we want to pass 
with a bulldozer over the IOC. If you have a capable president, why 
should you have to tell him to leave after eight years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice presidents Keba Mbaye and Kevan Gosper argued in favor  
of the single term. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's world, eight years is a very reasonable time to  
give enormously to an organization,'' Gosper said. ``Even the 
United States restricts its president to eight years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no consensus reached, Samaranch said the issue would be  
left to the session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Another divisive issue, whether to ban member visits from  
Olympic bid cities, was to be debated later Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive committee has recommended against visits,  
continuing a ban that was put into affect during bidding for the 
2006 Winter Games. But there is a strong feeling among many members 
that visits should be reinstated under tight controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is opposed to site visits -- which were at the heart of  
the scandal over gifts and other inducements offered to members 
during Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Among recommendations approved Saturday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- the IOC to have a maximum of 115 members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- 15 active athletes to be appointed as full IOC members.  
</P>
<P>
	-- the renovated IOC to include 15 presidents of international  
federations and 15 presidents of national Olympic committees or 
continental associations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 70 members to be elected on an individual basis.  
</P>
<P>
	-- creation of a special selection committee to screen candidates  
for IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	-- the executive board to be expanded from 11 member to 15, with  
a permanent seat reserved for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend meetings come at a time of increased scrutiny of the  
IOC by critics in the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At a congressional hearing earlier this month, lawmakers  
expressed skepticism about the reform efforts and threatened 
retribution if the organization fails to enact meaningful change in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible sanctions include legislation to cut off American  
corporate support for the Olympics and strip the IOC's tax-exempt 
status in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has agreed to testify in Congress about the reforms on  
Dec. 15.

<HEADLINE> Overzealous Security Guard Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An overzealous security guard intent on protecting  
parking spots for bank customers was sentenced to 20 years for 
killing a driver delivering frozen chickens next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Valdes, 69, and relatives asked for leniency, but Circuit  
Judge Marc Schumacher imposed what may amount to a life term for a 
man with a heart condition because Valdes failed to take full 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at sentencing Friday, Valdes faulted the unarmed victim,  
Abraham Oliden, 35, as the aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men argued in January 1998 when Oliden, who was  
delivering chickens to a restaurant next door, drove into the 
suburban bank lot and double parked. 
</P>
<P>
	Two gunshots hit the Peruvian immigrant in the chest and  
stomach, and he died in the arms of a witness. Valdes called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes claimed he acted in self-defense when Oliden reached  
toward his truck as if looking for a weapon. The only item police 
found inside was a cellular phone.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: Bush, Gore Too Similar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said  
Saturday he left the Republican Party because its front-runner, 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, does not offer voters an alternative on 
trade questions, foreign policy or opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who left the Republican Party last week to campaign  
for the Reform Party nomination for president, said Bush agrees too 
often with Democratic Vice President Al Gore on issues Republican 
supporters care about. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he switched parties so he could continue to  
emphasize his opposition to abortion and skepticism about U.S. 
trade agreements and foreign policy decisions that have sent troops 
where the United States has no national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is what this is about,'' Buchanan told an enthusiastic  
crowd of more than 250 people at a North Dakota Christian Coalition 
meeting here. ``It is about ... offering the American people a 
real, genuine, authentic choice of destinies for this country, and 
I just don't think we're getting that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his last Republican presidential campaign in 1996,  
Buchanan finished third in a field of eight candidates in North 
Dakota's presidential primary. He trailed Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and 
publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is optimistic about getting the Reform Party  
nomination, ``despite what the big fella in Minnesota thinks,'' a 
reference to Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former professional 
wrestler who is the nation's only Reform Party governor. Ventura 
has said he prefers someone else as the party's presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to win that. We may have to body-slam (Ventura)  
once or twice, but we're going to win it,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota Republicans are holding presidential preference  
caucuses on Feb. 29, while Democrats are holding caucuses of their 
own a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Baltrusch, chairman of the North Dakota Reform Party, said  
Saturday the party is considering organizing caucuses of its own, 
although no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan on Saturday repeated his promise to appoint U.S.  
Supreme Court justices who favor overturning Roe v. Wade, the high 
court's 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide. His 
statements on the subject drew a standing ovation from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bush also support the North American Free Trade  
Agreement, which is meant to create a free-trade area with Canada 
and Mexico, and the establishment of the World Trade Organization, 
Buchanan said. The WTO is an international body that judges trade 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tells the government of the United States, you've got to  
tell California to get rid of their 'Buy California' laws, because 
that violates trade rules,'' Buchanan said. ``This is an 
international institution that is above the sovereignty of the 
United States of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Haman of Harvey, the North Dakota Christian Coalition's  
state chairman, said much of Buchanan's message was welcome, 
particularly on abortion and NAFTA.

<HEADLINE> Iowa, N.H. Caucuses Put at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- This year's fight over the presidential  
nomination calendar could lead to the end of the 
first-in-the-nation status of Iowa and New Hampshire, Iowa 
Democratic Chairman Rob Tully said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is it's going to be tough for us in 2004 to retain  
this,'' Tully said. ``There's a lot of animosity around the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a fight occurs every four years over the lineup of  
primaries and caucuses, this year's battle saw a split between Iowa 
and New Hampshire that could doom both, Tully said at a television 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	The two parties use different systems to set their political  
calendars. Democrats establish national party rules, which spell 
out the calendar. Republicans let each state sort through the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In past election cycles, Republicans and Democrats in Iowa and  
New Hampshire have worked together to fend off challenges from 
other states seeking the attention that comes during early 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, things went differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Iowa went through four different dates for its precinct  
caucuses, forced to move earlier in the process as other states 
moved up. The final move came when Iowa set its events for Jan. 24 
after New Hampshire surprised everyone by picking Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, the maneuvering in New Hampshire that forced us  
to go to the 24th has added fuel to the fire,'' said Tully, a 
member of the Democratic National Committee's special panel that 
deals with the political calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you from personal experience that there are people  
on that committee who are salivating to get rid of Iowa and New 
Hampshire,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gun Show Draws Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- The Great Western gun show, one of the  
largest in the country, drew thousands of patrons on Saturday after 
fighting off efforts by the county to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old show, which runs through Sunday at the Los  
Angeles County fairgrounds, has become a focus of California gun 
control advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	County supervisors banned sales of weapons and ammunition on  
county property a month after five people were wounded in a 
shooting rampage at a San Fernando Valley Jewish community center 
and a Filipino-American postman was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction about two  
weeks ago that blocked the ordinance, allowing the show to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Aisles were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder with people admiring  
swords, Western revolvers, $900 assault-style rifles in camouflage 
colors, heaps of uniforms, piles of ammunition and curios ranging 
from old political campaign buttons to wooden dolphin carvings. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 5,300 tables were filled with arsenals of guns,  
ranging from Chinese-made Kalashnikov knockoffs -- semiautomatic 
only -- to hunting rifles with gleaming wooden stocks and fancy 
inlays. 
</P>
<P>
	No problems or arrests were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Harrison Carter, 13, came to the show with his father to find a  
target shooting and hunting rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been looking at a lot of M-16 clones, trying to find  
something with a good deal on them. A lot of them are in, like, the 
$1,000 range, though,'' Harrison said.

<HEADLINE> Bocelli Makes American Opera Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *AN AP ENTERTAINMENT REVIEW   	
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli stepped from  
the confines of pop music to the grand stage of opera this weekend, 
singing the lead in Massenet's ``Werther'' at the Detroit Opera 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	His silky voice leading the way, Bocelli courted music critics  
and aficionados of fine arts in his much anticipated North American 
opera debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clad largely in evening gowns and suits, those who came to  
listen appeared receptive, applauding the moment Bocelli took the 
stage Friday night astride a white horse, opposite mezzo-soprano 
Denyce Graves. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli had the romantic title role, hoping to swoon a score of  
critics who were at the opera house to judge whether the 
best-selling singer who made his name in pop could carry the day in 
live opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviews were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	After initially voicing doubts about Bocelli's capacity to  
maintain his sound and amplitude, Opera Magazine's Michael H. 
Margolin said Bocelli's performance improved as it went along. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time for him working on a stage like this,''  
Margolin said. ``I think the man should be given a medal of bravery 
for just doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just seven months ago, Bocelli himself questioned aloud whether  
he could, saying at the time that he didn't feel ``credible enough 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have to suffer a little while longer,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was younger, if I had shown up to audition in an opera  
house, they would have suggested I check into a lunatic asylum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli has said that if opera proved a comfortable fit, he  
wouldn't mind forsaking his pop career. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer, who was blinded by a soccer injury at age 12, has  
made inroads, evident in works that last week held the top two 
spots on classical's Top 10 charts: ``Aria-The Opera Album'' and 
``Viaggio Italiano.'' Both albums have been certified gold, which 
means at least 500,000 copies of each have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The international chart-topper has sold millions of pop and  
classical records, was nominated in January for a Grammy for best 
new artist and has performed for President Clinton and Pope John 
Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	His albums include opera arias, though his smooth-sounding  
ballads have some believing he's more akin to pop diva Celine Dion, 
with whom he has performed a duet, than the acclaimed Three Tenors. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Bocelli took on a full-length role, he starred as  
Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's ``La Boheme'' in a production on the 
Italian island of Sardinia. In ``Werther,'' he sang the title role 
in the tragic opera about a man who kills himself after the woman 
he loves marries another. The opera is based on a 1774 novel by 
Goethe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Opera performed a new production of ``Werther,''  
directed by Mario Coraddi. The set was rented from the San Diego 
Opera Company. Christopher Schaldenbrand sang the role of Albert 
and Ying Huang was Sophie. 
</P>
<P>
	About 96 percent of the tickets have been snapped up for  
Bocelli's six planned performances here through Nov. 14. Tickets 
range from $50 to $250, dwarfing the typical price at the Detroit 
Opera House of $18 to $98.

<HEADLINE> Bush Relies on Capitol Hill Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Republican presidential front-runner  
George W. Bush roiled GOP House members this fall by criticizing 
their budget plans, Rep. Roy Blunt stepped forward to calm the 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
	At a private meeting of the rank and file, the Missouri  
Republican stressed that such public faultfinding is rare, and 
occasional disagreements are inevitable, according to one lawmaker 
who attended. ``He said it wasn't meant as a slight against 
anyone,'' this lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt made his defense in his capacity as the Bush campaign  
point man in the House. He is half of a team -- Sen. Paul Coverdell 
of Georgia is his partner -- that is responsible for smoothing the 
way for the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're friends of mine,'' Bush said in a recent interview.  
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell, 60, is a former state party chairman now in his  
second Senate term, a member of the GOP leadership. He has 
long-standing ties to the Bush family and was Peace Corps director 
in the administration of Bush's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Blunt, 49, has risen rapidly in only his second term in the  
House. He was tapped this year to serve as the GOP's chief deputy 
whip after his predecessor in that post, Rep. Dennis Hastert, was 
elevated suddenly to speaker. GOP officials say Hastert had been in 
line to be the Bush campaign's point man in the House, and Blunt 
inherited that portfolio when he moved into the whip's 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Given Bush's status, he and his campaign organization are in  
touch regularly with Republicans in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say that when they were together in Florida recently,  
Bush thanked House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas for his 
restrained response to the budget controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert dispatched top aides to Austin this year to meet with  
campaign aides. Also, Bush's political director, Maria Cino, once 
was a top aide to former Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., who remains close 
to Hastert and the powerful GOP Whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Blunt and Coverdell say there has been no attempt to  
coordinate legislative initiatives with the Bush campaign, although 
communication back and forth is plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously work at being a source of information,'' says  
Coverdell. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial task for Blunt and Coverdell was to line up support  
for the Texas governor. Thus far, about 160 House members and 29 
senators have enlisted publicly -- there are others as yet 
unannounced -- backing that dwarfs any other GOP presidential 
contender's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The endorsement part of this hasn't been the hardest job I've  
ever taken on,'' Blunt says with evident understatement. About 80 
Republicans, he said, ``had gone on record before there was a 
record to go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell notes that at a similar stage in the 1988 campaign,  
Bush's father had only a single Senate endorsement even though he 
was a sitting vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tasks are less public.  
</P>
<P>
	When the governor was on the verge of announcing his views on  
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, for example, GOP officials say 
Coverdell quietly made sure the campaign knew that 20 of 29 of his 
supporters in the Senate opposed the pact. Bush came out against 
the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also say an effort is in the works to encourage Senate  
supporters of Bush to activate their political networks on the 
governor's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, Coverdell has not had to handle the type of blowup  
that confronted Blunt this fall when Bush parted company with a GOP 
plan that would change a tax program designed to benefit the 
working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs  
of the poor,'' Bush said at the time. The comment angered many 
House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to coming to Bush's defense, Blunt arranged for  
Republicans to meet a few weeks later to talk with senior campaign 
strategist Karl Rove. 
</P>
<P>
	Rove, too, sought to reassure lawmakers about Bush's intentions,  
Blunt said. He added that at least one other lawmaker observed that 
while Bush's comments were a rarity for him, other GOP hopefuls, 
Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes among them, routinely criticize the 
Republican majority in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	A more typical task for Blunt was triggered by Elizabeth Dole's  
decision to drop her own presidential campaign. He quickly was on 
the phone to half a dozen lawmakers who had endorsed her. In a few 
hours, all had swung behind the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, when Bush was in Washington earlier this fall, Blunt  
arranged for a small group of uncommitted House members to sit with 
him. The session took place in a hotel suite fit for a 
front-runner, with a grand piano in one room and a commanding view 
of the Washington skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy Blunt came after me for months,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller  
of Illinois, one of the group that met with Bush that day. ``I 
said, how could I endorse someone for president if I've never had a 
conversation with him either in person or on the phone?''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Pick Up Cormier's Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox picked up a $2 million option  
Saturday on left-handed reliever Rheal Cormier. 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier earned $950,000 last season, when he appeared in 60  
games and posted a 2-0 record and 3.69 ERA in the regular season. 
In the playoffs, he pitched 7 2-3 innings over six games and did 
not allow an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox must decide by Monday whether to exercise a $3  
million option on pitcher Pat Rapp or give him a $250,00 buyout. 
Rapp was 6-7 with a 4.12 ERA in the regular season and pitched one 
scoreless inning in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A Red Sox spokesman said the team was waiting to hear whether  
Kent Mercker would exercise his $1.75 million option to return for 
next season. He must decide by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker went 2-0 with a 3.51 ERA after joining the Red Sox in  
midseason and went 0-1 with a 5.79 ERA in three playoff starts.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wants Fee Added to Phone Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators opened an investigation  
Friday into a request by AT&AMP;T Corp. to sharply increase fees that 
residential customers pay to subsidize phone service for the poor, 
people in expensive-to-serve areas and school Internet hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance company, filed a  
request Friday with the Federal Communications Commission seeking 
to increase the fee by almost 52 percent, from 99 cents a month to 
$1.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said late Friday that it would not let the proposed fees  
go into effect for now and opened an investigation to determine 
whether they are justified. If the FCC didn't act, the fees would 
have gone into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission ``stopped these charges pending the outcome of an  
investigation to determine the reasonableness of AT&AMP;T's increase,'' 
the agency said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T justified the proposed fee increase as fair and necessary  
to cover its increased costs in providing the subsidized services. 
The subsidy requirements are imposed by the government on 
long-distance and other companies, which pass them along to 
customers in various charges on their phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a complex matter and we will go over our numbers and  
justification with the FCC as soon as possible,'' a AT&AMP;T 
spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will give AT&AMP;T and all other interested parties an  
opportunity to weigh in on the matter before making a final 
decision. The commission is required to complete its investigation 
within five months, agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups assailed AT&AMP;T's request.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is an outrageous proposal,'' said Gene Kimmelman of the  
Consumers Union. ``It amounts to nothing more than price gouging to 
consumers, especially people who make few long-distance calls.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Seeks Catholic School Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Cheered on by thousands of children and  
teachers, Pope John Paul II on Saturday called for equal funding 
for Catholic schools in one of the biggest rallies at St. Peter's 
Square in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates ranged as high as 200,000 for the lively crowd, which  
filled the piazza and spilled out onto the long boulevard leading 
into the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's bishops and John Paul have pressed for government  
financial help for Catholic schools through tax credits to parents 
or other means. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent moves in that direction ``unfortunately were not  
enough,'' John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnout from across Italy far surpassed the prediction of  
80,000. Politicians attended as well, with Italy's education 
minister among those applauding when John Paul urged parity between 
state and church schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the current setup ``ever less bearable,'' John Paul said  
the solution was ``full recognition of legal and economic parity 
between state and non-state schools, overcoming the old objections, 
which are foreign to the basic values of the European cultural 
tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of state support for church schools has divided  
Italy's center-left government. Leftist opponents to the funding 
sent schoolchildren marching through Rome in their own, much 
smaller demonstrations earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's rally -- on a sunny autumn morning -- drew a rare,  
wide smile from the pope, whose face as he has aged has stiffened, 
which some attribute to Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A little boy and girl approached the papal throne to present  
bouquets of flowers, then milled about, as if unwilling to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul laughed out loud, leaning forward to stroke the  
children's faces.

<HEADLINE> Curators Seek Rockwell Reinvention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Perhaps the most recognized American painter of  
the 20th century, Norman Rockwell has always been loved by the 
masses but dismissed as pedestrian by most in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
	Curators of a new touring exhibit, which features the largest  
collection of his paintings outside the Norman Rockwell Museum in 
Stockbridge, Mass., hope to make Rockwell as popular in the 
galleries of New York and Los Angeles as he is in middle America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the people who dismiss him only know him through the  
magazine covers and have never seen his work in person,'' exhibit 
co-curator Anne Knutson said during a break from preparations at 
Atlanta's High Museum of Art, where the seven-city tour begins Nov. 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	``But hopefully they'll come so they can see for themselves that  
he was a classically trained artist and his painting technique was 
outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Saturday Evening Post covers Rockwell is famous for  
started out as full-size paintings and will hang in the exhibit 
entitled ``Pictures for the American People.'' A companion book 
also is available, featuring essays by several art critics and even 
one by his son Peter, a model for several of Rockwell's paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell, who left the Post in the mid-1960s for Look Magazine,  
died in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit features all the whimsy, detail and Americana  
Rockwell is known for, along with several pieces painted in the 
1960s and showcasing the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ms. Knutson, Rockwell would finish his paintings on  
deadline and send them via courier -- sometimes still wet -- from his 
home in Massachusetts to Philadelphia, where they would be 
photographed and shrunk for the cover shots. In some places, the 
actual covers will hang next to the paintings to allow for closer 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors will find a safety pin protruding from ``Babysitter,  
Babysitter'' and pieces of gravel incorporated into the artist's 
account of a moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the true Rockwell,'' Ms. Knutson said of the  
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	However, art historian Ann-Sargent Wooster says the exhibit may  
not be enough to convince longtime Rockwell critics who downplay 
the importance of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of artists and art critics got into the field to revolt  
against just what Rockwell was doing,'' said Wooster, a professor 
at the School of Visual Arts in New York. ``Heck, there's a 
darkness to Disney movies now that isn't even in Rockwell's work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already 30,000 tickets have been sold two weeks before the show,  
which will travel to Chicago, Washington, San Diego, Phoenix, 
Stockbridge, Mass., and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will certainly bring in some people who ordinarily don't  
go to museums,'' said co-curator Maureen Hart Hennessey of the 
Rockwell Museum. ``But not only are we trying to reach new 
audiences, but introduce the whole Rockwell to people who only know 
part of his work.''

<HEADLINE> Racers Having Fun At 230 mph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- While watching the Champ Cars circle the  
two-mile California Speedway oval at speeds topping 230 mph, you 
might expect that the drivers are holding their breath most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, they're enjoying themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of fun,'' said sensational rookie Juan Montoya, who  
goes into Sunday's season-ending Marlboro 500 trailing Dario 
Franchitti by just nine points in the duel for the CART FedEx 
Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Michigan, it's easier to run side-by-side, but this kind of  
race is good because you have to work a lot on the car. It's a nice 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Max Papis came within half a lap of winning the race in July at  
Michigan Speedway -- a virtual carbon copy of its sister track in 
Fontana -- before running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``These races are never boring,'' Papis said. ``There's a lot of  
overtaking and you have to be ready for it all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Papis, who has yet to win a race in his four seasons in CART,  
was asked if his showing at Michigan makes him feel like a favorite 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, in my heart, I'm always the favorite,'' the one-time  
sports car star said. ``Michigan is just the proof that we can do a 
good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the spotlight this week is mostly on the championship  
battle between leader Franchitti and Montoya, Papis would love to 
steal some of the thunder in the season's only other 500-mile 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success at Michigan really doesn't give us any kind of  
distinct advantage,'' said Papis, completing his first season with 
Team Rahal and coming off a career-best second-place finish two 
weeks ago on the temporary street circuit in Surfers Paradise, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I haven't been able to accomplish this season  
that was a goal of mine coming in was to win a race,'' said Papis, 
who replaced new boss Bobby Rahal in the cockpit following Rahal's 
retirement as a driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people have told me that I won Michigan, but I  
am not looking for moral victories. I want my name on paper as 
having won a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice began Friday and Papis' Reynard-Ford was second only to  
Englishman Mark Blundell's Reynard-Mercedes. Blundell turned a fast 
lap of 235.292 mph, while Papis hit 234.747, both in the first of 
two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who leads everyone this season with seven victories in  
19 starts, was third overall at 233.539 in the morning and led the 
slower afternoon session -- marked by gusty winds -- at 230.707 in 
his backup Reynard-Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who didn't take the series lead from Montoya until  
winning in Australia, was 11th overall at 232.269 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good day,'' Montoya said. ``We were just trying to  
find a nice race car, but it's very difficult to find out how fast 
you are until qualifying because everybody drafts each other in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not too worried about speed, though,'' said Montoya, who  
went into today's qualifying with a series-high seven poles. ``My 
main goal is trying to beat Dario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, like Montoya, looking for his first series title,  
said, ``We're just trying to get our work done and be ready to race 
on Sunday. We'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell was pleased with his fast lap, but readily admitted he  
had some help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard not to get at least a little tow out there in  
practice,'' Blundell said. ``But I don't think we had too much 
help, so I'm pretty pleased. We should be in good shape for 
qualifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Naoki Hattori of Japan was airlifted to a nearby hospital  
for precautionary tests after crashing during the morning practice. 
Dr. Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for CART, said Hattori 
was awake and alert and had no apparent injuries.

<HEADLINE> Taliban: bin Laden Wants Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- Officials in Afghanistan, which faces  
the threat of U.N. sanctions for harboring Osama bin Laden, said 
today that the alleged terrorist wants to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, accused by the United States of masterminding the  
bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998, has been 
living in Afghanistan, where the ruling Taliban militia has given 
him refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban are under tremendous international pressure to hand  
bin Laden over to the United States. The United States has imposed 
sanctions against Afghanistan, and the United Nations has 
threatened to do the same if the Saudi exile is not handed over by 
Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter on Friday to the reclusive Taliban leader Mullah  
Mohammed Omar, bin Laden asked permission to leave Afghanistan, 
said Taliban spokesman Tayyab Agha. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden asked the Taliban to provide him security while he is  
moving out and not disclose his destination, Agha told The 
Associated Press by telephone from the southern Afghan city of 
Kandahar. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a consensus among the Taliban leadership that if bin  
Laden wants to leave Afghanistan, he won't be stopped, Agha said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But our central leaders will hold a meeting in next two to  
three days to decide the issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban have long refused to hand over bin Laden, calling  
him a brother Muslim and a guest of Afghanistan. And Agha insisted 
his decision now to leave was not under pressure from the Taliban. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps Osama wants to leave Afghanistan because he feels that  
the country is facing a lot of hardships because of his stay 
here,'' Agha said. ``We have not forced him to take this decision 
... he has decided this on his own free will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States accuses bin Laden of running a terrorist  
network committed to hit U.S. interests the world over. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, the United States fired Tomahawk missiles on  
Afghanistan, targeting bin Laden's alleged camps for training 
Islamic militants. Bin Laden is also on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted 
List, and the U.S. government has offered a $5 million reward for 
his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have provided shelter to Osama for so long and resisted the  
American pressure. ... We are prepared to give him security in the 
days to come,'' Agha said. ``But it's for him to decide whether he 
will stay here.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Wouldn't Recognize NBA 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Imagine if Michael Jordan returned to basketball, but the NBA  
told him he had to take an aptitude test first. Here are your 
questions, Mike: 
</P>
<P>
	--What do triangles, Los Angeles and Kobe Bryant have in common?  
(Hint: Ask Shaq, or call your old coach). 
</P>
<P>
	--Who is America's Team? (Hint: Ask Sacramento's Jason Williams,  
whose apparel outsold yours last season). 
</P>
<P>
	--Who is Team Microsoft? (Hint: Call Scottie Pippen in Portland).  
</P>
<P>
	--What is a cornrow? (Hint: Ask Allen Iverson or see Spree in New  
York). 
</P>
<P>
	--Who is the best player? (Hint: It's not you. It rhymes with  
Him). 
</P>
<P>
	It's doubtful Jordan would go 5-for-5 on the entrance exam for  
the 1999-00 season. But the player who ruled the '90s would have to 
admit that the NBA landscape has changed dramatically since he hung 
up his No. 23 jersey only nine months ago, a period that seems like 
an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 25 trades involving 79 players since the end of  
last season, and all the maneuvering, disassembling and retooling 
has one common goal: to get teams to a championship level that's 
far easier to attain in what has become a wide-open NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of tough teams, especially in the Western  
Conference, that have stocked up to make a run at the title,'' Tim 
Duncan of the defending champion San Antonio Spurs said. 
``Everybody, they're looking at us now. They want to take us out of 
the top spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere is that more evident than in Portland, where Microsoft  
co-founder and Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen has added three 
veterans in Pippen, Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf. As a result, 
Portland has become the preseason favorite one season after 
reaching the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have overhauled their system by bringing in coach  
Phil Jackson, who led Chicago to six championships and now will try 
to make Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice -- and who 
knows, maybe even Dennis Rodman -- proficient in the triangle 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento Kings, the highest-scoring and most exciting team  
to watch last season, have added Nick Anderson to a starting lineup 
that will appear on national television a previously unheard of 17 
times -- hence the moniker ``America's Team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the West is stronger. It's a powerhouse right now,''  
the Kings' Chris Webber said. ``It seems like the powers have 
switched to the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the East, the New York Knicks proved last season how much of  
a crapshoot the conference has become. They became the first 
eighth-seeded playoff team ever to make it to the finals before 
losing 4-1 to the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will have virtually the same team returning, with the  
most noticeable change being the move of Latrell Sprewell and his 
increasingly imitated hairstyle to the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers tinkered with their team by trading one of  
their big men, Antonio Davis, to Toronto for teen-ager Jonathan 
Bender. The Miami Heat also made minimal changes to a team that has 
won the Atlantic Division three straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a different story, however, for the Orlando Magic and, to  
a lesser degree, the Atlanta Hawks -- two of the conference's most 
consistent winning teams in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic made many trades, sending away four of last season's  
starters and thereby playing a big role in the overstocking of the 
West. Penny Hardaway went to Phoenix, Anderson to the Kings and 
Horace Grant to the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks blew up their backcourt, sending Mookie Blaylock to  
the Warriors and Smith to the Blazers, leaving an opening for 
Eastern teams like Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are some teams in the East who are going to be  
better than people think,'' Bucks coach George Karl said. ``The 
West is less wide open just because the champions are there, but 
the East has a number of teams who could take over. You saw the 
Knicks do it last season. They've had a tremendous amount of talent 
for a number of years, but then, somehow it all comes together. 
That can happen for anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big factor will be which teams with the best young players can  
take the next big step. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson became the league's leading scorer last season and led  
his 76ers to the second round of the playoffs. Vince Carter became 
a regular on TV highlights for a Raptors team that nearly made the 
playoffs. Kevin Garnett emerged as a force for a Timberwolves team 
eager to move on to a more stable season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now anybody can step up and play to the best of their  
abilities, and they'll have a shot at a championship. I think it's 
exciting,'' said Don Nelson, who begins the season on the hot seat 
in Dallas, which missed out on the free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
	This definitely will be the last season for Charles Barkley in  
Houston -- he says -- and Jeff Hornacek in Utah, while six teams will 
have their first seasons in new buildings: the Hawks, Nuggets, 
Heat, Clippers, Lakers and Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several rules changes designed to improve the flow of  
the game, the most noticeable of which will be a ban on forearm 
checking. Referees also have been told to crack down on overly 
physical play away from the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game in Oakland, Calif., will feature the return of  
the slam dunk contest, and three spots will be open on the all-NBA 
Olympic team that will compete at the Sydney Games next September. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those spots figures to go to O'Neal, who will be asked to  
become more of a thinker and passer in Jackson's new Lakers 
offense. O'Neal addressed one team problem over the summer by 
attending Bryant's 21st birthday party, and the two say they have 
put their differences aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who say that Shaq won't fit into the offense are  
mistaken,'' Jackson said. ``Wilt Chamberlain thrived in this 
offense back in his time because it takes full advantage of a big 
man's skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan thrived in it, too, but that was in a different era.  
</P>
<P>
	It's post-Michael time now, and this is a whole different NBA.

<HEADLINE> Reward Offered in Homeless Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An anonymous donor has offered a $100,000 reward  
with the hope that someone will come forward with information in 
the recent beating deaths of five homeless men. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Wellington Webb announced the reward Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	So far police have not found any evidence linking the five  
deaths dating back to Sept. 7. But they are not discounting the 
possibility that a pattern might emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have no new leads in the beatings but hope the reward  
will cause more people to come forward with information, said Lt. 
Frank Conner, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-year-old man was charged with robbing and assaulting a  
homeless man in September, but he has not been linked to any of the 
beating deaths, Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The donor stepped forward after Webb talked to Larry Strutton,  
publisher of the Denver Rocky Mountain News, about the unsolved 
slayings, said mayor's spokesman Andrew Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	The donor is a business associate of Strutton, Hudson said.

<HEADLINE> S.F. Prosecutor Faces Tough Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- This should be an easy time for prosecutors  
to get re-elected, what with crime dropping nationally and the 
economy booming. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly in San Francisco, where a 33 percent drop in  
violent crime since 1995 beats the 26 percent decline in New York 
City as well as many other cities with tough-on-crime leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing has ever come easy to former Golden Gloves boxer  
Terence ``Kayo'' Hallinan, a pugnacious liberal who bills himself 
as ``America's most progressive district attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallinan, 62, faces four challengers on Tuesday. The toughest is  
Bill Fazio, a former assistant D.A. who has called Hallinan 
``pathetic'' and temperamentally unsuited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were running even in a recent poll, which was taken  
after the San Francisco Chronicle compared police arrests to 
convictions at trial and reported that the success rate of 
Hallinan's office was 32.5 percent -- the lowest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallinan says the conviction rate ignores a series of diversion  
programs, which in 1998 resulted in two-thirds fewer people going 
to prison compared to 1993. And all of his challengers pledged in a 
pre-election debate to continue and even expand on these policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Divert nonviolent drug offenders to school, not jail? Legalize  
medicinal marijuana use? Send prostitutes and ``johns'' to social 
workers, rather than courtrooms? Send misdemeanor spousal abusers 
to ``batterer's school'' for a year? Absolutely, and more, the 
candidates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is San Francisco,'' said Fazio, who lost to Hallinan in  
1995 after running a tough-on-crime campaign. ``We're all 
progressive to a certain degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other candidates include former assistant D.A. Steve  
Castleman, who accuses Hallinan of blowing a huge environmental 
case; Matt Gonzalez, a deputy public defender who wants to 
decriminalize all marijuana use and end the death penalty; and Mike 
Schaefer, a wealthy lawyer and ex-con who has spent 33 years 
campaigning for offices around the country, almost always 
unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
	For Hallinan, the political has always been personal. A former  
city supervisor and longtime activist for civil rights and other 
causes, he had to fight all the way to the state Supreme Court to 
become a lawyer after the bar blocked him, citing his civil 
disobedience convictions and some youthful fistfights. 
</P>
<P>
	Since becoming D.A., Hallinan got heat for firing 14 deputies  
and replacing them with minorities and gays and lesbians in what he 
called an effort to make the office reflect the city. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also been accused of being too willing to plea-bargain with  
defense lawyers, and improperly trying to influence several trials 
with his public comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I judge my success by a decline in violent crime and an  
increase in public safety. On that level, I'm leading the whole 
country,'' Hallinan said.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive DEA Agent Commits Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A fugitive DEA agent wanted in the deadly  
shooting of his estranged girlfriend shot and killed himself in 
Louisiana Saturday during a police pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gerard Bailey, 35, had been the subject of a nationwide  
manhunt since Wednesday night, when he barged into the Fullerton 
home where his estranged girlfriend was staying, shooting and 
killing her and wounding her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Veda Harris, 32, with whom Bailey has a 2-year-old daughter, was  
pronounced dead at the scene. Her 36-year-old sister, Wendy 
Campbell, was shot in the stomach. She was hospitalized at 
University of California, Irvine, Medical Center. A message left 
Saturday for her condition wasn't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullerton and Louisiana police officers said after Wednesday's  
shooting, Bailey fled in a sport utility vehicle. He was still 
driving it Saturday in Opelousas, La., when police spotted him in 
the neighborhood of his ex-brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 p.m. CDT, Opelousas officers saw Bailey in his Ford  
Explorer. They ordered him to surrender, but he ran off. Officers 
chased after him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bailey was armed with 9 mm semiautomatic,'' said Opelousas  
police Capt. Ronnie Trahan. ``He placed the gun to his head and 
fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was pronounced dead at the scene.

	Judge Linda K.M. Ludgate suffered a broken arm, nose and facial  
bone when she was punched and kicked in the head by Derrick J. 
Neidig, 38, of Reading on Oct. 19, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neidig allegedly pushed past two deputies and rushed the bench  
after Ludgate said he could be committed to a mental health 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludgate said four deputies are typically assigned to her  
courtroom on Tuesdays, her busiest day of the week. But Sheriff 
Barry J. Jozwiak had reassigned two of them the Tuesday afternoon 
she was assaulted because of a light court schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious the security in my courtroom is woefully  
lacking,'' Ludgate told The Times of Reading on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neidig was finally subdued after about five probation officers  
and city police present in the courtroom on other cases grabbed him 
as Ludgate lay unconscious. He is charged with assaulting Ludgate 
and remains in the county prison in lieu of $100,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Students Said Inspired by Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The teen-agers accused of plotting a deadly  
attack at their high school laughed about the Columbine massacre 
and wanted to do the same thing at their high school, a friend 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They started talking about how they hated the world, and they  
wanted to do the same thing at South High School,'' 15-year-old 
Sarah Jedd said in Saturday's editions of The Plain Dealer. ``They 
said they wanted to be well-known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four white students have been arrested and seven others  
questioned in what was described as a racially motivated plot to 
carry out an attack at predominantly black South High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White closed South High on Friday after the  
parents of a student tipped off authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jedd said the four teens laughed about how Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before killing 
themselves last spring at Columbine High School in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The four teens were charged with two counts of inciting violence  
and one count each of false alarm, aggravated menacing-ethnic 
intimidation and inducing panic. Police took two guns from a 
student's house but did not say where they were found. 
</P>
<P>
	South High will open again on Monday with police officers in the  
school and hand-held detectors scanning students. The building will 
be searched before students arrive.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Marketing 'Terminator' Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Missouri farmer Bill Christison cuts $20,000  
off the annual cost of growing soybeans by saving seed from one 
year's crop to plant the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
	So he does not like the idea that seed companies could stop him  
from doing that by genetically engineering seeds to block 
reproduction. Worse, to Christison, the federal government invented 
a ``terminator'' process for rendering seeds sterile and now 
actively is trying to get it to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is that the U.S. government will wake up and look at  
what they are facilitating here,'' Christison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department researchers say the terminator process is  
misunderstood and has applications that could benefit farmers all 
over the world. The same technique that renders seeds sterile by 
turning certain genetic traits on and off also could be used to 
make plants resistant to drought or pests, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents of genetic engineering in the United States and  
especially in Europe have made the terminator issue a symbol of 
what they see as the evils of biotechnology. To them it is immoral 
for the U.S. government to promote and profit from such an 
invention, even if private companies are developing terminator 
processes of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The department developed the terminator technology at a  
laboratory in Texas and secured a joint patent last year with 
Scott, Miss.-based Delta &AMP; Pine Land Co., the world's largest 
cotton seed company, which co-sponsored the research. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is officially known as the ``technology protection  
system.'' The terminator nickname is a reference to the on-screen 
robotic killer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monsanto Co., seeking Justice Department approval to acquire  
Delta &AMP; Pine Land, recently announced it would not use terminator 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government is continuing research and is close to  
finishing negotiations on a marketing license with Delta &AMP; Pine 
Land for commercializing the technology, Agriculture Department 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	If Monsanto refuses to use the technology, the department would  
have the right to find another company that would. Officials will 
not say what they will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``First we have to see if Monsanto's purchase goes through. It's  
too hypothetical to be talking about,'' said department spokesman 
Andy Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has no plans to relinquish the patent, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``As co-holders of the patent we are in the room and in  
discussions with D&AMP;PL about whether or if or how there would be any 
commercialization. We think it's important that we be there to 
represent the public interest,'' Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
	One critic of genetic engineering, Hope Shand, research director  
of Rural Advancement Foundation International, said: ``The specter 
of genetic seed sterilization is particularly alarming given the 
rapid rate of consolidation of the global seed industry. Seed is 
the first link in the food chain. Whoever controls the seed has a 
stranglehold on the food supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's terminator research ``is a misallocation of  
precious ... research dollars and will benefit only a handful of 
big corporations,'' said Adam Goldberg, a spokesman for Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In developing countries, it is common for farmers to save seed  
from year to year. Christison, who is president of the National 
Family Farm Coalition, estimates that 25 percent of U.S. producers 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetically engineered crops, which are making up an increasing  
share of U.S. production, cannot be reproduced legally. Farmers 
also buy new seeds each year for corn and hybrid versions of other 
crops because they lose their special characteristics after the 
first generation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, an estimated 57 percent of the soybeans,  
38 percent of the cotton and 30 percent of the corn planted this 
year was genetically engineered, either to resist pests or 
herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA believes seed companies must be allowed to protect  
investments in new varieties of seeds if they are to continue 
developing crops that are hardier, more nutritious and require 
fewer applications of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the terminator process is still several years away  
from being commercially available, said Sandy Miller Hayes, a 
spokeswoman for department's Agricultural Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, it has been shown to work only in tobacco, which is  
used as a model plant species in agricultural research, and in 
cotton. The first applications likely would be in cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be used only in crops that do not cross-pollinate, such  
as cotton, soybeans and wheat, she said. In cross-pollinating 
plants like corn, fields of nonterminator varieties could be made 
sterile.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Allies Split With NH Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Supporters of Reform Party presidential  
hopeful Pat Buchanan split with the state's Reform chapter on 
Saturday, saying they were being treated like second-class citizens 
by state party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to incorporate themselves as the Granite State Reform  
Party this week, said Shelly Uscinski, Buchanan's New England 
campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
	The rift came at state party convention in Manchester, at which  
the party elected officers. About 30 people seeking to follow 
Buchanan into the Reform Party disagreed with new bylaws that 
prevent new members from voting, Uscinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't allowed to vote. We weren't allowed to speak,''  
Uscinski said. ``There was a bit of shouting, a bit of a ruckus. 
... They were very exclusive in preventing the Buchanan folks from 
participating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan joined the party last week, citing differences with the  
GOP, which he said has abandoned conservative principles such as 
opposing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	State Reform Party spokesman John Talbott said the dispute  
concerned whether the chapter would endorse Buchanan for president. 
It refused because it has not yet given other possible candidates -- 
such as Donald Trump -- a chance to compete for the chapter's five 
delegates, Talbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state party convention was originally scheduled for Sept.  
25, but was postponed after Buchanan backers threatened to crash it 
and elect themselves officers, Talbott said. As a result, the state 
party changed its bylaws to prevent new members from voting for 30 
days, and rescheduled the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We implemented those changes, and they didn't like them,''  
Talbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said he did not understand the Buchanan supporters'  
strategy, since only one of the officers elected Saturday -- the 
chairman -- automatically becomes a delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	Daron Libby, of Londonderry, was re-elected chairman.

<HEADLINE> China Approves Anti-Cult Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By CHARLES HUTZLER    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Calling Falun Gong an unprecedented threat to  
communist rule, China's legislature paved the way Saturday for 
leaders of the banned spiritual movement to be given lengthy prison 
terms and the death penalty at upcoming trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly unanimous passage of a new anti-cult law by the  
legislature's executive committee inside the Great Hall of the 
People came as defiant Falun Gong followers trickled into adjacent 
Tiananmen Square for a sixth day of peaceful, largely passive 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Embarrassed by the demonstrations and under orders to quash  
them, police widened their security net to capture thousands of 
Falun Gong followers who have slipped into Beijing from around the 
country. Uniformed police questioned people on streets, and 
plainclothes officers trained high-powered binoculars on the vast 
square. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 followers were taken away from the square. One woman  
cried, and she and several others separately pressed hands in a 
gesture of prayer after they were placed inside a police minibus. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Foreign Ministry telephoned several foreign news  
organizations, warning them not to contact Falun Gong members. 
Security agents followed foreign reporters. One agent carried a 
travel bag with a hidden camera. Operated by a handheld remote 
control, the camera's motorized film drive audibly whirred with 
every picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
	By tightening the law on cults, the communist government sped up  
the trials of principal members already in custody. But the need 
for new measures shows how threatened Chinese leaders feel by Falun 
Gong and how undaunted its followers remain more than three months 
into a ban on the widely popular group. 
</P>
<P>
	In passing the law 114-0 with two abstentions, senior  
legislators called Falun Gong ``unprecedented in the 50-year 
history of the People's Republic in terms of its size of 
organization, influence, number of illegal publications as well as 
the damages it brought to the society,'' the government's news 
agency, Xinhua, said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the vote, the Standing Committee of the National People's  
Congress ordered police and prosecutors on ``full alert of cult 
activities and smash them rigorously,'' Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The law revises a section of the criminal code to make leaders  
of Falun Gong and other group's labeled cults liable for 
prosecution for murder, fraud, endangering national security and 
other crimes punishable by more than the 2- to 7-year prison terms 
allowed for most organizers under the current statute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a directive issued immediately after passage of the law,  
China's chief prosecutors agency and the Supreme People's Court 
identified as offenses key activities Falun Gong has been accused 
of: illegal assembly, resisting bans, organizing across provincial 
lines and causing deaths by preventing medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter charge would open the way for leading members to be  
tried for murder, a death-penalty offense. Falun Gong practitioners 
are not to take medicine. The government has blamed the group for 
1,400 deaths, many of them among people who refused to be treated 
for illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	An offshoot of traditional schools of slow-motion exercise that  
channel unseen forces of nature to the body, Falun Gong blends in 
ideas from Buddhism and Taoism. Its practice is believed to promote 
health and morality and has drawn anywhere from 2 million 
followers, the Communist Party figure, to tens of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Already the government has accused 13 principal members for  
disseminating state secrets, and one, Xu Xinmu, could be tried in 
the coming week, human rights groups report. Over the next two 
months, up to 50 leaders could be put on trial with a few given the 
death penalty, a Communist Party source said. 
</P>
<P>
	For rank-and-file members, the law encourages local governments  
to show leniency and ``to educate those deceived while punishing a 
small number of cult leaders,'' Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who recant their beliefs and withdraw from cults are not  
to be prosecuted, the prosecutors and Supreme People's Court 
directive said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, police in northeastern Jilin province sentenced  
without trial 12 women followers, all school teachers, to labor 
camps, mostly for one-year terms, the Hong Kong-based Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. 
They join more than 100 other followers in the province's labor 
camps.

<HEADLINE> Gay Group Protests Zimbabwe Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Police arrested four gay rights campaigners  
Saturday after they attempted to make a citizen's arrest of 
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Tatchell, leader of a group called Outrage!, was arrested  
outside the Crowne Plaza hotel, according to one of the protesters. 
The group said they wanted to arrest Mugabe because of the alleged 
torture of two journalists in his country. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters had carried placards including one which said  
``Mugabe stop abusing queers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland Yard confirmed that four men had been arrested for  
criminal damage and public order offenses after they had jumped on 
to a car, but no names were released. Police would not say whether 
Mugabe was in the car, and no one answered the telephone at 
Zimbabwe's embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foreign Office confirmed that Mugabe had arrived in London  
earlier this week for a brief visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert Mugabe has had a couple of days here on a private  
shopping trip and is going back to Zimbabwe this evening,'' said 
protester John Hunt, 47. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United Nations convention on torture has effect in this  
country, and we were intending to perform a citizen's arrest, and 
notified the attorney general,'' Hunt said. ``However, the police 
appeared to have misinterpreted their duty and have allowed Robert 
Mugabe to escape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two journalists in Zimbabwe were arrested earlier this year for  
their reporting on that nation's involvement in Congo's civil war. 
The men later appeared in court with serious injuries they said 
were inflicted during questioning by military officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The human right group Amnesty International has condemned the  
government for what it called the torture of the journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mugabe has also been an outspoken critic of homosexuality.

<HEADLINE> Report: Military Wary at Waco Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- U.S. military leaders were reluctant to  
assist in the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian headquarters near 
Waco and questioned the legality of their role, the Waco 
Tribune-Herald reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits the military from becoming actively  
involved in domestic law enforcement matters unless directed to do 
so by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing federal documents obtained under the Freedom of  
Information Act, the newspaper reported that at one point, a top 
Army officer questioned the legality of military support for the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The military previously has acknowledged that it provided  
assistance to federal law officers. In August, the General 
Accounting Office, an investigatory arm of Congress, reported that 
military personnel were called to the scene after the ATF ``cited 
possible drug-related activity'' at the Davidian compound. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Pentagon official then said no consideration was given  
to requesting a presidential waiver of the law that prohibits 
military involvement in domestic law enforcement because it wasn't 
deemed necessary or applicable. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Tribune-Herald, the military role began before  
Feb. 28, 1993, the day ATF agents tried to serve members of the 
Davidians with search and arrest warrants. A gunfight ensued; four 
agents and six Davidians died. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF had contacted Operation Alliance, an agency that  
coordinates law-enforcement requests for military help in fighting 
drugs, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Jan. 22, 1993 letter to Operation Alliance, ATF officials  
requested training by special-forces troops, instruction in driving 
Bradley Fighting Vehicles and the loan of seven Bradleys. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Alliance forwarded ATF's request to Fort Bliss and  
Joint Task Force-6, the military's headquarters for domestic 
anti-drug efforts. Officials there were told that assistance was 
``in direct support of interdiction activities along the Southwest 
border,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maj. Mark Petree, commander of the Army's special forces,  
questioned the legality of the request. Maj. Phillip Lindley, his 
legal adviser, wrote in a Feb. 3, 1993 memo that the ATF request 
would make the military an active, illegal partner in a domestic 
police action. 
</P>
<P>
	After Joint Task Force-6 accused Lindley of trying to undermine  
the mission, he consulted his boss, Lt. Col. Douglas Andrews, the 
deputy staff judge advocate, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews told Lindley that the military could probably evaluate  
the ATF plan, but could not intervene to cancel it or revise it for 
the agency, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been allegations that members of the Army's Delta  
Force squad engaged in a shootout with the Davidians on the day of 
the April 19, 1993 fire in which sect leader David Koresh and about 
80 followers died. 
</P>
<P>
	However, military officials insist three Delta Force members  
were present that day as observers only. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Force officers did meet with Attorney General Janet Reno  
to discuss proposals to flush the Davidians from the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cites a document in which an unidentified Delta  
Force officer reported that Reno was only offered limited advice -- 
including the military's belief that inserting tear gas into the 
residence might cause mothers to panic and ``run off and leave 
infants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno had been on the job less than five weeks when she approved  
the FBI's proposal to use tear gas to break the siege. She has said 
she made clear to the FBI that nothing be used that could ignite a 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But in August this year, the FBI acknowledged that a ``very  
limited number'' of pyrotechnic gas canisters were fired at a 
concrete shelter. The agency said the canisters did not cause the 
fire that consumed the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has appointed former Missouri Sen. John Danforth to examine  
the FBI's conduct at Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	No Army official familiar with the situation was available for  
comment Saturday, said Gerry Gilmore, a Pentagon Army spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Levi Halting Its Own Web Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- As teen-agers increasingly shun classic,  
five-pocket blue jeans in favor of baggier, trendier styles, Levi 
Strauss &AMP; Co. announced it would stop selling its products online 
through its own Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's, which has struggled to find new outlets to boost sagging  
sales, launched its Internet business a year ago, and announced its 
demise Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a peak of $7.1 billion in 1996, sales dropped to $6.9  
billion in 1997 and to $6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's said it hoped the online stores would be an easy way to  
learn more about consumers and keep in touch with their 
ever-changing desires. But the move angered the company's key 
retail partners, who were forbidden from selling Levi's and Dockers 
over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	After Christmas, Levi's clothing and accessories -- such as  
jeans, khakis, hats and belts -- will be sold only on Web sites 
operated by J.C. Penney and Macy's, two of Levi's biggest 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's spokesman Jeff Beckman said Levi's may continue selling  
limited edition or other special products on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's said that sales at www.levi.com and www.dockers.com have  
been strong, but costs remain high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the cost of running a world-class e-commerce  
business is unaffordable considering our competing priorities,'' 
Beckman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's isn't alone. Many manufacturers are struggling with how  
to handle the Internet -- whether to exclusively sell merchandise 
themselves or allow retailers to offer their brands online. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Nike announced it would take orders for  
customized shoes online and deliver them directly to homes, 
bypassing retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Allen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,  
Mass. said Levi's is setting a trend in the wrong direction by 
giving in to retailers and backing away from the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to broaden their distribution channels,''  
she said. ``There are ways to assuage the concerns of retailers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the costs of operating an online store can be high,  
especially for manufacturers who aren't used to dealing with issues 
like customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``E-commerce can be a tremendous distraction to your core  
business,'' said Candace Corlett of New York-based WSL Strategic 
Retail. ``It was a very precipitous move on the part of a weak 
company to try to take on their retailers.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Wouldn't Recognize NBA 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Imagine if Michael Jordan returned to basketball, but the NBA  
told him he had to take an aptitude test first. Here are your 
questions, Mike: 
</P>
<P>
	--What do triangles, Los Angeles and Kobe Bryant have in common?  
(Hint: Ask Shaq, or call your old coach). 
</P>
<P>
	--Who is America's Team? (Hint: Ask Sacramento's Jason Williams,  
whose apparel outsold yours last season). 
</P>
<P>
	--Who is Team Microsoft? (Hint: Call Scottie Pippen in Portland).  
</P>
<P>
	--What is a cornrow? (Hint: Ask Allen Iverson or see Spree in New  
York). 
</P>
<P>
	--Who is the best player? (Hint: It's not you. It rhymes with  
Him). 
</P>
<P>
	It's doubtful Jordan would go 5-for-5 on the entrance exam for  
the 1999-00 season. But the player who ruled the '90s would have to 
admit that the NBA landscape has changed dramatically since he hung 
up his No. 23 jersey only nine months ago, a period that seems like 
an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 25 trades involving 79 players since the end of  
last season, and all the maneuvering, disassembling and retooling 
has one common goal: to get teams to a championship level that's 
far easier to attain in what has become a wide-open NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of tough teams, especially in the Western  
Conference, that have stocked up to make a run at the title,'' Tim 
Duncan of the defending champion San Antonio Spurs said. 
``Everybody, they're looking at us now. They want to take us out of 
the top spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere is that more evident than in Portland, where Microsoft  
co-founder and Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen has added three 
veterans in Pippen, Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf. As a result, 
Portland has become the preseason favorite one season after 
reaching the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have overhauled their system by bringing in coach  
Phil Jackson, who led Chicago to six championships and now will try 
to make Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice -- and who 
knows, maybe even Dennis Rodman -- proficient in the triangle 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento Kings, the highest-scoring and most exciting team  
to watch last season, have added Nick Anderson to a starting lineup 
that will appear on national television a previously unheard of 17 
times -- hence the moniker ``America's Team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the West is stronger. It's a powerhouse right now,''  
the Kings' Chris Webber said. ``It seems like the powers have 
switched to the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the East, the New York Knicks proved last season how much of  
a crapshoot the conference has become. They became the first 
eighth-seeded playoff team ever to make it to the finals before 
losing 4-1 to the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will have virtually the same team returning, with the  
most noticeable change being the move of Latrell Sprewell and his 
increasingly imitated hairstyle to the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers tinkered with their team by trading one of  
their big men, Antonio Davis, to Toronto for teen-ager Jonathan 
Bender. The Miami Heat also made minimal changes to a team that has 
won the Atlantic Division three straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a different story, however, for the Orlando Magic and, to  
a lesser degree, the Atlanta Hawks -- two of the conference's most 
consistent winning teams in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic made many trades, sending away four of last season's  
starters and thereby playing a big role in the overstocking of the 
West. Penny Hardaway went to Phoenix, Anderson to the Kings and 
Horace Grant to the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks blew up their backcourt, sending Mookie Blaylock to  
the Warriors and Smith to the Blazers, leaving an opening for 
Eastern teams like Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are some teams in the East who are going to be  
better than people think,'' Bucks coach George Karl said. ``The 
West is less wide open just because the champions are there, but 
the East has a number of teams who could take over. You saw the 
Knicks do it last season. They've had a tremendous amount of talent 
for a number of years, but then, somehow it all comes together. 
That can happen for anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big factor will be which teams with the best young players can  
take the next big step. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson became the league's leading scorer last season and led  
his 76ers to the second round of the playoffs. Vince Carter became 
a regular on TV highlights for a Raptors team that nearly made the 
playoffs. Kevin Garnett emerged as a force for a Timberwolves team 
eager to move on to a more stable season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now anybody can step up and play to the best of their  
abilities, and they'll have a shot at a championship. I think it's 
exciting,'' said Don Nelson, who begins the season on the hot seat 
in Dallas, which missed out on the free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
	This definitely will be the last season for Charles Barkley in  
Houston -- he says -- and Jeff Hornacek in Utah, while six teams will 
have their first seasons in new buildings: the Hawks, Nuggets, 
Heat, Clippers, Lakers and Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several rules changes designed to improve the flow of  
the game, the most noticeable of which will be a ban on forearm 
checking. Referees also have been told to crack down on overly 
physical play away from the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game in Oakland, Calif., will feature the return of  
the slam dunk contest, and three spots will be open on the all-NBA 
Olympic team that will compete at the Sydney Games next September. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those spots figures to go to O'Neal, who will be asked to  
become more of a thinker and passer in Jackson's new Lakers 
offense. O'Neal addressed one team problem over the summer by 
attending Bryant's 21st birthday party, and the two say they have 
put their differences aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who say that Shaq won't fit into the offense are  
mistaken,'' Jackson said. ``Wilt Chamberlain thrived in this 
offense back in his time because it takes full advantage of a big 
man's skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan thrived in it, too, but that was in a different era.  
</P>
<P>
	It's post-Michael time now, and this is a whole different NBA.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State and local governments know better than  
Washington what their people need, and President Clinton should 
tell federal bureaucrats to back off, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivering the Republicans' weekly radio address, Huckabee, who  
like Clinton is from tiny Hope, Ark., urged the president not to 
forget his roots despite almost seven years in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, Mr. President, don't forget where you're from,''  
Huckabee said. ``Don't forget you once were a governor demanding 
more flexibility from Washington so you could help the working 
families of your state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described Arkansas' ``Our Kids First'' comprehensive  
insurance program for children of low-income families, the state's 
welfare-to-work program that has cut welfare rolls by more than 
half and other improvements in the decade since Clinton was 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real innovations have come at the state and local levels,  
rather than at the federal level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this, he said, the administration wants to dictate how  
spending and policy decisions such as moving insured children from 
the copayment-based Arkansas plan to Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see how a bureaucrat working in a nicely appointed  
office cubicle in Washington might not understand that forcing 
families who have never been a part of a welfare program to enroll 
in Medicaid would drive them away,'' Huckabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I would expect the president, who was a governor in my  
state for so long and met the same families I meet every day, to 
understand this basic of human nature.''

	Taliban: bin Laden Wants Out Afghanistan  
</P>
<P>
	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- Officials in Afghanistan, which faces  
the threat of U.N. sanctions for harboring Osama bin Laden, said 
today that the alleged terrorist wants to leave the country. Bin 
Laden, accused by the United States of masterminding the bombing of 
two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998, has been living in 
Afghanistan, where the ruling Taliban militia has given him refuge. 
The Taliban are under tremendous international pressure to hand bin 
Laden over to the United States. The United States has imposed 
sanctions against Afghanistan, and the United Nations has 
threatened to do the same if the Saudi exile is not handed over by 
Nov. 14.

	Anti-Cult Law Approved in China

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- As Falun Gong followers quietly protested for a  
sixth defiant day on its doorstep, China's legislature approved an 
anti-cult law today to quash the banned spiritual movement and 
punish group leaders. The law, passed by the executive committee of 
the National People's Congress, ordered police, prosecutors and 
courts to be on ``full alert of cult activities and smash them 
rigorously,'' the government news agency Xinhua reported. ``Cult 
organizations that have destroyed normal social order and stability 
through illegal gatherings and led to the deaths of practitioners, 
rapes of women and swindled money should be dealt with severely,'' 
Xinhua quoted the Standing Committee's decision as saying.

	Clinton Urges Mideast Peace

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton, plunging back into Middle East  
peacemaking, says Israel and its Arab neighbors have a chance for a 
permanent settlement of their decades-long conflict ``within the 
reasonable near future.'' But Clinton said the opportunity won't 
last long and could easily be lost. ``This is the moment that we 
must seize,'' he said last night in Atlanta at a convention of the 
Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish group that has been a leader in 
the battle against bigotry and racism. On Sunday, Clinton will 
travel to Norway to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at a tribute to slain Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated four years ago by an 
Israeli opponent of the peace process.

	Colombian Confesses to 140 Child Murders  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A drifter who could turn out to be among  
history's worst serial killers has confessed to killing 140 
children in a five-year spree, luring his victims by posing as a 
beggar, a cripple or a monk, Colombia's chief prosecutor said. The 
victims of Luis Alfredo Garavito, 42, were found with their throats 
slit and ``showing signs of having been tied up and mutilated,'' 
prosecutor Alfonso Gomez told a news conference yesterday. Garavito 
was arrested in April during an 18-month investigation into the 
disappearances of children in at least 11 Colombian states. Only 
114 bodies have been found thus far.

anti-Saddam Hussein organizations who say the group relies too 
heavily on the United States. About 300 delegates of the Iraqi 
National Congress began a three-day meeting yesterday in the posh 
New York Sheraton Hotel. Sen. Bob Kerry, D-Neb., spoke at the 
meeting. Kerry, who sponsored the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act 
providing for arming Iraqi opposition groups, called for a change 
in U.S. policy.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Speaking at the Anti-Defamation League's annual  
national commission dinner, President Clinton called for Congress 
to pass a new hate-crime law, which would combat violence prompted 
by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. ``Hate 
crimes victimize not only the victim but they victimize society as 
a whole in a special way because they contradict the very idea of 
America we are trying to build,'' Clinton said yesterday. He has 
been crusading for new hate-crimes legislation since November 1997.

<HEADLINE> Isaypete Wins Calder Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Long shots finished 1-2 in the $200,000 Calder  
Derby on Saturday as Isaypete closed with a rush to beat Rhythmean 
by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaypete, shipped in from California, went off at 17-1, while  
Rhythmean, shipped in from Ohio, was an 80-1 shot. Phi Beta Doc, 
the favorite, was third in the field of 12 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaypete, ridden by Jose Ferrer, covered 1 1/8 miles on the turf in  
1:50 and paid $36.40, $16 and $12.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhythmean paid $66.20 and $17.40, while Phi Beta Doc paid $3.80  
to show. The trifecta paid $10,009.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaypete was last into the first turn with Rhythmean fifth as  
Press Type and Minor Wisdom fought for the lead. Rhythmean, on the 
outside, swept to the lead on the far turn. Press Type fell back to 
second with Special Coach third and Minor Wisdom fourth. Phi Beta 
Doc was seventh and Isaypete remained far off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhythmean turned for home with a length lead over Special Coach.  
Monkey Puzzle rallied into third and Isaypete started his move. 
Rhythmean finished gamely, but could not hold off Isaypete, who 
caught him from the outside in the final 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Phi Beta Doc was three-quarters of a length behind Rythmean and  
a neck in front of Crash Course. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight stakes victory for Isaypete, a  
Kentucky-bred son of Peteski. In his stakes debut, at Fairplex on 
Sept. 18, he won the $48,000 Derby Trial and one week later won the 
$100,000 Pomona Derby at the same track, both on dirt. His victory 
Saturday raised his earnings to $266,740 with five victories in 10 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	He was bred by his trainer, James Chapman, and is owned by  
Carolyn Chapman and Theresa McArthur.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov. Considered Ramsey Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens turned down offers by the  
parents of JonBenet Ramsey to meet while he was considering a 
special prosecutor in the girl's death because he was concerned 
about a ``prime suspect'' influencing the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens said it would have been wrong to meet with the Ramseys  
because John Ramsey would have wanted a hand in deciding whether a 
prosecutor should be named, and if so, who should be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ramsey is considered to be a prime suspect,'' Owens said  
Friday. ``It would be very inappropriate to meet with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Boulder County grand jury earlier this month ended its  
13-month investigation of the case without an indictment. Owens met 
with prosecutors and Boulder police before deciding last week not 
to appoint a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Ramsey attorney L. Lin Wood of Atlanta branded  
Owens a liar for having said the Ramseys were hiding behind their 
lawyers and failing to help solve the Dec. 26, 1996 slaying of 
their daughter. The Ramseys were willing to meet with the governor 
and testify before a grand jury, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens dismissed Wood's accusation that he lied and slandered the  
couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways I feel sorry for Mr. Wood. He knows the truth is  
the ultimate defense against slander,'' Owens said. ``Let's quit 
calling each other names.''

<HEADLINE> Status Quo Challenged in 1999 Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Heading into Tuesday's elections, some traditional political  
sure-shots are facing rare challenges: a Republican is in a 
neck-and-neck race to become Philadelphia's mayor, while a Democrat 
has a strong chance at winning the Mississippi governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia hasn't gone Republican in a half-century.  
Mississippi, like most of the traditionally Democratic South, has 
been turning steadily GOP. In the Midwest, Democrats are vigorously 
trying to end decades of Republican control in Indianapolis and 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	With presidential hopefuls swarming the first primary states,  
races for these and a smattering of other offices give political 
activists the chance to build momentum for the all-important races 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political community watches elections of this kind very  
closely,'' said Robert D. Holsworth, director of the Center for 
Public Policy at Virginia Commonwealth University. ``It has a 
potential ripple effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are gleeful about the chance of winning  
Philadelphia, hope to take control of all of Virginia's Legislature 
and expect to lock in Mississippi after Democrats last year shook 
the Southern GOP trend and won governorships in Alabama and South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two months, the Republican National Committee has  
poured more than $1 million into state and local races, half of it 
in Mississippi's race for governor. Democrats didn't make their 
spending figures public. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say even if they don't win some races, the fact  
they're competing in Republican territory like the South and the 
Midwest proves their growing strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a year of surprise for Democrats. We're in  
contention in places we never thought we'd be,'' said Jenny Backus, 
a Democratic National Committee spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi's race for governor, after an affair dogged the  
end of married Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice's two terms, many saw 
an opportunity for Lt. Gov. Ron Musgrove, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Early polls showed him in a tie with former GOP Rep. Mike  
Parker, but a survey last week showed Parker creeping ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance of losing Philadelphia has President Clinton and  
other national politicians campaigning for Democrat John Street. 
Polls show Republican Sam Katz with an even chance to win a city 
that hasn't had a GOP mayor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, Republicans are within one seat of gaining control  
of the General Assembly for the first time in 140 years. If they 
do, the GOP would be in position to redraw congressional lines in 
2001, and build momentum for next year's expected challenge to 
two-term U.S. Sen. Charles Robb. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republican strongholds of Indianapolis and Columbus,  
Ohio, Democratic candidates have mounted strong campaigns. Neither 
city has gone Democrat in nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only other governor's race Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Paul  
Patton in Kentucky is favored to win a second term. In Louisiana, 
Republican Gov. Mike Foster won re-election earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Washington state, Democrats could gain control of the  
House if they win a special election for a House district along the 
Idaho border that has steadily voted GOP since 1936. The Senate and 
governor's office are now Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities with elections include Baltimore; Houston; Tucson,  
Ariz.; and San Francisco, where Mayor Willie Brown may be forced 
into a runoff by fellow Democrats. Allegheny County, which includes 
Pittsburgh, is choosing an executive. New Jersey's 80 Assembly 
seats are also up for election. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Bedford, Mass., two sanitation workers are running for  
mayor and city council on a platform to ``clean up the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While political activists watch those races closely, voters in  
several cities and states are paying more attention to a number of 
ballot referendums. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, a ballot question that would ban ATM bank fees  
is expected to pass easily, with the banking industry promising a 
court fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine voters will decide whether to ban a late-term abortion  
procedure that has been outlawed in several states, and whether to 
legalize marijuana for medical uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Missoula, Mont., will decide on a minimum hourly wage of $8,  
limited to city employees and businesses and groups who rely on 
city grants or tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	There are spending and tax questions for sports stadiums in St.  
Paul, Minn., Scottsdale, Ariz., Houston and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Ketchum, Idaho, voters are being asked whether the city  
should continue a mock six-gun shootout that is a tradition at the 
annual Wagon Days festival near the Sun Valley resort.

<HEADLINE> White House Addresses W.Va on Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration told West  
Virginia's congressional delegation on Saturday it sees no need for 
special legislation to protect strip mining jobs in the state as 
long as the issue is not forced by a federal court decision 
favoring environmental interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said in a statement that it seeks to preserve a  
balance that preserves jobs while reducing harm to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert C. Byrd, ranking Democrat on the Senate  
Appropriations Committee, and other West Virginia lawmakers had 
vowed to attach riders protecting strip mining in the state to 
legislation appropriating money for the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came to a boil on Oct. 20 when the U.S. District Court  
judge considering suits brought by environmental groups concluded 
that the practice of using high explosives to blow the tops off 
mountains to expose low-sulphur coal violated the Clean Water Act 
and the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Charles H. Haden II barred the West Virginia Division of  
Environmental Protection from allowing spoil from such mining 
operations to be dumped in West Virginia streams. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was a victory for environmental groups which sued the  
coal mine industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, Haden delayed implementation of that order  
pending the outcome of an appeal to a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd issued a one-sentence statement after the stay was issued,  
saying the judge's decision ``may provide some breathing room for 
the time being to consider the options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the White House, worried about the impact of the West  
Virginia situation on its overall efforts to tighten environmental 
protection laws, appeared relieved that the issue would not be 
forced immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said  
administration officials had consistently made clear that they 
would only consider language that ``restored our sound regulatory 
approach'' and that it would oppose ``any effort to ease 
environmental restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This stay achieves the goal of restoring our regulatory  
approach,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Using the comprehensive process previously developed with the  
environmental community and the state, we will continue working to 
ensure that the streams and rivers of West Virginia remain 
protected,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore, the administration has determined that there is no  
need to consider legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration remains committed to a process of  
continuously monitoring and analyzing strip mining in West Virginia 
``to determine if additional controls are needed to protect rivers 
and streams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haden's ruling could have all but shut down mountaintop removal  
mining, a strip mining technique used increasingly in Appalachia. 
The top of a ridge is sheared off, the coal is extracted, and the 
leftover rock and dirt are pushed into a nearby river valley. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is the No. 2 coal-producing state, behind Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Report: Baylor Accepts Cubs Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Braves hitting coach Don Baylor has  
accepted an offer to manage the Chicago Cubs, according to The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs plan to announce Sunday that Baylor has agreed to a  
four-year deal worth an average of $1.3 million a season, the 
newspaper said in Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Cubs general manager Ed Lynch and the team's public  
relations staff by The Associated Press on Saturday night were not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor is returning to the managing ranks after one season as  
Atlanta's hitting coach after being fired by the Colorado Rockies 
following six years at the helm of an expansion team he led to the 
playoffs in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bradley Gaining on Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley is trailing Vice President Al  
Gore but has cut the margin, in the Democratic presidential race, 
says a poll released Saturday. The margin between Gore and Bradley 
has fluctuated in polls in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Newsweek poll suggests Gore favored by 40 percent of  
registered Democrats or those who lean toward voting Democratic, 
while Bradley was the favorite of 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-percentage-point lead represents a drop from the vice  
president's 49-26 margin in the same poll a week ago. Bradley had 
cut the gap to 12 points in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll early 
this month, but Gore doubled his lead in that poll earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newsweek poll also suggests Pat Buchanan's entry into the  
Reform Party could lure Republican voters away from GOP candidates, 
including top contender George W. Bush. The Texas governor, 
however, continues to hold a big lead, 63 percent to 12 percent for 
Arizona Sen. John McCain and 9 percent for publisher Steve Forbes 
in the race for the GOP nomination. Other candidates were in low 
single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-way race among Gore, Bush and Pat Buchanan, the poll  
found Bush favored by 46 percent of voters, Gore 39 percent and 
Buchanan 7 percent. In a Bush-Bradley-Buchanan race, Bush got the 
nod from 43 percent, Bradley 38 percent and Buchanan 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	When Buchanan is not in the mix, Bush was a 53 percent to 39  
percent choice over Gore. Bush was favored over Bradley, 49 percent 
to 41 percent, in a head-to-head matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was based on interviews with 630 registered voters last  
Thursday and Friday. It was conducted by Princeton Research 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4  
percentage points, was conducted after the first televised debate 
between Gore and Bradley. But few registered voters were aware of 
the forum, pollsters found.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Penn State 27, Illinois 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Rashard Casey zigged and zagged his way  
up the field, bobbing and weaving through the defense and even 
throwing in two 360-degree turns for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was finished, his Penn State teammates were  
amazed and Illinois was dazed and confused. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just makes big plays,'' Penn State fullback Mike Cerimele  
said. ``He made two of them today and turned the momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did he ever.  
</P>
<P>
	Casey, the second half of Joe Paterno's quarterback tandem,  
bailed out the Nittany Lions on Saturday, throwing for one 
touchdown and running for one as Penn State beat Illinois 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 11th straight victory for Penn State (9-0, 5-0 Big  
Ten), the second-longest winning streak in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the team's flat, I'm going to try to spark them somehow,''  
said Casey, who finished 3-of-6 for 49 yards and rushed for 75 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Penn State extended its winning streak over Illinois  
(4-4, 1-4) to six games, the victory was much tougher, and much 
sloppier, than a No. 2 team can afford at this time of the year. 
Despite repeatedly getting good field position from kick returner 
Bruce Branch, the Nittany Lions' offense was pitiful through the 
first 2 1/2 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Thompson threw three interceptions. Casey was ineffective  
in his first series, getting sacked for a 7-yard loss. Penn State 
got to the Illinois 36 four times without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	They also settled for Travis Forney's 44-yard field goal after  
Thompson threw two incompletions, giving Penn State a 10-7 lead 
with 12:15 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is, but we can't get things rolling right  
away,'' tight end Tony Stewart said. ``We're doing all right 
offensively, but we made some mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that saved Penn State was, as usual, its vaunted  
defense. Illinois, which stunned then-No. 9 Michigan last weekend 
at Ann Arbor, couldn't move the ball after the first quarter. They 
gained just five yards in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions abused Illini quarterback Kurt Kittner all  
day, sacking him five times. Defensive end Courtney Brown tied a 
Penn State record with four sacks, and his 32 career sacks broke 
Larry Kubin's school record of 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Courtney sets the whole tone,'' said linebacker LaVar  
Arrington, who had six tackles, including three for a loss of 15 
yards, and two sacks. ``When Courtney's on, our pass rush is on. 
When he's not, we struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the defense needed some help, Casey finally provided it. Put  
in with less than four minutes left in the third quarter, he got 
Illinois linebacker Danny Clark on a pump fake and then lobbed an 
easy, 16-yard pass to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart caught the ball just before the goal line, turned and  
stepped into the end zone, giving Penn State a 17-7 lead with 2:22 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Illini went three-and-out on their next possession --  
thanks, in part, to Brown's 9-yard sack -- Steve Fitts botched the 
punt and Penn State took over on the Illinois 34. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first play, Casey looked around briefly before he took  
off running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to stay in the pocket and wait for something to come  
clean,'' he said. ``All of the sudden, I saw an open field and I 
tucked it in and ran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He eluded at least five Illinois players as he dashed upfield,  
and even pushed a few of his own teammates out of the way. He 
darted around and spun around twice before finally sprinting into 
the end zone for the 24-7 lead with 1:13 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I did it,'' said Casey, who was hit so hard  
last week he was coughing up blood. ``I've got to wait and see the 
film myself to see what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illini didn't look like a team at the bottom of the Big Ten  
when the game started, going right after Penn State. Muhammad 
Abdullah picked off Thompson's pass in the first series, and the 
defense swarmed over anything in a white jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocky Harvey, who scored the final two touchdowns against  
Michigan last week, broke free for a 34-yard scoring run with 7:01 
left in the first quarter, giving Illinois a 7-0 lead. Anthony King 
got a hand on Harvey's jersey as he crossed the goal line, but it 
was too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second touchdown Penn State has given up in the  
first quarter this season. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the first quarter, Harvey had rushed for 75 yards  
-- 10 more than Penn State had allowed in each of its last three 
games. But the Nittany Lions responded quickly, holding the Illini 
to 135 yards of total offense the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got yardage on us, but we made adjustments,'' linebacker  
Brandon Short said. ``The W is all that matters. I don't care if we 
win by 51 or 1. A win is a good game.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Bring Triangle 'O' to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Slipping into a limo, Phil Jackson looks the part of the mogul  
on the move with his trim gray beard, dapper suit, granny glasses 
and laptop computer powered up so he can punch in stock trades as 
the chauffeur whisks him from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The image in the TV commercial is not so different from his  
image at courtside, except that here Jackson reverts a bit to the 
kid in him, sticking his fingers in his mouth and letting loose 
shrill whistles to get his players' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	These days Jackson is whistling more often than he used to in  
Chicago, while his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers, tries to learn 
the system the Bulls perfected to win six NBA championships in his 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone from the game for a year after the acrimonious and, he  
says, premature breakup of the Bulls, Jackson is back with a 
5-year, $30-million deal and aiming to prove he can win a title 
without Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's challenge with the Lakers is to turn soloists into a  
tight, harmonious band, to create a dynamic unit out of a motley 
collection of underachieving stars who often seemed leaderless and 
chaotic under coaches Del Harris and Kurt Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hasn't found it easy so far. Kobe Bryant broke his right  
hand a couple of weeks ago and will miss the first month of the 
season. Travis Knight sprained his right ankle and will miss at 
least the first week of the season. The Lakers are still looking 
for a solid power forward to allow 36-year-old A.C. Green to slide 
into a backup role. 
</P>
<P>
	From his first no-nonsense practice, Jackson let the Lakers know  
he would work them hard but give them a winning plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being at a boot camp with this general guy that you  
always see on TV beating people up,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``You 
know if you don't want to get in trouble, just keep your mouth 
quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And O'Neal kept quiet, except to say, ``Everybody was focused,  
everybody is willing to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Jackson watched his players run around as if they had  
blindfolds on, trying to figure out where they should be in his 
triangle offense, he showed his patience and humor and began 
winning the respect of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a funny guy,'' Bryant said. ``He'll be serious, then all  
of a sudden he'll just say something weird. If you mess it up, 
he'll definitely tell you. If you're doing a good job, he'll pat 
you on the butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was the offense, maybe it was Jackson's presence, but  
Derek Fisher quickly saw better chemistry among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was that guys on our team didn't want to  
commit to being on the same page, but I don't think we ever had a 
page to follow,'' Fisher said. ``Our coaching staff has presented 
something for us to follow and everybody's following it right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on the brink of the  
season-opener, Jackson spoke about his belief that he could have 
taken the Bulls to another championship last year if they hadn't 
been busted up. He talked about how long he thinks the Lakers will 
take to jell this year, how Bryant's early absence will affect the 
team, and the not-so-farfetched possibility that the Lakers might 
even sign Dennis Rodman again. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson spoke slowly and softly, reflecting in his tone the  
insight and intelligence that Jordan and the Bulls came to respect 
throughout their championship years. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	AP: The hardest thing to do in sports is to build a winning team  
and keep it going. It seemed so dumb that the problems in Chicago 
between the owner, the general manager and you led to your 
departure and then, ultimately, Michael's and Scottie's and 
everybody else. Did it strike you that way, that there was 
something lost that should have been saved? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: We always wondered how long we could keep it going. We  
put a limitation on the number of years that we thought we could 
keep this juggernaut afloat, and I think maybe we mistimed it. We 
thought maybe they couldn't play past 35, 36. That maybe Scottie, 
with a couple of back surgeries, at age 33 would be in decline. And 
Rodman couldn't play past 36. And we put an age limitation on the 
capabilities of what those players in this day and age could do. 
And from that standpoint I think that the organization, and the 
coaching staff included in that, didn't push hard enough to keep it 
going. In the overall concept of what dynasties are, this was a 
dynasty that was very unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: Did you feel you could have won at least another year?  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: In a 50-game season last year? It would have been easy.  
That was a no-brainer last year, because there wasn't a whole lot 
of training camp for anybody. It was just like, if we've got a good 
team, stick with it. I do think, given the team totally intact that 
we had before, it would have been real easy for them to come back 
and play well. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: Would you have liked to see that team stay together until it  
was obvious that they couldn't win anymore? Why not take it to the 
end? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: Well, we thought we had, basically. The enthusiasm for  
management to start rebuilding, getting the right temperament in 
rebuilding, skewed our notion of where we had to go with it. The 
owner two, three times in the offseason asked me if I would return. 
But I thought we had done too much to destroy our team and 
relationship at that time so it wasn't a possibility for me to go 
on back and continue it. And then given the year that the NBA had 
last year, it was the right thing and it happened the right way. We 
can look back at that team as a unique team, a special team of the 
'90s, and enjoy what it was, maybe bemoan the fact that it didn't 
have a natural death. But even so, I think everybody was able to 
move on with their lives and be proud of what they had done. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: Were you close to going to the New York Knicks?  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: No, we had just one preliminary talk. New York was in  
ninth place, or tied for eighth place at that particular juncture 
of the season with a week and a half left. It was just an 
introductory talk and we tabled it until their season was over. So 
there wasn't anything substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: What impact will Kobe's injury have on him and the rest of  
the Lakers as you introduce a new offense? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: One of the good things about it is it's going to give  
Kobe an opportunity to learn in a different format. He's going to 
have to sit and watch. We're going to have to be able to nurture 
his growth as a guard and the way he fits into the offense. 
Physically he's going to be in fine shape. So we don't anticipate 
it's going to delay him. 
</P>
<P>
	As a team it's put us under some duress because we don't have a  
legitimately experienced backup two-guard. We have some players who 
are adjustable in Rick Fox, and a young kid in Sam Jacobson. 
Obviously, acquiring Ron Harper helps us right now in getting 
someone who can play that two-guard spot, know the position and 
know the offense. But at this point in his career, Ron's not a 35- 
or 40-minute man. He's a guy I think of as averaging 25, maybe 30 
minutes. So we've got a gap there that's going to hurt us for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: How long does it take for a team to learn the triangle  
offense, and why would it take longer for that than other systems? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: It's an offense that requires a knowledgeable sense of  
where you are on the court at all times. It's very easy in most NBA 
offenses to designate a screen and roll, an isolation, a post-up, a 
two-man type game, possibly three-man type game that are generic to 
the game of NBA basketball that players are familiar with. But this 
game provides that all five players have to participate in the 
offense all the time. There's never a down period in this offense. 
And it just takes one person not functioning to create a bit of 
havoc on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: So would you say it will take half a season or a full season  
for them to really learn it? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: There's a lot of learning that goes on. The players  
play in this learning mode, which means that they're thinking and 
playing instead of reacting. That's the critical mass there, to 
play inside the system. The familiarity takes perhaps a month or 
two, and then you begin to see the nuances and the subtleties of 
it. By January this team should be functioning pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: Is there a risk in trying to recreate the same style that  
the Bulls played in, because the Lakers are center-oriented more 
than guard- and forward-oriented like the Bulls? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: The offense takes on the personality of the players  
that are in it, like any offense will. The offense is a system that 
is designated for a post-up player. A guy like Shaq helps this kind 
of an offense. His ability to pass is going to be very good. It's 
going to be exciting to see this offense with a different look. 
</P>
<P>
	What we did a lot of times with this offense was we created  
spacing for guys like Michael and Scottie Pippen, so that they had 
operating room on the weak side or the back side of the offense. It 
created a lot of different types of operations for those guys 
because our center was in and out of the post, rather than being 
positioned in the post-up. To get their type of game going was 
critical to scoring points with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	This offense works best with a post-up player on the court. In  
talking with Shaq about it I told him the premier player in this 
offense was Wilt Chamberlain with the '66-'67 Philadelphia 76ers 
when he averaged close to nine assists a game and led the league in 
assists. That's what this offense did for that team, which won 68 
games that year. It really benefits the whole team being able to 
place the ball into the enemy's territory, which is the post in the 
heart of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: That was the year Chamberlain made the switch from offensive  
scorer to passer and rebounder. Do you look for that kind of change 
from Shaq as well? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: No, I don't see that dramatic a change. You have to  
remember that Chamberlain was coming down from 40-50 points to 35 
and then to 25. Maybe 24.5 that year. That's what we'd like to see 
Shaq doing, scoring 25 points a game and getting six assists. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: What else do you expect from Shaq as far as his contribution  
on the floor and off the floor? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: I think that the leadership role will come to him  
naturally. That's one of the things maybe he's going to have to 
provide with Kobe out. Because the two of them together give you a 
certain sense of dynamics, power, the inside-outside threat, the 
driver and the post-up power player. And without Kobe, we're going 
to be relying upon Shaq to provide that kind of leadership. That's 
going to be interesting for him because he's going to have to get 
things done in a critical part of the game if we're going to be 
successful early on in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: Have you seen that kind of receptiveness there?  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: Yeah. He's really willing. He wants to flesh out the  
best part of his game. I think he's come a long way. The next 
scenario for him is to become a somewhat reliable free throw 
shooter so that he can be the guy the team can go to down the 
stretch without having the fear of loss of points because he might 
make one or might not make any free throws. That's where he's got 
to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: And Kobe, when he comes back, what are you looking for from  
him? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: Kobe shows that ability to find his way into a game and  
to have an impact on the game and find a way to score. But we see 
him as a player who's going to be not just an individual player but 
a person who opens up the team game. The opportunity this type of 
game gives to him is he can become that type of player that's not 
just a scoring threat, not just a dramatic one-on-one player, but 
also a player that can bring the level of play up by assisting his 
teammates, organizing the offense, reading the defense, doing the 
things that give a team a dramatic impact as only a star can. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: He's still so young (21), yet he's been compared with Jordan  
and with other great players. Do you see him developing into that 
level of player? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: Well, the jury's still out on that. This is Kobe's  
fourth year. He's had some great years even as a young player in 
this league. He's shown that he'll be a star. He's an attractive 
player for people to watch. The next aspect is to bring in his 
all-around game as a defensive player. Of course, Kobe's active, 
and he does things that are exciting, going for steals. But now 
he's got to learn how to be a stopper player, a player that people 
don't want to go at because of his ability to change the course of 
the game with his defense. To help his teammates with defensive 
abilities and all those other things are going to be earmarks as to 
whether he's going to enlarge his career. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: What are your biggest challenges for this team, for  
individual players, and for yourself? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: The challenge is to give this team a basis on which to  
play around. The offense itself is a confidence builder, an 
organizer for players on the floor. The coach is the one who gets 
them to a place where they can take the bit in their mouth and take 
it upon themselves to run the game. That is why it is so important 
for a team to have the confidence that they can be out on the court 
themselves, figure out what the problem is, find the solution and 
execute without the push and pull of a coach that has to make calls 
and has to do things that create an intrusion into the flow of a 
game. That's one of the things that they have to find. They have to 
find their own lead and their own leaders out there. I think they 
were a team that didn't have a leader on the court during critical 
parts of the game, and it was obvious in the last two playoffs. 
This is their growth point. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: You still have a hole at power forward, as opposed to having  
that as a strength as you did in Chicago. What are your plans 
there? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: We've got a good guy in A.C. Green. He's a good player,  
he's been in a championship mode, he's got that drive and hustle 
and spirit that we need. He's also a good worker. I don't know how 
many minutes that we can rely on A.C. at age 36. But he's in great 
shape, and I think that he can do a lot of things for this team. 
</P>
<P>
	But we're in a conference with great power forwards, (Vin) Baker  
and (Karl) Malone and (Chris) Webber and (Kevin) Garnett, more than 
a handful that stand out in this Western Conference. It's obvious 
we don't have that kind of a name or dramatic player in that 
position. But we think if we get defense out of that position 
that'll be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: Are you and Jerry West still trying to make a deal for that  
spot? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: We're just going to stay tuned to what can possibly be.  
</P>
<P>
	AP: You're not going for Dennis Rodman again, are you?  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: Haven't talked to Dennis, but I'm not ruling out that  
it's never going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: So if it worked out and he's ready to play, you would see no  
problem taking him back? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: We're a team that needs to develop our own roles in  
leadership, need to settle into a lot of things that go along with 
a new offense, a new coach, new team players, new system, new 
building -- there's a lot of newness here for the Lakers this year. 
And once things settle in and we try to get a rhythm and the roles 
become defined for the players, then we'll assess how we are and 
what our potential is with the personnel we have. 
</P>
<P>
	AP: How do you think the team has responded to your personal  
style so far? Have you made any reading suggestions for them yet? 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson: No, we're just beginning as far as chemistry and the  
relationship between coaches and players. So that's interesting 
right now, to just watch and see what happens, get to know the 
players, learn who they are, be able to make some suggestions. I 
want to try to get to these players as people.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive DEA Agent Commits Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A fugitive DEA agent wanted in the deadly  
shooting of his estranged girlfriend shot and killed himself in 
Louisiana Saturday during a police pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gerard Bailey, 35, had been the subject of a nationwide  
manhunt since Wednesday night, when he barged into the Fullerton 
home where his estranged girlfriend was staying, shooting and 
killing her and wounding her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Veda Harris, 32, with whom Bailey has a 2-year-old daughter, was  
pronounced dead at the scene. Her 36-year-old sister, Wendy 
Campbell, was shot in the stomach. She was hospitalized at 
University of California, Irvine, Medical Center. A message left 
Saturday for her condition wasn't returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullerton and Louisiana police officers said after Wednesday's  
shooting, Bailey fled in a sport utility vehicle. He was still 
driving it Saturday in Opelousas, La., when police spotted him in 
the neighborhood of his ex-brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 p.m. CDT, Opelousas officers saw Bailey in his Ford  
Explorer. They ordered him to surrender, but he ran off. Officers 
chased after him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bailey was armed with 9 mm semiautomatic,'' said Opelousas  
police Capt. Ronnie Trahan. ``He placed the gun to his head and 
fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was pronounced dead at the scene.

<HEADLINE> Mummified Body of Baby Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUGO, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities were investigating the death of a  
baby boy whose mummified body was found in a cardboard box inside 
an old shed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe the baby was born in 1964 since a newspaper  
from that year was found with the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby was dressed in a night shirt and diaper and his  
umbilical cord had been tied off. He was wrapped in a pink baby 
blanket and there was a blue blanket under the body. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like there was some feeling for this child,'' said  
Arapahoe County coroner Mike Dobersen, who performed an autopsy 
Friday. Authorities said the baby may have been stillborn and that 
there was no indication of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found Thursday when the owners of the property were  
cleaning out the shed.
