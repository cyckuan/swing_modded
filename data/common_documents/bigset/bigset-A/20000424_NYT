KINGS LOOK GOOD, BUT IT WON'T GET THEM FAR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seconds to play, Jason Williams running the fast
break, faking a pass to the right and whipping it around his back
to the left, Nick Anderson swooping in from the wing for a soaring
dunk. Fans oohing.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzer sounding. With the Sacramento Kings 117-107 losers to the
Lakers in Game 1 of Round 1 of the NBA playoffs at the Staples
Center on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That's the basketball Kings for you _ fleet, clever, highly
entertaining. And, in the end, irrelevant for purposes of
championship competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is the way the game is meant to be played, or
people wouldn't be watching us,'' backup center and forward Scot
Pollard had said before the game in a mild defense of his team's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the point. Nobody said the Kings aren't worth
watching. They simply said you'd better look quick, because they
won't be around next week.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the fear that this five-game series will take 13
days under the ridiculously stretched-out scheduling mandated by
NBC executives. So much for the idea the Kings are a dangerous
playoff opponent for the Lakers, who won the regular-season series
3-1 but trailed at halftime in all four games.
</P>
<P>
   So much for NBA commissioner David Stern's preseason
proclamation that the Kings ``are clearly the prototype of the team
of the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The league changed some rules over the summer with the idea of
loosening up offenses. Everybody fell in love with the Kings in the
50-game season of 1999, when newcomers Williams and Chris Webber
led the team to its first plus-.500 record in 13 years in
Sacramento, and it seemed as if it would be a nice idea if
everybody had as much fun as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're kind of like the NBA's poster child for new rules or
for the way they'd like to see the game played
</P>
<P>
   up-tempo, open floor, not a lot of throw it in the post and
pound it, pound it, pound it,'' Brian Hill, then coach of the
Vancouver Grizzlies, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings must think the new millennium begins next year. Their
further improvement in 2000 could be measured only with the aid of
a microscope. They went 44-38, were No.1 in scoring but No.27 in
defense, and got into the playoffs as the bottom seed in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I expected out of the team this year was to
make the playoffs. We've met our expectations,'' Pollard told a
couple of reporters. ``It's you guys' fault'' for raising false
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll second that,'' guard Nick Anderson chimed in from the
next cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, am no longer raising false expectations.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Kings are fun dates. Pretty to look at,
spontaneous, uninhibited. They'll dance all night.
</P>
<P>
   They're nothing to get serious about, though.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 wasn't a blowout. The Kings led 42-41 before Chris
Webber's foul trouble began. They had closed to within 105-99 with
four minutes remaining. Yet there was never a doubt the Lakers were
going to win.
</P>
<P>
   The equation of springs past has been reversed. Now it's the
Lakers who are fundamentally sound, in perfect balance, can-do in
the clutch. It's the other team that's all style and no substance.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings came to downtown Los Angeles hoping to steal a game
and perhaps set the Lakers back on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically we're underdogs. We wanted to sneak in and get
one,'' said Webber, downcast after fouling out with 6:53 left in
the game. ``It's like when you're fighting
</P>
<P>
   you want to land the first punch and then run home to your
mom.''
</P>
<P>
   They're running home with a bloody lip _ hoping to return to the
Staples Center for Game 2 on Thursday night with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday their defensive lapses were on display for 18,997 fans.
Not to mention their rebounding lapses; they came up with less than
half of the Lakers' misses. Not to mention their lapses of cool; a
couple of the fouls on Webber, which dominated the Kings' postgame
discussion, were questionable, but the late-third-quarter offensive
foul he protested vehemently enough to draw a technical foul was
legit.
</P>
<P>
   And they have no answer for Shaquille O'Neal. But who does?
</P>
<P>
   There's only so much the Kings can do differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't change the way we play,'' Williams said stubbornly.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the point. They have only one way to go _ fast,
loose, thrilling _ and it'll get them only this far. &QL;

RED SOX SUFFER 4TH STRAIGHT POSTPONEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The players knew. The umpires knew. The people in the
TV trucks knew. Even some ballpark ushers knew.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last ones to know that an Easter weekend of Red Sox
baseball would be a total washout were Fenway Park's paying
customers, who were not informed until 4:27 p.m. that Sunday's
doubleheader between the Sox and Cleveland Indians was postponed.
That was 3 hours 22 minutes after Game 1's scheduled first pitch,
almost 4 1/2 hours after the players on both sides OK'd a June 8
reschedule date in the event of a rainout, and close to an hour
after Indians pitcher Chuck Finley was told, he said, he wouldn't
be pitching against Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea insisted that the decision to call
off the game was made only minutes before park announcer Ed
Brickley went on the PA system and, reading from a prepared
statement, told the fans still huddled in the steady rain that the
games had been called off and the weekend's three postponements had
been rescheduled. It was the only announcement fans heard all
afternoon regarding the status of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth straight day the Sox couldn't play because of
rain. Thursday night's game in Detroit also was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made every effort to play at least one game today,
especially in light of what happened all weekend,'' Shea said.
``People understood when they came here that the forecast wasn't
good, and unfortunately we weren't able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The home team has the authority to call off a game until lineup
cards are exchanged. Then the authority shifts to the umpiring crew
chief, who in this case was Jim McKean. He was in consultation with
both clubs throughout the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason given for a delay in the announcement, according
to Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, was that the teams were
waiting for the players association to approve the makeup dates.
Shea said it took four hours for the union to respond to the teams'
request. The Sox wanted fans to know what their options were, Shea
said, before they left the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, the associate general counsel for the Major League
Players Association, acknowledged that he was unable to respond
immediately to the call from the Sox. ``I was having Easter dinner
with my mother in an Italian restaurant in the Bronx,'' Orza said.
``When they called me again in the car, they had an answer from us
within 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wanted to have all agreements in place before
people left the ballpark,'' Orza said. ``I'm not sure that need was
as profound as they suggested, but everything is now in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to play June 8 requires both teams to give up an
off day to play a single game at 6:05 p.m. The Sox originally were
scheduled to have an off day between a three-game set in Miami
against the Marlins and a three-game series in Atlanta against the
Braves. The Indians, meanwhile, are scheduled to play the Brewers
in Milwaukee June 7, then play host to the Reds on the 9th.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling of the June 8 game did not require the approval
of the union, Orza said. ``The players (on the teams) voted,'' Orza
said. ``It requires the waiver of a provision in the Basic
Agreement barring one-game stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Union permission was necessary, Orza said, for the back-to-back,
split-admission doubleheaders the teams will play Sept. 20 and 21
when the Indians return here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the doubleheaders Wednesday and Thursday instead of
Tuesday and Wednesday,'' Orza said, ``because the Indians have a
game scheduled that Monday (in New York).''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield, the Red Sox player representative, said Duquette
informed the team of the schedule revisions at around noon Sunday,
and that the players OK'd the June 8 game informally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan said, `If we don't play, this is the scenario,' ''
Wakefield said. ``We agreed to it informally. It would be stupid to
play three doubleheaders in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   The crews manning the TV trucks outside the ballpark were
packing up equipment around 3:30, the same time Finley, the
Indians' scheduled Game 1 starting pitcher, said he was told the
game had been called off. One ballpark usher said that he heard
around 3 that the Sox already had decided to call the game off but
were waiting to hear back from the players union. The umpires were
out of uniform and gone almost immediately after the announcement
of the postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan poured a drying agent on the bullpen
mound and reliever Derek Lowe already was throwing around 4, joined
20 minutes later by Martinez, whose appearance drew a cheer from
the remaining fans, many of whom believed he'd gone out to prepare
for his start. Instead, Martinez was in the bullpen for a side
session, knowing his next start wouldn't come until Tuesday night
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez is scheduled to pitch Monday night against the
Rangers, with Jeff Fassero due to pitch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All three games against the Indians were sellouts, according to
one club official, who estimated that each rainout cost the Sox at
least $1 million in revenue. However, with all three games
rescheduled as separate-admission events, the Sox should be able to
recoup that money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the rain, cloudy days and storms, especially when I'm
sleeping,'' Pedro said. ``I wish I could see through the glass
(window).
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's when I'm sleeping, not playing. I think it's
romantic, the rain. Rainy days are good to cuddle and stay at home.
Not to play ball.''

O'NEAL, LAKERS TOO MUCH FOR KINGS IN GAME 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it's a race to 15 wins, as the Lakers have
dubbed their championship pursuit, then Sunday's opening leg was
appropriately paced.
</P>
<P>
   They sprinted alongside the Sacramento Kings when necessary, and
then, with momentum as their ally, ran right over them. And between
baseline sprints, they clarified a few things, in case there were
doubts:
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they can play at the Kings' pace and not lose their heads
in the process (though they did lose a shoe).
</P>
<P>
   No, those little hiccup losses in Texas last week didn't mean a
darn thing.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, they in fact do have another gear reserved for the
playoffs, and it's faster than a speeding Jason Williams bullet
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere after fifth gear came the turbo-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal extended his MVP season into the postseason,
pummeling the Kings with 46 points, 17 rebounds and five blocked
shots to lead the Lakers to a 117-107 victory at Staples Center and
a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different season,'' O'Neal said, ``a different type of
focus. And we're on a mission here.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's scoring total tied his career playoff high, and he set
new career marks for field goals attempted and made (21 for 33).
Kobe Bryant kicked in another 23 points, and the Lakers who fretted
and sweated through every game against Sacramento this season
relaxed through the last quarter of this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was an easier time tonight,'' said Glen Rice, who
added 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting. ``I don't think we played our
`A' game. I think we still have a lot more room to improve. Things
just happened to work out a little bit better than they have in the
previous games.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they are ready to play at a breakneck pace that in the
past has meant breaking their own necks. Offense ruled as the
Lakers took a 65-55 halftime lead, and it wasn't until the third
quarter that they held the Kings under 40 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense eventually arrived, and the Lakers made 52 of 99
shots (52.5 percent) to maintain a consistent lead that never
dropped below six points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's domination of Vlade Divac (2 for 14, 10 points), the
fourth-quarter foul-out of Chris Webber (28 points) and the Lakers'
total domination of the boards (54 to 37) rendered the Kings
impotent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the type of team that likes to run and shoot, and
whenever we get the opportunity to run and shoot, we also do
that,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has hurt the Lakers in the past, scored 20 points
but never got on enough of a roll to break down the defense.
Sacramento's next highest scorer was Tony Delk, whose 17 points
came mostly with the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   The victory only seemed in jeopardy for a short time ironically,
just !ital!after!off! Webber went to the bench with his sixth foul,
with 6:53 left to play. A Nick Anderson 3-pointer and five quick
points from Divac fueled a 10-0 run that got closed the gap to
105-99.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant hit a 15-footer as the 24-second clock expired and
O'Neal did the rest. He stuffed a Divac layup at the other end,
then scored on a bank shot and a thunderous dunk off a Ron Harper
lob for a 111-99 cushion. For emphasis, O'Neal swatted Divac once
more, and the 18,997 at Staples Center began amusing themselves
with the wave and a few ``M-V-P'' chants.
</P>
<P>
   It was a charmed afternoon for the Lakers' mammoth leader. He
even split a double-team for a short bank shot while losing his
right shoe in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best player in the universe,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played a terrific game,'' coach Phil Jackson
said. ``I thought his mindset, his demeanor, the fact he didn't let
some bangs and bumps on his shot upset him. He obviously got fouled
a couple plays with no call. He played right through it, didn't let
it irritate him. I think he carried himself great today. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials obviously demonstrated there won't be a lot of
fouls on Shaq, so he's just going to have to make his shots, rather
than getting bailed out by foul calls.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of the banged-up Lakers team that last week
muddled through a pair of losses at Dallas and San Antonio to close
out the regular season. Apparently, three days off got them healed
and focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this for almost two weeks,'' Derek
Fisher said. ``We didn't want to lose any games. But you really
could tell that there wasn't any sense of urgency or there wasn't
anything that kept the fire burning on the inside going on. So
we've been looking forward to today for awhile. This is only the
beginning. We can definitely play much better, and we'll continue
to get better as these playoffs go on.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 9th graf for change in wording; subs penultimate graf for
changes in wording)  By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Photograph No. 1 shows a helmeted, goggled,
grimacing man pointing a fearsome automatic weapon toward a
terrified child being protected by the man who rescued him from the
ocean five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Photograph No. 2 shows the same child hours later, posing
smiling and relaxed in the arms of his father.
</P>
<P>
   The first photo was shot by Alan Diaz of The Associated Press,
who will presumably provide its reporters with full details
surrounding the politically dismaying spot-news photo.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, who was waved into the house by its residents' shocked
attorney, could respond credibly to such questions as: Were other
shots taken in the instants before and after? Was anything posed?
Who was first to grab the child? What were the subjects saying? The
news organization is objective; we'll believe its report.
</P>
<P>
   The second photo was credited ``courtesy of Juan Miguel
Gonzalez,'' carefully posed for propaganda purposes. It was taken _
after nobody knows how much cajoling _ by Gregory Craig, President
Clinton's personal lawyer, who was hired by the left-wing church
group serving Fidel Castro's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno's spokesman, Eric Holder, admonished
us Sunday ``not to focus on'' the photo taken by the free press.
``The picture that Americans should focus on,'' he says, is No. 2,
of the happy family taken and distributed by the
Clinton-Craig-Cuban connection.
</P>
<P>
   Which photo do you believe illuminates the truth of this drama _
the spot-news shot or the propaganda pose? Will Clinton-Reno
Justice be remembered for the happy reunion or by the brutal excess
of police power that brought it about?
</P>
<P>
   I've been among the majority who believed that, in the close
judgment between a father's custodial rights and a child's
opportunity to live in a free society, the father had the edge. Let
the courts decide, we thought; in due course, Gonzalez would
prevail and the rule of law be grudgingly obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno, prodded by Clinton, who wanted to teach
Cuban-Americans a lesson, could not abide further challenge to
executive fiats. When the lawyer Craig turned down the final
compromise that had been agreed to by Elian's relatives in Miami,
Reno caved in to Craig's pressure and sent in the troops.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, she made three mistakes that discredited her
office, disgusted the fair-minded and demeaned the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake 1: I am the law. No executive officials can arrogate to
themselves the notion that they are ``the law''; they merely
execute laws passed by legislatures and interpreted by courts. The
genius of the American system is that the individual can with
impunity fight the federal government in federal courts and in
Congress. In this case, the Clinton administration circumvented a
federal appeals court decision that encouraged the relatives' case;
instead, the can't-wait enforcers took the law into their own heavy
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake 2: Treating Elian as a hostage. When hostages are
endangered, the government can trick the terrorists by stringing
them along and then striking in the dead of night with overwhelming
force. Wrongly construing Elian to be a hostage, Reno talked with
the relatives' lawyers on the phone, supposedly negotiating, even
as her agents in body armor smashed down the door.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian was no hostage; nobody was harming him or threatening
anybody's life. In this civil case, lawyers for the boy's loving
relatives were disputing the Immigration Service's demands in a
court of law. For Reno to claim ``intelligence'' (from the FBI?)
that the Cuban-Americans' arguably legal defiance was backed up
with hidden weapons _ and therefore that she was urgently required
to launch a cruel and violent assault by a score of our most
ferocious-looking agents _ is ludicrous. Clinton Justice plainly
lost its head.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake 3. In the dead of night, nobody would see. Clinton may
have realized that by pressing Reno to smash into a peaceful
citizen's home in darkness to search and seize, the only visible
injury would be to the spirit of the Fourth Amendment. He counted,
as usual, on not getting caught in the act. That was the crowning
mistake: A photographer showed up to record the nation's shame.

REVOLUTION UNINSPIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The contrast could not have been much
greater between the two Kraft-owned teams in the MLS Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The dreariness of a rainy night at Foxboro Stadium magnified and
contributed to an uneven and uninspiring performance as the
Revolution tied the Chicago Fire, 1-1. Meanwhile, on a bright,
sunny afternoon in San Jose, Calif., the Earthquakes celebrated a
5-0 victory over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Though geography and weather are often major determining factors
in the style of play and even the success of soccer teams, they
were not the greatest reasons for the differences between the
Earthquakes and Revolution. Though the difference in climate is
symbolic, the greater reasons for optimism and pessimism reside
within the makeup of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution once again seem bogged down in their own
limitations. There is little evidence this team is destined for
great things, though it should improve on last year's finish and is
currently among the leaders in the Eastern Division. But a better
context to evaluate the Revolution is in their overall standing _
ninth place in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, though, presents a young team with a lot of mobility
and dynamic figures such as Ronald Cerritos, Abdul Thompson Conteh,
and Mauricio Wright to provide points of reference. The five-goal
victory over Dallas seems a fluke, but it is the type of fluke the
Revolution never have been able to accomplish, and seem unlikely to
with the current team.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the Earthquakes project an image of a team
of the future. This is a process that began more than a year ago
under Brian Quinn. Lothar Osiander has replaced Quinn as coach but
seems to be following the spirit of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution would like to replicate many elements of San
Jose's on-field plan. Coach Fernando Clavijo is an enthusiastic
promoter of young talent and wants to present a team that combines
aesthetics and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo, though, might have missed his chance to make over the
Revolution in his image, to start the process that began in San
Jose before the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution midfield is a study in underachievement. Leonel
Alvarez and John Harkes essentially duplicate functions as
defensive midfielders. Mauricio Ramos is wasted on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution strikers are not producing, which is as much a
function of the midfield malfunctioning as their own limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Only the defense, perceived as a major weakness before the
season, has performed at a consistently competent level.
</P>
<P>
   William Sunsing could become a galvanizing force in attack. His
best position is on the outside of midfield, whether competing with
Imad Baba for the starting spot on the right or taking over the
left side. Either way, this would allow Ramos to move to the
center. But, should the Revolution remain in a 4-4-2 alignment,
Harkes then would be forced to move outside.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes is motivated by a possible recall to the US national team
as a holding midfielder. And, indeed, his experience and
personality qualify him for a central role. Harkes is an
accomplished and versatile player, but is it wise to base so much
of the strategy on him? The San Jose model would indicate the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   After six games, the Revolution have earned six points, about on
par with past teams. As in the past, most Revolution players and
management are convinced they are close to blending a successful
team and require only persistence and time. But Clavijo and
director of operations Sunil Gulati will have to decide soon
whether they can convince fans and players there is hope for the
future, or if they should modify their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, their attacking players aren't worrying opposing
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this team capturing the attention of any but hard-core
fans. And this is an important consideration, since the Boston area
continues to prove its superior soccer interest. Despite the
miserable weather and the team's historic lack of success, a crowd
of 6,737 was perceived as disappointing. The Revolution never have
defeated an MLS opponent by five goals, and if they did, they
likely would draw significantly more than the 8,000 Silicon
Valley-ites who were in Spartan Stadium Saturday.

GAME 1 WIN HAS NICE RING TO IT FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Phil Jackson's best motivational tool Sunday
wasn't a book or a quote from Eastern philosophy but something far
more tangible, and really, really sparkly: a diamond-encrusted
piece of jewelry on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since becoming Lakers coach last June,
Jackson wore a Chicago Bulls championship ring No.6, from 1998 in
front of his players. The message and the timing needed little
explanation as the Lakers prepared to open round one of the
playoffs against the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gleaming, huh?'' Glen Rice said. ``One of the things he
told us is that he's going to wear his ring, to put it in our face
a little bit, so we can work just as hard, so we can get our ring
and put it back in his face. ... It said a lot. It's really what
it's all about. You go out and you work hard in games, and you try
and get to that point where you can also have a ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper, who won three championships under Jackson, also wore
his 1998 ring to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want one of those,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``I think the focus
has always been there, but to see it live and direct, it's another
experience. ... He said he was going to wear it until somebody
knocks us out, or until we get him another one.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one other pregame wrinkle for the playoffs: Bob
Marley's ``Get up, Stand up'' played over the locker room speakers.
</P>
<P>
   NO PAIN: Derek Fisher played for the first time since going on
the injured list April 14, but he said the bone spur in his right
ankle didn't affect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go for it,'' he said. ``I might last a week,
I might last two weeks. You don't know really what's going to
happen. I think I'm just going to go for it when I'm there, and
just play hard, try to provide some energy when I'm on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher scored just three points in 10 minutes, but his main
contribution came when he took a charge from Sacramento's Chris
Webber midway through the fourth quarter, causing him to foul out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not running as well as I'd like to see him run,'' Jackson
said of Fisher, ``and I'm concerned about that, because this is a
series in which we have to have a quick guard, a small guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's sprained right wrist was taped but also seemed to be a
non-issue as he hit 11 of 22 shots for 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get an injury, the concentration picks up, your focus
picks up,'' he said. ``I told (trainer Gary) Vitti, I didn't want
to do any treatment before the game because my wrist felt pretty
good.'' &QL;

FINLEY RIDES OUT THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He spent his off time in his Boston hotel room reading
``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent his working time during the past two days watching a
less-than-perfect storm create havoc with his plans to face the Red
Sox' Pedro Martinez in what some viewed as a near perfect matchup
of pitching aces.
</P>
<P>
   For Chuck Finley, newly minted as one of the leaders of the
Cleveland Indians staff after a 14-year stint with the Angels ended
over the winter, Sunday was a hurry-up-and-wait end to a
hurry-up-and-wait weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was to start against Martinez Saturday, but that game was
called off three hours before its 3:05 start, one that had been
pushed back two hours to try to dodge the rain that settled over
the region the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said Finley. ``Part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He could wait a day. But when Finley woke up Sunday morning and
turned on the Weather Channel, he saw nothing but green radar
blotches hovering over Boston. ``I saw that and they said it was
just sitting there and I thought it might be a problem,'' said
Finley after waiting 3 hours 22 minutes for Sunday's doubleheader
to be postponed, wiping out the entire series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Finley kept his game face on as long as possible. While
most of his teammates were in the visiting clubhouse, watching NBA
playoff games on television, Finley sat in the dugout, watching the
rain fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never really let up,'' said Finley. ``The field was
saturated, and it would have taken a while to get going even if the
rain had stopped.'
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested the Indians and Sox _ who now must play
back-to-back day-night doubleheaders in September to make up for
two of the games washed out and a one-game pit stop in between
trips June 8 to make up the other _ might have been best served if
they had started in the light rain and tried to get at least five
innings and an official game into the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been tough,'' said Finley, who flew across the
country Sunday &UR;  &LR; night to Seattle and will pitch Monday night
against the Mariners. ``It would have been dangerous and they would
have had to change the ball on every pitch and after every hit. It
would have taken a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley and Charles Nagy, who was scheduled to start the second
game, both shrugged off the delay. ``You just make adjustments,''
said Nagy, who will have to wait until Tuesday night to pitch,
which means he will have waited a week between starts. ``It really
shouldn't have any effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said the weekend was surreal. He never even began to warm
up, much less pitch. What was unusual was getting washed out two
days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've missed a start, but never two days in a row, because of
weather,'' said Finley, who was even more intrigued by New England
weather after reading ``The Perfect Storm,'' the chronicling of the
deadly Halloween storm that killed fishermen off Gloucester,
prompting a best-selling book and a soon-to-be-released movie.
``It's just something you have to get used to. I don't think there
will be any problem (with too much rest).''
</P>
<P>
   For Finley, who sat in the dugout and watched replays of Red Sox
magic moments _ six times _ before he was told the game was
postponed, it was a weekend of reading and reflection rather than
accomplishment.

HARPER SETS TONE FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Easter Sunday, Ron Harper rose from the
debilitated if not the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Written off all year as too decrepit to run the floor with the
likes of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the 36-year-old guard
put together a marvelous first quarter against Sacramento that set
into blurring motion the Lakers' 117-107 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Harper contributed five points, five rebounds and two assists in
the opening 12 minutes, as the Lakers raced to a six-point lead
over the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   He got his second basket of the quarter by rising like a
specter, seemingly materializing out of nowhere to heave home a
miss by O'Neal to lengthen the Lakers' lead to 34-26.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's tip-in acted on the sellout Staples Center crowd like a
double shot of espresso. About the only person in the building who
didn't pop a cornea when Harper took flight and the ball fell
through the hoop was Harper. In typically self-deprecating fashion,
he said, ``I closed my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   An awesome game by an aw-shucks guy who sat out the last two
regular-season games with a bruised tailbone; how's that for a
Hollywood beginning?
</P>
<P>
   For sure, coach Phil Jackson couldn't have scripted it any
better. The fast start was precisely what a head doctor would have
ordered for a heavily favored team looking to shake some bad
playoff mojo.
</P>
<P>
   A stumble out of the gate would have reversed the momentum the
Lakers built en route to compiling the league's best regular-season
record (67-15). A shaky performance in front of a hyped-up home
crowd, and all of the sudden, people would have been looking back,
at the Lakers' second- and third-round playoff exits of the
previous two years, instead of ahead, to a possibly jubilant June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game is always the hardest, especially when you have
the home-court advantage,'' said O'Neal, who made it look pretty
easy, actually, collecting 46 points, 17 rebounds and five blocked
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Harper's four assists set up one of O'Neal's more
spectacular putaways. After grabbing the rebound at the other end,
Harper lobbed an alley-oop pass that O'Neal threw down to put the
Lakers up, 111-99, with just over three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to putting an exclamation point on the afternoon,
the play made a point: No matter how cushy their lead, the Lakers
weren't about to back off and give the Kings a bit of breathing
room.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, the Lakers talked about doing such things. The
difference was they didn't have anyone like Harper to breathe life
into the words.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson lured Harper, whom he had coached in Chicago, out of
retirement so he could be the coach's alter ego on the floor.
Harper was a cog in three of Chicago's NBA title runs, so he knew
the drill.
</P>
<P>
   His Lakers' teammates know he knows the drill, which makes all
the difference. ``He has a couple of rings,'' O'Neal said of
Harper. ``So we're going to listen to what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper overcame a speech impediment in his early 20s and hasn't
stopped talking since. His lips must get tired before his legs do
for all the work they get. On Sunday, Harper filled every break in
the action with chatter.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to the officials during some lulls, politicking on
behalf of his teammate, O'Neal, whom Harper said, ``is getting
pulled on all the time'' by the Kings' Vlade Divac, Chris Webber
and Scot Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal shot 33 free throws, 17 more than than any King tried, so
one can assume Harper was heard.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't pleading with the officials, Harper was in his
teammates' faces. He told Kobe Bryant more than once to stop
hurrying the offense, and when Robert Horry committed a silly foul
on Webber in the waning minutes of the second quarter, Harper
harped to him, saving Jackson a little breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some players who tend to get overanxious,'' Harper
said, stressing the last word. ``Sometimes, they try to score too
soon. I've got guys who tend to shoot too fast. My job is to try to
calm them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Kings had outrebounded the Lakers in their lone
victory in four regular-season meetings, Harper decided it was also
his job to go hard to the glass. He grabbed six offensive rebounds,
and with every one of them he effectively stalled the Kings'
patented fast break.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when was the last time he collected so many offensive
boards, Harper laughed. ``In the eighth grade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Harper was in the eighth grade, Kings point guard Jason
Williams was in the womb. Despite the lower mileage on his legs,
Williams, 23, had a heck of a time keeping up with ``Old Head,'' as
Bryant affectionately calls Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all the basketball skills,'' Harper said of Williams.
``I used my old head on him.'' The Lakers used to be like Williams,
who has more skill than he sometimes can manage. Harper's job, as
he sees it, is to show them the way.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. &QL;

TECHNOLOGY IS MAKING SHORTHAND OBSOLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Back before secretaries were administrative assistants, when
many still bought gifts for the boss' wife, Judy Pool took
shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   The squiggly lines and symbols, illegible to the men who
dictated the letters, filled her steno pads and her days. The job
required it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, few, if any, schools in the Valley offer shorthand, which
at one time allowed secretaries to take as many as 200 words of
dictation a minute. Community colleges offer something called
``Rapid Writing'' using abbreviations. But dictaphones, speed
typing and computers that recognize voices have taken the place of
the administrative art. And within 30 years, many predict the
method will be extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing shorthand reflects a major change in the fourth most
common job for women. This year, Secretaries' Week was renamed
Administrative Professionals' Week, another sign of the shift.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative Assistants, the chosen job title, now are taking
on more authority, as their rote duties are handed off to
receptionists and word processors.
</P>
<P>
   Probably fewer than 25 percent of administrative assistants know
shorthand, guesses Rick Stroud of the International Association of
Administrative Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a disappearing art,'' says Pool, 57, who runs the
Secretarial Pool in Scottsdale. ``It's lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Most colleges dropped their shorthand classes in the late 1980s,
more than 20 years after many high schools stopped offering the
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1950s, almost every girl took shorthand in high
school, listening to the Gregg instructional record albums. The
still-popular Gregg's steno pads with the pink line dividing the
pages in half remind most women over 40 of practicing the lines
over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Brown, 62, taught herself shorthand in the 1950s so she
could learn the lyrics of her favorite songs by the Four Tops,
Perry Como and Debbie Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   She used shorthand as a secretary and, later, taught it at
Lamson Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   As the job of secretary changed and technology evolved, her
class changed to ``Fast Writing.''
</P>
<P>
   It would cost $30-$40 to use shorthand for dictated letters now,
Brown guesses, for the time of writing the letter in shorthand,
then transcribing it into the computer and then rewriting it after
it's edited.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Now, the boss will just say, `Write a letter to so and so o
this or that,' and you compose it,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The Administrative Professionals' Association says very few jobs
require shorthand and, although it can be useful, those looking for
a job don't really need it.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pool says she hears now and then of some bosses requiring
shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old guys like it,'' said Pool, who had to wear white
gloves to work when she was a secretary in the 1960s. ``They
probably liked having the female in front of them, hanging on each
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown still uses shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks so pretty,'' she says. She lapses back to Gregg when
``I don't want the person next to me to know what I'm writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But secretaries have outgrown it,'' she says. ``It's sad, but
now we're not just here to please the boss, but to meet the
company's goals.'' &QL;

 OLERUD KO's KC  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They placed their No. 1 starter on the disabled list
Friday night and added their No. 2 starter to the list Saturday
afternoon. It was such a painful weekend that one of their players
was knocked out of the game standing in the on-deck circle. There
were so many injuries that Jay Buhner, who missed half of Seattle's
games the past two seasons, said, ``I feel like an iron man.''
</P>
<P>
   But after applying all the bandages, reviewing all the X-rays
and filling out all the insurance forms, the Mariners not only
survived the weekend from hell, they swept three games from the
Royals and increased their lead to three games in the American
League West.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez returned from a strained quadricep to hit a
two-run home run into the upper deck, but it was Washington native
John Olerud who delivered Sunday's biggest hit. After Arthur Rhodes
allowed a game-tying home run in the top of the ninth, Olerud
slammed a three-run, walkoff homer in the bottom of the inning to
beat the Royals 8-5 and extend Kansas City's losing streak to nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you sweep a series it's good, but especially so after
getting banged up like that,'' starter Aaron Sele said. ``There's a
lot of satisfaction to this.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding, given the way the series started out on Black
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Opening day starter Jamie Moyer went on the disabled list with a
shoulder strain before Friday's series opener, and then No. 2
starter Freddy Garcia limped onto the DL with what turned out to be
a hairline fracture of his right tibia. And then there was John
Mabry's pulled groin. The Mariners say Moyer will be out three
weeks; Garcia and Mabry could be out four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you've got some other guys that have some injuries who
have to tippy-toe around,'' Buhner said. ``But that's part of the
adjustments you have to make, part of the grind. And that's the
best part about playing 162 games _ you know you'll get those guys
back. Those are the challenges and you've got to pick guys up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners certainly did that over the weekend. Frankie
Rodriguez came through with four scoreless innings in relief of
Garcia on Friday, Brett Tomko came up from AAA Tacoma and won
Saturday's game in place of Moyer, and Olerud came through Sunday
after the bullpen faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Sele left with a 5-1 lead in the sixth, but Jose Paniagua and
Jose Mesa gave up three runs in the seventh inning and Rhodes,
filling for closer Kazu Sasaki, allowed a solo home run to Jermaine
Dye in the ninth to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had the making of a game we let slip away,'' said Alex
Rodriguez, who set a club record by walking five times. ``We've had
games like that slip away in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. After Stan Javier and Rodriguez walked, Olerud
quickly fell behind reliever Ricky Bottalico 0-2 and also took a
1-2 slider that just missed the strike zone. He sent the next pitch
into the right-field seats for a game-ending home run and found his
teammates waiting for him at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud is hitting .404 and has reached base in 21 of his past 28
plate appearances. He was 2-for-4 with four RBIs and two runs
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think only John could lay off a pitch like that (1-2
pitch),'' Rodriguez said. ``Even the fastball he hit was a good
pitch, a fastball on the hands. But that's pretty much indicative
of the hitter he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes it look way too easy. We're different hitters. I'm a
lot more aggressive than he is. With John, he gets behind 0-2 and
it's like he's taking a walk in the park, he is so cool and
collected. He might be the best hitter in the game. He's like Tony
Gwynn. You do learn discipline from him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a right-handed Edgar,'' Buhner said. ``You've got John
from the left and Edgar from the right, bam-bam. And A-Rod in front
of them and some rum-dum behind them. Three guys with hitting
titles, three guys with a pretty good idea of what they're doing up
there. And then some rum-dum like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud said he couldn't remember the last time he hit a walkoff
home run in the state of Washington, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember hitting some in the run for the state
championship (at Interlake High School in 1986) but I don't know if
I hit one to end a game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After all that happened over the weekend, Olerud said the sweep
was a big lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen has done a good job for us overall and it's always
nice to pick them up so they know they can count on us when they
struggle,'' Olerud said. ``Because there will be times when we need
them to pick us up.''

   LOS ANGELES _ On Easter Sunday, Ron Harper rose from the

   Written off all year as too decrepit to run the floor with the

didn't pop a cornea when Harper took flight and the ball fell
through the hoop was Harper. In typically self-deprecating fashion,
he said, ``I closed my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   An awesome game by an aw-shucks guy who sat out the last two
regular-season games with a bruised tailbone; how's that for a
Hollywood beginning?
</P>
<P>
   For sure, coach Phil Jackson couldn't have scripted it any
better. The fast start was precisely what a head doctor would have
ordered for a heavily favored team looking to shake some bad
playoff mojo.
</P>
<P>
   A stumble out of the gate would have reversed the momentum the
Lakers built en route to compiling the league's best regular-season
record (67-15). A shaky performance in front of a hyped-up home
crowd, and all of the sudden, people would have been looking back,
at the Lakers' second- and third-round playoff exits of the
previous two years, instead of ahead, to a possibly jubilant June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game is always the hardest, especially when you have
the home-court advantage,'' said O'Neal, who made it look pretty
easy, actually, collecting 46 points, 17 rebounds and five blocked
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Harper's four assists set up one of O'Neal's more
spectacular putaways. After grabbing the rebound at the other end,
Harper lobbed an alley-oop pass that O'Neal threw down to put the
Lakers up, 111-99, with just over three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to putting an exclamation point on the afternoon,
the play made a point: No matter how cushy their lead, the Lakers
weren't about to back off and give the Kings a bit of breathing
room.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, the Lakers talked about doing such things. The
difference was they didn't have anyone like Harper to breathe life
into the words.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson lured Harper, whom he had coached in Chicago, out of
retirement so he could be the coach's alter ego on the floor.
Harper was a cog in three of Chicago's NBA title runs, so he knew
the drill.
</P>
<P>
   His Lakers' teammates know he knows the drill, which makes all
the difference. ``He has a couple of rings,'' O'Neal said of
Harper. ``So we're going to listen to what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper overcame a speech impediment in his early 20s and hasn't
stopped talking since. His lips must get tired before his legs do
for all the work they get. On Sunday, Harper filled every break in
the action with chatter.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to the officials during some lulls, politicking on
behalf of his teammate, O'Neal, whom Harper said, ``is getting
pulled on all the time'' by the Kings' Vlade Divac, Chris Webber
and Scot Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal only tried five free throws, so Harper had reason to
lobby for his center.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't pleading with the officials, Harper was in his
teammates' faces. He told Kobe Bryant more than once to stop
hurrying the offense, and when Robert Horry committed a silly foul
on Webber in the waning minutes of the second quarter, Harper
harped to him, saving Jackson a little breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some players who tend to get overanxious,'' Harper
said, stressing the last word. ``Sometimes, they try to score too
soon. I've got guys who tend to shoot too fast. My job is to try to
calm them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Kings had outrebounded the Lakers in their lone
victory in four regular-season meetings, Harper decided it was also
his job to go hard to the glass. He grabbed six offensive rebounds,
and with every one of them he effectively stalled the Kings'
patented fast break.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when was the last time he collected so many offensive
boards, Harper laughed. ``In the eighth grade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Harper was in the eighth grade, Kings point guard Jason
Williams was in the womb. Despite the lower mileage on his legs,
Williams, 23, had a heck of a time keeping up with ``Old Head,'' as
Bryant affectionately calls Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all the basketball skills,'' Harper said of Williams.
``I used my old head on him.'' The Lakers used to be like Williams,
who has more skill than he sometimes can manage. Harper's job, as
he sees it, is to show them the way.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LABOR-TRADE (Washington) _ The American labor movement, while
waging its biggest battle ever against trade liberalization, is
trying to fend off charges from many economists, business
executives and members of Congress that it has re-embraced
protectionism. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-AIDS (Irkutsk, Russia) _ Today a region which had hardly
heard of AIDS a year ago has recorded 5,000 new cases of HIV
infection and registered more than 8,500 drug addicts. Those are
the official statistics: The true figures could be as much as 10
times greater, officials say. Perhaps nowhere else in Russia have
HIV infections grown so explosively. Heroin has proven the deadly
catalyst in this epidemic. It has fueled a sharp rise in drug use
and encouraged the needle-sharing that helps the AIDS virus spread.
By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-TODAY (Thu Duc, Vietnam) _ ``For Vietnam, 1975 was the
year of national reunification geographically and 1976 was the year
of national reunification legislatively,'' said a Vietnamese
journalist in Hanoi. ``But for national reunification
psychologically it will take several decades more.'' By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-SUICIDE (Bhilai, India) _ That most haunting of questions
_ ``Why?'' _ is one that researchers are grappling with in India as
suicide rates rise. While India's rates are below the international
average of 16 per 100,000 people, they have been on a steady upward
march to 10 per 100,000 people in 1997 from 6.3 in 1980, according
to India's National Crime Records Bureau and the World Health
Organization. Psychiatrists here say they are not sure why, though
they believe the accelerating pace of social and economic change is
behind the rising rates. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-DEFECTOR (Seoul, South Korea) _ For Kim Eun Chol, a North
Korean defector, his long, arduous flight to freedom began three
years ago when he swam across the Amnokkang River and into China.
Barely a year into his new life, Kim says he is terribly unhappy in
this strange land of seemingly boundless freedom and a strong,
hi-tech market economy that has given South Koreans one of the
highest standards of living in Asia. His difficulties illustrate
the deep disparities that have developed between the two Koreas
since they went to war 50 years ago. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-TOURISTS (Cuzco, Peru) _ In the last seven years, since the
terrorist Shining Path insurrection began to wind down, Cuzco has
rapidly become one of South America's prime tourist destinations.
Quechua-speaking Indians, who pose for tourist cameras with llamas
decorated with pink ribbons tied to their ears, have begun to ask
for tips in smatterings of Italian, French and English. Visa and
American Express signs hang ubiquitously over Inca stonework.
Diesel exhaust belched from tourist buses now mixes with the

University's College of Citizenship and Public Service. Tufts'

curriculum _ powered by a $10 million gift from the eBay guy _ is

expansion of coverage without an accompanying expansion of
government. But many analysts say his approach has serious
shortcomings, and Democrats are only too willing to highlight them.
By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-IMAGE (Austin, Texas) _ Gov. George W. Bush is constantly
telling people, in one way or another, that he is a regular,
down-home kinda guy. Trendy television shows? Doesn't watch 'em.
Fancy-schmancy vacations? Doesn't take 'em. Literary novels?
Doesn't read 'em. Bush is hardly the first presidential candidate
to strive for a folksy touch. But in his case, several political
analysts said, that persona contains especially interesting
tensions and contradictions, because it is conspicuously at odds
with his surname, his pedigree and much of his personal history. By
Frank Bruni.

   BRAZIL-U.S.-JUICE (Undated) _ Nobody grows or squeezes more
oranges than Brazil, where some 400,000 workers rely on oranges for
their livelihoods. Since most of the 170 million people in Brazil
are not in the habit of drinking orange juice, all but 1 percent of
the juice gets exported. Much goes to the United States, where
Americans are the globe's biggest consumers of orange juice. In a
world of open borders, this pairing of abundant supply and growing
demand should come close to free trade nirvana. But Washington has
imposed heavy tariffs on orange juice from Brazil since 1987. By
Anthony DePalma with Simon Romero.

   CHIP-PHOTO (Grenoble, France) _ A new generation of chips could

   TV-SWEEPS-MEDIA (Undated) _ This week begins May sweeps month,
that rite of spring in which the TV networks go to great lengths to
goose ratings because this is the period in which advertising rates

programming bears scant resemblance to anything else that will
appear all year. No wonder broadcasting and advertising executives

   E-COMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Given the dismal performance of
dot-com retailers on Wall Street and in the offices of venture
capitalists lately, investors have had their fill of e-books,
e-pets, e-drugs and other Web retail operations that burn through
cash at Internet speed. What the market seems to be in the mood for

   LIMBAUGH-MEDIA (Undated) _ Shed no tears for Rush Limbaugh. He
is still at the top of talk radio. Advertisers still clamor to get
on his show. His personal income is still higher than any other
radio personality's, according to Forbes magazine. But here it is
an election year, and you probably do not hear his name quite so
often, or read his thundering opinions quoted in newspapers and

</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY-ROMANIA-MEDIA (Undated) _ While Playboy is not
necessarily a feminist's dream publication, it was not known for
publishing purposefully misogynist articles _ that is, until
Playboy Enterprises made a licensing arrangement with a multimedia
publishing company in Romania called Media Pro Group, which began
publishing a Romanian edition of the magazine in October. The April
issue clearly stepped beyond the boundaries of American Playboy,
and has outraged women's groups in Eastern Europe and caused a stir
at the Playboy corporate offices, with an article titled ``How to
Beat Your Wife ... Without Leaving Marks on Her Body.'' By Alex
Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   QUIZSHOW-GENDER-MEDIA (Undated) _ Men know their geography and
women know their cosmetics. And men tend to know card games, ship
disasters and acronyms for police organizations a little better
than women _ who, um, know Broadway show tunes. Or at least those
seem to be the assumptions of the people who write the test
questions used in screening applicants for the TV quiz show ``Who

   AUCTIONS-SOLICIT (New York) _ Beneath the patina of culture and
connoisseurship, practices like soliciting the bereaved have become
commonplace in the auction world. Once the rarefied domain of
aristocracy and old wealth, auctions have mushroomed into a $5
billion-a-year global business. At the same time, Sotheby's and
Christie's, which control 90 percent of the market worldwide, have
swapped their patrician ways for more aggressive business tactics.

SHOWTIME IS BACK FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one in the Los Angeles Lakers' locker room said
a single discouraging peep on Easter Sunday about their first round
playoff opponent, Sacramento. But sometimes words aren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of a game they controlled and would win by
10, one could scan the Lakers bench and find A.C. Green sitting
with a green Beanie Baby on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers respect the Kings and Chris Webber, but the Lakers of
the New Millennium now understand that what they do, how well they
execute Phil Jackson's game plan, comes before any hard-sell on the
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime is clearly part of the Lakers' history, replaced now by
Jackson's methodical yet challenging approach. He has prepared his
team so well, invariably the same team that always looked
unprepared a year ago, that there's a sense of fait accompli in
what they do. That's a trait one usually finds in the DNA of most
championship teams, too. There wasn't a single moment Sunday when
anyone in the Staples crowd of 18,997 felt the Lakers were in any
real danger.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson still works hard, though, to keep his points fresh. His
early season comment about Kobe Bryant, that the young star needed
to play within the team, has turned Kobe into a complete player, a
transition Michael Jordan also had to make before becoming the
league's best player and winner of six NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's unwavering support of Shaquille O'Neal from tipoff to
playoff has allowed the Man of Steel to fill his BMOC (Big Man On
Court) role without any of the leadership paranoia that accompanied
the team in the past. O'Neal, the son of a Marine, now plays drill
instructor to Jackson's captain. There's something to be said for a
well-defined chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to last week, too, when Jackson spliced scenes of
movies with a message into film sessions, or the day he put the
best team in the league through a sweaty three-hour pre-playoff
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the same things in Chicago,'' said Lakers guard Ron
Harper, who won three NBA titles as a member of Jackson's Bulls.
``He's in his mode now. He wants us to now play our best
basketball, to play with great intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best time of every season, after the 82 games. The
best time.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year has not been the best time for the Lakers, at
least not since 1991, their last visit to the NBA finals. Between
1992 and 1999, the Lakers missed the playoffs one season, were
eliminated in the first round three times, and swept out of the
playoffs the last two years, by Utah in the 1998 Western finals and
San Antonio in the second round last year. Total postseason record
the last eight years: A miserable 23-31.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is here for that very reason, to improve the postseason
marks, and he is unconcerned about style points.
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing to note that while Shaq, Kobe and Glen Rice are
the Big Three, Jackson is getting great play from the supporting
cast. Harper had nine rebounds Sunday, six of them offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I had six offensive rebounds was probably the
sixth grade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper this season has had 36 games with six or more boards and
35 with four or more assists. A.C. Green, with six boards Sunday,
has had 60 games now with five or more rebounds. Robert Horry has
had five assists or more in 20 games since late February. And Brian
Shaw, a player G.M. Jerry West always wanted, has been an asset
cross the board.
</P>
<P>
   Once mesmerized by half-court teams, the Lakers now look to trap
opponents in their triangle offense. Unlike last year, when the
team's defense went to Charlotte with Eddie Jones, the Lakers this
year set an L.A. club record for fewest points allowed per game
(92.3) and held opponents to 41 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that likes to run and shoot, and when we have
the opportunity, so do we,'' said Shaq. ``But when they take shots
like that, there are a lot of long rebounds, and we win those
battles. He (Jackson) has prepared us well.''
</P>
<P>
   This includes advising O'Neal not to expect any favors by the
officias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials have demonstrated there won't be a lot of fouls
called against Shaq, so he has to make his shots,'' Jackson said.
``Everything about his mindset and demeanor was good. He played
through the non-calls and carried himself great.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he carried himself with 46 points on 21 for 33 from the
field, plus 17 rebounds and five blocked shots. Fourteen more games
like that and the Lakers can win a title and earn rings.
</P>
<P>
   And they have all seen enough of those worn by Harper and
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all seen the rings,'' said Harper, ``seen them enough
that they want to win one for themselves.'' &QL;

SHORTHAND (undated) _ Back before secretaries were administrative
assistants, when many still bought gifts for the boss' wife, Judy
Pool took shorthand. The squiggly lines and symbols, illegible to
the men who dictated the letters, filled her steno pads and her

   MENTAL (Phoenix) _ Record numbers of residents of Arizona's
Maricopa County _ frustrated at being refused state services _ are
going to court to prove they have a serious mental illness. But
even in court, advocates say, potential patients face a legal
system so lopsided that it requires them to prove their mental
illness. The appeals system requires that potential patients make
their case under rules more strict than state statutes that define
mental illness. Even then, the Arizona Department of Health
Services has the final say over whether they receive treatment. By

<P>
   Of course, we did. Nolan Ryan proved it for five other-worldly
seasons while he wore a Rangers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Double-bypass surgery? It can't be. Didn't Nolan just pitch last
week?
</P>
<P>
   Some of us still believe, you see, in both the Easter Bunny and
Nolan Ryan _ and not necessarily in that order. Nolan was timeless.
Nolan was tireless.
</P>
<P>
   He gave hope to all of the 40-something guys out there who, when
confronted with life's Robin Venturas, now had a role model to show
how to apply a headlock.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Austin is encouraging, as heart surgeries go. But
this is a living legend that we are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight, over-indulged, over-partied TV stars get heart
attacks. Ryan, on the other hand, is 53 and as fit as a saint.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'd be two years younger myself if I could have the
time I spent waiting for Nolan to conclude his obligatory
post-pitching workout before speaking to the media.
</P>
<P>
   His son Reese reported yesterday, with considerable relief,
``The doctors say he's got the heart of a 30-year-old. They were
real optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. They probably want him to pitch for the hospital softball
team.
</P>
<P>
   According to the family, Nolan and wife Ruth were walking around
the grounds yesterday morning at the new Round Rock ballpark _ home
of the latest Ryan family business enterprise, minor-league
baseball. When Nolan reported feeling shortness of breath and pains
in his chest, Ruth drove him to a nearby clinic, where he was
examined and sent to the Heart Hospital of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   An angiogram there disclosed a 90 percent blockage of one
artery, and doctors were summoned to perform the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reese Ryan, the medical people seem to think that
heredity might have finally caught up with the Rangers' superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad's mom, dad and grandfather all had heart attacks or
strokes before they were 55,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   After the double bypass, surgeons pronounced the operation a
``complete success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all feeling a lot better after seeing him,'' Reese
reported. ``There was a lot of stress there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Nolan had been under a tight schedule, trying to open the
new ballpark and launch the Round Rock Express, the son said that
his dad had been enjoying himself and had even played a rare round
of golf last week.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease, however, is a walking case of Craig Grebeck. He's
the little weasel, now with Toronto, that Nolan never could seem to
get out.
</P>
<P>
   America has spent billions on educating people about the dangers
of high cholesterol. We eat egg whites and drink caffeine-free
coffee. We smell the burger, but order the grilled chicken. We mix
in a salad. We dodge the neighborhood dogs on our daily jog.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan did all of that and a lot, lot more _ and he has
double-bypass surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Attention, Internet millionaires: Next time, don't buy the
basketball team for a toy. Give the $280 million to heart disease
research.
</P>
<P>
   The cruel irony to yesterday's news, of course, is that most of
America remembers Nolan Ryan for his endurance, his
indestructibility and his unfaltering spirit. It was no coincidence
that Ryan was a disarming pitch man for Advil pain relievers,
Duracell batteries and Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan was featured once on one of Nike's ``Just Do It''
campaigns, and the slogan never had a more perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   It read, in part, ``People who forgot to retire ... And never
got old ... People who realized it's easier to keep going, if you
never stop ... Just Do It.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was 46 when he threw his last pitch for the Rangers. His
elbow finally failed him. The conditioning didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the doctors are right and Nolan _ with his
30-year-old-like heart _ will be back in the owner's box at Round
Rock in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we remain humbled that this could happen to a man who
looks like he could still down two Advils and pitch for the home
team.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, just in case, I'm ordering the salad.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   We flatter ourselves to think we know something about writing
tight, but we are pikers compared with these people. Granted, there
was self-interest involved. They were embroiled in a contest
sponsored by the San Luis Obispo newspaper ``New Times,'' which
invited readers to submit stories using plot, setting and characte
in fewer than 55 words. First prize included a certificate and a
T-shirt. If ``New Times'' hasn't upped the ante since then, it
doesn't deserve readers like these. Most of the stories are long
(relatively speaking) on dialogue, humor and creative implication,
and short on everything else. It sounds easy, but try it. Here is
``The Britches of Madison County,'' in which author Bill Crown
one-ups Robert James Waller in 37 words: ``Francesca came out on
the porch and welcomed them home, her husband, their son, and
daughter. But her skirt was hung up in the waist of her drawers.
The old man got hip and he shot her.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ORCHID FEVER'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Eric Hansen (Pantheon, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Please do not shy away from this book because its subject is
orchids and you don't know anything about them. Hansen didn't know
anything about them either, until he was hired to guide two orchid
fanatics into the wilds of Borneo in search of the holy grail of
orchids, the Latin name of which we refuse to repea here. Hansen
hired some Borneo natives to provide sherpalike assistance on this
journey, and these simple, jungle-savvy men provide lots of laughs
as they react to the orchid zealots' reasons for sloshing up a
muddy Borneo river with a stockpile of equipment that includes a
camouflaged cardboard toilet. This trip was the author's
introduction to the world of orchids and orchid lovers, which was
far more complex, seductive, competitive and pricey than he ever
imagined. Read all about it in this captivating and often funny
book. (Hansen appeared briefly in a recent ``60 Minutes'' story
about the orchid world. As is almost always the case when media
overlap, the book is better.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SHRINK YOUR HANDICAP'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Phil Lee and Jeff Warne (Hyperion, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can read this as a means to improve your golf game, or you
can read it for laughs. New &AMP; Notable has no golf game to speak of,
but in search of good suggestions for Father's Day, we read gamely
on, stifling our guffaws. Lee, a psychiatrist, and Warne, a golf
instructor, join forces to explain the mystery of why you play
better when no one is watching. The villain is the dreaded panic
attack syndrome. As Lee says, There are specific swing weaknesses
that are magnets for the chemicals of anxiety. Even the tiniest
amount of anxiety produces chemicals that will feast on certain
specific weaknesses in the swing. Their solutions include a
pre-shot routine that involves entering a light trance, developing
``Insight-Oriented Defenses'' to fight the nasty chemicals and
``uninstalling'' the ``Blame Game,'' or the urge to be angry over
bad shots. They take this very, very seriously, but we could not.
Disguised as psychobabble, even common sense sounds like hooey. &QL;

   &UR; ``LEFT FOR DEAD'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Beck Weathers (Villard, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The survival of Dallas pathologist Beck Weathers was just about
the only good news to come out of the storm on Mount Everest that
killed nine people in 1996. Left for dead by other climbers, he
suddenly, miraculously stood up and walked through the squall to
the nearest camp. Fellow climber Jon Krakauer (``Into Thin Air'')
comes off well in this version of the day's events. Anatoli
Boukreev, the guide who climbed without oxygen and so was unable to
help his clients descend before the storm hit, does not. Neither
does George W. Bush, who would not help Weathers' family get him
home from Nepal. Less interesting sections about Weathers' youth
and relationship with his wife and family are followed by sobering
descriptions of his recuperation (he lost both hands and his nose
to frostbite). Best of all, he tells of the daring Nepalese pilot
who flew alone, perilously higher than his helicopter was meant to
go, and brought Weathers off of Mount Everest alive.  &QL;

LAKERS FANS GET PLAYOFF FEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &UR;
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ It was enough to make Michael Miller of
Northridge shake his blue and gold Afro wig in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the Lakers, starting their first postseason at Staples
Center with a good chance to win it all, and Sunday's crowd looked
as if they came fresh from a tasteful brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Were Miller, 27, and his friends the only face painters? Where
was the rabid passion, the abandon, the men and women with ``L.A.''
scrawled across their body parts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a town full of vanity,'' Miller sighed, his richly
hued face barely visible beneath the hair. ``They're here for
paparazzi purposes. They're here to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Miller decried the crowd's restraint, however,
than another batch of pigment-enhanced fans poured off the
escalator. ``Get in here!'' Miller yelled. ``Go Lakes!''
</P>
<P>
   They were slow to arrive and slow to warm up, but many Lakers
fans at Sunday's playoff opener did their best to dispel the
Staples Center crowd's lackluster rep. They screamed to drown out
the cell phone conversations going on in the good seats below. They
hurled abuse at the opposing players during free throws.
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of the game, they had an audience known more for
preening than for enthusiasm roaring at the team's blowout 117-107
win over the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Lakers fans to step up,'' said Junior Villela, 25,
of Torrance. ``We gotta represent for L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobilizing the crowd took work. Awkward silences dominated the
game's first half, with many in the audience shutting up completely
between Lakers baskets. Whole blocks of seats remained empty at the
start of play.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was willing to show fashionably late.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour before the game, Lawrence Balag stood munching
a burrito with his wife and son as the parking lot slowly filled
with Suburbans. They were the only tailgaters in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Raiders fan by heart, so I'm used to tailgate parties,''
said Balag, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Like most at the game, he expected a win. The 1999-2000 Lakers
were strong and deep, and only the San Antonio Spurs, last year's
champion, could possibly derail them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get past San Antonio, they'll win it all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Garay of North Hills and his family stood ready in line
for the center's doors to open at 1:30 p.m. Decked in yellow, they
were bound for the center's nosebleed seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down there's the millionaires,'' said Garay, 21. ``They don't
even watch the game. They just talk and talk and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their distance from the actual game -- so high up even
Shaq looked small -- Garay vowed to make noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you'll hear me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cheers that eventually swept the crowd all seemed to
emanate from the cheap seats. Ramon Andrade and ``Big Lou'' Ruiz of
Rosemead started early, waving a golden Lakers flag from the upper
balcony and trying to launch cheers while many fans were still
finding their seats.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it didn't work. No matter how loud Big Lou bellowed,
his chants hit the audience and disappeared like water into a
sponge. Decked in a Shaquille O'Neal jersey and a hat reading
``Nobody knows I'm a lesbian,'' he looked out of place in a sea of
tasteful sweaters and capris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get everyone into it,'' said Andrade, a season
ticket holder who takes complaints about the center's quiet crowd
very seriously. ``It's going to be loud. We're going to get this
crowd going.''
</P>
<P>
   It still didn't work. The audience clapped politely whenever a
Laker scored, then fell so silent that the basketball's bounce
could be heard in the top row.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get into it, man. They're going to in the second
half,'' Andrade said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't far off. With a few minutes left in the first half,
the Lakers started stretching out their lead, and the crowd
responded. The cheers continued between baskets. Cries of
``Defense!'' finally took on volume and strength.
</P>
<P>
   No one screamed louder than Villela and his crew from Torrance.
Eddie Lopez, 30, took the lead on chants, and the rest spread them
into the nearby sections. Such hard-core fans that several still
sported Raiders tattoos, it was the least they could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to pump up the Lakers fans,'' Villela said. ``When
was the last time we could win the playoffs? You've got to
represent.''

SLIPPERY SUSPECT TELLS HIS STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff writer Sylvia L. Oliande contributed to this
story)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;     By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &UR;
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ With James Bond's cunning and Bruce Lee's
physical skill, Steven Maurice Miko outwitted police by crawling
three stories up an elevator shaft, tunneling to another apartment
and hiding inside a mattress.
</P>
<P>
   He used air conditioners to climb three stories down to the
ground, set fire to an apartment as a diversion and nearly avoided
a police dog's sensitive nose by covering himself in manure.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the 36-year-old assault suspect was captured on April
14, authorities said he somehow managed to remove his seat belt and
leg straps, then tried to use his watch to pick the lock on his
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview, Miko revealed his secret: fear and
drug-induced paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making me sound like I'm some MacGyver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew is I had to stay awake and run away from them. I
was flying by the seat of my pants, trying to stay alive. I didn't
plan anything. Whatever I had to do, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason may be that Miko could face a third strike, which
could send him to prison for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The police reluctantly admit Miko was a formidable opponent, and
they warn he is a public threat -- better off behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy is smoother than silk. Of all the guys I've chased,
he's one of the wiriest,'' said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Ed
Dvorak of the Palmdale sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an intelligent guy -- and that's what makes him
dangerous,'' Dvorak said. ``We laughed about it and said you could
probably make a movie off of this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If deputies wrote the script, the movie would end with Miko
serving a long prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Miko is charged with drawing a firearm in the presence of a
police officer, attempted robbery, assault with a firearm, and two
charges of being a felon or addict in possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded not guilty to all counts during his arraignment on
Tuesday, said Charles Klum, head deputy of the Lancaster office of
the Los Angeles public defender.
</P>
<P>
   Now at the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, Miko reflected
on his last few weeks on the run from authorities. Freed from his
leg and waist chains, the father of three said a longtime drug
addiction has gotten him in trouble since he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a clean, sober life with my future wife. That's all I
want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When police finally caught Miko, he was covered in manure in a
horse trailer, where he had gone to hide -- and sleep. He said he
had been on a crystal methamphetamine binge and hadn't slept more
than four days during his month on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was a dead man. They caught me because I fell
asleep underneath the saddle blanket. I just remember getting woken
up to the dog chewing on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miko is a plasterer by trade and acknowledges he has always been
hard-working but could not stay out of trouble since age 11, when
he got hooked on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just your average, rotten kid -- always in trouble. I've
been begging for help for years,'' he said from jail. ``Could you
help me?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kress, a longtime childhood friend to Miko, said he was
not surprised by his buddy's sly tactics in evading police.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong-willed individual. He was not ready to go to
jail,'' Kress said while standing in line at the jail to visit his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Kress said, Miko was fascinated with Bruce Lee
movies and attended karate classes off Ventura Boulevard in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Miko's sister, Beverly Ewing, 40, said it was not in any
school that he learned his wily escapes, but rather in prison,
where he spent six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made him out to be this major martial artist. He was
educated in jail. He is a total product of the jail system,'' she
said, adding she could not recall why he was jailed previously.
</P>
<P>
   His latest trouble started last month when a deputy responding
to a domestic disturbance call said he ran into Miko carrying a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   But Miko fumbled and dropped the gun. The deputy ran for cover
as Miko picked up the gun and fled, with his girlfriend driving.
</P>
<P>
   Miko argued he dropped a cellular phone, not a gun. But police
said they found a round of ammunition that fell from the gun at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The next time authorities heard of Miko was on April 1, when
they say he kidnapped his girlfriend and stabbed her in the
buttocks, Dvorak said.
</P>
<P>
   Miko denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities next saw Miko at Northridge Hospital Medical Center,
but again he escaped, leading them on a wild chase.
</P>
<P>
   He drove a stolen truck onto railroad tracks, dumped it and fled
into an apartment. He stopped the elevator between floors, climbed
out and crawled three stories up the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   As police surrounded the building, he went into a vacant
apartment, where he cut off his long hair, kicked in a wall,
tunneled into the unit next door and set fire to the other
apartment to divert police.
</P>
<P>
   He then used air conditioners as steps to climb three floors to
the ground -- and to freedom, police said.

   ``He lands on top of a car and gets away,'' Dvorak said.
</P>
<P>
   On the run, he then broke into a Northridge man's home, split
open the mattress and hid inside as police hunted for him
throughout the night, authorities said. The resident was not home
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, who asked not to be identified for fear for his
safety, said he came home to find his clothing, passport and money
missing -- and a strange man's boots in his dining room.

   ``He took every house key, everything you can imagine.''

<P>
   The victim said Miko made himself at home once the police backed
off on the search. He used his toothbrush and his razor to finish
shaving his head, drank water and ate pizza.
</P>
<P>
   His sister can only hope for the best now, although she worries
about him giving in to the bad influence of prison. ``Everyone's
got to be responsible for their own actions,'' she said. ``But he
didn't learn all of this from watching `Bambi.' '' &QL;

SLIPPERY SUSPECT TELLS HIS STORY

 &UR;
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ With James Bond's cunning and Bruce Lee's
physical skill, Steven Maurice Miko outwitted police by crawling
three stories up an elevator shaft, tunneling to another apartment
and hiding inside a mattress.
</P>
<P>
   He used air conditioners to climb three stories down to the
ground, set fire to an apartment as a diversion and nearly avoided
a police dog's sensitive nose by covering himself in manure.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the 36-year-old assault suspect was captured on April
14, authorities said he somehow managed to remove his seat belt and
leg straps, then tried to use his watch to pick the lock on his
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview, Miko revealed his secret: fear and
drug-induced paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making me sound like I'm some MacGyver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew is I had to stay awake and run away from them. I
was flying by the seat of my pants, trying to stay alive. I didn't
plan anything. Whatever I had to do, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason may be that Miko could face a third strike, which
could send him to prison for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The police reluctantly admit Miko was a formidable opponent, and
they warn he is a public threat -- better off behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy is smoother than silk. Of all the guys I've chased,
he's one of the wiriest,'' said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Ed
Dvorak of the Palmdale sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an intelligent guy -- and that's what makes him
dangerous,'' Dvorak said. ``We laughed about it and said you could
probably make a movie off of this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If deputies wrote the script, the movie would end with Miko
serving a long prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Miko is charged with drawing a firearm in the presence of a
police officer, attempted robbery, assault with a firearm, and two
charges of being a felon or addict in possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded not guilty to all counts during his arraignment on
Tuesday, said Charles Klum, head deputy of the Lancaster office of
the Los Angeles public defender.
</P>
<P>
   Now at the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, Miko reflected
on his last few weeks on the run from authorities. Freed from his
leg and waist chains, the father of three said a longtime drug
addiction has gotten him in trouble since he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a clean, sober life with my future wife. That's all I
want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When police finally caught Miko, he was covered in manure in a
horse trailer, where he had gone to hide -- and sleep. He said he
had been on a crystal methamphetamine binge and hadn't slept more
than four days during his month on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was a dead man. They caught me because I fell
asleep underneath the saddle blanket. I just remember getting woken
up to the dog chewing on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miko is a plasterer by trade and acknowledges he has always been
hard-working but could not stay out of trouble since age 11, when
he got hooked on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just your average, rotten kid -- always in trouble. I've
been begging for help for years,'' he said from jail. ``Could you
help me?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kress, a longtime childhood friend to Miko, said he was
not surprised by his buddy's sly tactics in evading police.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong-willed individual. He was not ready to go to
jail,'' Kress said while standing in line at the jail to visit his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Kress said, Miko was fascinated with Bruce Lee
movies and attended karate classes off Ventura Boulevard in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Miko's sister, Beverly Ewing, 40, said it was not in any
school that he learned his wily escapes, but rather in prison,
where he spent six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made him out to be this major martial artist. He was
educated in jail. He is a total product of the jail system,'' she
said, adding she could not recall why he was jailed previously.
</P>
<P>
   His latest trouble started last month when a deputy responding
to a domestic disturbance call said he ran into Miko carrying a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   But Miko fumbled and dropped the gun. The deputy ran for cover
as Miko picked up the gun and fled, with his girlfriend driving.
</P>
<P>
   Miko argued he dropped a cellular phone, not a gun. But police
said they found a round of ammunition that fell from the gun at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The next time authorities heard of Miko was on April 1, when
they say he kidnapped his girlfriend and stabbed her in the
buttocks, Dvorak said.
</P>
<P>
   Miko denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities next saw Miko at Northridge Hospital Medical Center,
but again he escaped, leading them on a wild chase.
</P>
<P>
   He drove a stolen truck onto railroad tracks, dumped it and fled
into an apartment. He stopped the elevator between floors, climbed
out and crawled three stories up the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   As police surrounded the building, he went into a vacant
apartment, where he cut off his long hair, kicked in a wall,
tunneled into the unit next door and set fire to the other
apartment to divert police.
</P>
<P>
   He then used air conditioners as steps to climb three floors to
the ground -- and to freedom, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lands on top of a car and gets away,'' Dvorak said.
</P>
<P>
   On the run, he then broke into a Northridge man's home, split
open the mattress and hid inside as police hunted for him
throughout the night, authorities said. The resident was not home
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, who asked not to be identified for fear for his
safety, said he came home to find his clothing, passport and money
missing -- and a strange man's boots in his dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took every house key, everything you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim said Miko made himself at home once the police backed
off on the search. He used his toothbrush and his razor to finish
shaving his head, drank water and ate pizza.
</P>
<P>
   His sister can only hope for the best now, although she worries
about him giving in to the bad influence of prison. ``Everyone's
got to be responsible for their own actions,'' she said. ``But he
didn't learn all of this from watching `Bambi.' '' &QL;

<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ It was enough to make Michael Miller of
Northridge shake his purple and gold Afro wig in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the Lakers, starting their first postseason at Staples
Center with a good chance to win it all, and Sunday's crowd looked
as if they came fresh from a tasteful brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Were Miller, 27, and his friends the only face painters? Where
was the rabid passion, the abandon, the men and women with ``L.A.''
scrawled across their body parts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a town full of vanity,'' Miller sighed, his richly
hued face barely visible beneath the hair. ``They're here for
paparazzi purposes. They're here to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Miller decried the crowd's restraint, however,
than another batch of pigment-enhanced fans poured off the
escalator. ``Get in here!'' Miller yelled. ``Go Lakes!''
</P>
<P>
   They were slow to arrive and slow to warm up, but many Lakers
fans at Sunday's playoff opener did their best to dispel the
Staples Center crowd's lackluster rep. They screamed to drown out
the cell phone conversations going on in the good seats below. They
hurled abuse at the opposing players during free throws.
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of the game, they had an audience known more for
preening than for enthusiasm roaring at the team's blowout 117-107
win over the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Lakers fans to step up,'' said Junior Villela, 25,
of Torrance. ``We gotta represent for L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobilizing the crowd took work. Awkward silences dominated the
game's first half, with many in the audience shutting up completely
between Lakers baskets. Whole blocks of seats remained empty at the
start of play.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was willing to show fashionably late.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour before the game, Lawrence Balag stood munching
a burrito with his wife and son as the parking lot slowly filled
with Suburbans. They were the only tailgaters in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Raiders fan by heart, so I'm used to tailgate parties,''
said Balag, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Like most at the game, he expected a win. The 1999-2000 Lakers
were strong and deep, and only the San Antonio Spurs, last year's
champion, could possibly derail them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get past San Antonio, they'll win it all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Garay of North Hills and his family stood ready in line
for the center's doors to open at 1:30 p.m. Decked in yellow, they
were bound for the center's nosebleed seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down there's the millionaires,'' said Garay, 21. ``They don't
even watch the game. They just talk and talk and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their distance from the actual game -- so high up even
Shaq looked small -- Garay vowed to make noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you'll hear me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cheers that eventually swept the crowd all seemed to
emanate from the cheap seats. Ramon Andrade and ``Big Lou'' Ruiz of
Rosemead started early, waving a golden Lakers flag from the upper
balcony and trying to launch cheers while many fans were still
finding their seats.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it didn't work. No matter how loud Big Lou bellowed,
his chants hit the audience and disappeared like water into a
sponge. Decked in a Shaquille O'Neal jersey and a hat reading
``Nobody knows I'm a lesbian,'' he looked out of place in a sea of
tasteful sweaters and capris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get everyone into it,'' said Andrade, a season
ticket holder who takes complaints about the center's quiet crowd
very seriously. ``It's going to be loud. We're going to get this
crowd going.''
</P>
<P>
   It still didn't work. The audience clapped politely whenever a
Laker scored, then fell so silent that the basketball's bounce
could be heard in the top row.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get into it, man. They're going to in the second
half,'' Andrade said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't far off. With a few minutes left in the first half,
the Lakers started stretching out their lead, and the crowd
responded. The cheers continued between baskets. Cries of
``Defense!'' finally took on volume and strength.
</P>
<P>
   No one screamed louder than Villela and his crew from Torrance.
Eddie Lopez, 30, took the lead on chants, and the rest spread them
into the nearby sections. Such hard-core fans that several still
sported Raiders tattoos, it was the least they could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to pump up the Lakers fans,'' Villela said. ``When
was the last time we could win the playoffs? You've got to
represent.''

   VIETNAM-MEMORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Serving in Vietnam, we
bonded, we changed. And we returned home to the other Vietnam, the
domestic battlefield of hard-hats and peaceniks, the Vietnam that
one side proclaimed the frontline against godless communism, and
the other a symbol of all the greed and immorality of a perfidious
establishment. The protests waned, but we still avoided talking
about the war. Many people viewed veterans of the war with
condescension. But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that
developed in the 1980s was far different from any grunt, or any
Vietnam I knew. By Serge Schmemann. (Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SNOBS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds
for social ostracism. Cell phones are required for professionals
from a certain class background, and it helps to flaunt a personal
digital assistant _ preferably one with data-beaming capabilities.
``Early adopters'' have always been a bit obnoxious. From the first
proud few to replace slide rules with calculators to CB radio
hobbyists to the audiophiles who paid thousands of dollars for the
first CD players, gadget freaks have often seemed to exist in a
jargon-filled matrix of their own, oblivious to the mundanities of
civil society. By Amy Harmon. (Moved in the `a' category)

<P>
   HEALTHCARE-PERKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have new
expectations from their health care system. They want the latest in
medical technology, just as they hunger for the latest sports
utility vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they also seek
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also want medicine to improve their looks, often in an environment
where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can all be done
under one roof. And the health care industry is responding to
consumer demand. It is offering more aesthetic procedures and
complementary services. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Elian Gonzalez case illustrates
that courts run on adult time while children suffer the
consequences. For many American children, their destinies remain
uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as their custody and
child welfare cases wind through the courts. Experts see tension
between two competing notions of time: the deliberate, adult pace
of the law, in which a day, or a week or a month may be seen as not
significant, and the the highly compressed time of child
development, in which bonds can be made, or poisoned, in the same
space of time. By Somni Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Both sides in the gun control
debate assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped
the modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it. But in a new book due this fall, a historian
challenges what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun
ownership in the frontier era was far from universal. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   PIPEDREAM.COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this time of dizzying
volatility on Wall Street, no company's fortunes have seesawed
quite so dramatically as those of PipeDream.com, whose (imaginary)
initial public offering in January zoomed from an initial price of
$2 a share to 468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its
founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Proctor, 17, the
youngest dot-com billionaire on record. During the recent sell-off
in technology stocks, however, PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4. An
interview with Proctor. By Gary Krist.
</P>
<P>
   SATELLITE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nations were once able to
hide their armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy
civilians, while militaries could pry into most corners of the
globe from spy satellites, secure in the knowledge that they could
control who got to take a peek. No more. Taking pictures from space
is undergoing a revolution, and it is making some governments feel
naked. Private companies are launching increasingly sophisticated
reconnaissance satellites, and governments are finding it harder to
restrict what snapshots they distribute to anyone willing to pay
the price. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-PHOTO-REVIEW (Undated) _ It became the most remembered
photograph of the fall of Saigon, and most people believed that it
showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the U.S.
embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture caption
usually says. But as with much about the Vietnam War, the caption
is wrong. The building is a nearby apartment complex. The people
fleeing are Vietnamese. The last flight out of Saigon was hours
away. In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-POLITICS (Washington) _ Iran is in the midst of a brutal,
open-ended political war being waged on several fronts - the
courts, the press, television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the
bazaar, the streets. The current round of fighting heated up after
reformists candidates swept to victory in the first round of
parliamentary elections in February. And the stakes are high -
nothing less than the nature of the Islamic Republic itself. By
Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-THIRDWORLD-REVIEW (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ The changes
created by the Internet in rich industrialized nations are well
known, affecting everything from the way people date to the way
they work. But less is known about impact on communities with
limited contact with the rest of the world. As examples of such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: The way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the
outside world is likely to be altered forever. By Simon Romero.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-CONTRASTS-REVIEW (London) A correspondent describes the
contrasts he observed after leaving the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland, and then heading to Africa: rubbing shoulders with
dot-com billionaires, oil industry barons and sleek investment
bankers, in an Alpine village set among among the pristine snow
fields, and then, on the Angola-Zambia border, mingling with the
poorest of the poor, where the meaning of the word economy had been
distilled to the barefoot essentials of survival. By Alan Cowell.

   VIETNAM-MEMORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Serving in Vietnam, we
bonded, we changed. And we returned home to the other Vietnam, the
domestic battlefield of hard-hats and peaceniks, the Vietnam that
one side proclaimed the frontline against godless communism, and
the other a symbol of all the greed and immorality of a perfidious
establishment. The protests waned, but we still avoided talking
about the war. Many people viewed veterans of the war with
condescension. But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that
developed in the 1980s was far different from any grunt, or any
Vietnam I knew. By Serge Schmemann. (Moved in the `i' category)

(Repeating)  (For release Sunday, April 30)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE WORLD: Stories &LR;  By David Gates.
Vintage Contemporaries, $12. These mordant tales are filled with
aging male hipsters whose ironic detachment and heightened
self-awareness leave them unable to connect with the real world.
``Gates can be very funny,'' Gerald Marzorati wrote in The New York
Times Book Review last year, but mostly he ``is concerned with
creating characters you haven't met in fiction before, getting just
right the words they use to disengagedly engage their women and
their friends and even their inner selves.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE IMMACULATE INVASION &LR;  By Bob Shacochis. Penguin, $14.95. A
novelist turns journalist in this account of the 1994 American
intervention that returned Haiti's first democratically elected
leader to power. The mission is depicted as a hopelessly absurd
affair in which the Americans' main objective was (despite their
good intentions) not to stop brutality but to protect themselves.
``Shacochis proves that he is a writer of rare grace and
intuition,'' Amy Wilentz wrote last year. He ``never stumbles and
never turns a blind eye.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE COCKS FIGHT: Dominicans, Haitians, and the Struggle for
Hispaniola &LR; , by Michele Wucker (Hill &AMP; Wang, $14), explores the
complex cultural divide between the two nations that share
Hispaniola _ French-speaking Haiti and the Spanish-speaking
Dominican Republic _ and reveals how racism and migration have
shaped their history. This account ``weaves together five centuries
of tragic conflict with a subtle picture of the island today,''
Patrick Markee wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOY ON THE GREEN BICYCLE: A Memoir &LR;  By Margaret Diehl.
Soho, $12. The author describes how her privileged childhood was
shattered by the death of her older brother and her father's
suicide soon after, and how she retreated into an ultimately
destructive fantasy world. ``Diehl's descriptions of both the
terrible events in her family and the golden stuff of her own
interiority are so entrancing that one realizes too late ... that
fairyland can be a gravityless hell,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BROKE HEART BLUES &LR;  By Joyce Carol Oates. Plume, $13.95. The
author's 29th novel, which revolves around a Brando-like heartthrob
who disappears mysteriously after captivating the student
population of a small town, is about the mythologizing of
adolescence by unhappy adults. The book ``displays great
inventiveness and a justified belief in its relevance to our own
emotional lives,'' D.T. Max wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEDUCTIVE JOURNEY: American Tourists in France From Jefferson
to the Jazz Age &LR;  By Harvey Levenstein. University of Chicago, $17.
A history professor chronicles the changing attitudes of American
travelers toward France, blending frank and amusing comments from
tourists' diaries with new insights into the cultural history of
going abroad. ``The result is a thoroughly readable and highly
likable book,'' Deirdre Bair wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LADIES' MAN &LR;  By Elinor Lipman. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
Harvey Nash is a womanizer in his 50s who reappears in Boston one
day to shake up the well-ordered life of the woman he jilted at the
altar 30 years earlier. ``I loved every page of this very funny,
insightful, sophisticated yet good-natured'' novel, Anita Gates
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHAKESPEARE: A Life &LR;  By Park Honan. Oxford University, $17.95.
More is known about Shakespeare's life than most people realize,
and Park Honan does an ``admirable job of collecting, synthesizing
and judging'' the data, Lois Potter wrote in 1999. ``His book _
comprehensive, up-to-date and agreeably written _ is exactly what
it was meant to be: a definitive (for the time being) life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LATE MR. SHAKESPEARE &LR; , by Robert Nye (Penguin, $13.95), is
a sprightly tale whose fictional narrator, an actor named
Pickleherring, crams his version of his mentor's life with red
herrings, gossip, trivia and true-to-life details. ``Nye's novel
has more of the real Shakespeare in it than the souffle-light
`Shakespeare in Love,'`` Allen Lincoln wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COWBOY WAY: Seasons of a Montana Ranch &LR;  By David McCumber.
Bard/Avon, $14. The author, a journalist who signed on for a year
as a hand on a 6,000-acre ranch, describes the hardscrabble culture
of the modern cowboy. ``With uncluttered prose and a laid-back
sense of humor, he underscores the nobility in hard work, personal
responsibility and love of the land,'' one critic wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRAVELLING HORNPLAYER &LR;  By Barbara Trapido. Penguin, $12.95.
This novel tracks the intersecting lives of two sisters, one of
whom dies in a traffic accident, and a British novelist and his
dyslexic daughter. ``Trapido keeps us happily engaged in the lives
of her clever, warmhearted characters,'' Edward Hower wrote in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST KABBALIST OF LISBON &LR;  By Richard Zimler. Overlook,
$14.95. In this novel, a young follower of the mystical Jewish
tradition tries to track down his uncle's killer in 16th-century
Lisbon. In 1998 the reviewer Erik Burns admired the ``many-layered
narrative, in which a suitably complex cast of characters plays a
dangerous game with fate.''

(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our memory of Vietnam, like any other, is shaped in part by what
we allow ourselves to say, and that has changed over the years, as
have my generation and the country that sent many of us to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   When I went there in 1969, and when I returned home a year and
12 days later, Vietnam was a subject my friends and I avoided
talking about. For those who had not gone, there was something
embarrassing about talking to someone who had, after all the
energies they had all expended on damning the war and anyone who
was part of it, and on eluding the draft. And for my part, I had no
interest in defending a war that all the guys in my unit hated just
as much, only in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   We were not grunts, the sweat-soaked kids in jungle fatigues so
familiar now from movies and that bronze sculpture of three
servicemen next to the Vietnam memorial in Washington. Drafted out
of graduate school, I was trained in artillery fire direction
control, assigned to the 23rd Artillery Group in II Field Force,
and, in the enigmatic wisdom of the Army, set to work as a
personnel clerk, first in Long Binh, the huge base not far from
Saigon, then in Phu Loi, on the highway to Cambodia. Many of the
guys in the headquarters were also older, drafted from college and
graduate school, but we counted days like everybody else, wore
peace symbols, pulled guard duty and proclaimed that 'Nam was ``No.
10'' _ bad.
</P>
<P>
   But our 'Nam was not the Vietnam back home: These were entirely
different concepts that shared only the name of a lovely and badly
scarred country in Southeast Asia, whose delicate-looking people,
history and customs very few of us _ ``in country'' or ``in the
world'' _ ever bothered to learn about. Over there we lived in a
world of our own, a sweaty, sometimes dangerous place where we wore
loose jungle fatigues, slept in hootches, wrote long letters home,
longed for R&AMP;R and counted days to DEROS (``date of estimated
return from overseas'') and the Freedom Bird that would take us
home. It was a place with a GI culture and language all its own,
where grunts humped the paddies to waste Charlie or get blown away,
where angry brothers fragged white officers, where Vietnamese
squatting by the roadside sold No. 1 (best) grass in deftly
resealed Marlboro packs and there were always several choppers
slapping through the rancid black plumes from burning latrine cans.
</P>
<P>
   We were young, we bonded, we changed. And we returned home to
the other Vietnam, the domestic battlefield of hard-hats and
peaceniks, the Vietnam that one side proclaimed the front line
against godless communism, and the other a symbol of all the greed
and immorality of a perfidious Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I came back, the protests waned, but we still avoided
talking about the war. Some veterans felt alienated among peers
who, they felt, looked on them with condescension, as sad guys who
had been fooled into fighting an immoral war. Most of us simply
didn't know what to say, both those who had been there or those who
had not, especially after the Americans abandoned Vietnam in that
excruciating display of shame, panic and betrayal. There was the
beginning of a literature, most notably Michael Herr's brilliant
``Dispatches,'' David Rabe's off-Broadway staging of ``The Basic
Training of Pavlo Hummel,'' Ronald Glasser's ``365 Days.'' But they
were glimpses of 'Nam, not a reckoning. That began in earnest only
with the Vietnam memorial in 1982, possibly the most honest shrine
ever raised to the fallen soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that developed in the
1980s was far different from any Vietnam, or any grunt, I had
known. Movies like ``Apocalypse Now,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' or
``Platoon'' created a swampy, fiery hell peopled by psychopaths
(``I love the smell of napalm in the morning''). They complemented
emerging images in the media of the ``Vietnam vet'' as a troubled
and neglected victim _ a scraggly and deranged outcast with a
rumpled boony hat, a legless victim converted to pacifism, a
returning POW scarred by unspeakable horrors. There were all these,
to be sure, and others: For some veterans, the emotional conflict
between the abiding loyalties of shared danger and the shame of a
failed and unpopular war coalesced into an impassioned crusade to
account for all missing GIs. For military officers, Vietnam became
a nightmarish memory of body bags, humiliation and division, until
any mission that carried even the remotest hint of ``another
Vietnam'' encountered instinctive resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the conflicting and bizarre images, at least we
could talk about it now. Writers like Tim O'Brien (``The Things
They Carried''), Neil Sheehan (``A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul
Vann and America in Vietnam'') and many others began to look more
deeply into the war and the men who made and fought it. We also
began to talk about it among ourselves and with our children, for
whom the '60s and Vietnam already had the pallor of history and
myth. The recriminations could still surface, but as we grew older
we could look on old passions with forbearance, even nostalgia.
With time, the Vietnam vet became a respectable, even slightly
romantic figure, and politicians like Sens. John F. Kerry, Bob
Kerrey and John McCain, who had served in Vietnam, acquired a moral
edge over those, like Bill Clinton, who had not.

 &UR; UNDATED: had not. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In moments of honesty, we began admitting to one another that
our actions all those years ago were not always as noble as we
liked to think they were.
</P>
<P>
   At the 25th reunion of my class at Harvard in 1992, a panel
discussion titled ``The Choices We Made,'' turned into a stunning
exercise in brutal candor, almost confession. Hundreds of us sat
spellbound hour after hour as one classmate after another explored
why he or she had opposed the war, or participated in it. Only
after the custodians threatened to turn off the lights and lock us
in did the meeting break up. One man acknowledged, to my silent
empathy, that he went only because he would never be able to face
his father if he didn't. My family were immigrants, I might have
added, and my father would have taken my dodging the draft as rank
ingratitude. The speaker tried to tell about a friend who was blown
away before his eyes, but could not, leaving us all in a long and
terrible silence. A woman then acknowledged that she became active
against the war also, and only, out of deference to her parents.
Then: ``Actually, they were Communist Party members.'' Then,
quietly, ``So was I.'' Another classmate told of never building a
life after years of protests and jails, and of finally landing work
as a train conductor. When one former member of the Students for a
Democratic Society _ the radical SDS _ launched into an aggressive
recital of old charges, he was universally jeered into silence. We
had tacitly agreed that day that only conscience could judge the
choices we had made.
</P>
<P>
   The old controversies still surface sometimes. But by and large,
the war is fading from the public consciousness. There is no
communist threat any more, and a wholly new Army has been built, in
which only a handful of senior officers served in Vietnam. In the
rare movie that uses Vietnam, like ``Rules of Engagement,'` the war
is little more than a handy cliche. For today's children, I
sometimes think with amazement, Vietnam is almost as remote as
World War I was for us _ only lacking the glow that national memory
reserves for victories.

peaceniks, the Vietnam that one side proclaimed the front line
against godless communism, and the other a symbol of all the greed
and immorality of a perfidious Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I came back, the protests waned, but we still avoided
talking about the war. Some veterans felt alienated among peers
who, they felt, looked on them with condescension, as sad guys who
had been fooled into fighting an immoral war. Most of us simply
didn't know what to say, both those who had been there or those who
had not, especially after the Americans abandoned Vietnam in that
excruciating display of shame, panic and betrayal. There was the
beginning of a literature, most notably Michael Herr's brilliant
``Dispatches,'' David Rabe's off-Broadway staging of ``The Basic
Training of Pavlo Hummel,'' Ronald Glasser's ``365 Days.'' But they
were glimpses of 'Nam, not a reckoning. That began in earnest only
with the Vietnam memorial in 1982, possibly the most honest shrine
ever raised to the fallen soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that developed in the
1980s was far different from any Vietnam, or any grunt, I had
known. Movies like ``Apocalypse Now,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' or
``Platoon'' created a swampy, fiery hell peopled by psychopaths
(``I love the smell of napalm in the morning''). They complemented
emerging images in the media of the ``Vietnam vet'' as a troubled
and neglected victim _ a scraggly and deranged outcast with a
rumpled boony hat, a legless victim converted to pacifism, a
returning POW scarred by unspeakable horrors. There were all these,
to be sure, and others: For some veterans, the emotional conflict
between the abiding loyalties of shared danger and the shame of a
failed and unpopular war coalesced into an impassioned crusade to
account for all missing GIs. For military officers, Vietnam became
a nightmarish memory of body bags, humiliation and division, until
any mission that carried even the remotest hint of ``another
Vietnam'' encountered instinctive resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the conflicting and bizarre images, at least we
could talk about it now. Writers like Tim O'Brien (``The Things
They Carried''), Neil Sheehan (``A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul
Vann and America in Vietnam'') and many others began to look more
deeply into the war and the men who made and fought it. We also
began to talk about it among ourselves and with our children, for
whom the '60s and Vietnam already had the pallor of history and
myth. The recriminations could still surface, but as we grew older
we could look on old passions with forbearance, even nostalgia.
With time, the Vietnam vet became a respectable, even slightly
romantic figure, and politicians like Sens. John F. Kerry, Bob
Kerrey and John McCain, who had served in Vietnam, acquired a moral
edge over those, like Bill Clinton, who had not.

 &UR; UNDATED: had not. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In moments of honesty, we began admitting to one another that
our actions all those years ago were not always as noble as we
liked to think they were.
</P>
<P>
   At the 25th reunion of my class at Harvard in 1992, a panel
discussion titled ``The Choices We Made,'' turned into a stunning
exercise in brutal candor, almost confession. Hundreds of us sat
spellbound hour after hour as one classmate after another explored
why he or she had opposed the war, or participated in it. Only
after the custodians threatened to turn off the lights and lock us
in did the meeting break up. One man acknowledged, to my silent
empathy, that he went only because he would never be able to face
his father if he didn't. My family were immigrants, I might have
added, and my father would have taken my dodging the draft as rank
ingratitude. The speaker tried to tell about a friend who was blown
away before his eyes, but could not, leaving us all in a long and
terrible silence. A woman then acknowledged that she became active
against the war also, and only, out of deference to her parents.
Then: ``Actually, they were Communist Party members.'' Then,
quietly, ``So was I.'' Another classmate told of never building a
life after years of protests and jails, and of finally landing work
as a train conductor. When one former member of the Students for a
Democratic Society _ the radical SDS _ launched into an aggressive
recital of old charges, he was universally jeered into silence. We
had tacitly agreed that day that only conscience could judge the
choices we had made.
</P>
<P>
   The old controversies still surface sometimes. But by and large,
the war is fading from the public consciousness. There is no
communist threat any more, and a wholly new Army has been built, in
which only a handful of senior officers served in Vietnam. In the
rare movie that uses Vietnam, like ``Rules of Engagement,'` the war
is little more than a handy cliche. For today's children, I
sometimes think with amazement, Vietnam is almost as remote as
World War I was for us _ only lacking the glow that national memory
reserves for victories.

GETTING IT WRONG IN A PHOTO CAPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD with KARI HASKELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   It became the most remembered photograph of the fall of Saigon,
capturing the last chaotic days of the Vietnam War, and most people
believed that it showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof
of the U.S. Embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture
caption usually says.
</P>
<P>
   But as with much about the Vietnam War, the caption is wrong.
The building is an apartment complex. The people fleeing are
Vietnamese. The last helicopter left about 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. Americans, whether
conservative or liberal, often imposed their own ideas on that
troubling war, and that seems to be what happened with the picture,
said Hubert Van Es, a United Press International photographer who
took it 25 years ago, on April 29, 1975, from the roof of a hotel
half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the correct caption on it,'' said Van Es, who now lives
in Hong Kong, ``but people back in the United States just took it
for granted that it must be the embassy, because that was where
they believed the evacuation took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture was of an apartment building for the employees of
the U.S. Agency for International Development, its top floor
reserved for the CIA's deputy chief of station. The address was 22
Gia Long St., about a half mile from the embassy. Fox Butterfield
lived around the corner as one of the last two correspondents of
The New York Times remaining in Vietnam, and he left later that
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days, as the embassy hastily prepared for the last
stage of evacuation, 22 Gia Long was chosen as one of about a dozen
possible gathering places for Americans. The secret signal for the
start of the evacuation was a radio broadcast saying the
temperature in Saigon was ``105 degrees and rising,'' followed by
the first 30 seconds of ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham A. Martin, had
delayed the final evacuation in the vain hope that President Gerald
Ford and Congress would rescue the collapsing South Vietnamese
army. Martin assumed that the U.S. Air Force could use Ton Son Nhut
air base to lift out the last few thousand Americans. But the
rapidly advancing North Vietnamese army wrecked that idea, shelling
the base on the morning of April 29 and shooting down some South
Vietnamese air force planes trying to take off, their wreckage
littering the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA station chief, Thomas Polgar, had a problem. The night
before, he had telephoned a group of senior South Vietnamese
politicians, generals and police officers who had helped the
agency, telling them to gather at his house with their families for
evacuation. Among them was Tran Van Don, deputy prime minister and
defense minister, and a general who was chief of military
communications intelligence. But by late morning, the area was no
longer secure, recalled Polgar, who is now 78.
</P>
<P>
   Then Polgar had an inspiration. The elevator shaft on the roof
of the apartment building at 22 Gia Long St. might support a
landing in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Polgar brought in a CIA employee, O.B. Harnage, to direct the
Vietnamese officials and their families to Gia Long Street and have
them flown out by Air America, an airline owned by the CIA for its
operations in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   When Harnage landed on the roof in a silver Huey helicopter,
some people were panicking. Some junior officers and policemen had
been allowed in on condition that they use their weapons to keep a
crowd milling in the street outside from storming the building.
</P>
<P>
   Stationing himself next to a ladder leading onto the roof,
Harnage tried to help the Vietnamese families up. But the first man
who appeared, Harnage recalled, was a Korean who was hysterical and
Harnage punched him out of the way to maintain order. The Huey, the
workhorse of the American effort in Vietnam, normally carried about
eight passengers, but Harnage jammed in as many as 15 Vietnamese,
and jumped on the helicopter's skid, standing in the open doorway
as it flew to Tan Son Nhut on the edge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Harnage, who was later awarded a CIA medal, made four or five of
these flights to the air base, where larger Navy or Air Force
helicopters ferried the families to ships waiting in the South
China Sea. At a time when America abandoned many Vietnamese allies
and South Vietnam's military and political leaders abandoned their
own country, it was a heroic act.
</P>
<P>
   But one mystery remains. Is it indeed Harnage in the photograph?
He believes it is. The picture, which he saw a week later in a
Manila, Philippines, newspaper, shows a man in a white shirt and
dark pants, which Harnage was wearing that day. His wife also saw
the photograph. ``She said she recognized me from my backside,''
said Harnage, who is now 75. He recalled her saying she knew him
``because I was always leaving'' to go somewhere on another
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they were the ones in the picture. Polgar said he's
unsure who it is. ``But if Harnage says he is the man in that
picture, I'll take his word for it,'' he said.

<P>
   McCain Flies a Flag of Contrition
</P>
<P>
   Now it can be told: Sen. John McCain always thought the
Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina Statehouse
should come down.
</P>
<P>
   He had hemmed and hawed about it during the South Carolina
primary, refusing to go out on a limb any further than his
Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who would say only
that the flag's fate should remain in the hands of the people of
South Carolina. But at a luncheon Wednesday in Columbia, the
senator made his feelings plainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the
South Carolina primary,'' he said. ``I broke my promise to always
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's confession was seen by some as a betrayal. ``I'm
ashamed that he lied to the people of South Carolina,'' said Jake
Knotts, a state lawmaker and former McCain supporter. Yet the
revelation reminded others of McCain's enduring impact on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues even wondered if the former candidate wasn't
still running for something. On Comedy Central's ``Daily Show,''
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., speculated, in all seriousness, that
``McCain may be subconsciously running for vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   On the national political stage, the Confederate flag may be a
peripheral prop. But at least it is an issue on which Bush has
staked out a position different from that of Vice President Al
Gore, who has declared that the flag should go. Bush, after all,
has come out with a series of planks that might not be out of place
in the Democratic Party platform. His latest: a $1.7 billion
proposal to encourage developers to build and repair housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   That plan follows other Bush proposals to expand health care
services to the needy ($4.3 billion); give tax credits to
low-income families to buy health insurance ($41.6 billion) and
improve teacher training and childhood literacy ($7.9 billion).
</P>
<P>
   As Bush was offering new plans for spending money, Gore was
going to old friends to raise it. He appeared with President
Clinton at a Beverly Hills event that took in $2.8 million for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Solving a Royal Mystery
</P>
<P>
   Examining all that remained of the boy who died in France's
Temple prison in 1795 _ a dried heart _ scientists ended one of the
nation's most enduring historical debates. The boy, the scientists
said, was indeed Louis XVII, the 10-year-old uncrowned king of
France, and not an impostor placed there so the young dauphin could
escape into exile.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, historians have argued over whether the
son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette might have escaped from
prison after his parents were guillotined during the French
Revolution. The dispute spawned hundreds of pretenders to the
throne, one of whom was convincing enough to get the government of
Netherlands to bury him under a tombstone indicating that he was
the true heir to the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists comparing DNA from the boy's heart with DNA from
locks of Marie Antoinette's hair said there could be no mistake.
The boy, who had endured two years virtually alone in a prison cell
without windows, barely fed or attended to, was the queen's son.
When he died, he had come a long way from the whirl of lace, sweets
and doting servants depicted in his official portraits. He was
riddled with disease, encrusted with sores and bloated with tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists in human genetics who performed the tests,
Jean-Jacques Cassiman of the University of Louvain in Belgium and
Bernd Brinkmann of the University of Muenster in Germany, said the
DNA fragments they had been able to obtain from the heart were not
perfect, but enough for a conclusive match.
</P>
<P>
   The heart survived through a fluke. One of the doctors
performing the autopsy on the boy stole the heart as a souvenir,
wrapping it in a handkerchief and stuffing it in his pocket.
Eventually, it was returned to the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The Bourbon family is now asking for a proper burial for the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   World Trade Officials Vow Effort to Fight Aids
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 million poor people in developing nations are infected
with the AIDS virus, and the number is rising so quickly that the
disease has become a leading impediment to economic development in
Africa and South Asia. That's the way the World Bank sees it. After
a spring strategy session in Washington, world finance ministers
endorsed a World Bank plan to spend ``unlimited money'' to finance
programs to prevent the spread of AIDS and treat its victims in
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the plan was announced while thousands of
protesters tried to block access to the meetings, claiming that the
bank has done too little to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Report on Theft From Jews
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of Jewish assets in wartime France was so extensive
that all Jews, whether the richest bankers or the poorest tailors,
were touched by it. This was among the conclusions reached by the
Matteoli Commission, which began the first major study on the
subject three years ago. The study found that the theft of assets
was far greater than previously assumed. But it also found that
efforts to return the property or to reimburse Jews were extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bad News on Fiber
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, many doctors and most of the public have
believed that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer. But now two
studies involving thousands of people randomly assigned to eat
either high-fiber diets or their normal diets failed to find that
the high-fiber diets protected against polyps, which are tiny lumps
in the colon that precede many colon cancers.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts say there is still hope for the high-fiber
hypothesis _ maybe the diet needs to be started earlier or maybe it
only acts after cancers are well established _ others say it is
time to put the idea to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Gay Union Bill
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's legislature reached the verge of creating the closest
thing in America to gay marriage _ but left the final step until
this week, and no one is saying its over until its over. The state
Senate, in a 19-11 vote, passed a bill creating marriage-like civil
unions, but its bill was slightly different from the one passed
last month in the House. That means the House takes up the question
again in a session Tuesday. Gov. Howard Dean has said he will sign
the bill.

   New Drug for `Superbugs'
</P>
<P>
   Amid increasing concern over ``superbugs'' that can outsmart
even the most powerful germ-fighting medicines, the Food and Drug
Administration approved a new antibiotic, Zyvox, that doctors say
could save thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, manufactured by Pharmacia of Peapack, N.J., is the
first in an entirely new family of antibiotics, and is effective
against germs that can cause lethal bloodstream infections and
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Weapon Sales to Taiwan
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration deferred the sale of four Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan that were intended to counter the Chinese
build-up of ballistic missiles. The White House also decided to
hold back on the sale of submarines and P-3 Orion anti-submarine
aircraft. Instead, the Taiwanese will buy three kinds of updated
missiles and were promised a naval study to find ways of improving
their outmoded navy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes this middle course will mollify
Beijing, which has said the sale of the destroyers would be
unacceptable, and at the same time meet some of the defense needs
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Bid to Condemn China Fails
</P>
<P>
   The State Department failed in its intense lobbying campaign to
persuade the U.N. Human Rights Commission to consider a U.S.
resolution criticizing China for its human rights record. The
53-member commission voted not to consider the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a special trip to
Geneva last month to address the commission. But the Chinese
government also lobbied hard, and prevailed in part because
countries friendly to the United States in South America and Asia
abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest in Web Attack
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old Montreal high-school student with the online
nickname Mafiaboy was arrested by Canadian law enforcement
officials for his role in a series of computer attacks on some of
the biggest Internet sites in February.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who was accused of attacking Cable News Network's
Web site, is the first to face charges stemming from the crippling
of Web sites of Yahoo, eBay and Etrade among others. The youth was
not charged in the other attacks, which hindered access to the
sites and exposed weaknesses in the emerging field of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A Heart of Stone
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists reported that they had found a dinosaur heart
the size of a grapefruit, encased in stone and fossilized.
Examining its internal structure, the scientists were surprised to
discover an advanced heart that was more like that of a bird or
mammal than any known reptile.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that at least some dinosaurs had higher
metabolisms than other reptiles and probably were warm-blooded, a
discovery that could profoundly change theories of dinosaur
physiology and their place in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   2 Death Penalty Rulings
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch what we do, not what we say,'' may have been the Supreme
Court's message in a pair of death penalty cases interpreting a new
federal law that placed strict limits on federal courts' ability to
hear appeals from state inmates. By a 5-4 vote, the court read the
1996 law to mean that federal judges must defer to state court
rulings that, even though wrong, are nonetheless not
``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, this standard would appear to eviscerate
federal court power to issue writs of habeas corpus. But the court
then went on to set aside the two death sentences, effectively
demonstrating that federal courts do retain authority and that the
justices expect them to use it.

   McCain Flies a Flag of Contrition
</P>
<P>
   Now it can be told: Sen. John McCain always thought the
Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina Statehouse
should come down.
</P>
<P>
   He had hemmed and hawd about it during the South Carolina
primary, refusing to go out on a limb any further than his
Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who would say only
that the flag's fate should remain in the hands of the people of
South Carolina. But at a luncheon Wednesday in Columbia, the
senator made his feelings plainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the
South Carolina primary,'' he said. ``I broke my promise to always
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's confession was seen by some as a betrayal. ``I'm
ashamed that he lied to the people of South Carolina,'' said Jake
Knotts, a state lawmaker and former McCain supporter. Yet the
revelation reminded others of McCain's enduring impact on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues even wondered if the former candidate wasn't
still running for something. On Comedy Central's ``Daily Show,''
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., speculated, in all seriousness, that
``McCain may be subconsciously running for vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   On the national political stage, the Confederate flag may be a
peripheral prop. But at least it is an issue on which Bush has
staked out a position different from that of Vice President Al
Gore, who has declared that the flag should go. Bush, after all,
has come out with a series of planks that might not be out of place
in the Democratic Party platform. His latest: a $1.7 billion
proposal to encourage developers to build and repair housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   That plan follows other Bush proposals to expand health care
services to the needy ($4.3 billion); give tax credits to
low-income families to buy health insurance ($41.6 billion) and
improve teacher training and childhood literacy ($7.9 billion).
</P>
<P>
   As Bush was offering new plans for spending money, Gore was
going to old friends to raise it. He appeared with President
Clinton at a Beverly Hills event that took in $2.8 million for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Solving a Royal Mystery
</P>
<P>
   Examining all that remained of the boy who died in France's
Temple prison in 1795 _ a dried heart _ scientists ended one of the
nation's most enduring historical debates. The boy, the scientists
said, was indeed Louis XVII, the 10-year-old uncrowned king of
France, and not an impostor placed there so the young dauphin could
escape into exile.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, historians have argued over whether the
son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette might have escaped from
prison after his parents were guillotined during the French
Revolution. The dispute spawned hundreds of pretenders to the
throne, one of whom was convincing enough to get the government of
Netherlands to bury him under a tombstone indicating that he was
the true heir to the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists comparing DNA from the boy's heart with DNA from
locks of Marie Antoinette's hair said there could be no mistake.
The boy, who had endured two years virtually alone in a prison cell
without windows, barely fed or attended to, was the queen's son.
When he died, he had come a long way from the whirl of lace, sweets
and doting servants depicted in his official portraits. He was
riddled with disease, encrusted with sores and bloated with tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists in human genetics who performed the tests,
Jean-Jacques Cassiman of the University of Louvain in Belgium and
Bernd Brinkmann of the University of Muenster in Germany, said the
DNA fragments they had been able to obtain from the heart were not
perfect, but enough for a conclusive match.
</P>
<P>
   The heart survived through a fluke. One of the doctors
performing the autopsy on the boy stole the heart as a souvenir,
wrapping it in a handkerchief and stuffing it in his pocket.
Eventually, it was returned to the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The Bourbon family is now asking for a proper burial for the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   World Trade Officials Vow Effort to Fight Aids
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 million poor people in developing nations are infected
with the AIDS virus, and the number is rising so quickly that the
disease has become a leading impediment to economic development in
Africa and South Asia. That's the way the World Bank sees it. After
a spring strategy session in Washington, world finance ministers
endorsed a World Bank plan to spend ``unlimited money'' to finance
programs to prevent the spread of AIDS and treat its victims in
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the plan was announced while thousands of
protesters tried to block access to the meetings, claiming that the
bank has done too little to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Report on Theft From Jews
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of Jewish assets in wartime France was so extensive
that all Jews, whether the richest bankers or the poorest tailors,
were touched by it. This was among the conclusions reached by the
Matteoli Commission, which began the first major study on the
subject three years ago. The study found that the theft of assets
was far greater than previously assumed. But it also found that
efforts to return the property or to reimburse Jews were extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bad News on Fiber
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, many doctors and most of the public have
believed that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer. But now two
studies involving thousands of people randomly assigned to eat
either high-fiber diets or their normal diets failed to find that
the high-fiber diets protected against polyps, which are tiny lumps
in the colon that precede many colon cancers.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts say there is still hope for the high-fiber
hypothesis _ maybe the diet needs to be started earlier or maybe it
only acts after cancers are well established _ others say it is
time to put the idea to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Gay Union Bill
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's legislature reached the verge of creating the closest
thing in America to gay marriage _ but left the final step until
this week, and no one is saying its over until its over. The state
Senate, in a 19-11 vote, passed a bill creating marriage-like civil
unions, but its bill was slightly different from the one passed
last month in the House. That means the House takes up the question
again in a session Tuesday. Gov. Howard Dean has said he will sign
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-THISWEEK-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the bill. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Drug for `Superbugs'
</P>
<P>
   Amid increasing concern over ``superbugs'' that can outsmart
even the most powerful germ-fighting medicines, the Food and Drug
Administration approved a new antibiotic, Zyvox, that doctors say
could save thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, manufactured by Pharmacia of Peapack, N.J., is the
first in an entirely new family of antibiotics, and is effective
against germs that can cause lethal bloodstream infections and
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Weapon Sales to Taiwan
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration deferred the sale of four Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan that were intended to counter the Chinese
build-up of ballistic missiles. The White House also decided to
hold back on the sale of submarines and P-3 Orion anti-submarine
aircraft. Instead, the Taiwanese will buy three kinds of updated
missiles and were promised a naval study to find ways of improving
their outmoded navy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes this middle course will mollify
Beijing, which has said the sale of the destroyers would be
unacceptable, and at the same time meet some of the defense needs
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Bid to Condemn China Fails
</P>
<P>
   The State Department failed in its intense lobbying campaign to
persuade the U.N. Human Rights Commission to consider a U.S.
resolution criticizing China for its human rights record. The
53-member commission voted not to consider the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a special trip to
Geneva last month to address the commission. But the Chinese
government also lobbied hard, and prevailed in part because
countries friendly to the United States in South America and Asia
abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest in Web Attack
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old Montreal high-school student with the online
nickname Mafiaboy was arrested by Canadian law enforcement
officials for his role in a series of computer attacks on some of
the biggest Internet sites in February.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who was accused of attacking Cable News Network's
Web site, is the first to face charges stemming from the crippling
of Web sites of Yahoo, eBay and Etrade among others. The youth was
not charged in the other attacks, which hindered access to the
sites and exposed weaknesses in the emerging field of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A Heart of Stone
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists reported that they had found a dinosaur heart
the size of a grapefruit, encased in stone and fossilized.
Examining its internal structure, the scientists were surprised to
discover an advanced heart that was more like that of a bird or
mammal than any known reptile.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that at least some dinosaurs had higher
metabolisms than other reptiles and probably were warm-blooded, a
discovery that could profoundly change theories of dinosaur
physiology and their place in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   2 Death Penalty Rulings
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch what we do, not what we say,'' may have been the Supreme
Court's message in a pair of death penalty cases interpreting a new
federal law that placed strict limits on federal courts' ability to
hear appeals from state inmates. By a 5-4 vote, the court read the
1996 law to mean that federal judges must defer to state court
rulings that, even though wrong, are nonetheless not
``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, this standard would appear to eviscerate
federal court power to issue writs of habeas corpus. But the court
then went on to set aside the two death sentences, effectively
demonstrating that federal courts do retain authority and that the
justices expect them to use it.

WHAT CAN THE NEW ECONOMY DO FOR PLACES WITHOUT AN OLD ONE?

<P>
   LONDON _ In early February, on assignment to seek out diamond
smugglers, I traveled straight from the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, to a place in central Africa where the borders
of three nations _ Congo, Angola and Zambia _ fuse in a triangle of
poverty and strife. It was a trip in every sense of the word,
across the chasm separating the truly rich and the achingly poor.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid memories of that journey returned as I watched footage of
last weekend's demonstrations in Washington against the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank _ a rich-vs.-rich
argument over the rich-poor divide, between protesters from the
wealthiest nation on Earth and well-heeled officials over the
destiny of the world's poor, who were not, of course, present.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, I was rubbing shoulders with dot-com billionaires,
oil industry barons and sleek investment bankers, in an Alpine
village set among the pristine snow fields. The elect of the World
Economic Forum seemed almost to glow in contentment, suffused by
the huge prosperity of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The next minute, on the Angola-Zambia border, I found myself
among the poorest of the poor, in a setting where the meaning of
the word economy had been distilled to the essentials of survival.
</P>
<P>
   In Davos, the talk had been of a global economic revolution,
with technology and knowledge as its standard-bearers. In Zambia,
north of a town called Mwinilunga, the talk was of whether the few
dollars in school fees levied by the state would be better used
buying food for the family.
</P>
<P>
   I had lived in Zambia in the mid-1970s, at the height of the war
between nationalist guerrillas from Zimbabwe and what was then the
white minority regime in Rhodesia. Hardship was visible then, too,
in the endless lines of women with babies strapped to their backs,
patiently waiting for corn or salt or sugar. But Zambians were told
that sacrifice was necessary, the price the nation paid for serving
as a base for the guerrillas in their struggle for majority rule.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century later, the appeals to a higher cause were
gone. Not globalization, but economic regionalization had arrived
with the ending of apartheid in South Africa. The beneficiaries
were a small urban elite, who carried cell phones and shopped at
stores transplanted from the malls of Johannesburg and Cape Town.
Anglo American Corp., the huge mining transnational based in
Johannesburg and London, was negotiating to buy back at fire-sale
prices the same copper mines it had lost to nationalization at
Zambia's independence from Britain in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the gleaming Shoprite supermarkets and the Steers
restaurants, in the urban shanties or in the countryside, was the
rest of the nation. The economy, victimized by years of
mismanagement and burdened by debt, was paralyzed, dependent on the
copper mines that earned badly-needed hard currency for state
coffers. The mines lost $150 million a year for the operators.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1970s, each Zambian's share of the national
wealth was tallied by the World Bank at a lowly $630; by the late
1990s it had fallen to $380. The currency, the Kwacha, had fallen
to something like one two-thousandth of its value in the 1970s, and
85 percent of the 8.2 million population lived on less than $1 a
day. AIDS infected 1.6 million people _ 20 percent of the
population _ killing the adults and creating a lost generation:
More than half the population is now under the age of 15, children
living in extended families with a dwindling number of wage
earners.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, of course, misery is just a
fact, rarely dramatic enough to draw the bright lights of a
visiting TV crew. In Zambia, for example, the economy had stagnated
long before globalization simply passed it by. Far to the northwest
of Lusaka, the Zambian capital, children of grade-school age tilled
dry fields instead of attending class. In the lee of the copper
mine dumps, which once symbolized Zambia's wealth, the highways
were so badly potholed that it was hard to see any asphalt surface.
Eleven-year-olds along the roadside sold stunted tomatoes at 15
cents a bunch from crudely woven baskets, earning pennies from
infrequent motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The global wealth imbalance between north and south is nothing
new. Indeed, in Africa, a pattern of dependency was established in
the colonial 19th century. Then as now, it was a leap in northern
technology _ the industrial revolution then, the Internet
revolution now _ that caused the gulf to widen. Then, as now, the
developed world set the rules. But if the new game of globalization
demands the free flow of money and trade, the question is whether
the parts of Africa I visited even have the chips to play.
</P>
<P>
   As the pace of change in the developed world _ embodied by the
Davos set _ has rocketed, buoyed by globalized trade and currency
flows, by soaring stock valuations and the stunning wealth created
by America's record growth, much of Africa has, at best, stood
still. And investment, the grease on which the global economy
glides, has largely dried up in the face of the continent's chronic
instability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-GLOBAL-CONTRASTS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; LONDON: chronic instability. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the south of Zambia spindly men, silhouetted against the
fierce light of the Zambezi valley, held up their wares for sale _
a tortoise in one hand, a chunk of crystalline rock the color of
amethyst in the other _ hoping to earn a few dollars. Others held
wads of Zambian currency, fluttering in their hands like small
birds, offering an illegal exchange for Zimbabwe dollars. Even
Zimbabwe, with its intractable economic woes, had more to offer
these desperate men than their own country.
</P>
<P>
   In Davos, according to one survey, 50 percent of business
leaders thought the Internet-driven New Economy would help close
the gap between rich and poor, and 38 percent thought it would not.
Those figures seemed surreal in places like Jimbe on the
Zambia-Angola border, 50 miles of dirt track from the nearest
telephone or electric power. When conversation in Switzerland
turned to ``the market,'' the word denoted global tides of
trillions of dollars flowing through the wired world. At Jimbe,
``the market'' meant a twice-weekly sale of scrawny chickens and
plump pineapples, which had been suspended since Angola launched a
bombing attack a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The question, in a place like Jimbe, is not so much whether
globalization would help the poor in these parts of the developing
world, as whether it extended here at all. Globalization, after
all, unites those with the training and resources to leap onto a
speeding technological bandwagon. But what of those condemned,
often by their own leaders' greed and incompetence as much as by
anything else, to the roadside?
</P>
<P>
   I T was literally on the roadside, north of Mwinilunga, for
instance, that I met Gerry Majoni, a 23-year-old student. He was
walking 40 miles to visit an uncle, from whom he hoped to borrow
about $8 in school fees and collect a new school uniform so that he
could fulfill his dream of an education. He was walking because
there were no buses and few bush taxis that he could afford. Even a
bicycle was a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate vicinity, the only connection to the developed
world's riches was a square thatched hut that had been painted with
a large, black Nike logo, an expression of impossible yearning for
a distant world _ in Davos, say, or Washington _ where $100
sneakers are the norm. Outside the hut stood a young woman holding
a baby. She wore no shoes at all.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The prospects seemed bright when the
Internet was recently introduced in a remote part of the
mountainous Cotopoxi region in Ecuador. Under the guidance of aid
workers, Quichua-speaking peasants planned to gather crop
information and sell their crafts over the Web.

   Dismayed, the women began to question how the men were treating

   The changes created by the Internet in rich industrialized
nations are well known, affecting everything from how people date
to how they work. But less is known about the impact on societies
with limited contact with the rest of the world. As such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: The way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the world
is likely to be altered forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadorean peasants were a case in point. ``The impact was
huge, but as it almost always is when the Internet makes it to such
a community, quite surprising,'' said Amalia Souza, a Brazilian
technology expert familiar with the project who has been an adviser
on programs that bring the Internet to poor communities in more
than 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago the women of the impoverished Wapishana
and Macushi tribes of Guyana were introduced to the Internet in a
project sponsored by Bill Humphries, who headed Guyana Telephone &AMP;
Telegragh at the time and was optimistic about technology's
money-making potential. The tribal power structures were shaken.
</P>
<P>
   The women began making money by marketing their intricate
hand-woven hammocks over the Web at $1,000 each. Feeling
threatened, the traditional regional leadership took control of the
organization, alienating and finally driving out the young woman
who ran the Web site. The weaving group fell into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events should be a case study for students of economics
and social work,'' wrote Indera Ramlall, who is Guyanese, in a
letter to a newspaper in the capital city of Georgetown. ``Economic
advancement is not just about technology and markets; more
fundamentally, it is about human relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Progress was the great hope of the Kennedy
administration in the early 1960s. Its aim was to thwart communism
with U.S. aid to Central America, bridging the gap between poor and
rich societies by building roads, factories and bridges. But aid to
El Salvador tore the social fabric, contributed to the oppression
of the poor, increased the holdings of the land-owning classes and
helped fuel civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For many people in developing countries these days, inspiration
is increasingly drawn from Bill Gates. Some of the outwardly
successful development projects, like the Grameen Bank in
Bangladesh, are trying to deal with the unforeseen impact on the
people they are trying to help. The Grameen Bank provides small
amounts of credit to more than two million poor people, mainly
women, enabling them to invest in raising livestock or
entrepreneurial ventures like buying rickshaws. But critics say the
focus on women, who are considered more reliable borrowers than
men, has caused considerable tension between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistributing income from men to women, sharing out the
misery of a shrinking cake, is not going to solve the people's
problems,'' said Para Teare, a London-based social scientist who
has studied such micro-lending programs, in a critique of the
Grameen Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as technology starts to blur the distinction between
industrialized countries and developing ones, social transition, if
not transformation, has become an issue in some of the world's most
remote regions. A recent issue of Cultural Survival, a magazine
that covers indigenous people and ethnic minorities, described
projects to bring the Web to communities as varied as the
reindeer-herding Sami of Scandinavia and northern Russian, the
aboriginal peoples of the Northwest Territories in Canada, the
ethnic minorities of Burma and native Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts represent a departure from the idea that
introducing new technologies to indigenous peoples will bring about
negative results. Such thinking, which dates back to Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, the 18th-century philosopher who lured Europe into
idealizing the simple lifestyle of the noble savage, appears to be
coming undone in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not realistic to think that as the world gets smaller
there should be enclaves untouched by Western technology,'' said
Robert Whelan, a writer on indigenous affairs at the Institute of
Economic Affairs in London. ``But it is realistic to realize that
traditional cultures can be very oppressive, especially for women
and wildlife, and that technology can help change this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the double-edged nature of technology's impact
is beneficial. For the Grameen Bank, credit is considered a weapon
for alleviating poverty and oppressive policies affecting women.
Yet some societies are better equipped than others to deal with an
onslaught of technological change. The American Amish, who are
known for their rigid views about technology, have banned the car
and computer but not the pocket calculator. A few Amish also use
the Internet, albeit quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, are not so sure about placing too much value on
technology's liberating potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you introduce the Internet to people whose most urgent
need is to get enough food to eat each day,'' said Karin
Delgadillo, a coordinator at ChasquiNet, which provides technology
assistance to remote communities in Quito, Ecuador, ``you see there
are other priorities that need to be taken care of first.''

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The prospects seemed bright when the
Internet was recently introduced in a remote part of the
mountainous Cotopoxi region in Ecuador. Under the guidance of aid
workers, Quichua-speaking peasants planned to gather crop
information and sell their crafts over the Web.

IRAN, MAKING HISTORY, IS TOO BUSY TO READ IT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the top of Iran's list of historical grievances
against the United States is the coup engineered by the CIA in 1953
to oust Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and reinstate Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi.
</P>
<P>
   During the revolution in 1979 and the seizure of the U.S.
Embassy that soon followed, militant Iranians often cited the coup
as proof of the United States' evil designs in Iran. Over the
years, the coup has fueled a conspiracy-theory view, widely held
among ordinary Iranians, that external powers, particularly the
United States, are behind every misfortune to befall Iran.
</P>
<P>
   So one might have expected that the surfacing of a secret
official CIA report that lays out the U.S. plot in all its detail
would have been the talk of Iranian political and journalistic
circles last week.
</P>
<P>
   Not so.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a moment for historical reflection in Iran. Iranians
are too busy fighting a brutal, open-ended political war in real
time to worry much about a short, if equally brutal, war 47 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today's war is waged on several fronts _ the courts, the press,
television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the bazaar, the streets.
And last week the fighting was particularly intense, having heated
up after reformist candidates swept to victory in the first round
of Parliamentary elections in February. The stakes are high _ the
nature of the Islamic Republic itself _ and the outcome is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The story mesmerizing the Iranian media last week was not out of
Washington but out of Berlin; its subject was the disruption by
opponents of the Islamic Republic of a conference there on Iranian
politics. The protesters heckled the speakers, all of them
reformers. One woman protested with a hip-rotating dance. Another
stripped to her bra and panties.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers expressed embarrassment and disgust. But the
protest was videotaped and much of the footage was aired on Iran's
state-controlled television, in an effort to discredit the reform
movement.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, 140 members of the outgoing Parliament
had signed a letter to the nation's leading conservative cleric,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, branding the conference participants
``traitors'' and calling on the judiciary (which Khamenei controls
as Iran's Supreme Leader) to punish them. Ayatollah Abolghasem
Khazali, who is never unrestrained in his language, said the
participants deserved to die. ``They insult Islamic sanctities,''
he was quoted in the reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz as saying.
``They attend a conference to say nonsense. Kill them wherever you
find them. This is God's unchangeable position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin incident was not the only example of a political
bloodletting since the parliamentary elections. Recently the
Expediency Council, an oversight body headed by former President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, ruled that the new Parliament will
have no authority to investigate any institutions controlled by
Khamenei. That would deprive Parliament of the power to look into
abuses in the judiciary, radio and television, the intelligence and
security apparatus and the giant state-supported foundations that
control huge swaths of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago, Khamenei delivered an extraordinary sermon in
which he acknowledged a need for reform in all of Iran's major
institutions. But he also denounced the promotion of ``U.S.-style
reform'' as inauthentic and un-Islamic, further emboldening
conservatives who often act in his name. The Merchants' Association
of the Tehran bazaar, for example, called for the bazaar to close
last Thursday as a show of support. But Thursday is the best
shopping day of the week. In bold defiance _ and a sign of how
fluid and unpredictable politics have become in Iran _ merchants
opened their doors anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is even talk of a coup, but it has nothing to do with
1953. Last Sunday, the Revolutionary Guards issued an official
threat against the reformists. ``If necessary, our enemies, be they
small or large, will feel the reverberating impact of the hammer of
the Islamic revolution on their skulls,'' the communique said.
</P>
<P>
   While all this has been going on, a council responsible for
vetting candidates and overseeing elections has invalidated the
first-round election victories of a number of reformist candidates
and a run-off election has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   To silence an increasingly emboldened press, the outgoing
conservative Parliament also passed a law last week that severely
restricts the activities of the press. And a high-profile,
high-stakes trial of 13 Jews and several Muslims on charges of
spying for Israel remains in the background, having been put off
until next month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the remarkable thing about this moment is that all of
this evidence of a conservative backlash has failed to quiet the
reformists. One pro-reform group, the Islamic Revolution
Mujaheddini Organization, responded to the Revolutionary Guards
communique by calling its goal ``a childish dream.'' In a letter
released to the newspapers, the group said that ``The power mafia
is seeking to justify an anti-reform coup with the goal of imposing
dictatorship under the cover of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism is even coming from the far provinces. After the
state-run television announced the invalidation of the election of
the candidate from the town of Oshnaviyeh in West Azerbaijan
province, the local governor, Ali Mostafavi, called the move unjust
and unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson for the United States in all this. U.S.
policy-makers have clearly been hoping for months now that modest
concessions to Iran, like a lightening of sanctions, may encourage
a dialogue _ and that a change in the U.S. attitude toward Iran's
history can only help. Last month, when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced the easing of sanctions on non-oil
exports from Iran, she called the ``democratic winds'' in Iran ``so
refreshing'' and acknowledged U.S. errors in past dealings with
Iran, including the CIA-led coup in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But she is still waiting for the Iranians to respond to that
speech with concrete gestures. The problem is that the political
winds now blowing in Iran are more like a hurricane. And until they
subside, there is little chance of meaningful movement toward the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi will arrive in New York for
United Nations-related business this week, but he has been turning
down invitations to speak. In such a wild and uncertain atmosphere,
what could he possibly say?

NEW CASH COWS: A LA CARTE AT THE HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
patients can enjoy a live midday classical music concert between
chemotherapy treatments. In Newport Beach, Calif., Dr. George
Brennan, a dermatologist, sells his skin-care creams out of his
office. At a hospital on New York's Long Island, nurses are
learning how to massage premature babies, a skill they will pass on
to new parents.
</P>
<P>
   Today Americans have new expectations about their health care
system. They want the very latest in medical technology to cure
their diseases, just as they hunger for the latest sports utility
vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they are also seeking
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also looking to medicine to improve their looks, often in an
environment where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can
all be done under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   And the health care industry is responding to consumer demand.
Not only are doctors offering more aesthetic procedures, but
hospitals are also adding complementary services _ departments that
enhance traditional care, hospital administrators say, but do not
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Services like massage therapy for a cancer patient or anti-aging
creams for a dermatology client give doctors and hospitals a
competitive edge. Patients pay for much of this care, especially
aesthetic procedures, in full and in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives realize that they need to borrow a page from
the hotel industry to attract patients. It is not enough to be set
up on the beach when all your competitors are there, too _ extras
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that in the consumers' mind, the notion of
what is health care has broadened considerably in the last
decade,'' said Dr. George Tyson, an administrator at University
Hospital and Medical Center at Stony Brook, N.Y., which offers
infant massage among the services in its complementary medicine
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a health care system that above and beyond illness
improves their quality of life,'' Tyson said. ``At the same time,
this industry is looking for new sources of revenue and has the
capacity to meet this demand. So it seems to be the ideal match.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have ample evidence that Americans are looking outside
of traditional medicine in their pursuit of good health. Americans
spent $27.2 billion on alternative, nontraditional care in 1998. A
recent study published in the American Cancer Society's journal
found that 37 percent of prostate cancer patients turned to
vitamins, massage therapy, herbal remedies and relaxation therapy
as part of their treatment; other studies have gleaned similar
results.
</P>
<P>
   Many health care experts say that part of what drives patients'
interest in this area is their desire to play some role in their
own care. ``Patients these days are not passive recipients of
care,'' said Barrie R. Cassileth, who runs the complementary center
at Sloan Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Care in cancer medicine can be very scattered,'' Cassileth
said. ``Patients usually have several physicians, and it is very
difficult to interact with all those individuals and have a sense
of wholeness. People want connections and to better understand what
is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Americans now treat health care much like any
other consumed good _ they comparison shop, check the Internet for
new information about their illness and quiz doctors about
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providers have to work hard to favorably differentiate
themselves,'' said Tyson. ``But because the quality of care is not
measured in any precise way, another strategy is to offer services
that the public is looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson points to cancer as one example. ``With cancer, a
considerable number of patients are looking for cutting-edge
conventional care combined with a kinder, gentler form of
medicine,'' he said. ``This can be used to differentiate your
cancer care center from the one across town.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the members of the American Academy of
Medical Acupuncture have hospital privileges; five years ago that
number was closer to 5 percent, said James Dowden, executive
administrator for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Richard C. Niemtzow is the military's first acupuncturist.
He runs a pilot program at the Naval Medical Center San Diego to
treat pain and nausea in the center's pain clinic and breast health
center.
</P>
<P>
   The John S. Marten Center for Complementary Medicine and Pain
Management started nine years ago at St. Vincent's Hospital in
Indianapolis after its benefactor, who was dying of prostate
cancer, proclaimed he wanted a center for pain that did not depend
on narcotics. The program, which is expanding, includes
acupuncture, herbal medicine and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wesley Wong, who is the medical director of the medical
specialities service line at St. Vincent's Hospital, said the
complementary services are hugely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We book up four weeks in advance,'' he said.

NEW CASH COWS: A LA CARTE AT THE HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
patients can enjoy a live midday classical music concert between
chemotherapy treatments. In Newport Beach, Calif., Dr. George
Brennan, a dermatologist, sells his skin-care creams out of his
office. At a hospital on New York's Long Island, nurses are
learning how to massage premature babies, a skill they will pass on
to new parents.
</P>
<P>
   Today Americans have new expectations about their health care
system. They want the very latest in medical technology to cure
their diseases, just as they hunger for the latest sports utility
vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they are also seeking
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also looking to medicine to improve their looks, often in an
environment where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can
all be done under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   And the health care industry is responding to consumer demand.
Not only are doctors offering more aesthetic procedures, but
hospitals are also adding complementary services _ departments that
enhance traditional care, hospital administrators say, but do not
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Services like massage therapy for a cancer patient or anti-aging
creams for a dermatology client give doctors and hospitals a
competitive edge. Patients pay for much of this care, especially
aesthetic procedures, in full and in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives realize that they need to borrow a page from
the hotel industry to attract patients. It is not enough to be set
up on the beach when all your competitors are there, too _ extras
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that in the consumers' mind, the notion of
what is health care has broadened considerably in the last
decade,'' said Dr. George Tyson, an administrator at University
Hospital and Medical Center at Stony Brook, N.Y., which offers
infant massage among the services in its complementary medicine
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a health care system that above and beyond illness
improves their quality of life,'' Tyson said. ``At the same time,
this industry is looking for new sources of revenue and has the
capacity to meet this demand. So it seems to be the ideal match.''

<P>
   In this time of dizzying volatility on Wall Street, no company's
fortunes have seesawed quite so dramatically as those of
PipeDream.com, since its (imaginary) initial public offering in
January.
</P>
<P>
   PipeDream's stock zoomed from an initial price of $2 a share to
468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder and chief
executive, Ethan Proctor, the youngest dot-com billionaire on
record. During the recent sell-off in technology stocks, however,
PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how the fledgling company was weathering the storm,
we arranged to meet Proctor at the Silicon Valley Video Arcade in
Mountain View, Calif., where the 17-year-old visionary was leading
his senior managers in a team-building exercise involving the
obliteration of slime creatures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times: Mr. Proctor, what has been your greatest
challenge in starting this company?
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Proctor: Homework.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Homework?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Well, yeah. I've got this English teacher? And she's
making us read Beowulf? It's sort of hard to develop international
marketing strategies when you know you're getting quizzed on the
genealogy of Hrothgar and Unferth right after lunch period.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: So it's been a struggle?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Absolutely. If it weren't for The Geekmeister here (chief
financial officer Thomas Benson Jr.), we'd never have been able to
get granular on our business plan in time for the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Mr. Benson, is it true that you and Mr. Proctor
started PipeDream in the basement of your mother's ranch house in
suburban San Jose?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Benson: Totally.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Where is corporate headquarters now?
</P>
<P>
   T.B.: In the garage, behind the broken sofa-bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: It must have been a thrill to engineer one of the
most successful IPOs in Nasdaq history. How do you explain your
company's initial success?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Obviously the market understood that PipeDream's unique
position _ straddling the B2B and e-commerce sectors _ would allow
us to really pancake the value chain, injecting old economy
revenue-growth models at new economy valuations. Plus, a lot of
people seemed to like the name.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Nonetheless, PipeDream is an untested company run by
young, inexperienced executives, without even the remotest
expectation of a profit. What do you say to people who claim that
prices of companies like PipeDream were ripe for a correction?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: All I can say is they sound like my mom (vice president
for commissary operations Helen Proctor). We gave her the chance to
load up on stock options at the very beginning, but she did a total
self-toast. Told me that the only thing she wanted in exchange for
her services was that I clean up my room.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: And what does she say now?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: She stopped being mad at me when I bought her a
controlling interest in Mary Kay Cosmetics for her birthday. But
now, after the correction, she keeps going ``I told you so, I told
you so.'' I hate that.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: But doesn't she have a point? Given the drop in your
market capitalization, won't you have trouble raising the money you
need to achieve your growth targets?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: OK, the VCs have sort of stopped returning my phone calls.
But my management team and I are exploring alternative funding
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Paper routes. And Dad's raising my allowance.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Some of your critics have complained that PipeDream
seems to lack focus. What is PipeDream's mission in the
marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Well, like, we represent a new, you know, paradigm, geared
to the rapidly-changing realities of the 21st-century virtual
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: But what kind of product or service do you provide?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: ``Product'' and ``service'' are totally last millennium
concepts. PipeDream is the future, and so whatever the future turns
out to be, PipeDream's going to be right there. What more do
investors need to know?

IN CUSTODY BATTLES, CHILDREN GET UNEQUAL TIME

<P>
   If the Elian Gonzalez case illustrates anything, other than the
peculiarly overheated state of Cuban-U.S. relations, it is that
courts run on adult time, with unhappy consequences for the
children they are trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a federal appellate court ruled that Elian
Gonzalez must remain in this country while his political asylum
request is aired, Attorney General Janet Reno said the boy had been
formally assigned to a ``kind of never-never land.''
</P>
<P>
   That is familiar territory for scores of American children whose
destinies remain uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as
their custody and child welfare cases wind through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Look at this particular Cuban 6-year-old boy. He has suffered
the trauma of losing his mother, who drowned while attempting to
flee Cuba last November by boat. He has been transplanted to a new
place and surrounded by new people, one of whom, Elian's cousin
Marisleysis, has reportedly become a surrogate mother. He is not
attending school, where children his age are learning critical
lessons in how to socialize with peers.
</P>
<P>
   And he has now been forcibly taken from his Miami relatives and
delivered to his father. A court must still rule on the issue of
political asylum _ if Elian can leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The latest court postponement of Elian's fate only underscored
what experts see as the tension between two notions of time. There
is the deliberate, adult pace of the law, in which a day or a week
or a month may not seem terribly significant. And then there is the
highly compressed time of child development, in which bonds can be
made, or poisoned, in the same span of time.
</P>
<P>
   There are rules of civil society, which demand that the courts
allow all the parties in a case to be heard. There is also the
child's sense of time, as psychiatrists are fond of saying, in
which waiting in uncertainty can leave a child feeling insecure and
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the judicial system handles custody and child welfare
cases would shock child developmental experts as being almost
designed to insure that children will be ill-served by the
process,'' said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at New York
University. ``Ordinarily, we are taught, `Don't rush through
decisions that are perceived to be at the expense of getting it
right.' Paradoxically, the failure to rush may ensure we can't get
it right. That's the rock and the hard place of law and custody
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling last Wednesday, the three-judge panel of the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta did not render a verdict
on the issue of custody. But in stern language, the judges seemed
to scold the government for its handling of the boy's asylum
request. The Justice Department had asserted that only the boy's
father, and not his Miami relatives, was legally entitled to speak
or him, since a child could not comprehend the complexities of an
asylum claim. The judges, however, said that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service may not have properly considered ``the
child's separate and independent interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the record,'' they wrote, ``plaintiff, although a
young child, has expressed a wish that he not be returned to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   But to what extent can a 6-year-old's opinion be considered in a
legal matter? Should children his age have a say in custody
disputes, let alone matters of political asylum?
</P>
<P>
   In child custody cases in New York City, children, usually at
age 11 or 12, are asked where they would like to live, said Joseph
M. Lauria, the administrative judge of the city's Family Court. But
children are also told by the judge and their own law guardian _
the advocate appointed to represent the child in court _ that the
decision is not theirs to make.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gonzalez case, it may be therapeutic for the boy to
express his feelings, but his opinions should not be accorded the
same weight as, say, a 14-year-old's, said Dr. Albert Solnit,
professor emeritus of psychology at Yale and the outgoing mental
health commissioner of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be burdened with the responsibility of making
decisions that require an adult capacity, cognitively, emotionally
and socially,'' Solnit said. ``You would not expect a 6-year-old
child to be able to understand what is entailed in such a decision
_ how to trust his memory, how to deal with the severe trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Elian waits in the United States while the courts hear
his case. Waiting, in fact, is the hallmark of the process. In New
York City's Family Court, children and their caretakers may wait
all day to see a judge. At that point, if, say, one attorney has
been unable to reach another, the case is adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Lauria said it was common for a contested custody case to take
eight months to a year in Family Court. It can take up to a year
just to conclude whether a child had been abused or neglected, and
equally long to determine whether a drug-addicted parent is fit to
raise a child. There is increasing pressure on the city's Family
Court to speed up, but judges and lawyers concede that the very
character of American jurisprudence _ not to mention badly
overburdened courts _ makes it virtually impossible for cases to
move at a pace that suits a child's psychological need for swift
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal system has a sense of thoughtful due process in
which all avenues should be explored,'' said Donald J. Cohen, a
child psychiatrist and director of the Yale Child Study Center.
``This can go on for years, this process for looking for a perfect
solution, while children lives don't stand still. A child's
custodial situation is treated in some ways as battles between
stockholders in a company, where lawyers on both sides argue in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   One need not have a degree in psychology to realize that for a
child, especially a young one, being unable to answer the basic
question, ``Who will take care of me?'' can leave him feeling
frightened and helpless. Psychiatrists say these feelings may lead
to adolescent depression and delinquent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiting game for a child is a painful one,'' said Michael
G. Kalogerakis, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the New York
University School of Medicine. ``If we are counseling healthy
parents about healthy children and the issue of time is on the
table, we would always say, `Don't postpone. Don't delay. Don't
keep a kid hanging.' ''

request is aired, Attorney General Janet Reno said the boy had been
formally assigned to a ``kind of never-never land.''
</P>
<P>
   That is familiar territory for scores of American children whose
destinies remain uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as
their custody and child welfare cases wind through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Look at this particular Cuban 6-year-old boy. He has suffered
the trauma of losing his mother, who drowned while attempting to
flee Cuba last November by boat. He has been transplanted to a new
place and surrounded by new people, one of whom, Elian's cousin
Marisleysis, has reportedly become a surrogate mother. He is not
attending school, where children his age are learning critical
lessons in how to socialize with peers.
</P>
<P>
   And he has now been forcibly taken from his Miami relatives and
delivered to his father. A court must still rule on the issue of
political asylum _ if Elian can leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The latest court postponement of Elian's fate only underscored
what experts see as the tension between two notions of time. There
is the deliberate, adult pace of the law, in which a day or a week
or a month may not seem terribly significant. And then there is the
highly compressed time of child development, in which bonds can be
made, or poisoned, in the same span of time.
</P>
<P>
   There are rules of civil society, which demand that the courts
allow all the parties in a case to be heard. There is also the
child's sense of time, as psychiatrists are fond of saying, in
which waiting in uncertainty can leave a child feeling insecure and
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the judicial system handles custody and child welfare
cases would shock child developmental experts as being almost
designed to insure that children will be ill-served by the
process,'' said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at New York
University. ``Ordinarily, we are taught, `Don't rush through
decisions that are perceived to be at the expense of getting it
right.' Paradoxically, the failure to rush may ensure we can't get
it right. That's the rock and the hard place of law and custody
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling last Wednesday, the three-judge panel of the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta did not render a verdict
on the issue of custody. But in stern language, the judges seemed
to scold the government for its handling of the boy's asylum
request. The Justice Department had asserted that only the boy's
father, and not his Miami relatives, was legally entitled to speak
or him, since a child could not comprehend the complexities of an
asylum claim. The judges, however, said that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service may not have properly considered ``the
child's separate and independent interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the record,'' they wrote, ``plaintiff, although a
young child, has expressed a wish that he not be returned to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   But to what extent can a 6-year-old's opinion be considered in a
legal matter? Should children his age have a say in custody
disputes, let alone matters of political asylum?
</P>
<P>
   In child custody cases in New York City, children, usually at
age 11 or 12, are asked where they would like to live, said Joseph
M. Lauria, the administrative judge of the city's Family Court. But
children are also told by the judge and their own law guardian _
the advocate appointed to represent the child in court _ that the
decision is not theirs to make.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gonzalez case, it may be therapeutic for the boy to
express his feelings, but his opinions should not be accorded the
same weight as, say, a 14-year-old's, said Dr. Albert Solnit,
professor emeritus of psychology at Yale and the outgoing mental
health commissioner of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be burdened with the responsibility of making
decisions that require an adult capacity, cognitively, emotionally
and socially,'' Solnit said. ``You would not expect a 6-year-old
child to be able to understand what is entailed in such a decision
_ how to trust his memory, how to deal with the severe trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Elian waits in the United States while the courts hear
his case. Waiting, in fact, is the hallmark of the process. In New
York City's Family Court, children and their caretakers may wait
all day to see a judge. At that point, if, say, one attorney has
been unable to reach another, the case is adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Lauria said it was common for a contested custody case to take
eight months to a year in Family Court. It can take up to a year
just to conclude whether a child had been abused or neglected, and
equally long to determine whether a drug-addicted parent is fit to
raise a child. There is increasing pressure on the city's Family
Court to speed up, but judges and lawyers concede that the very
character of American jurisprudence _ not to mention badly
overburdened courts _ makes it virtually impossible for cases to
move at a pace that suits a child's psychological need for swift
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal system has a sense of thoughtful due process in
which all avenues should be explored,'' said Donald J. Cohen, a
child psychiatrist and director of the Yale Child Study Center.
``This can go on for years, this process for looking for a perfect
solution, while children lives don't stand still. A child's
custodial situation is treated in some ways as battles between
stockholders in a company, where lawyers on both sides argue in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   One need not have a degree in psychology to realize that for a
child, especially a young one, being unable to answer the basic
question, ``Who will take care of me?'' can leave him feeling
frightened and helpless. Psychiatrists say these feelings may lead
to adolescent depression and delinquent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiting game for a child is a painful one,'' said Michael
G. Kalogerakis, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the New York
University School of Medicine. ``If we are counseling healthy
parents about healthy children and the issue of time is on the
table, we would always say, `Don't postpone. Don't delay. Don't
keep a kid hanging.' ''

<P>
   Not so long ago, it seems, nations were able to hide their
armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy civilians,
while militaries could pry into most corners of the globe from spy
satellites, knowing they could control who could take a peek.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Taking pictures from space is undergoing a revolution,
and it is making some governments feel naked.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies in a growing number of countries are launching
an increasingly sophisticated fleet of reconnaissance satellites,
and governments are finding it harder and harder to restrict what
snapshots are distributed to anyone willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   A recent case involves Area 51, a secret military installation
in a secluded valley northwest of Las Vegas that is thought to be
used to test advanced aircraft. For decades, the U.S. government
kept it off limits to cameras. Known officially as Groom Lake, it
was veiled in high security, mysterious lights and, UFO buffs
claim, test flights of captured alien spaceships.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, private sleuths won a quiet battle for openness at
Area 51 _ at least on what can be seen from the sky _ as commercial
rivals sold space photos of it. In the fast developing field of
private photography from orbit, the episode suggests a new frailty
for any efforts at state censorship.
</P>
<P>
   When civilian reconnaissance craft were first launched into
space in 1972, there was a vast technological gap between them and
their older but more powerful cousins, the military spy satellites.
All the civilian photos of small objects in those days were fuzzy.
But over the decades, they have become increasingly sharp. At
first, the spacecraft were able to show identifiable objects no
smaller than 100 meters ( 300 feet). Then that number fell to 30,
10, 5, 2 and now 1 meter, or 3 feet. At that resolution, cars,
roads, buildings, tanks, ships, jets and missiles can be
distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one company, Space Imaging, in Thornton, Colo., has
put a one-meter craft into orbit. But other companies in the United
States, Russia, Japan, Israel and South Korea are planning to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Already, analysts say, commercial spy craft are so numerous and
competitive as to undercut governmental efforts to curb what they
disseminate. Russia can bar the operators of a Russian satellite
from selling pictures of Chechnya, but it has no power over an
American company. Likewise, any U.S. efforts to control spying on
Area 51 were rendered moot last week when a Russian company put its
imagery of the base on the market. Some snoop, the experts say,
will always be willing to sell closeups of sensitive zones that
some other nation wants off limits, encouraging a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't last,'' Ann M. Florini, a space reconnaissance expert
at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, said of state censorship.
``It's hard to imagine any foreign-policy situations where all the
actors are going to get together and agree, `Yes, that imagery is
not going to be disseminated.'''
</P>
<P>
   In military terms, of course, it's been decades since any nation
could count on real security from the prying eyes of foes. Missile
testing, bomb development and large-scale military operations have
long been detected _ or forced to try to hide from spy satellites
by dint of camouflage and subterfuge. Even so, it hasn't usually
been to the spyer's advantage to make its discoveries public, since
a cardinal rule of espionage is to keep your discoveries to
yourself. And that, in a way, made the game all the more secretive
and manageable.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial companies don't play by those rules. What is new
is the prospect that any country's secrets will come unpredictably
under public display in ways that could embarrass governments, tip
their hands in war and debate, or show sensitive installations to
terrorists or just plain mischief-makers. Imagine if the FBI's and
KGB's eavesdropping gear suddenly fell into the hands of voyeurs,
and you get a hint of the queasiness now felt in high places.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, even after cameras started zooming, states could
exert some control over civil reconnaissance from space. In 1995,
India lofted a craft that took 5-meter images. It photographed the
world, but blocked photos of its own military bases. And in 1996,
after the Clinton administration approved the taking of one-meter
photos, American supporters of Israel won a law limiting the
sharpness of images of Israel to the best obtainable by any foreign
company. Today, that means two-meter sharpness, which a Russian
company sells.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the investigative use of space imagery has
been strongly encouraged by the Public Eye program of the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington
that promotes arms control and has bought satellite photos in a
systematic effort to fight military censors. In January, it
revealed a North Korean missile base, and in March a Pakistani
nuclear reactor and missile site.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest target is Area 51, and it played a big role in the
release of the new imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Public Eye ordered Area 51 photos from Space Imaging last winter
_ to no avail, leaving it wondering whether there had been what
experts call ``shutter control,'' a right that U.S. officials
assert to at times restrict U.S.-owned civil spy cameras, or
self-censorship by Space Imaging, which is owned mainly by Lockheed
Martin, a military contractor, and whose largest customer is the
Pentagon. The company denied there had been either.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam broke Monday when a rival American company, Aerial
Images, based in Raleigh, N.C., released Russian two-meter photos
of the secretive base.

DISARMING AMERICA'S GUN HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rancorous national debate over gun control, both sides
assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped the
modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it.
</P>
<P>
   This heritage is widely assumed but rarely examined, even in
history books. ``The prevalence of firearms and the high value
placed on the quick draw made a sure shot the test of manliness,''
wrote Daniel J. Boorstin in ``The Americans: The Democratic
Experience.'' ``From earliest colonial times, the needs of the
wilderness and the threat of Indians had put firearms in the
American household. The right to bear arms had been hallowed in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a new book due this fall, another historian challenges
what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun ownership in the
frontier era was far from universal. In ``Arming America: The
Origins of a National Gun Culture'' (Knopf), Michael A. Bellesiles
(pronounced buh-LEEL) contends that only a relative few private
citizens actually owned firearms between 1765 and 1850. Fewer still
owned guns that worked, he says, and only an elite, typically
professional hunters and sportsmen, could reliably aim and fire a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no more than 10 percent of the total American population
owned guns at any time before 1850, according to a variety of
records cited by Bellesiles, an associate professor of history at
Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a federal report in 1803 found that fewer than a
quarter of white adult males owned guns. This census of militias _
emergency forces composed of citizens rather than professional
soldiers _ covered all 17 states and three territories. It
suggested that there were enough firearms for one in 20 Americans.
(By contrast, most estimates today, including the FBI's, suggest
that there are enough firearms for the entire population.)
</P>
<P>
   Average Americans in the pre-Civil War period considered guns,
especially rifles, an expensive luxury that cost a month's wages or
more. Members of Congress, in a lament that would last from the
Revolutionary War to the 1850s, continually deplored citizen
militias' indifference to acquiring, maintaining and using
firearms. What armed America, Bellesiles argues, was the Civil War
of 1861-65, the bloodiest conflict of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles' research fills a vacuum, according to William
Hosley, a former curator of the Samuel Colt gun collection in
Hartford, Conn., and the author of ``Colt: The Making of an
American Legend'' (University of Massachusetts, 1996). The problem
with scholarship on gun ownership, Hosley said, is that ``there is
very little of it, and I've been looking for it for the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more known about silver teapots than there is about
guns,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bellesiles declined to speculate how his
findings affect the current debate over gun control. But Joshua
Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center in
Washington, which favors gun control, says Bellesiles' book may
change the terms of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it at face value that rifles and handguns were
omnipresent from colonial times onwards,'' he said. ``But if
America's gun culture is a recent development, then gun deaths
today, as the NRA argues, are not the price we pay for our heritage
_ because there is no such heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles has his critics. The National Rifle Association, the
strongest opponent of gun control, declined to comment on the book
but has criticized an earlier academic article on which his new
book is based as an attack on the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kottrol, a professor of law and history at George
Washington University who sympathizes with the NRA, asks, ``How
would the westward expansion of the United States, into Indian
territory, have been possible if the population was lightly
armed?''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bellesiles' research doesn't square with other
contemporary narratives, such as travelers' diaries, newspaper
accounts and autobiographies, critics say. Clayton Cramer, a writer
who sympathizes with the NRA, said numerous 19th century accounts
mention an American gun culture.
</P>
<P>
   He cites, for example, Philip Gosse, an English naturalist
traveling in Alabama in the 1830s, who wrote, ``The long rifle is
familiar to every hand; skill in the use of it is the highest
accomplishment which a southern gentleman glories in; even the
children acquire an astonishing expertness in handling this deadly
weapon at a very early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University
in Tallahassee and the author of ``The Great American Gun Debate''
(Pacific Research Institute, 1997), said Bellesiles had
overinterpreted his evidence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: his evidence. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, he could say at least 10 percent of the population
had guns but we have no real way of knowing how much higher that
could go,'' Kleck said, mainly because pre-Civil War record keeping
was so poor. Even in 1968, when recordkeeping of all kinds had
presumably improved, a federal commission had difficulty measuring
gun production because records were scant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kleck said, fathers in frontier America who handed
down their guns to their sons would do so when their children were
young. ``Gun use occurred in adolescence or young manhood so men
would not wait until they were near death to hand on their guns,''
he said. Probate records, Bellesiles' principal evidence, ``would
not reflect that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles did not set out to dismantle an American myth but
fell on the subject by chance. He based many of his conclusions on
a 10-year study of more than 11,000 probate records. Unlike
published wills, which sometimes reflected imagined notions of a
property holder's estate, probate records were inventories of
actual property after a death, from land to broken cups, used to
settle debts in what was known as ``the final reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing thousands of such records while researching a
paper on frontier law in 18th-century America, Bellesiles said he
had an epiphany in a Vermont courthouse in 1989. ``Where,'' he
asked himself, ``were the guns?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kleck's criticism, Bellesiles said, the probate records
he examined appear to record every bequest and gift of value,
including those made during the life of the deceased. These gifts
were subtracted from an heir's portion of the estate, unless there
was a specific instruction to the contrary. ``I am curious to see
Kleck's historical analysis in detail,'' Bellesiles said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellesiles' argument does not rest solely on probate
records. The rifles and muskets of the period rusted quickly and so
required careful maintenance, he said. In a typical report to
Congress, the secretary of war complained in 1838 that ``when
mustered, a majority of (the militia) are armed with walking canes,
fowling pieces, or unserviceable muskets.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, scattered records of gunsmiths seem to indicate little
demand for their wares, Bellesiles said. For example, the family
business of Eltweed Pomeroy of Windsor, Conn., the first known
gunsmith in Colonial America, produced no more than two dozen guns
a year between 1630 and 1849, he said. Other gunsmiths of the time
_ like Hugh Orr of Bridgewater, Mass., and William Henry of
Lancaster, Pa. _ stayed in business by branching out into other
kinds of ironworks like axes and scythes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bellesiles said, ``As a historian, I would be the
last one to say that mine was the final word.''

</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rancorous national debate over gun control, both sides
assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped the
modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it.
</P>
<P>
   This heritage is widely assumed but rarely examined, even in
history books. ``The prevalence of firearms and the high value
placed on the quick draw made a sure shot the test of manliness,''
wrote Daniel J. Boorstin in ``The Americans: The Democratic
Experience.'' ``From earliest colonial times, the needs of the
wilderness and the threat of Indians had put firearms in the
American household. The right to bear arms had been hallowed in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a new book due this fall, another historian challenges
what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun ownership in the
frontier era was far from universal. In ``Arming America: The
Origins of a National Gun Culture'' (Knopf), Michael A. Bellesiles
(pronounced buh-LEEL) contends that only a relative few private
citizens actually owned firearms between 1765 and 1850. Fewer still
owned guns that worked, he says, and only an elite, typically
professional hunters and sportsmen, could reliably aim and fire a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no more than 10 percent of the total American population
owned guns at any time before 1850, according to a variety of
records cited by Bellesiles, an associate professor of history at
Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a federal report in 1803 found that fewer than a
quarter of white adult males owned guns. This census of militias _
emergency forces composed of citizens rather than professional
soldiers _ covered all 17 states and three territories. It
suggested that there were enough firearms for one in 20 Americans.
(By contrast, most estimates today, including the FBI's, suggest
that there are enough firearms for the entire population.)
</P>
<P>
   Average Americans in the pre-Civil War period considered guns,
especially rifles, an expensive luxury that cost a month's wages or
more. Members of Congress, in a lament that would last from the
Revolutionary War to the 1850s, continually deplored citizen
militias' indifference to acquiring, maintaining and using
firearms. What armed America, Bellesiles argues, was the Civil War
of 1861-65, the bloodiest conflict of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles' research fills a vacuum, according to William
Hosley, a former curator of the Samuel Colt gun collection in
Hartford, Conn., and the author of ``Colt: The Making of an
American Legend'' (University of Massachusetts, 1996). The problem
with scholarship on gun ownership, Hosley said, is that ``there is
very little of it, and I've been looking for it for the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more known about silver teapots than there is about
guns,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bellesiles declined to speculate how his
findings affect the current debate over gun control. But Joshua
Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center in
Washington, which favors gun control, says Bellesiles' book may
change the terms of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it at face value that rifles and handguns were
omnipresent from colonial times onwards,'' he said. ``But if
America's gun culture is a recent development, then gun deaths
today, as the NRA argues, are not the price we pay for our heritage
_ because there is no such heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles has his critics. The National Rifle Association, the
strongest opponent of gun control, declined to comment on the book
but has criticized an earlier academic article on which his new
book is based as an attack on the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kottrol, a professor of law and history at George
Washington University who sympathizes with the NRA, asks, ``How
would the westward expansion of the United States, into Indian
territory, have been possible if the population was lightly
armed?''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bellesiles' research doesn't square with other
contemporary narratives, such as travelers' diaries, newspaper
accounts and autobiographies, critics say. Clayton Cramer, a writer
who sympathizes with the NRA, said numerous 19th century accounts
mention an American gun culture.
</P>
<P>
   He cites, for example, Philip Gosse, an English naturalist
traveling in Alabama in the 1830s, who wrote, ``The long rifle is
familiar to every hand; skill in the use of it is the highest
accomplishment which a southern gentleman glories in; even the
children acquire an astonishing expertness in handling this deadly
weapon at a very early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University
in Tallahassee and the author of ``The Great American Gun Debate''
(Pacific Research Institute, 1997), said Bellesiles had
overinterpreted his evidence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: his evidence. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, he could say at least 10 percent of the population
had guns but we have no real way of knowing how much higher that
could go,'' Kleck said, mainly because pre-Civil War record keeping
was so poor. Even in 1968, when recordkeeping of all kinds had
presumably improved, a federal commission had difficulty measuring
gun production because records were scant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kleck said, fathers in frontier America who handed
down their guns to their sons would do so when their children were
young. ``Gun use occurred in adolescence or young manhood so men
would not wait until they were near death to hand on their guns,''
he said. Probate records, Bellesiles' principal evidence, ``would
not reflect that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles did not set out to dismantle an American myth but
fell on the subject by chance. He based many of his conclusions on
a 10-year study of more than 11,000 probate records. Unlike
published wills, which sometimes reflected imagined notions of a
property holder's estate, probate records were inventories of
actual property after a death, from land to broken cups, used to
settle debts in what was known as ``the final reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing thousands of such records while researching a
paper on frontier law in 18th-century America, Bellesiles said he
had an epiphany in a Vermont courthouse in 1989. ``Where,'' he
asked himself, ``were the guns?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kleck's criticism, Bellesiles said, the probate records
he examined appear to record every bequest and gift of value,
including those made during the life of the deceased. These gifts
were subtracted from an heir's portion of the estate, unless there
was a specific instruction to the contrary. ``I am curious to see
Kleck's historical analysis in detail,'' Bellesiles said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellesiles' argument does not rest solely on probate
records. The rifles and muskets of the period rusted quickly and so
required careful maintenance, he said. In a typical report to
Congress, the secretary of war complained in 1838 that ``when
mustered, a majority of (the militia) are armed with walking canes,
fowling pieces, or unserviceable muskets.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, scattered records of gunsmiths seem to indicate little
demand for their wares, Bellesiles said. For example, the family
business of Eltweed Pomeroy of Windsor, Conn., the first known
gunsmith in Colonial America, produced no more than two dozen guns
a year between 1630 and 1849, he said. Other gunsmiths of the time
_ like Hugh Orr of Bridgewater, Mass., and William Henry of
Lancaster, Pa. _ stayed in business by branching out into other
kinds of ironworks like axes and scythes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bellesiles said, ``As a historian, I would be the
last one to say that mine was the final word.''

   Have you checked out the Rome MP3 player with the form factor of
an audiotape that you can play in the tape deck of your car? No?
</P>
<P>
   When are you upgrading to the Palm VII?
</P>
<P>
   Did you know the new Nokia can also be used as a lipstick
mirror?
</P>
<P>
   Wait, you haven't customized your cell phone ring yet? You can't
be serious.
</P>
<P>
   Geekspeak and gadget fetishism used to be limited to geeks and
gadget fetishists. Not anymore. In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds
for social ostracism. For so-called knowledge workers, cell phones
are required and it helps to flaunt a personal digital assistant _
preferably in the same unit.
</P>
<P>
   To the less obsessed, it's beginning to get tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all they talk about,'' said Joia Speciale, an independent
filmmaker, about several of her male friends. ``They get into that
whole boy toys thing about comparing. I just think there are so
many things they could be doing better with their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speciale, who owns a cell phone and a Palm 3E, says she does
benefit, however. ``In a way it's good because when I want
something I don't have to do all the shopping,'' she said. ``They
just tell me what to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Resistance is futile, and surrender can seem kind of nice.
</P>
<P>
   Take Arthur Molella, who pulled out his new Palm 5X while
waiting in line at an airport the other day and immediately
received the knowing look of a tribal brother from a British
passenger in front of him wielding a Palm VII. Soon they were
happily chatting about how often they back up files and the
benefits of CD-ROM burners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the closest I've ever come to having a magic wand,''
said Molella, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's Center
for the Study of Invention and Innovation, who added that he had
resisted buying an electronic organizer like the Palm Pilot until
recently. ``You have a sense when you hold one of these devices
that you're grasping some distillation of human knowledge that
represents centuries of evolution _ and here it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the companion of the British passenger, Molella noticed,
was not so enthusiastic. In fact she looked like she was feeling
left out and a bit annoyed. It's a look gadget-wielders might see
more often if they weren't caught in an electronic trance.
</P>
<P>
   As digital devices become more pervasive and more personal, the
etiquette of how and when to use them _ or to babble endlessly
about their features _ is still evolving.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, is it OK to talk into the air, as crowds of
people seem to be doing when they talk into the newly popular
headsets for cellular phones?
</P>
<P>
   ``People freak out,'' said Seth Goldstein, who spearheads
investments in mobile digital devices for FlatIron Partners, a
venture capital firm. ``But it depends on the context. Doing your
e-mail just because you can whether you're in a conference room or
at a dinner doesn't mean it's appropriate. But if two people take
out their Pilots and are beaming information to each other at a
dinner, that's more acceptable to me because it's social.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Goldstein can sneak a peek at the e-mail messages
bleeping in on his wireless pager during dinner with his wife,
``There are unwritten rules,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Early adopters, as the consumer electronics industry refers to
people who are willing to pay far more than a given electronic
device will eventually cost in order to have it first, have always
been a bit obnoxious. From the first proud few to replace slide
rules with calculators to CB radio hobbyists to the audiophiles who
paid thousands of dollars for the first CD players, gadget freaks
have often seemed to exist in a jargon-filled matrix of their own,
oblivious to the mundane demands of civil society.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of belonging to an elite group who see things more
clearly with the aid of electronic circuits hasn't changed. But the
size of the group has, and so has the size of the gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4 million personal organizers like the Palm Pilot were
sold in 1999, according to IDC, a research and consulting firm,
with sales expected to climb to 6.3 million this year. Dozens of
companies have announced plans to flood the world with ``hand-held
devices'' including various mutations of cell phones, MP3 music
players, digital cameras, e-mail pagers, Web browsers and
geopositioning systems. Last week, Microsoft unveiled the newest
version of its Windows CE software in an attempt to dislodge the
Palm Pilot as the leading hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   Today's technology aficionados are not the boys with the thick
lenses _ they wear Armani frames. And their devices aren't at home
in the garage or the rec room _ they are with them at all times,
clipped, dangling or tucked away on their bodies. For those who
don't care whether your hard drive is bigger than theirs, that
means the relentless tech talk is hard to escape. It's there in
restaurants, on trains, on the street, although the people using it
often seem not to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about this new personal technology telling
you that the real world doesn't count and what's important is this
magic that I have in my pocket and my fingertip command,'' said
Thomas Hine, a historian of popular culture who was recently forced
to listen to a fellow train passenger warn eight people by cell
phone that he would be an hour late. ``So, you peons, you don't
matter, you're bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the technology that enables users to so easily slip out
of touch with their physical surroundings also serves as a bridge
between strangers _ and family. When emotions run high, or
conversation is strained, ``feeds and speeds'' are a good fallback.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse it doesn't have any politics or anything
that could remotely turn anyone off,'' said Bob Parks, who edits
the ``Fetish'' section of Wired magazine. ``When I go home to talk
to my dad we have kind of a stilted dialogue sometimes, but
whenever the conversation turns to gadgets we can talk for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It works particularly well while on the road, Parks added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sitting next to someone who would never talk to you
and whip out a digital camera and say `I have a two-million pixel
Cannon and instead of the Type 2 flashcard I dropped in an IBM
Microdrive and the great thing about it is it's got USB,' and the
person will say, `Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. And perhaps geekspeak as small talk will eventually run
its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a newbie phenomenon,'' said Paul Saffo, director of
the Institute for the Future. ``If you're really cool you don't
show your stuff off. Me, I'd never be flashing gizmos in polite
society.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A new era of custody politics
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even amid the general squalor of the Elian case, for those with
a political taste for such piquant delights there's a delicious
irony in the musings of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals over the
question of whether a 6-year-old has independent standing to seek
U.S. political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel barred Elian Gonzalez from going home to
Cuba with his father while the court puzzles over this unknown. The
judges noted that in writing ``any alien who is physically present
in the United States'' may seek refuge from political and other
abuses at home, Congress did not specifically bar children from the
privilege _ and hundreds of years of common law that assume such
age distinctions go hang.
</P>
<P>
   Thus looms the odd prospect of defecting toddlers testifying for
their emancipation from this and that tyranny. Millions of Chinese
kiddies are ready to go in, coach.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the court sharply rebuked the Immigration and
Naturalization Service for not at least querying Elian before
lapsing to the commonplace legal assumption that parents and
children ordinarily belong together. This, mind you, from a
routinely conservative circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, conservatives in general and Republicans
in particular were demonizing Hillary Clinton, wife of the
Democratic presidential nominee, for advocating limited legal
rights for children.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary, ``a dowdy feminazi,'' intended to rip children from the
bosom of the family and have them reared _ read: ``indoctrinated''
_ by the state. One commentator had her as the cackling wicked
witch of Oz, carrying off innocents.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Rich Bond said Hillary
had ``likened marriage and family to slavery.'' She believes, Bond
said, ``kids should sue their parents rather than helping with the
chores.''
</P>
<P>
   The air of the 1992 GOP convention in Houston was superheated
with fevered Hillary-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of this calculated hysteria were two academic
journal articles Hillary Clinton has written in 1973 and '79 for
the Harvard Education Review and the Yale Law Journal.
</P>
<P>
   They were carefully calibrated and thoughtful pieces. In them,
Hillary argued that children in some very limited circumstances
should have a legal right to seek their own interests in the courts
in contravention of their parents' wishes. One cited case: an
adolescent whose parents, for religious reasons, forbade the
surgical correction of a cleft palate.
</P>
<P>
   The author emphasized that she was not advocating any broad
legal estrangement of parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all but the most extreme cases,'' she wrote, ``such
questions should be resolved by the families, not the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But here we are with a conservative court, to relief and cheers
from much the same quarters that pilloried Hillary, wondering if
children as young as six shouldn't have the legal right to, in
effect, divorce their parents over a supposed ideological
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a little politics makes.

LIMO COMPANIES SAY NO TO UNDERAGE DRINKERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Every prom season the campaigns against
underage drinking abound: Don't drink on prom night. Don't drink
and drive on prom night.
</P>
<P>
   This year there's another message: Don't drink and ride.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly popular way of getting to and from prom is a
cushy ride in a big ol' limo. But parents and limousine operators
are now being urged not to make it easy for kids to binge in the
backseat.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids who are lucky enough to be riding in such style,
however, don't seem to be getting the message. Or maybe they're
just not listening.
</P>
<P>
   Limousine companies hired to transport teens on their special
nights out continue to find underage passengers sneaking alcohol in
the limo, perhaps even more often than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see kids bringing backpacks, overnight bags and large
purses into the car, that kind of gives you a clue,'' said Gregg D.
Shane, owner of Kool Nites Limousine Inc. in Blue Springs, Mo., a
suburb of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the drugs with the kids ... it's alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane named an incident this year in which as many as eight
carry-on bags belonging to one group of prom-night passengers were
found to contain some form of alcohol, with several devoted
entirely to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night some of the parents even helped their kids put
their belongings in the car,'' he said. ``That's not saying the
parents knew. I hate to say it, but the parents need to check their
kids' bags when they're going out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they do, the trend has motivated Shane to stop relying
on prom-night passengers to automatically comply with underage
drinking laws. He recently ordered warning stickers placed on his
company's contracts with customers. They say: ``Possession of
alcohol by a minor will constitute immediate cancellation of our
contracted services. Parents will be notified immediately. No
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Shane said, ``our drivers are subject to arrest, can
go to jail, our cars can be towed, and we open ourselves up to
lawsuits by the parents. It's a can of worms.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the stickers were implemented, Shane said he's had to
terminate ``about three'' trips for alcohol-related reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drivers watch for it, and they do check,'' said Teri
Mynatt, manager of Custom Limousine Inc. in Bonner Springs, Kan.,
also a suburb of Kansas City. ``If they are caught, the ride stops
and the parents are called ... because we tell parents we do not
contribute to the delinquency of a minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Rowlands' Shawnee Mission (Kan.) Limousine &AMP; Airport
Service also notifies customers in writing that chauffeurs are not
designated drivers for underage imbibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public is fine, but there are occasions when not
everybody is watching the store,'' Rowlands said. ``What we've
tried to do is be proactive. And, perhaps without exception, every
parent we've worked with has wholeheartedly embraced the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Seymour's daughter Ashlee, a senior at Park Hill South
High School, was taken to prom this year in a limousine with her
date and several other couples. Like many high-schoolers who
arrange for such high-toned transportation, Ashlee and her pals
pooled their money and paid for it themselves. Seymour never saw a
contract from a limousine company, but she doesn't think the
primary responsibility for kids' prom-night behavior lies with limo
operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first responsibility is with the parents,'' Seymour said.
``Then the teen-agers. Then I'd say the limo driver or whoever else
is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws in Missouri and Kansas protect the welfare of minors and
punish anyone aiding and abetting a minor in committing a crime.
Those laws could be used to hold limousine drivers accountable for
underage drinking that occurs in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But those laws have rarely been applied, say local authorities
who can't quote a single case where a limo driver has been charged
or prosecuted for a prom-related offense.
</P>
<P>
   One limousine driver, though, came close at last year's prom at
Lee's Summit (Mo.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   When school officials smelled alcohol on a group of students who
had just arrived by limousine, uniformed police on hand to help
with security detained the partyers and the limo driver, a first
for Lee's Summit police.
</P>
<P>
   The kids admitted they'd had a cooler of beer in the car, but
the driver told police he didn't know anything about it, said Sgt.
Chris Salva, supervisor of the juvenile investigations unit for the
Lee's Summit Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although the limo driver had committed no crime, he should have
been more aware of what was going on in the car, Salva said. ``We
educated him that it was not a smart thing to do with minors,'' he
said. ``We determined that he was not being the best adult figure,
but he did not participate in them purchasing'' the beer. The
driver was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Salva says limousine companies that follow a ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy about kids drinking in their cars need to change that
thinking. ``Some upscale limos have partitions that allow privacy
for adult passengers. But when they have children in there, that's
when they have to override those amenities and be more
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneaking liquor into a limousine on prom night is no mission
impossible. Some students carry bags with a change of clothing for
later. Slip a bottle or two into the bag, or even into a small
cooler, and the driver may never know that his passengers are
partying.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in a limo that Brian Davis, a senior at Park Hill
High School, shared with several other prom couples two years ago.
``There was only drinking afterward in the limo,'' said Brian, 18.
``And there were only two or three in there who did.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the worst of it in Vicky Ward's view, because on
prom and graduation nights _ high-risk nights for underage drinking
_ some parents supply their kids with liquor or make accommodations
so that their children can drink, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents say, `Well, you know, they're going to drink anyway.
At least they're not going to drive.' But they are condoning that
behavior,'' said Ward, prevention services director for Tri-County
Mental Health Services Inc. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure many parents rent limos to make it a special night.
But there are others who do it to `keep them safe.' The problem is,
if you truly want them to be safe, condoning their drinking is not
the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Community surveys have found that ``by and large, underage
drinking was condoned,'' Ward said, including in hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Tri-County Mental Health, school and law enforcement officials,
mostly in the Northland, have sent letters to hotels in a
five-county area asking them not to rent rooms to minors on prom
night.
</P>
<P>
   Local limousine companies received similar letters urging them
to clamp down on teens drinking in their cars. ``Because some young
people seek places to have parties, your awareness and commitment
can make the difference between safety and tragedy,'' the letters
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Fritz, assistant district attorney in Johnson County, Kan.,
said a legal argument could be made that if a limo driver did
nothing to stop teens from drinking in the car, he is aiding and
abetting a minor in the commission of a crime. It's the same state
statute that would apply to ``lookouts'' who help kids buy beer at
liquor stores.
</P>
<P>
   But Fritz has never come across such a case.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the problem can be handled by simply confiscating the
alcohol, as Gene Gamble, general manager of City Lights Limousine
in Kansas City, had to do last prom season.
</P>
<P>
   After Gamble picked up a group of prom-goers at a house near
Pleasant Hill in Cass County, a young man in the group asked for
the car to pull over only about a block away. He ran into a pasture
and returned with a cooler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What you got in there? Booze?' Gamble said. ``He
said, `Yeah.' I said, `OK, let's put it in the trunk.' I guess he
thought I would just let him in with it. They'll try things, but
most of them don't get away with it.''

PAINTINGS OF FARMER GERALD MOORE CAPTURE A COUNTRYSIDE FROM
YESTERYEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNDEN, Kan. _ Gerald Moore tells a tale of two countrysides.
</P>
<P>
   There's the countryside of his acrylic paints and his
imagination, where small towns are vibrant, and the evening sky
radiates lavender behind a well-ordered farmstead.
</P>
<P>
   The other countryside, the one where Moore actually resides,
isn't quite so pastoral or benign. It's rural America in decline.
It's towns that have lost their young folk and their Main Streets,
and farmhouses gone vacant because it hardly pays a family anymore
to raise soybeans or hogs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore hovers in the middle, one dusty boot in each. He's the
fifth successive generation to farm the acreage his
great-great-grandfather homesteaded west of Washington, Kan., hard
against the Nebraska line. He's the first generation to paint it.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit of about 15 of his paintings has toured Kansas for 15
months, stopping at banks and community centers and colleges. It's
at the Agricultural Hall of Fame &AMP; National Center in Bonner
Springs through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Lambert, an arts promoter, organized the show after Moore's
art instructor introduced Lambert to the farmer's work. Lambert was
taken by the painter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an art-jaded person,'' said Lambert, who was
instrumental in propelling another regional artist, the late
Elizabeth Layton of Wellsville, Kan., into the limelight. Layton
enrolled in her first and last art class at the age of 68 and
produced an extensive body of work the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moore ``takes his cues not from ... whatever is hot in New York.
He paints the world around him, which is vanishing rural Kansas,''
Lambert said. ``That's one reason I like him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   That world has been transformed right before Moore's eyes. When
he was a child 40 years ago, his hometown of Munden had an
elementary and a high school, a pool hall, a bank, a grocery store,
beauty parlor, auto repair shop and a couple of gas stations. The
train from Chicago to Denver even stopped in Munden.
</P>
<P>
   Today the lone surviving establishments are a post office,
beauty parlor and bank, set amid a collection of blank-eyed
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years ago the countryside had a farmstead every
quarter-mile and a school every couple miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A farmer could make a living off 80 or 160 acres,'' Moore
said. ``You wouldn't stand a chance of making a living off 160
acres today.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his father and sister together cultivate nearly 800
acres.
</P>
<P>
   In agriculture, as in other industries, staying viable
increasingly means getting big.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his family quit raising hogs in recent years after the
industry became dominated by a half-dozen packers. Moore says the
small family farmer had no place to sell the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has seen, and personally felt, the life being squeezed out
of the countryside. But you won't find a hint of that saga in his
bucolic tableaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm trying to put that in the back of my head,'' he
said. He is ``not trying to make a statement,'' but aims instead to
depict the natural beauty and the small pleasures of his world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colors, contrasts, the way light hits things,'' he said. ``I
think (people) miss those things. I never get tired of when the sun
is going down or coming up. I never get tired of the way the sun
makes shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 51, seems more comfortable expressing the country's
poetical appeal in acrylic paints than in words. He quickly shifted
conversational gears to a safer, less emotional realm: what route
had his visitor taken to his remote homestead?
</P>
<P>
   His wife and three grown sons take little interest in his work,
Moore said. His first encouragement came from the owner of an art
supply store in the nearby town of Scandia, where he bought some
red paint about 15 years ago. He told the proprietor he was
painting his red Ford tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's gonna stick to the tractor,'' she said of
the tube of acrylic he had selected. She suggested he might benefit
from some instruction. And indeed, he admits the tractor portrait
was ``really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He registered for her basic painting class at Cloud County
Community College and, in short order, Moore had himself a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had drawn caricatures for years, but one winter in the
mid-1980s, when he was disabled with a back injury, he decided he'd
watched enough television. He unearthed an ancient set of paints
from the basement.
</P>
<P>
   His first subjects were tractors, barns, houses. He has since
moved on to scenes of small-town life, a crowd at a county fair,
kids throwing snowballs. His current project, at 10- by 3-feet, is
much larger than any earlier works. He's laboring on it in his
basement _ for both space and privacy reasons. Except for his
immediate family members, viewing of works in progress is strictly
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   He has sold some of his paintings, mostly commissions arranged
beforehand. Painting won't supplant his farming income anytime
soon, but Moore finds other rewards in it.
</P>
<P>
   He's pleased when viewers ``walk away with the feeling, `I've
been here before.' If anything, that's what I want them to walk
away with, a sense of belonging.''
</P>
<P>
   He also aims to educate city-slickers about farmers and the
volatile universe in which they operate. It is marked by ``sunsets
and windstorms and rain and the elements ... and market forces,
things we don't have any control over,'' the painter said. ``We're
at the mercy of the markets and the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow farmers may relate to the challenging conditions under
which both they and Moore labor, but some of them can't quite
accept this farmer as artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that's nice,'' some of them might allow. ``But shouldn't
he be out checking the calves?''
</P>
<P>
   For Moore, it's not one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice being recognized as an artist and a farmer.'' For
him, the two are inextricably entwined, especially in the twilight
when the sun's rays fall in gentle crossways slats, illuminating
every floating particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes together for a couple minutes. I sometimes stop
the tractor, stare at it and think, `This is what I want to paint
next. How am I gonna do it?''
</P>

 &HT;    Multi-tasking senators are representative
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ She keeps warning them. For two years
running, Florida Senate President Toni Jennings has scolded
senators for dinking around
</P>
<P>
   on their computers when they should be paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   And that may not be so horrible. Bad things happen when the
Florida Senate focuses on its work. When focused, senators pass
transparently bad, defiantly unconstitutional and special-interest
payback legislation without hesitation. Best they keep themselves
busy with things that won't harm the environment or busy the
appellate courts. Like eBay and their stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be the more deliberative chamber, so slowing
the process by inattention is in keeping with their constitutional
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about hearing the muted click of keyboards around
the chamber is that many offending computer operators are reading
their e-mail. Hearing from constituents. To a believer in
democracy, this is good. The Senate is ready to hand out tax breaks
instead of fixing roads, paying teachers or seeing that kids get
basic health care, but the majority of Floridians have other
priorities. I'd like to think a few of them are sharing these
feelings with legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a lot of the floor action this session had more to do with
surfing the Net and nervously consulting the Nasdaq index rather
than consulting the folks back home. That's OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   These people have a hard job. It's not easy to live through
three months of partisan rhetoric no sane person really believes
and legal minutiae that make your head hurt. They must sit through
agonizing meetings, stay awake against all odds, and brazen it out
while introducing lobbyist-written legislation that makes the same
amount of sense whether read left-to-right or right-to-left.
</P>
<P>
   Internet surfing on the floor reminds senators that there's a
bigger, saner and less harsh world out there. Maybe the exercise
makes them less mean.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: The Florida House does not allow computers on the floor
and it is altogether nastier, grouchier and more partisan than the
Senate. Coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   The Senate president is fighting a losing battle against
multi-tasking. It's not only happening on the Senate floor, it's
everywhere: in the classroom, in the workplace and especially on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of daily life is speeding to the point that people feel
guilty doing only one thing at time. Just look at the cars around
you. A quarter of the drivers are talking on the phone, perfecting
their grooming or looking for one particular song on a two-hour
tape.
</P>
<P>
   I have even watched people talk on cordless phones while
gardening. I have laughed at this as I walk the dog and talk into a
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   My time waiting for kids' doctor appointments is no longer
devoted to last year's People Magazine and calming
prescription-drug pamphlets. No, it's devoted to a tiny hand-held
computer that holds more text than I can read in a day. I'm not
just cooling my heels in a waiting room. I'm multi-tasking. And
that marks me a certified busy, on-the-go, 21st century person.
</P>
<P>
   People look at me and think: ``There is a very on-the-go,
pressed for time, 21st century multi-tasking person. No wonder he
dresses like that.''
</P>
<P>
   We have moved from a culture that sees status in conspicuous
consumption and conspicuous leisure to a society that celebrates
the status of the person too busy to do only one thing well.
</P>
<P>
   If elected to the Florida Senate, I'm certain I, too, would
drift away from the debate over the third amended tax table in the
Tax Break for Companies that Force Their Employees to Pledge
Allegiance to the Flag Act. I would idly check plane fares to
Brazil in case I had to leave the country in a hurry or track the
plunging worth of my shares in
PocketProtectorDiscountWarehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd be a better person for it.
</P>
<P>
   I could go on, but my phone and wristwatch are beeping
simultaneously while the incoming e-mail symbol flashes on my
computer. There are tasks to take on simultaneously and three is my
limit.

 &HT;    D.C. demonstrators didn't know they have same goals as IMF,
World Bank
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Now that America's latest protest movement has
chalked up a few quality practice sessions, the protesters are
stoked about their chances to disrupt the Republican and Democratic
presidential conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders point with pride to the 50,000 demonstrators who
got lots of ink and air time for their efforts to wreck the meeting
of the World Trade Organization in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle in Seattle provided a nice warm-up for protests of
recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had a grand time baiting police officers,
clogging traffic, chanting slogans and acting morally outraged over
issues they likely did not understand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few points of agreement among a panel of experts on a
public broadcasting news program discussing the anti-globalization
protests was the likelihood that only a handful of the protesters
understood the functions of the IMF or World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Had the protesters understood what the IMF and World Bank
attempt to accomplish, and if they were truly concerned about the
environment, world poverty, governmental corruption, health care
for impoverished children, access to education, clean water,
living-wage jobs, economic stability and world peace, then they
might be inclined to assist the efforts of IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the goals of these institutions. Certainly, the
leaders of the two organizations have occasionally blundered, but
their goals are praiseworthy. They have had far more successes than
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Both international organizations were founded at or toward the
end of World War II in an effort to prevent future world wars by
promoting international monetary stability, fostering economic
growth, boosting worldwide employment, fighting poverty, providing
resources to protect the environment, sharing knowledge, increasing
life expectancy and reducing infant mortality, to name a few of the
many laudable objectives.
</P>
<P>
   With a righteousness that only the bewildered can achieve, the
protesters railed against the IMF and World Bank for raping the
environment and holding the hobnailed jackboot of multinational
corporations on the throat of the world's poor to enrich wealthy
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   That's drivel.
</P>
<P>
   While both organizations have made loans and decisions that have
backfired, their intent and their track records show remarkable
achievement on most endeavors. They deal with many of the world's
most intractable problems.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the anti-globalization protests appears to be a
philosophical antipathy toward capitalism and free trade.
</P>
<P>
   That's why extreme conservatives join extreme liberals in
protest against the efforts of these international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite history's clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,
many Americans still believe fascism or socialism will produce
heaven on earth.
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters news story by David Morgan tells how protest
organizers are planning to improve on the demonstrations in Seattle
and Washington, D.C., at this summer's presidential conventions in
Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Unity 2000 coalition hopes to attract 100,000
protesters from more than 100 activist organizations to the
Republican convention in Philadelphia. Compare that to the 15,000
anti-war demonstrators who disrupted the 1968 Democratic convention
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters can be credited with sharpening the focus and
improving the operations of the IMF, World Bank and World Trade
Organization. We can only hope that they will do the same for the
presidential candidates.

 &HT;    A good argument is key to a long life
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Annie and Leonard, both octogenarians, live
to argue. This week it's about cemetery plots. Annie says she
doesn't give a hoot because she's not ready to ``move on.'' Leonard
says it's time to decide because they can't spend eternity in the
old Buick even though, according to him, that would be Annie's
final resting-place-of-choice since she's run the wheels off of it
for the last 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little before breakfast when I stopped in to ask for
the loan of Old Blue, Leonard's 23-year-old pickup with windows
that quit working in the winter of '84. Annie was cooking
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a seat,'' Leonard says nodding toward the table and
plunking an Ohio State mug full of the evil brew he calls coffee in
front of me. ``Whatcha'' doing up so early?''
</P>
<P>
   I tell him I'm in need of a load of manure for my flower beds, a
truck to haul it in, and maybe some help shoveling. He tells me it
looks like all I have is the notion and it's up to him to supply
the rest. I put on my blameless face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll load up right after breakfast,'' he says, ``but right
now we're having a discussion and Annie is being bull-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie explains, looking as exasperated as I've ever seen her
except the time the pressure cooker blew up and stuck beans all
over the ceiling. ``This old fool ran into Howie Sikeston at the
feed store and they got to talking about dying. Every time those
two get together, it means trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie turns back to the stove where she's frying a fat hunk of
bologna for Leonard's breakfast. He has the same thing every
morning _ bologna and fake eggs. Gave up the real ones about eight
years ago when the doc told him if he wanted to live to spend all
of his money he was going to have to quit eating anything and
everything that couldn't outrun him.
</P>
<P>
   Grudgingly, Leonard gave up nightly chocolate malts, peanut
brittle, and real eggs. But not the fried bologna. Annie tried to
take it away once and he refused to get out of bed that morning.
Said it just wasn't worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is right on two plots over in Union Cemetery but
this woman here,'' he waves a hand in Annie's direction, ``says
she's too young to talk about dying and anyway, she'd rather use
the money for a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Annie flips the bologna and slaps it a hard lick with the
spatula. ``We need a vacation more than we need a hole in the
ground,'' she says. ``What'd you rather see?'' she asks
rhetorically, ``The Grand Canyon or the underside of some danged
weeds?'' Leonard argues it's two plots for the price of one but
Annie says if it's not big enough to build a barn on she doesn't
want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're a bargain,'' Leonard says. ``Two for $300. They're
going so cheap because Howie's sister has made up her mind she's
not going to spend eternity in a cemetery full of Lutherans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth is,'' Annie answers back, ``I've kind of made up my mind
to get buried on a mountain top in California. Only $265,000 for a
family of four. Saw it in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's eyes roll back in his head. There's no more cemetery
talk. ``Let's go out and shovel,'' he says as he heads for the
door, ``it's getting too deep in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie grins at me behind his back. ``Now a trip to Branson won't
sound nearly so expensive to him,'' she whispers. ``He's so easy to
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard hands me a shovel that fits my hand and chuckles,
``Well, guess I took her mind off the Grand Canyon with all that
cemetery talk. I'm going to offer her Branson instead. Whatta' you
think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth?'' I ask. He nods. ``I'm thinking I want to be having as
much fun as you two when I'm 80.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard winks and we dig in.

 &HT;    Star Trek game makes no gains on TV seriesBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   The problem with episodic action/adventure television is that,
more often than not, it's so, well, formulaic. Likewise is this
digital incarnation of the Roddenberry world, Star Trek: Hidden
Evil ($30; www.acti-vision.com; PC). Taking up where the Next
Generation ``Insurrection'' movie left off, the Enterprise crew
continues to interact with the enigmatic Ba'ku people as they
uncover still more ``advanced technology'' from a long-dead
civilization. Gamers mainly control a Star Fleet ensign, an apt
adventurer who's a little slow on the uptake when it comes to
action. Genre-typical tasks and objectives _ explore, find, unlock,
clash with the enemy every now and again _ mire what is otherwise a
graphically splendid and technically efficient game. Voiceover work
from the likes of Patrick Stewart (Picard) and Brent Spiner (Data)
do well to offer an immersive Star Trekian interactive adventure.
Yet, all said and done, it's an episodic TV-caliber adventure, not
a virtual extravaganza on par with the blockbuster movies.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Wrebbit's first digital incarnation of perplexing
3-D jigsaw puzzles, but the QuickTime dependant Puzz3D CD The
Orient Express from the Twenties ($20; www.wrebbit.com; for the PC
or Mac) is its first blend of genuine jigsaw challenge with more
conventional computer based mind-benders. In and of itself, the
virtual 3-D build-a-train puzzle promises/threatens hours of
well-interfaced point and click, and drag and drop, puzzle play
with difficulty ranging from easy (150 simplistic pieces, a help
menu, some task automated) to ``Super Challenging'' (707 tiny
pieces, no help, no hints). Once completed, Orient Express becomes
an Agatha Christie-inspired virtual mystery, a graphic-intensive
point and click adventure in the tradition of ``Myst'' or
``Riven,'' replete with mini-games involving clue-riddled Mah Jong
tiles/ciphers, code conundrums, music sheet mysteries and more.
Innumerable FMV featurettes present characters and plot lines and
move the mystery along. A well-executed, long-term
mind-messer-upper for a paltry $20.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   For fans of fighting games, the Sega Dreamcast's lineup since
its launch has been an cornucopia of riches. First came the
exquisite ``Soul Calibur,'' and now Tecmo's Dead or Alive 2 ($45,
www.tecmoinc.com), which is, in a word, gorgeous. The game is a
standard fighting game the way the Sistine Chapel has bunch of
squiggles on its ceiling. With great graphics, ultra smooth
game-play and some stellar modes like Tag Team fighting, Dead or
Alive 2 is stunning. The levels are interactive, so throwing an
opponent off a ledge can lead you to another, lower level to
continue a fight. Snow-covered vistas, beautiful gardens and ornate
arenas are just eye candy to the very fun game-play. If we have one
complaint, it's that the game doesn't have as many modes of play as
``Soul Calibur.'' But once you're swapping out players in Tag Team
mode, you won't care.

 &HT;    Delete key probably the best defense against junk e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are times _ lots of them, really _ when I'm over
my head talking about some facet of technology. Things change so
fast and get so complicated that I end up spending a lot of my time
being mystified. But when it comes to junk e-mail, I'm on solid
ground.
</P>
<P>
   I once was a junk-mail king. I spent seven years writing for
mail-order catalogs and putting mailings together. So next time you
open your real-world mailbox and find envelopes telling you that
the ``Smith Family Is Already a Winner'' or that the secret to
consolidating all your credit card bills is inside, curse me.
</P>
<P>
   Junk e-mail is just the modern equivalent of all those mailings
that I worked on so diligently. Both are a major irritant for a lot
of people, and both are almost impossible to stop. I know that junk
e-mail _ spam as it's called _ is becoming an increasingly annoying
problem because I get so many e-mails asking how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of methods, and we'll sure touch on them
because sometimes it helps to at least try to stop an annoyance
rather than just feel helpless. But the bottom line is that, if you
have an e-mail account, you're going to get junk mail addressed to
you. And a high proportion of this mail will be offensive in some
way. They'll either insult your intelligence with stupid get-rich
offers, or they'll offend your sensibilities with X-rated offers
that are blatant, even in the e-mail itself.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about what not to do. Most junk mail includes
instructions for being removed from future mailing lists. Don't
comply. While some legitimate mailers really will remove you, it's
impossible to know who is legitimate and who isn't. By replying,
you are actually making your e-mail address more valuable to the
e-mailer. It can then be sold as an address that has proven valid
and active. The exception to this rule is if you get an e-mail from
a brand-name company. Then you are probably safe in asking that
your name be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, don't give in to the temptation to write back and chew out
the mailer _ for the same reason you shouldn't ask to be removed
from the list. You'll just increase the chances of even more
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what can you do? Keep in mind my opinion that none of these
techniques will noticeab

 &HT;    Language translation sites inexact but helpful
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Medan europeer ofta kan tala flera sprak flytande, de
flesta amerikaner ar okunniga i andra sprak.
</P>
<P>
   If that Swedish doesn't make sense to you, you're not alone. The
translation is: ``While Europeans often are fluent in several
languages, most Americans are ignorant of other languages.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be the World Wide Web, but when it comes to reading
information in other languages, most of us are at a loss. Even if
you took Spanish or French in school, most of us are awkward at
best when it comes to following the conversational language you are
likely to find on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There is help for that, right on theWeb. If you're an
experienced user, you probably know that there are free online
translation services available. One of the best known is called
BabelFish, a service provided by the AltaVista Web site
(www.altavista.com). You can either click on the link called
``translation'' on that page, or go directly to
babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?.
</P>
<P>
   Just as is true with some of the other, less well known sites
that we'll visit in this column, you need to manage expectations
when you use the service. Don't expect the sort of letter-perfect
translation you'd get from a professional translator. This
translation is done by software, and the results can vary between
pretty good and really funny. But the text, in most cases, will be
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of BabelFish, you'll have a choice of French,
German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. You can translate from
English into one of those languages, or from any of those languages
into English.
</P>
<P>
   Some other sites offer a broader selection of languages. One is
Inter-Tran, located at www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran. There are
too many languages available here to list them all but _ besides
those found at AltaVista _ you can add Swedish, Dutch, Finnish,
Japanese, Russian, Icelandic and Croatian, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   At both sites, you can either type or paste in the text you want
to translate or list the URL for the Web page that needs
translating.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a quick laugh _ and also a demonstration of the
relative lack of sophistication of the software _ translate an easy
sentence from English to another language and then use the
translator to return that translation to English. You'll see why
these services would not be good enough for a final translation of
an important business letter or a marriage proposal.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to learn a little bit about the language and to
try it yourself if you already have some skill in that particular
language. The Web also offers online dictionaries in other
languages that can help you over the rough spots. One to check out
is the Logos dictionary at www.logos.it/dictionary/owa/sp?lg &QC; EN.
You'll find a wide selection of languages and can use the
dictionary to translate both words and brief phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Also at that site you'll find games such as crossword puzzles
and anagrams that can help make learning or practicing another
language fun.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, instead of a translation, you are preparing for a trip
to another country and would like to be able to speak and
understand a few basic phrases in the language. Knowing even a
little of the host country's language can open up people's hearts
and make for a more enjoyable trip.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent site for this type of work is called Foreign
Languages for Travelers and can be found at
www.travlang.com/languages/.
</P>
<P>
   There's a broad selection of languages to choose from here, more
than can be listed. Once you settle on a language, you can take
easy online lessons that teach you the basics: how to say hello and
goodbye, ask for directions (understanding them when spoken fast in
an unfamiliar language is another matter), book a room in a hotel
or order a simple meal.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that is especially helpful _ since words in another
language often follow different rules for pronunciation than in
English _ is the use of audio so that you can hear a native speaker
say the word or phrase you are learning. You'll also find quizzes
that test you on your new-found knowledge.

 &HT;    Microsoft workers unfazed by ruling
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Web, not the government, is the hot topic at the
sprawling Microsoft campus set against a backdrop of breathtaking
mountains in the Seattle suburb of Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are filled with mostly young, mostly male
employees who pack the campus cafeteria at lunch hour to talk about
the intricacies of software programming, snowboarding and power
hiking.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear much talk about Netscape or browser wars up in
Redmond anymore, or even what the judge in the Justice Department's
antitrust case might do to punish the company for illegal
anti-competitive practices. The talk, instead, is all about coming
up with more compelling start pages and developing technology
similar, but not too similar, to Amazon.com's one-click ordering
system. The last thing Microsoft needs is for legal history to
repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft employees appear to be a middle-American, fairly
apolitical bunch, much more interested in programming and
delivering new products on time to consumers than the fact a judge
recently ruled the company they work for is a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem to bother them that the company that signs their
checks and gives them their millionaire-making stock options has
been branded as a company that illegally bullied its rivals,
stifled software innovation and basically did a lot of
less-than-noble things to dominate the software and later the
Internet marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   While company founder Bill Gates does TV commercials and huddles
with advisers in both Washington state and Washington, D.C., it's
pretty much business as usual at the Microsoft campus. Employees
would rather talk about their work. When it comes to the Web, they
are doing some pretty fascinating work. Right now, Microsoft is
producing some of the best Web sites around. The company has built
a new search engine (search.msn.com) as good as any search engine
on the Web. Its travel and real estate spinoffs, Expedia
(www.expedia.com) and HomeAdvisor (www.homeadvisor.com), are two of
the best sites in their respective categories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before it was trendy, Microsoft's Web team decided it
couldn't care less about how users get access to the Web. They
couldn't care less whether you get to the Microsoft Network from
your computer, your cell phone, your Palm Pilot or even your
wristwatch. They just want you to log on from somewhere and go
straight to the Microsoft Network of sites.
</P>
<P>
   This is revolutionary thinking coming from a company whose
entire business and the legal debacle that followed was based on
dominating the personal desktop computer. Analysts aren't really
sure if Microsoft's strategy will pay off, but it won't be for lack
of enthusiasm or lack of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has always been a company that needs to clearly define
an enemy to aim at. With the new emphasis on the Web rather than
software, the employees are now talking about Yahoo and Amazon.
They're interested in forming partnerships with companies that can
put good-quality content together with their whiz-bang technology
to make the Microsoft network of sites truly indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the deepest pockets in the industry, Microsoft is
still late to the party. As many analysts will tell you, when it
comes to the Web, if you are going to be late, you might as well
not show up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, because of its sheer size and influence, has often
been able to break those rules. If it can overcome a late start
with sophisticated Web functions that run on multiple platforms,
the company might be able to overcome the obstacles that could trip
up other lesser players.
</P>
<P>
   Finding and building software for a brave new world no longer
chained to the desktop is far more interesting to Microsoft's rank
and file than a legal battle being fought 3,000 miles away in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Microsoft case, most employees seem to
think everything will be all right in the end, and the free sodas
in the break rooms will keep flowing. Most say they are more than
confident that Gates, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer and as
many lawyers as Microsoft can buy will sort the whole mess out.
</P>
<P>
   What goes on in the boardroom and the courtroom doesn't make a
whole lot of difference to the people who actually make the
software that contributed to one of the most controversial
antitrust cases in history. That's their story, and every employee
seems to be sticking to it.

 &HT;    New Netscape 6 has many features average surfers could find
difficult to use.
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Netscape 6 is not fun.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, busy, flashy and can be just plain annoying. Netscape
took two years to dream up this mishmash of features, pull-down
menus, wacky toolbars and icons.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Netscape was the market leader in Web browsers _
the Internet software that enables computer users to surf the Web.
Microsoft also makes Web surfing software called Internet Explorer
that comes on every computer that runs the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling browsers _ so named because people can use them to
``browse'' the World Wide Web _ led to the antitrust suit against
Microsoft. The Justice Department and 19 states claimed Microsoft
used unfair business practices to edge Netscape out of the market,
which it nearly did. Microsoft currently has around 65 percent of
the market to Netscape's 35 percent. Netscape is hoping its latest
browser will help it regain lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the way it looks right now, it's just going to drive users
away.
</P>
<P>
   If you want or expect all the features Netscape 6 offers, forget
the browser and just log on to America Online. The menu bars across
the top and the bottom bear a striking resemblance to AOL's version
5.0.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, America Online owns Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle said the browser looks more like a
souped-up version of the America Online software than a Web
browser, and that's right on the money. But other aspects of the
service like the pull-down menus look a lot like the Microsoft
Network, so there is something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   So just when you got to thinking you were a Web surfing
superstar ordering everything from books to antique pottery on the
Web, Netscape 6 swoops in and changes everything.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll get out of Netscape 6 is exactly what you put into
it. Using Netscape 6 on a daily basis requires a lot of time, a lot
of effort and a lot of waiting, no matter how much broadband you
may have streaming into your home.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have a lot of time and a lot of energy and don't
mind filling out forms, you'll love Netscape 6. If you don't mind
sitting at your computer playing games and reading magazines while
it tries to process the information you've just entered, this also
is a great program for you.
</P>
<P>
   However, if your Web browser needs are pretty much confined to
visiting a few favorite sites, and maybe engaging in a little bit
of electronic commerce along the way, stay far, far away from
Netscape 6 until the company _ or CNet or someone else you rely
upon for your software decisions _ says it's ready for prime time.
It's in a preview release now, which means it is still a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a hearty soul to install and then try to navigate
through Netscape 6, now available to download at
home.netscape.com/download/previewrelease.html.
</P>
<P>
   The installation process is pretty easy, and users can decide
what applications they want and don't want from the new browser.
Netscape 6 also takes up less space than current and previous
versions of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week of fussing and struggling with Netscape 6, it's
safe to say more work needs to be done before ordinary non-geek
consumers can or even should be using it.
</P>
<P>
   This new browser bears no resemblance to any browser you've seen
before. (Rumors are rampant that Microsoft is working on a
similarly feature-filled browser that will be just as flashy and
just as hard to use. Memo to Microsoft: If you want to hang on to
your market lead, leave your Internet Explorer browser alone.)
</P>
<P>
   In its evaluation of the product, CNet said, ``Netscape 6 ain't
soup yet, but it's off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty charitable comment for a product that takes
hours to load and takes up one-quarter of the browser space with a
new feature called Sidebar. If you have the time and endurance, you
can customize Sidebar, a pane taking up about a quarter of the
browser window. Sidebar has special folders users can fill with
anything they'd like, including stock portfolios, weather reports,
movie listings or news updates from CNN and others. There are also
integrated versions of AOL's Instant Messenger and a built-in
version of Net2Phone, which lets you make phone calls over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Web veterans who bravely decide to download Netscape 6 will
notice that Sidebar is very similar to the ill-fated PointCast
service from the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, PointCast and its ``push technology'' were
hailed by Internet soothsayers as the next big thing. The idea of
requesting information and having it ``pushed'' to your desktop
practically bordered on the revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   However, PointCast had many of the same problems Sidebar has.
For example, when Sidebar is updating information, the browser
grinds to a mind-numbing halt. Many companies eventually officially
prohibited employees from downloading PointCast onto their desktop
PCs because when PointCast was updating information on just one
computer, it could freeze up an entire office network.
</P>
<P>
   Even as I'm writing this, I can hear my poor little Pentium II
groaning under the strain of Sidebar as it struggles to update all
the information I've put into it. You know you've hit an all-time
low when you start feeling sorry for a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sidebar also makes Netscape 6 one of the busiest pieces of
software available today. There's so much going on, so many menu
bars and pull-down menus, the actual Web browser seems like an
afterthought. Netscape 6 has a menu bar at the top of the screen
and a menu bar at the bottom of the screen. The familiar
``backward,'' ``forward'' and ``reload'' keys have been replaced
with a series of arrows that look more like international highway
signs than browser buttons. The ``stop'' button is just an ``X,''
which makes me lonesome for the cute little red stoplight that's
been calling a halt to loading pages all these years. I also miss
the little house icon Netscape used to send users back to their
chosen home page.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has stated that it wants Netscape 6 to be a browser that
will work on any platform: the PC, the cellular phone, the personal
digital assistant and even America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The new browser is part of the company's ``AOL Anywhere''
philosophy of providing AOL service regardless what appliance is
used to access the service. But with so many agendas and the sheer
volume of information, toolbars and links all crowded onto the
browser, it looks like a combination of the Microsoft Network,
America Online and even software from Internet service provider
EarthLink, which also offers a detachable ``sidecar'' service that
works with EarthLink's high-profile personal start page.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape 6 looks like a browser built by committee that wants to
be all things to all people and a product for all platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts adore Netscape 6 and have high hopes for the
product in the long run. They may prove right, but from this user's
point of view, there's still a lot of work to be done.

 &HT;    E-mail forwarding - a great way to go
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a recent column we discussed whether your e-mail
address had to change when you switch ISPs. The answer was
something like, ``well, it depends.'' Some readers asked us to clue
y'all in on e-mail forwarding, another great way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: With e-mail forwarding, you can have one e-mail address
for life. You can change ISPs umpteen times and your e-mail address
will stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are several e-mail forwarding services. Many are
free. Their gig is to route e-mail to your ISP account(s). Here are
a few some of our readers suggested: Bigfoot (www.bigfoot.com),
iName (www.iname.com) and akaMail (www.akamail.com).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Interested? Go to an e-mail forwarding site. Pick your
new permanent e-mail address. Give the forwarding service your
current ISP e-mail address so they can forward mail to it. Then
give your permanent address to all your contacts. Any e-mail sent
to that address is automatically forwarded to your ISP e-mail
account, regardless of how many times you switch ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Basically, if I give Mom my Bigfoot e-mail address and
switch from AOL to EarthLink, she'll keep sending to Bigfoot.
Bigfoot kicks it along to my new ISP account.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you switch ISPs, go back to the forwarding service and
update your information. It's like filling out a change-of-address
form for the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You can get more than just e-mail forwarding. Some features
are rolled into your package, and others can be obtained for a fee.
In addition to basic forwarding, options include: autoresponders
that respond to e-mail while you're away; filtering, which allows
you to reject unwanted e-mail or forward it elsewhere; and
anti-spamming, which allows you to block nasty spammers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you're one of those folks with your own Web site, one
of the coolest features is URL forwarding. It allows you to move
your Web site as often as you need to without having to inform
everyone of your new Web address. So, if I'm selling thingamajigs
on my Web page, my clients will never have to be inconvenienced
because I've switched Web-hosting services.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For those who need to be reminded, your e-mail forwarding
service can help you remember holidays, birthdays and
anniversaries, too.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    The DOS world is hanging tough
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The truth is still out there.
</P>
<P>
   For the gentleman who is miffed because Windows no longer comes
with QBasic, two readers, Larry Logue and Jane Halstead, have good
news: You're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executable file and the help file are both in the Windows
98 delivery CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Find it by looking at this address on the CD (fill in the CD
drive letter for your own
computer):(backslash)tools(backslash)oldmsdos on the Windows 98
delivery CD. Simply copy both files to your hard drive, and you are
in business. It will run either in a DOS window or full screen.
</P>
<P>
   I also heard from readers with DOS printing problems, and one of
them is using one of the great old DOS programs, PFS: Professional
File. The PFS series was one of the high points of DOS software, as
far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, he finds that he can't print to modern printers,
and the ``current date'' function always produces the year
``1900.'' Well, the latter is what the Y2K thing was all about,
isn't it? Software Publishing Co., makers of the PFS series, was
sold and the series discontinued before the problem ever occurred
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As for printing, a reader reported he solved his DOS-to-modern
printer problem with a shareware program called Duplex. A cursory
search of a couple of shareware sites didn't turn it up, but it
shouldn't be too hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of printers, another reader kicked sand in my face for
``belittling'' people with dot-matrix printers. I don't belittle
people. I do assume they have a sense of humor, and tease them a
bit. After a couple of personal insults, he goes on to berate
inkjet printers because if not used regularly, the jets will clog.
</P>
<P>
   I found that out, too, and now I make sure to run a test page
through the printer every week if I'm not using it regularly. Seems
a lot easier than listening to a dot-matrix clacking away.
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow, however, writes to point out that impact
printers are still the only thing that will print multipage forms.
He's got me there.
</P>
<P>
   A reader in Denver says he used to run a huge spreadsheet under
DOS on a 386SX machine. Now he's got a new computer running
Windows, with four times the memory of his old one, and it can't
run the spreadsheet the 386 did. ``It is good for wasting time on
the Net, and fooling with pictures. Other than that, near as I can
tell, it's useless.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no arguing the fact that Windows itself eats up a huge
amount of resources. But there are at least two good reasons,
beyond Microsoft's machinations, that Windows has overshadowed DOS.
One of them matters to me, one doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The one that matters to me is the ability to multitask. Running
several programs at once is a very valuable feature for me. More
important to the world in general, however, is the standardization
that Windows imposes.
</P>
<P>
   Business users, not personal users, are the folks who drive the
market, and for them Windows makes training employees far, far
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, neither of those things matters to all the folks who've
been writing to me lately. I admire you, and I love hearing how
you're making things work out there in The Lost World.

 &HT;    Star Trek game makes no gains on TV seriesBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   The problem with episodic action/adventure television is that,
more often than not, it's so, well, formulaic. Likewise is this
digital incarnation of the Roddenberry world, Star Trek: Hidden
Evil ($30; www.acti-vision.com; PC). Taking up where the Next
Generation ``Insurrection'' movie left off, the Enterprise crew
continues to interact with the enigmatic Ba'ku people as they
uncover still more ``advanced technology'' from a long-dead
civilization. Gamers mainly control a Star Fleet ensign, an apt
adventurer who's a little slow on the uptake when it comes to
action. Genre-typical tasks and objectives _ explore, find, unlock,
clash with the enemy every now and again _ mire what is otherwise a
graphically splendid and technically efficient game. Voiceover work
from the likes of Patrick Stewart (Picard) and Brent Spiner (Data)
do well to offer an immersive Star Trekian interactive adventure.
Yet, all said and done, it's an episodic TV-caliber adventure, not
a virtual extravaganza on par with the blockbuster movies.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Wrebbit's first digital incarnation of perplexing
3-D jigsaw puzzles, but the QuickTime dependant Puzz3D CD The
Orient Express from the Twenties ($20; www.wrebbit.com; for the PC
or Mac) is its first blend of genuine jigsaw challenge with more
conventional computer based mind-benders. In and of itself, the
virtual 3-D build-a-train puzzle promises/threatens hours of
well-interfaced point and click, and drag and drop, puzzle play
with difficulty ranging from easy (150 simplistic pieces, a help
menu, some task automated) to ``Super Challenging'' (707 tiny
pieces, no help, no hints). Once completed, Orient Express becomes
an Agatha Christie-inspired virtual mystery, a graphic-intensive
point and click adventure in the tradition of ``Myst'' or
``Riven,'' replete with mini-games involving clue-riddled Mah Jong
tiles/ciphers, code conundrums, music sheet mysteries and more.
Innumerable FMV featurettes present characters and plot lines and
move the mystery along. A well-executed, long-term
mind-messer-upper for a paltry $20.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   For fans of fighting games, the Sega Dreamcast's lineup since
its launch has been an cornucopia of riches. First came the
exquisite ``Soul Calibur,'' and now Tecmo's Dead or Alive 2 ($45,
www.tecmoinc.com), which is, in a word, gorgeous. The game is a
standard fighting game the way the Sistine Chapel has bunch of
squiggles on its ceiling. With great graphics, ultra smooth
game-play and some stellar modes like Tag Team fighting, Dead or
Alive 2 is stunning. The levels are interactive, so throwing an
opponent off a ledge can lead you to another, lower level to
continue a fight. Snow-covered vistas, beautiful gardens and ornate
arenas are just eye candy to the very fun game-play. If we have one
complaint, it's that the game doesn't have as many modes of play as
``Soul Calibur.'' But once you're swapping out players in Tag Team
mode, you won't care.

 &HT;    Delete key probably the best defense against junk e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are times _ lots of them, really _ when I'm over
my head talking about some facet of technology. Things change so
fast and get so complicated that I end up spending a lot of my time
being mystified. But when it comes to junk e-mail, I'm on solid
ground.
</P>
<P>
   I once was a junk-mail king. I spent seven years writing for
mail-order catalogs and putting mailings together. So next time you
open your real-world mailbox and find envelopes telling you that
the ``Smith Family Is Already a Winner'' or that the secret to
consolidating all your credit card bills is inside, curse me.
</P>
<P>
   Junk e-mail is just the modern equivalent of all those mailings
that I worked on so diligently. Both are a major irritant for a lot
of people, and both are almost impossible to stop. I know that junk
e-mail _ spam as it's called _ is becoming an increasingly annoying
problem because I get so many e-mails asking how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of methods, and we'll sure touch on them
because sometimes it helps to at least try to stop an annoyance
rather than just feel helpless. But the bottom line is that, if you
have an e-mail account, you're going to get junk mail addressed to
you. And a high proportion of this mail will be offensive in some
way. They'll either insult your intelligence with stupid get-rich
offers, or they'll offend your sensibilities with X-rated offers
that are blatant, even in the e-mail itself.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about what not to do. Most junk mail includes
instructions for being removed from future mailing lists. Don't
comply. While some legitimate mailers really will remove you, it's
impossible to know who is legitimate and who isn't. By replying,
you are actually making your e-mail address more valuable to the
e-mailer. It can then be sold as an address that has proven valid
and active. The exception to this rule is if you get an e-mail from
a brand-name company. Then you are probably safe in asking that
your name be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, don't give in to the temptation to write back and chew out
the mailer _ for the same reason you shouldn't ask to be removed
from the list. You'll just increase the chances of even more
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what can you do? Keep in mind my opinion that none of these
techniques will noticeably decrease the amount of junk mail you
get. That's a fact of life. But you can try to discourage specific
mailers. One good way to do that is to write and complain to the
folks at the Internet provider used by the mailer. There are Web
sites such as www.bankes.com/nslookup.htm that will let you look up
the administrators at a site. Just go to the site and follow the
directions to find the names, addresses and even telephone numbers
of the administrators. All that said, be warned that many junk mail
abusers use free and low-rent sites that frankly don't care whether
you're angry or not. But you can try.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet providers also offer software filters that help
remove junk mail. For instance, if you have an EarthLink account,
you can use what that service calls the Spaminator. Other providers
also have similar features, designed to filter out junk mail. So,
write an e-mail to your provider and ask them.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail programs themselves _ Microsoft's Outlook and Eudora's
professional version, or its new free version _ sometimes offer
ways for you to filter the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can do what I do. Just read the headers and press
the delete key and forget it. The best way to eliminate junk e-mail
is to avoid responding, avoid buying. That's a slower filter but
one that _ if enough people do it _ is guaranteed to solve the
problem.

 &HT;    Language translation sites inexact but helpful
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Medan europeer ofta kan tala flera sprak flytande, de
flesta amerikaner ar okunniga i andra sprak.
</P>
<P>
   If that Swedish doesn't make sense to you, you're not alone. The
translation is: ``While Europeans often are fluent in several
languages, most Americans are ignorant of other languages.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be the World Wide Web, but when it comes to reading
information in other languages, most of us are at a loss. Even if
you took Spanish or French in school, most of us are awkward at
best when it comes to following the conversational language you are
likely to find on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There is help for that, right on the Web. If you're an
experienced user, you probably know that there are free online
translation services available. One of the best known is called
BabelFish, a service provided by the AltaVista Web site
(www.altavista.com). You can either click on the link called
``translation'' on that page, or go directly to
babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?.
</P>
<P>
   Just as is true with some of the other, less well known sites
that we'll visit in this column, you need to manage expectations
when you use the service. Don't expect the sort of letter-perfect
translation you'd get from a professional translator. This
translation is done by software, and the results can vary between
pretty good and really funny. But the text, in most cases, will be
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of BabelFish, you'll have a choice of French,
German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. You can translate from
English into one of those languages, or from any of those languages
into English.
</P>
<P>
   Some other sites offer a broader selection of languages. One is
Inter-Tran, located at www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran. There are
too many languages available here to list them all but _ besides
those found at AltaVista _ you can add Swedish, Dutch, Finnish,
Japanese, Russian, Icelandic and Croatian, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   At both sites, you can either type or paste in the text you want
to translate or list the URL for the Web page that needs
translating.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a quick laugh _ and also a demonstration of the
relative lack of sophistication of the software _ translate an easy
sentence from English to another language and then use the
translator to return that translation to English. You'll see why
these services would not be good enough for a final translation of
an important business letter or a marriage proposal.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to learn a little bit about the language and to
try it yourself if you already have some skill in that particular
language. The Web also offers online dictionaries in other
languages that can help you over the rough spots. One to check out
is the Logos dictionary at www.logos.it/dictionary/owa/sp?lg &QC; EN.
You'll find a wide selection of languages and can use the
dictionary to translate both words and brief phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Also at that site you'll find games such as crossword puzzles
and anagrams that can help make learning or practicing another
language fun.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, instead of a translation, you are preparing for a trip
to another country and would like to be able to speak and
understand a few basic phrases in the language. Knowing even a
little of the host country's language can open up people's hearts
and make for a more enjoyable trip.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent site for this type of work is called Foreign
Languages for Travelers and can be found at
www.travlang.com/languages/.
</P>
<P>
   There's a broad selection of languages to choose from here, more
than can be listed. Once you settle on a language, you can take
easy online lessons that teach you the basics: how to say hello and
goodbye, ask for directions (understanding them when spoken fast in
an unfamiliar language is another matter), book a room in a hotel
or order a simple meal.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that is especially helpful _ since words in another
language often follow different rules for pronunciation than in
English _ is the use of audio so that you can hear a native speaker
say the word or phrase you are learning. You'll also find quizzes
that test you on your new-found knowledge.

 &HT;    Microsoft workers unfazed by ruling
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Web, not the government, is the hot topic at the
sprawling Microsoft campus set against a backdrop of breathtaking
mountains in the Seattle suburb of Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are filled with mostly young, mostly male
employees who pack the campus cafeteria at lunch hour to talk about
the intricacies of software programming, snowboarding and power
hiking.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear much talk about Netscape or browser wars up in
Redmond anymore, or even what the judge in the Justice Department's
antitrust case might do to punish the company for illegal
anti-competitive practices. The talk, instead, is all about coming
up with more compelling start pages and developing technology
similar, but not too similar, to Amazon.com's one-click ordering
system. The last thing Microsoft needs is for legal history to
repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft employees appear to be a middle-American, fairly
apolitical bunch, much more interested in programming and
delivering new products on time to consumers than the fact a judge
recently ruled the company they work for is a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem to bother them that the company that signs their
checks and gives them their millionaire-making stock options has
been branded as a company that illegally bullied its rivals,
stifled software innovation and basically did a lot of
less-than-noble things to dominate the software and later the
Internet marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   While company founder Bill Gates does TV commercials and huddles
with advisers in both Washington state and Washington, D.C., it's
pretty much business as usual at the Microsoft campus. Employees
would rather talk about their work. When it comes to the Web, they
are doing some pretty fascinating work. Right now, Microsoft is
producing some of the best Web sites around. The company has built
a new search engine (search.msn.com) as good as any search engine
on the Web. Its travel and real estate spinoffs, Expedia
(www.expedia.com) and HomeAdvisor (www.homeadvisor.com), are two of
the best sites in their respective categories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before it was trendy, Microsoft's Web team decided it
couldn't care less about how users get access to the Web. They
couldn't care less whether you get to the Microsoft Network from
your computer, your cell phone, your Palm Pilot or even your
wristwatch. They just want you to log on from somewhere and go
straight to the Microsoft Network of sites.
</P>
<P>
   This is revolutionary thinking coming from a company whose
entire business and the legal debacle that followed was based on
dominating the personal desktop computer. Analysts aren't really
sure if Microsoft's strategy will pay off, but it won't be for lack
of enthusiasm or lack of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has always been a company that needs to clearly define
an enemy to aim at. With the new emphasis on the Web rather than
software, the employees are now talking about Yahoo and Amazon.
They're interested in forming partnerships with companies that can
put good-quality content together with their whiz-bang technology
to make the Microsoft network of sites truly indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the deepest pockets in the industry, Microsoft is
still late to the party. As many analysts will tell you, when it
comes to the Web, if you are going to be late, you might as well
not show up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, because of its sheer size and influence, has often
been able to break those rules. If it can overcome a late start
with sophisticated Web functions that run on multiple platforms,
the company might be able to overcome the obstacles that could trip
up other lesser players.
</P>
<P>
   Finding and building software for a brave new world no longer
chained to the desktop is far more interesting to Microsoft's rank
and file than a legal battle being fought 3,000 miles away in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Microsoft case, most employees seem to
think everything will be all right in the end, and the free sodas
in the break rooms will keep flowing. Most say they are more than
confident that Gates, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer and as
many lawyers as Microsoft can buy will sort the whole mess out.
</P>
<P>
   What goes on in the boardroom and the courtroom doesn't make a
whole lot of difference to the people who actually make the
software that contributed to one of the most controversial
antitrust cases in history. That's their story, and every employee
seems to be sticking to it.

 &HT;    New Netscape 6 has many features average surfers could find
difficult to use.
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Netscape 6 is not fun.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, busy, flashy and can be just plain annoying. Netscape
took two years to dream up this mishmash of features, pull-down
menus, wacky toolbars and icons.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Netscape was the market leader in Web browsers _
the Internet software that enables computer users to surf the Web.
Microsoft also makes Web surfing software called Internet Explorer
that comes on every computer that runs the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling browsers _ so named because people can use them to
``browse'' the World Wide Web _ led to the antitrust suit against
Microsoft. The Justice Department and 19 states claimed Microsoft
used unfair business practices to edge Netscape out of the market,
which it nearly did. Microsoft currently has around 65 percent of
the market to Netscape's 35 percent. Netscape is hoping its latest
browser will help it regain lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the way it looks right now, it's just going to drive users
away.
</P>
<P>
   If you want or expect all the features Netscape 6 offers, forget
the browser and just log on to America Online. The menu bars across
the top and the bottom bear a striking resemblance to AOL's version
5.0.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, America Online owns Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle said the browser looks more like a
souped-up version of the America Online software than a Web
browser, and that's right on the money. But other aspects of the
service like the pull-down menus look a lot like the Microsoft
Network, so there is something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   So just when you got to thinking you were a Web surfing
superstar ordering everything from books to antique pottery on the
Web, Netscape 6 swoops in and changes everything.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll get out of Netscape 6 is exactly what you put into
it. Using Netscape 6 on a daily basis requires a lot of time, a lot
of effort and a lot of waiting, no matter how much broadband you
may have streaming into your home.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have a lot of time and a lot of energy and don't
mind filling out forms, you'll love Netscape 6. If you don't mind
sitting at your computer playing games and reading magazines while
it tries to process the information you've just entered, this also
is a great program for you.
</P>
<P>
   However, if your Web browser needs are pretty much confined to
visiting a few favorite sites, and maybe engaging in a little bit
of electronic commerce along the way, stay far, far away from
Netscape 6 until the company _ or CNet or someone else you rely
upon for your software decisions _ says it's ready for prime time.
It's in a preview release now, which means it is still a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a hearty soul to install and then try to navigate
through Netscape 6, now available to download at
home.netscape.com/download/previewrelease.html.
</P>
<P>
   The installation process is pretty easy, and users can decide
what applications they want and don't want from the new browser.
Netscape 6 also takes up less space than current and previous
versions of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week of fussing and struggling with Netscape 6, it's
safe to say more work needs to be done before ordinary non-geek
consumers can or even should be using it.
</P>
<P>
   This new browser bears no resemblance to any browser you've seen
before. (Rumors are rampant that Microsoft is working on a
similarly feature-filled browser that will be just as flashy and
just as hard to use. Memo to Microsoft: If you want to hang on to
your market lead, leave your Internet Explorer browser alone.)
</P>
<P>
   In its evaluation of the product, CNet said, ``Netscape 6 ain't
soup yet, but it's off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty charitable comment for a product that takes
hours to load and takes up one-quarter of the browser space with a
new feature called Sidebar. If you have the time and endurance, you
can customize Sidebar, a pane taking up about a quarter of the
browser window. Sidebar has special folders users can fill with
anything they'd like, including stock portfolios, weather reports,
movie listings or news updates from CNN and others. There are also
integrated versions of AOL's Instant Messenger and a built-in
version of Net2Phone, which lets you make phone calls over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Web veterans who bravely decide to download Netscape 6 will
notice that Sidebar is very similar to the ill-fated PointCast
service from the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, PointCast and its ``push technology'' were
hailed by Internet soothsayers as the next big thing. The idea of
requesting information and having it ``pushed'' to your desktop
practically bordered on the revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   However, PointCast had many of the same problems Sidebar has.
For example, when Sidebar is updating information, the browser
grinds to a mind-numbing halt. Many companies eventually officially
prohibited employees from downloading PointCast onto their desktop
PCs because when PointCast was updating information on just one
computer, it could freeze up an entire office network.
</P>
<P>
   Even as I'm writing this, I can hear my poor little Pentium II
groaning under the strain of Sidebar as it struggles to update all
the information I've put into it. You know you've hit an all-time
low when you start feeling sorry for a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sidebar also makes Netscape 6 one of the busiest pieces of
software available today. There's so much going on, so many menu
bars and pull-down menus, the actual Web browser seems like an
afterthought. Netscape 6 has a menu bar at the top of the screen
and a menu bar at the bottom of the screen. The familiar
``backward,'' ``forward'' and ``reload'' keys have been replaced
with a series of arrows that look more like international highway
signs than browser buttons. The ``stop'' button is just an ``X,''
which makes me lonesome for the cute little red stoplight that's
been calling a halt to loading pages all these years. I also miss
the little house icon Netscape used to send users back to their
chosen home page.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has stated that it wants Netscape 6 to be a browser that
will work on any platform: the PC, the cellular phone, the personal
digital assistant and even America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The new browser is part of the company's ``AOL Anywhere''
philosophy of providing AOL service regardless what appliance is
used to access the service. But with so many agendas and the sheer
volume of information, toolbars and links all crowded onto the
browser, it looks like a combination of the Microsoft Network,
America Online and even software from Internet service provider
EarthLink, which also offers a detachable ``sidecar'' service that
works with EarthLink's high-profile personal start page.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape 6 looks like a browser built by committee that wants to
be all things to all people and a product for all platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts adore Netscape 6 and have high hopes for the
product in the long run. They may prove right, but from this user's
point of view, there's still a lot of work to be done.

 &HT;    E-mail forwarding - a great way to go
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a recent column we discussed whether your e-mail
address had to change when you switch ISPs. The answer was
something like, ``well, it depends.'' Some readers asked us to clue
y'all in on e-mail forwarding, another great way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: With e-mail forwarding, you can have one e-mail address
for life. You can change ISPs umpteen times and your e-mail address
will stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are several e-mail forwarding services. Many are
free. Their gig is to route e-mail to your ISP account(s). Here are
a few some of our readers suggested: Bigfoot (www.bigfoot.com),
iName (www.iname.com) and akaMail (www.akamail.com).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Interested? Go to an e-mail forwarding site. Pick your
new permanent e-mail address. Give the forwarding service your
current ISP e-mail address so they can forward mail to it. Then
give your permanent address to all your contacts. Any e-mail sent
to that address is automatically forwarded to your ISP e-mail
account, regardless of how many times you switch ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Basically, if I give Mom my Bigfoot e-mail address and
switch from AOL to EarthLink, she'll keep sending to Bigfoot.
Bigfoot kicks it along to my new ISP account.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you switch ISPs, go back to the forwarding service and
update your information. It's like filling out a change-of-address
form for the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You can get more than just e-mail forwarding. Some features
are rolled into your package, and others can be obtained for a fee.
In addition to basic forwarding, options include: autoresponders
that respond to e-mail while you're away; filtering, which allows
you to reject unwanted e-mail or forward it elsewhere; and
anti-spamming, which allows you to block nasty spammers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you're one of those folks with your own Web site, one
of the coolest features is URL forwarding. It allows you to move
your Web site as often as you need to without having to inform
everyone of your new Web address. So, if I'm selling thingamajigs
on my Web page, my clients will never have to be inconvenienced
because I've switched Web-hosting services.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For those who need to be reminded, your e-mail forwarding
service can help you remember holidays, birthdays and
anniversaries, too.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    The DOS world is hanging tough
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The truth is still out there.
</P>
<P>
   For the gentleman who is miffed because Windows no longer comes
with QBasic, two readers, Larry Logue and Jane Halstead, have good
news: You're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executable file and the help file are both in the Windows
98 delivery CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Find it by looking at this address on the CD (fill in the CD
drive letter for your own
computer):(backslash)tools(backslash)oldmsdos on the Windows 98
delivery CD. Simply copy both files to your hard drive, and you are
in business. It will run either in a DOS window or full screen.
</P>
<P>
   I also heard from readers with DOS printing problems, and one of
them is using one of the great old DOS programs, PFS: Professional
File. The PFS series was one of the high points of DOS software, as
far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, he finds that he can't print to modern printers,
and the ``current date'' function always produces the year
``1900.'' Well, the latter is what the Y2K thing was all about,
isn't it? Software Publishing Co., makers of the PFS series, was
sold and the series discontinued before the problem ever occurred
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As for printing, a reader reported he solved his DOS-to-modern
printer problem with a shareware program called Duplex. A cursory
search of a couple of shareware sites didn't turn it up, but it
shouldn't be too hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of printers, another reader kicked sand in my face for
``belittling'' people with dot-matrix printers. I don't belittle
people. I do assume they have a sense of humor, and tease them a
bit. After a couple of personal insults, he goes on to berate
inkjet printers because if not used regularly, the jets will clog.
</P>
<P>
   I found that out, too, and now I make sure to run a test page
through the printer every week if I'm not using it regularly. Seems
a lot easier than listening to a dot-matrix clacking away.
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow, however, writes to point out that impact
printers are still the only thing that will print multipage forms.
He's got me there.
</P>
<P>
   A reader in Denver says he used to run a huge spreadsheet under
DOS on a 386SX machine. Now he's got a new computer running
Windows, with four times the memory of his old one, and it can't
run the spreadsheet the 386 did. ``It is good for wasting time on
the Net, and fooling with pictures. Other than that, near as I can
tell, it's useless.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no arguing the fact that Windows itself eats up a huge
amount of resources. But there are at least two good reasons,
beyond Microsoft's machinations, that Windows has overshadowed DOS.
One of them matters to me, one doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The one that matters to me is the ability to multitask. Running
several programs at once is a very valuable feature for me. More
important to the world in general, however, is the standardization
that Windows imposes.
</P>
<P>
   Business users, not personal users, are the folks who drive the
market, and for them Windows makes training employees far, far
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, neither of those things matters to all the folks who've
been writing to me lately. I admire you, and I love hearing how
you're making things work out there in The Lost World.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:Where can I write to Lauren Hutton? Also, on Home and Garden
TV there is a program called ``The Designer's Landscape.'' The
host, Gary Alan, does excellent upgrades on people's yards. How are
those yards selected? Mine is in need of desperate help and I would
love to have him redo it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kay C.
</P>
<P>
   A: The stunning Hutton may be contacted in care of William
Morris Agency, 151 El Camino, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90212. Gary
Alan owns a landscaping contracting company and personally selects
a few jobs to air on the popular program out of the many paid jobs
he does. He charges $1,000 for a consultation plus travel and
accommodations. After the consultation, Alan can propose a
landscape restoration. To schedule a consultation, call Wade
Barlow, general manager, (800) 396-0611 Q: I am moving to
Georgetown from Arizona and am looking for hiking groups in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Colorado River Walkers members are young, old and in-between,
married and single, fast walkers and stroll-along (my category).
Annual dues ($10) include the entire family. Call 495-6294 for a
membership package or visit www.onr.com/user/dbarber/crw. Happy
trails. Q: Please settle a bet about which actress plays opposite
Jason Alexander in the Visa Check Card commercial. He is going to
the movies with an actress I believe is Marisa Tomei as per their
``Seinfeld'' skits. My wife and others insist it is not her!
</P>
<P>
   _ C.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your wife wins. Brian Young of Untitled Entertainment
confirms that the actress is not Marisa Tomei, but Kari Wuhrer, who
plays Margaret Beckett on the television show ``Sliders.'' Q: I am
looking for a Special Olympics cap or T-shirt for a little boy. I
try to encourage him every time I see him struggling in his walker
or wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   _Verda H. A: Call Midwest Trophy, (800) 324-5996, the official
supplier of Special Olympics paraphernalia. You can order a T-shirt
for around $12 and a cap for $14 or request a catalog. Midwest also
makes Special Olympic trophies and medals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the beginning and ending years for the birth of baby
boomers? Also there are only five states left in the United States
that do not have a state income tax _Texas, Florida, New Hampshire
and Tennessee. What is the fifth?
</P>
<P>
   _W. C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Discourses on age disagree on the boomer definition.
Generally, the boom began with those born in 1946. Susan Mitchell
in ``The Official Guide to the Generations'' defined the baby
boomers as those born between 1946-1964. Alaska, Florida, Nevada,
Texas, Wyoming, Washington and South Dakota do not have a state
income tax, according to the folks at the Federation of Tax
Administrators (imagine how wild their conventions must be). New
Hampshire and Tennessee have a state income tax limited to dividend
and interest income. For specifics, visit www.taxadmin.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since I was little bitty, I have always wanted to sing on the
TV show ``Star Search.'' But before I even had a chance, it was
canceled. I heard auditions were being held for a new show entitled
``Star Search 2000.'' Do you have the contact?

beach cruising. I firmly believe that this beer is all about
hanging out rather than the hardcore lifestyle associated with
mountain biking. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Sarah D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fat Tire began with a loyal small-town following in Colorado,
says New Belgium Brewery spokeswoman Pam Schmidt, but now defies
demographic studies. Customers range from of-age college students
to of-a-certain-age retirees, from fly fishermen to hard-core
bikers. Some beer aficionados think the trendy Fat Tire is
overrated (guess value is in the stein of the quaffer). By the way,
New Belgium Brewery purports to be the only wind-powered brewery in
the United States.Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for

area.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Colorado River Walkers members are young, old and in-between,
married and single, fast walkers and stroll-along (my category).
Annual dues ($10) include the entire family. Call 495-6294 for a
membership package or visit www.onr.com/user/dbarber/crw. Happy
trails. Q: Please settle a bet about which actress plays opposite
Jason Alexander in the Visa Check Card commercial. He is going to
the movies with an actress I believe is Marisa Tomei as per their
``Seinfeld'' skits. My wife and others insist it is not her!
</P>
<P>
   _ C.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your wife wins. Brian Young of Untitled Entertainment
confirms that the actress is not Marisa Tomei, but Kari Wuhrer, who
plays Margaret Beckett on the television show ``Sliders.'' Q: I am
looking for a Special Olympics cap or T-shirt for a little boy. I
try to encourage him every time I see him struggling in his walker
or wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   _Verda H. A: Call Midwest Trophy, (800) 324-5996, the official
supplier of Special Olympics paraphernalia. You can order a T-shirt
for around $12 and a cap for $14 or request a catalog. Midwest also
makes Special Olympic trophies and medals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the beginning and ending years for the birth of baby
boomers? Also there are only five states left in the United States
that do not have a state income tax _Texas, Florida, New Hampshire
and Tennessee. What is the fifth?
</P>
<P>
   _W. C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Discourses on age disagree on the boomer definition.
Generally, the boom began with those born in 1946. Susan Mitchell
in ``The Official Guide to the Generations'' defined the baby
boomers as those born between 1946-1964. Alaska, Florida, Nevada,
Texas, Wyoming, Washington and South Dakota do not have a state
income tax, according to the folks at the Federation of Tax
Administrators (imagine how wild their conventions must be). New
Hampshire and Tennessee have a state income tax limited to dividend
and interest income. For specifics, visit www.taxadmin.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since I was little bitty, I have always wanted to sing on the
TV show ``Star Search.'' But before I even had a chance, it was
canceled. I heard auditions were being held for a new show entitled
``Star Search 2000.'' Do you have the contact?

 &HT;    Disclaimers offer legal protection
 &HT;    By Brett Thurman

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I have noticed that in the ads for prescription
drugs the pharmaceutical companies run, they always include a list
of possible side effects in the legalese disclaimer at the end. I
saw one advertising something to help you with toenail fungus, and
the possible side effects included kidney problems and seizures!
Who in their right mind would trade their kidneys for nicer
toenails? What gives here?
</P>
<P>
   A: We at LegalEase deplore any and all legalese, and welcome
this opportunity to examine this new and sometimes amusing source
of same.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, you should know that reading the rest of this
column may satisfy your curiosity, but could lead to higher blood
pressure, pulling of hair and your dog getting kicked.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main reasons for these darkly cynical sources of
humor. First and foremost, there is a federal law that requires
possible side effects be mentioned in drug advertising. Not
surprisingly, the drug companies would probably play it safe and
put these disclaimers in even if the law did not require it. There
is a brave new world of potential liability just opening up as a
result of widespread direct advertising of drugs to the ultimate
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The old liability rules _ back before patients got much
information directly from the drug companies _ were pretty clear.
The government would approve a drug. Drug companies dealt
exclusively with doctors, and doctors dealt exclusively with
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Patients could under certain circumstances sue the drug
companies. But there were a lot of protections available to the
drug companies as a result of the fact they got government approval
of the drug and then limited their dealings to the doctors who
prescribed the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies recently discovered they could sell more of
their drugs if patients (and hypochondriacs) watching at home only
knew it was available and could then rush to their doctor to ``ask
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the good news. The bad news is that a variable in the
old relationships has changed. The drug companies are now
communicating with the consumer, and the consumer is now a
decision-maker in the drug-taking process.
</P>
<P>
   This change may or may not alter the old liability rules. It
takes a while for a significant number of medical conditions to
arise and work their way through the courts. Drug companies are
profitable enough that lucrative settlements often make more sense
than risking a trial that could create new and unfavorable law, so
most cases settle without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more, the drug companies anticipate, plaintiffs
will sue for complications allegedly caused by taking a drug that
was advertised. One of the things that will be mentioned at trial
is how the drug companies seduced the consumer into taking the drug
with their advertising. Not only did this drug company make an
unsafe product, it will be claimed, it also took out ads trying to
get people to ask for it from their doctors! That's two bad things,
not just one.
</P>
<P>
   These disclaimers would give the drug companies a better chance
to raise an affirmative defense of ``assumption of the risk.'' The
more specific the list of possible side effects, the better this
defense is.

 &HT;    Color TV, in black and white
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We're a nation racially divided _ except for
football fans. And, shall we say, mature viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently all couch potatoes, black and white, hunker down for
``Monday Night Football.'' We're a rainbow coalition that huddles
around the tube to start the work week watching grown men smash
helmets. It's a long-standing racial crossover unparalleled in TV
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' might break that monopoly if
it sticks around long enough. At the time of the latest demographic
survey, however, the ABC game show was dubbed a special rather than
a series. While it ranked high among whites and blacks (despite the
low number of black contestants), it has not been evaluated for a
full season. Experts say it might crack the Top 20 in black
households but probably not the Top 10. And it appears to be
cooling off.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, black and white viewers tend to watch different
shows, a trend long demonstrated by Nielsen Media Research's annual
demographic survey. Only one show is a crossover hit in each
group's Top 10, and only six in the Top 20.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest report by New York ad agency BBDO finds a new
twist: Older viewers, regardless of race, seem to have similar
tastes. Teens used to watch the same shows, but now it's the
50-plus gang, the semi-geezers, who are coming together. Seven of
the Top 10 shows in older black households are in the Top 10 for
all old-viewer households. Among this racially diverse group's
favorites: football, news and drama. ``60 Minutes'' is the No. 1
show on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a lifestyle difference,'' says Doug Alligood,
senior vice president of BBDO and author of the yearly survey of
black viewing habits. ``An older black viewer may have more in
common with an older white person than he does with a young black
person. Older whites and blacks don't dig the music or humor of the
younger groups either.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been true for some time, so why are older black and white
viewers suddenly sharing favorite TV shows?
</P>
<P>
   ``The over-50 viewer has never been a demographic coveted by
advertisers, and that's become even more true this season,'' says
Tina Pieraccini, professor of communication studies at the State
University of New York in Oswego. ``By emphasizing teen
programming, there are so few shows left for over-50 viewers that
everybody in that age group is watching the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alligood has analyzed racial demographics for two decades and
witnessed the various shifts in viewing patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and white teens used to like many of the same
programs,'' he says. ``It used to be that teens crossed over
tremendously to Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, a racially mixed teen audience watched ``21
Jump Street,'' ``In Living Color,'' ``Beverly Hills, 90210,''
``Living Single'' and ``Married ... With Children'' _ all on Fox.
The youth-oriented upstart network had decided to go after teens in
a big way to launch the network.
</P>
<P>
   But with the arrival of the UPN and WB networks, programmers
zoomed in even tighter on specific segments of the youth market,
changing program style to meet the needs of advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As cable TV arrived and all the programmers started trying to
appeal to smaller segments of the audience, the audience
fragmented,'' Pieraccini says. ``It's too bad it's so fragmented
now, but it really has more to do with the structure of the
industry trying to meet the needs of advertisers than the consumers
themselves. It's an economic explanation with societal
ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The sitcoms popular among black teens now are the so-called
``black experience'' sitcoms like ``Moesha'' and ``Grown-Ups.''
They're all on UPN and the WB (not a single top black favorite is
on Fox), and they're not remotely popular with white teens. For
example, UPN's ``The Parkers'' is No. 1 among black teens and 122nd
among white teens. (The one teen crossover hit is UPN's wrestling,
but that's almost too scary to consider.)
</P>
<P>
   Older black viewers are even less taken with the black sitcoms
than white teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPN and the WB have sitcoms that are almost pure in their
style of black stand-up comedy,'' Alligood says. ``They probably
have a pinpointed appeal in the black community among younger
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, humor is so specific to a culture and age group that
none of the Top 20 crossover shows is a comedy. But it wasn't
always that way. NBC's mega-hit ``The Cosby Show'' (1984-92)
crossed all racial and generation lines. It was a huge hit among
kids, parents and grandparents, marrieds and singles, blacks and
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has come close to the broad appeal of ``The Cosby
Show,'' not even Bill Cosby himself. His current CBS sitcom,
``Cosby,'' never a major hit, is going off the air Friday due to
lackluster ratings. Although criticized by some blacks for not
being ``black enough,'' ``The Cosby Show'' single-handedly revived
the sagging sitcom genre and brought millions to the box.
</P>
<P>
   What was its appeal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Cosby stressed how much alike we are rather than how
different we are,'' Alligood says. ``Color had very little to do
with the situational humor in that show. There was a funny but
strict dad, a mother who was generally strict but also loving, and
brothers and sisters who teased the heck out of each other. There
were trappings that showed they were proud of who they were _
paintings by black artists, sweatshirts from black colleges. But
there was very little racial context.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the races are more likely to come together over
dramas than sitcoms. Both groups can more easily relate to the
stories, characters and emotions in dramas. As Alligood says,
there's a ``universality to drama, good vs. evil,'' that appeals to
everyone. It probably doesn't hurt that popular crossover dramas
like ``ER'' and ``The Practice'' have multiracial casts, but black
fans don't tune out when the black characters aren't featured one
week.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences between black and white viewers are striking
_ perhaps predictably so with the much-talked about lack of
diversity on last fall's new shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the lack of diversity had some impact,''
Alligood says. ``We went from a lot of separation many years ago to
coming together to going apart again. There are so many more
choices it may have been inevitable, and the networks have made no
overt effort to lure the black audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics can give a false impression. Alligood says there's
``a pattern but no proof positive that blacks are in a world unto
themselves'' when it comes to TV viewing. Certainly black viewers
are more willing to watch so-called white shows than vice versa.
For some reason, white viewers still have trouble relating to the
black experience when there isn't a white best friend, co-worker or
goofy family next door.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we shouldn't worry so much about our separate viewing
habits. Maybe we should celebrate the fact that there are shows
specifically geared to blacks, since for so long there were none
(with the exception of ``Amos 'n' Andy'') that featured people of
</P>
<P>
   color.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wonderful if another crossover hit like ``Cosby''
came along that could give us a shared pop-culture experience. But
maybe that's not necessary. Maybe we should just watch football,
game shows and the occasional drama together and wait until we're
all over 50 _ we'll all be watching the same things then anyway.

 &HT;    Palm Pilots can get you there
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hand-held organizers have always been able to
manage your to-do lists so you aren't late for important
appointments, and they can store phone numbers so you can call
ahead even if you are running late.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can also help you find your way to that appointment
just about anywhere in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Rand McNally, the map people, have developed a mapping and
global positioning system (GPS) device designed to work with the
Palm III and Palm V organizers.
</P>
<P>
   StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 comes with a GPS antenna that plugs
directly into the back of the organizer. As you travel, the antenna
calculates your exact position by correlating signals from a
network of orbiting satellites and displays your position on a map
on the screen of the organizer.
</P>
<P>
   If you program the system with the route you want to follow, it
displays text messages telling you when and in which direction to
turn to reach your destination.
</P>
<P>
   To program the Palm organizer with the maps and directions you
need, you have to link the organizer to your personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 comes with StreetFinder CD-ROM software
that lets you access maps and directions through your home
computer. Using the software, you can look up specific addresses
for office buildings, restaurants, hotels and other services along
your travel route anywhere in the United States, Canada and most of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've compiled your travel information on the personal
computer, you can download it to your organizer and attach it to
the GPS antenna inside your car. The system also comes with a
bracket for attaching the unit to the windshield, plus rechargeable
batteries, a cigarette lighter power supply plug and an AC adapter.
</P>
<P>
   The StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 for the Palm III can be ordered
online from Rand McNally's Web site at www.randmcnally.com for
$179. It is also available from Rand McNally map stores, but the
company has no stores in Ohio, Kentucky or Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 for the Palm V can also be ordered
online, but Rand McNally said that version of the product won't be
shipped until the middle of May. It sells for $199.

 &HT;    Disclaimers offer legal protection
 &HT;    By Brett Thurman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I have noticed that in the ads for prescription
drugs the pharmaceutical companies run, they always include a list
of possible side effects in the legalese disclaimer at the end. I
saw one advertising something to help you with toenail fungus, and
the possible side effects included kidney problems and seizures!
Who in their right mind would trade their kidneys for nicer
toenails? What gives here?
</P>
<P>
   A: We at LegalEase deplore any and all legalese, and welcome
this opportunity to examine this new and sometimes amusing source
of same.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, you should know that reading the rest of this
column may satisfy your curiosity, but could lead to higher blood
pressure, pulling of hair and your dog getting kicked.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main reasons for these darkly cynical sources of
humor. First and foremost, there is a federal law that requires
possible side effects be mentioned in drug advertising. Not
surprisingly, the drug companies would probably play it safe and
put these disclaimers in even if the law did not require it. There
is a brave new world of potential liability just opening up as a
result of widespread direct advertising of drugs to the ultimate
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The old liability rules _ back before patients got much
information directly from the drug companies _ were pretty clear.
The government would approve a drug. Drug companies dealt
exclusively with doctors, and doctors dealt exclusively with
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Patients could under certain circumstances sue the drug
companies. But there were a lot of protections available to the
drug companies as a result of the fact they got government approval
of the drug and then limited their dealings to the doctors who
prescribed the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies recently discovered they could sell more of
their drugs if patients (and hypochondriacs) watching at home only
knew it was available and could then rush to their doctor to ``ask
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the good news. The bad news is that a variable in the
old relationships has changed. The drug companies are now
communicating with the consumer, and the consumer is now a
decision-maker in the drug-taking process.
</P>
<P>
   This change may or may not alter the old liability rules. It
takes a while for a significant number of medical conditions to
arise and work their way through the courts. Drug companies are
profitable enough that lucrative settlements often make more sense
than risking a trial that could create new and unfavorable law, so
most cases settle without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more, the drug companies anticipate, plaintiffs
will sue for complications allegedly caused by taking a drug that
was advertised. One of the things that will be mentioned at trial
is how the drug companies seduced the consumer into taking the drug
with their advertising. Not only did this drug company make an
unsafe product, it will be claimed, it also took out ads trying to
get people to ask for it from their doctors! That's two bad things,
not just one.
</P>
<P>
   These disclaimers would give the drug companies a better chance
to raise an affirmative defense of ``assumption of the risk.'' The
more specific the list of possible side effects, the better this
defense is.

 &HT;    Palm Pilots can get you there
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hand-held organizers have always been able to
manage your to-do lists so you aren't late for important
appointments, and they can store phone numbers so you can call
ahead even if you are running late.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can also help you find your way to that appointment
just about anywhere in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Rand McNally, the map people, have developed a mapping and
global positioning system (GPS) device designed to work with the
Palm III and Palm V organizers.
</P>
<P>
   StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 comes with a GPS antenna that plugs
directly into the back of the organizer. As you travel, the antenna
calculates your exact position by correlating signals from a
network of orbiting satellites and displays your position on a map
on the screen of the organizer.
</P>
<P>
   If you program the system with the route you want to follow, it
displays text messages telling you when and in which direction to
turn to reach your destination.
</P>
<P>
   To program the Palm organizer with the maps and directions you
need, you have to link the organizer to your personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 comes with StreetFinder CD-ROM software
that lets you access maps and directions through your home
computer. Using the software, you can look up specific addresses
for office buildings, restaurants, hotels and other services along
your travel route anywhere in the United States, Canada and most of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've compiled your travel information on the personal
computer, you can download it to your organizer and attach it to
the GPS antenna inside your car. The system also comes with a
bracket for attaching the unit to the windshield, plus rechargeable
batteries, a cigarette lighter power supply plug and an AC adapter.
</P>
<P>
   The StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 for the Palm III can be ordered
online from Rand McNally's Web site at www.randmcnally.com for
$179. It is also available from Rand McNally map stores, but the
company has no stores in Ohio, Kentucky or Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The StreetFinder Deluxe 2000 for the Palm V can also be ordered
online, but Rand McNally said that version of the product won't be
shipped until the middle of May. It sells for $199.

   VIETNAM-ESSAY (Undated) _ Suddenly, it was the last day. For 30
years the tides of civil war had washed over Vietnam, but there had
always been a non-Communist south _ a broad, fertile region south
of the 17th Parallel that was home not only to ethnic southerners
but the million or so ethnic North Vietnamese who had fled the
North after France's colonial forces were defeated in 1954. Most
people in South Vietnam had counted since then on perpetual United

these pictures are little known outside Vietnam. Now, decades

North Vietnamese smashed through the gates of the presidential
palace a few blocks away. But in its way, a quarter of a century
later, the war is still being waged here, even though more than
half the population of 78 million was born after 1975. Ho Chi Minh

<P>
   Suddenly, it was the last day.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years the tides of civil war had washed over Vietnam, but
there had always been a non-Communist south _ a broad, fertile
region south of the 17th Parallel that was home not only to ethnic
southerners but the million or so ethnic North Vietnamese who had
fled the North after France's colonial forces were defeated in
1954. Most people in South Vietnam had counted since then on
perpetual United States support against Hanoi's forces.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. America's troops had pulled out in 1973,
Communist forces had swiftly prepared for their victory push, and
the White House announced that the United States would no longer
back President Nguyen Van Thieu in Saigon. In March, 1975, the
country began its death throes.
</P>
<P>
   When Thieu's forces decided to abandon Ban Me Thuot and the
jungle-covered central part of South Vietnam the panic began. With
the country effectively split in two, refugees from Hue, Da Nang
and other towns in the northern part of the Republic of Vietnam
began a mass exodus, first on ox carts, motor bikes and afoot along
coastal Route 1 to the south, and then aboard any kind of boat that
would carry them southward.
</P>
<P>
   One day in April my wife and I drove from Saigon to Vung Tau,
where we expected the arrival of one of the refugee boats from Da
Nang, an American-built landing craft. As the boat limped into port
after nine days at sea, we learned that the people aboard it had
been without food, water or shelter from the scorching sun the
whole time. More than 50 of them lay dead on the hot deck, flies
droning over the pitiful corpses of children clutching dolls and
teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese entrepreneurs in sampans had met the landing craft
along the way and offered water at $1 a glass, but the impoverished
refugees could not afford more than a taste.
</P>
<P>
   Offshore a few dozen miles, American sailors aboard ships of the
7th Fleet drank cold sodas, oblivious of the nightmare unfolding
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Each day as the North Vietnamese troops and tanks drew closer to
Saigon I had less distance to drive to catch glimpses of their
forest-green uniforms and the muzzle flashes of their guns. By the
last week of April the rumble of Communist artillery and rockets
was audible in Saigon and the panic was in full cry.
</P>
<P>
   It was a profitable time for racketeers, both American and
Vietnamese. By offering money, gold or sexual favors, Vietnamese
hoping to be accepted for transportation on the CIA's humanitarian
airlift enriched many a crook offering bogus American sponsorship
promises and counterfeit refugee documents.
</P>
<P>
   Countless babies were thrust at departing Americans by mothers
who hoped at least to send a little emissary to the golden world
across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   A C5 Galaxy transport plane loaded with 243 ``orphans'' _ most
of them children whose parents were abandoning them to save them _
crashed on takeoff at Saigon's airport, killing most aboard. A
Vietnamese air force officer watching the tragedy bitterly remarked
to me, ``Never mind, we have plenty more to send you.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 28 Hanoi's army was less than one mile from The New
York Times office. Throughout the previous night the whoosh and
bang of artillery rockets hitting the center of town was incessant,
and one neighborhood of about 5,000 huts was blazing fiercely,
sending a towering column of smoke into the sky. Panicky people
were running aimlessly through the streets, yelling for lost
children.
</P>
<P>
   Above, American reconnaissance planes circled like hawks,
evading the storm of Communist anti-aircraft shells and bullets
rising to meet them. Occasionally one of the planes would fall,
blazing and smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the last week families were torn asunder as some
escaped the country while others chose or were forced to stay. The
social fabric of the nation disintegrated as the nation died.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, throngs of people tried to storm the American
Embassy, the American enclave at the airport or other places where
there seemed at least a forlorn hope of an exit from the rat trap _
a hope that dwindled with each helicopter that departed for the 7th
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   As swarms of Vietnamese air force helicopters set down on the
American warships, each helicopter was quickly unloaded and heaved
overboard to make room for the next one. Meanwhile, legions of
refugees used their sampans and fishing boats to reach the fleet,
setting their craft afire to keep them from falling into Communist
hands. The tranquil sea, covered from horizon to horizon with
blazing watercraft, looked like a vision of hell.
</P>
<P>
   And on the ships, as on shore, a stricken people wept.

<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ Bundled in two sweaters and a coat in his
chilly, tiny apartment, an old photographer described in sharp
detail his most cherished image of the war _ a young woman, bent
under her burden of supplies, laboring up a steep rock face on the
Ho Chi Minh trail.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ not even the photographer, Dinh Dang Dinh _ has ever
seen that picture. After three months on the trail in 1974, all his
film, 80 rolls of it, was destroyed in an attack by a U.S. F-4
Phantom jet.
</P>
<P>
   Streamers of exposed film fluttered from a treetop, said Dinh,
who is now 80. His first impulse was to photograph the destruction,
but that is another image that remains only in his memory. All his
cameras were destroyed in the attack as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep for a month, it was so awful,'' he said.
``Sometimes I still can't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands of other photographs do survive from a corps of
photographers who recorded the war on the communist side, both in
North and South Vietnam. But these pictures are as little known
outside Vietnam as the long-gone work of Dinh.
</P>
<P>
   Now, decades later, a selection of those photographs is being
gathered by two U.S. researchers who have dug through government
archives and tracked down a dozen of the aged photographers who
risked their lives to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the fighting ended, something surprising
is emerging: a new visual record of the war whose images had once
seemed so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   They are pictures of battle and of daily life from the other
side _ of barefoot guerrillas attacking a tank, of an outdoor
operating theater in a swamp, of children studying in a bomb
shelter, of a young soldier smiling brilliantly at the camera
moments before he was killed in a bombing raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've printed hundreds of these from the original negatives,''
said one of the researchers, Doug Niven, who is preparing a book
along with his associate, Chris Riley. The work is similar to a
previous project in which they produced a book of portraits of
victims of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys would just bring us plastic bags full of negatives,
and we'd just hold them up to a loop and go through them,'' Niven
said. ``Some of them are as good as the most famous photographers
on the Western side. But they've been in the shadows for 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews here and in Ho Chi Minh City, the former
Saigon, seven of the photographers talked about their work,
recalling what they said were the most intense and rewarding years
of their lives. They photographed the war, they said, with the same
nationalist fervor as their comrades, the soldiers. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Doan Cong Tinh, 57, a tough combat photographer who spent more
than two years living under fire in Quang Tri, capturing some of
the most dramatic battlefield pictures from the northern side. He
said he had carried a firearm as well as his camera and used both
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Le Minh Truong, 70, who took up photography after he was wounded
fighting the French in the 1950s, then discovered beauty everywhere
he looked, in the flare of napalm or the contrails of U.S.
warplanes in the rubble of Hanoi or the silhouettes of jungle
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Nam, 69, whose picture of a U.S. bomber tumbling through the
sky, a parachute floating nearby, was reproduced as a postcard by
the government with the caption, ``Happy New Year 1967.'' When
peace came, he became a pioneer in photographing beauty pageants in
communist Vietnam, and his walls are now adorned by pictures, not
of war, but of beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Dinh Uu, 82, who took his first pictures in 1948 when he
helped capture a unit of French soldiers and then turned their own
camera on them. ``Oh, I was so happy,'' he said, recalling the day
he first held a camera in his hands. ``We were more alive in
wartime, working in the border between life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Lam Tan Tai, 65, a master of battlefield photo-processing, who
carried his chemicals with him, built little earthen darkrooms and
hung his negatives on the bushes to dry.
</P>
<P>
   And Duong Thanh Phong, 61, who spent the war documenting life in
the hidden tunnels of Cu Chi, just south of Saigon. Then, in the
greatest thrill of his life, he photographed the final day of the
war, April 30, 1975, as victorious guerrillas and their supporters
surged toward the South's capital with flags and guns and laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Those pictures of victory are a revealing counterpart to the
familiar scenes of terrified Vietnamese in Saigon fighting their
way onto evacuation helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of these photographers are little known even in
their own country. Much of their wartime work has been uncollected
and unused since its original publication decades ago in Vietnamese
and some foreign communist newspapers. Some has never been
published, and some of the photographers have little left besides
the negatives they put aside for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For these photographers, the ignorance is mutual: the work and
names of their Western counterparts is all but unknown to them.
</P>
<P>
   At his little house in Ho Chi Minh City, Tinh, the Quang Tri
photographer, pulled stacks of crumbling newspapers from under a
cupboard, pointing to his byline as he opened each one, murmuring
his name as if he, too, had been hidden from view all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his pictures, crudely mounted with tape years ago, were
stuck together and would not come apart without tearing. Some were
blurred by yellow spots of mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been my dream to exhibit my pictures,'' he said.
``But as you know, the years after the war were very difficult here
and nobody had the money for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is also because the government _ like the
photographers themselves _ viewed their work as part of the war
effort, a project that could be forgotten now that it had served
its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, the photographers acknowledged with pride
that their pictures were deliberately one-sided, that they were
fighting as hard with their cameras as the soldiers were with their
guns.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most part, their wartime propaganda _ often stunning
to look at _ is as genuinely descriptive of the conflict as were
some of the great U.S. pictures of battlefield horror or anti-war
protests.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most beautiful of these was shot by Uu: a file of
young soldiers heading for the front surrounded by adoring
schoolchildren. The smiles on both side are radiant and clearly
genuine, if, perhaps, not entirely spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this picture the soldiers understood the purpose of my
work,'' said Uu. ``We were all soldiers together, and we had a
common determination to win against the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nam, who photographed the falling bomber, put it this way: ``I
never had any doubts about my work because I never set up any scene
for propaganda. What i took was reality, but it was just one side
of reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For example, he said: ``After a bombing raid we never showed the
dead bodies lying in the road. Instead we took pictures of people
rushing to fill the holes, to show that bombs are terrible but our
road to the front is still open.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no question that their work was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some photographers were assigned to the front but they didn't
go,'' said Truong. ``Nine out of 10 people who went never came
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinh was perhaps the most enthusiastic of them all in covering
combat, sometimes rolling onto his back, he said, to fire his gun
at a circling helicopter. Some of his pictures are blurred because
he was photographing on the run as he joined in a charge on an
enemy position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked my assignment,'' he said. ``There were big battles in
that area with America, many famous places that have left an echo
in history, like Kon Tien and Khe Sanh.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most striking pictures shows communist soldiers
raising their flag over a captured bunker, with the bodies of South
Vietnamese soldiers lying around it. Another shows a communist
soldier warily checking two badly wounded South Vietnamese troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times I was completely covered by dirt from an exploding
shell,'' Tinh said. ``Two of my close friends died. I'm alive now
only by luck. I loved taking pictures like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could match the excitement of Phong, who hitched a
ride into Saigon on the last day of the war, leaving behind the Cu
Chi tunnels where he had lived for years under the endless thudding
of enemy bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so thrilled,'' he said. ``It was such a happy day.
Everybody was on the streets laughing and singing.''
</P>
<P>
   He hitched a ride for the 30-mile trip to Saigon, stopping often
to photograph the fighters in black who milled about openly now,
their rifles in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The most evocative shot from that ride shows a two-lane road
filled with hundreds of pairs of military boots, discarded by South
Vietnamese soldiers who ripped off their uniforms to try to mingle
with civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Phong said that he had also taken pictures of the fleeing
soldiers in their underwear but that he had thought them too
embarrassing to print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just standing at the back of the car, shooting backwards
as we headed into the city,'' he said. ``The car was going voom,
voom, voom as we drove over the boots, like a boat going over
waves. I was just happy. Happy. It was fun driving over the boots,
bumping up and down.''

<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ For months, a giant portrait of
Vietnam's revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh, stared out across a
central square at a billboard showing the American fashion model
Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glorious victory of communism will last 1,000 years,'' the
portrait of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed. Crawford's portrait, offering
for sale an expensive watch to count the hours, smiled enticingly
and said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Crawford is gone now as this raucous, bustling
city _ still known to almost everybody as Saigon _ smartened itself
up to celebrate the high point of Vietnamese communism: What Hanoi
calls the liberation of the nation, after 30 years of war, from
foreign domination by the French and then the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago, on April 30, 1975, that the last fleeing
helicopter lifted off the roof of the U.S. Embassy and the first
tanks of the victorious North Vietnamese smashed through the gates
of the presidential palace a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Some 58,000 U.S. soldiers were dead, along with an estimated 3
million Vietnamese, military and civilian, both in the North and
South. The ruinous decade-long conflict known to Americans as the
Vietnam War, and to Vietnamese as the American War, was over.
</P>
<P>
   But in its way, a quarter of a century later, the war is still
being waged here, even though more than half the population of 78
million was born after 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh and the alluring faces of Western capitalism still
confront each other, emblems of communist Vietnam's celebrated past
and of a more complicated future it has not yet decided to embrace.
In the capital, Hanoi, a cumbersome, suspicious leadership still
hesitates between them, fearing to lose in the global marketplace
what it won, at such cost, on the battlefield.

<P>
   ``Now the war is all over and they have the liberty and
independence and freedom they made such sacrifices for,'' said the
U.S. ambassador, Pete Peterson, himself a war veteran who spent six
years in a North Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the world has redefined those things,'' Peterson said.
``What is independence in the global economy? Now a country is more
appropriately graded on interdependence. And liberty from what?
Happiness today is defined by the individual. They couldn't have
assumed in their wildest imagination a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The military geniuses of the Vietnam War, the old fighters whose
ingenuity and perseverance defeated a superpower, seem to have been
overwhelmed by the challenges _ steep challenges by any measure _
that confronted them in building a new, independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   By fits and starts over the years they have let in some fresh
air, opening the economy somewhat and cautiously allowing more
religious and social freedoms. But now they seem to have paused at
a crossroads, uncertain, divided and stuck, gripping the reins of
political and economic control for dear life, almost frenetic in
their stasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting a war was easy,'' said a retired North Vietnamese
army lieutenant who now works for a private company in Hanoi and
wholeheartedly supports his government. ``I tell you, to fight is
easier than to manage. You cannot go too quickly. If you go too
quickly something can go wrong. Every official in a high position
says, in a very big voice, we have to do something. But when he
reaches that point he realizes how difficult it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Following their victory, the communist leadership, struggling to
unify a nation that had torn itself apart in war, tried
disastrously to implement a socialist economy throughout the
country even as the defeated superpower worked actively to lock
them out of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle S. Thayer, an Australian expert on Vietnam, calls that
first decade ``winning the war and losing the peace.'' Then in 1986
Vietnam embarked on an experiment in openness called ``doi moi'' _
fundamental renovation _ and the world rushed in briefly, in the
early 1990s, with more investment and aid than the country could
manage or absorb. And through the late 1970s and the 1980s, Vietnam
was also engaged in more warfare, as it occupied neighboring
Cambodia and fought off a punitive attack by China.
</P>
<P>
   Before that second decade had run out, Vietnam had lost its
chief patron and aid donor with the collapse of the Soviet Union;
foreign investors had begun to flee in frustration over the
bureaucracy, corruption and slippery legal system that crippled
their work; and conservative forces had raised a hue and cry about
the corrupting influence of ``social evils'' imported from the
free-thinking West.

   In a speech in February, Vietnam's top communist leader, Le Kha
Phieu, warned once again that the battle with the West is still on,
though the arena is now the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to seek ways to completely wipe out the
remaining socialist countries and attack the movements for
independence, democracy and social progress,'' he said. ``We should
never relax our vigilance for a minute.''

   Under its vigilant leadership, Vietnam today seems like a nation
of bees buzzing inside a bottle, thrumming with repressed energy.
Many of the same difficulties that drove away foreign investors _
along with stifling limits on local business practices _ are
crippling the efforts of Vietnamese entrepreneurs. And an
insistence on government control of major industries serves as a
sea anchor slowing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government ever got out of the way here, this country
would put the rest of Asia to shame,'' said a Western economic
analyst who represents an international aid agency in Hanoi. ``Go
to the villages. Vietnam defines industriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   What he was talking about would amount to a revolutionary step
for the communist leadership, a redefinition of their victory 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While they wait and consider, said Peterson, ``there is probably
no developing country with such a vast void between potential and
realization.''

   The next difficult step for Vietnam in its reintegration into
the larger world is the signing of a trade agreement with the
United States that embodies the free-market prescriptions of the
International Monetary Fund. It would open Vietnamese markets to
perhaps $800 million a year in new investment and would send a
crucial signal that Hanoi is ready once again to do business with
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was initialed by trade negotiators in November but then
came to a dead stop as Hanoi began having second thoughts. Its
economic prescriptions challenged too many vested interests and
raised too many fears of a loss of central government control.
</P>
<P>
   And it roused a deeply held distrust of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a kind of vague fear that there is something between
the lines,'' said a Vietnamese economics professor, speaking of his
government on condition of anonymity. ``It's still a wartime
generation that is governing this country, and they do not
completely trust American intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from the United States are received with real warmth
today, both in the North and in the South. But that warmth does not
for the most part extend to their government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hanoi now allows as many as 1,300 students to study in
the United States each year, it remains leery of their views when
they return, the economist said. ``They say, `You are coming back
from America so perhaps you have been duped.'''
</P>
<P>
   After so many years of war, and so many years of postwar
hostility, said Tom Vallely, director of the Vietnam program at the
Harvard Institute of International Development, ``I think it's
difficult and maybe impossible for them to believe you can have a
win-win situation with the United States.''

</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades after the war ended, the United States
maintained a trade embargo, arguing that Hanoi was slow to provide
information on missing U.S. soldiers and that Vietnam was acting
aggressively by occupying its neighbor, Cambodia, from 1979 to
1989.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lifted the embargo in 1994 and established
full diplomatic relations the following year. U.S. investors, many
motivated by postwar sentiment, flooded in with what Peterson
called ``visions of grandeur'' that ended in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, trade between the two countries remains small, with
Vietnam shipping $650 million worth of goods to the United States
each year and U.S. companies selling $350 million in exports to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reminders of the costs of the American War:
continuing generations of babies born deformed because of the
effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange and continuing
generations of farmers and children who are killed and maimed by
unexploded bombs and mines.

   These explosives, ranging from mortar rounds to antipersonnel
mines to buried 500-pound bombs, shift and rise to the surface with
the annual floods that torment the central provinces, frustrating
efforts to clear new farmland.
</P>
<P>
   But when the United States offered a $750,000 program of
mine-clearing and training several years ago, the Vietnamese
refused because it would once again cause uniformed U.S. soldiers
to be based on Vietnamese soil.

   Despite these legacies of war, Vietnamese seem fascinated by the
United States. It sometimes seems the entire nation is studying
English, the language of international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And after two decades of postwar refugees, nearly 1 million of
whom are now in the United States, there is now a waiting list at
the U.S. consulate of thousands who have applied to immigrate to
join their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a curious twist, the dollars sent home by these refugees, now
well over $1 billion a year, are one of the country's largest
sources of foreign currency _ a much larger contribution than if
these same people had remained in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a museum here that still displays the ``war crimes'' of
Americans, a young woman selling souvenirs made out of bullets took
a U.S. visitor aside recently to ask how she could emigrate to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the victim of its
geography, fighting off periodic invasions by its northern
neighbor, China _ most recently in 1979. During the American War,
the communists of North Vietnam found themselves leaning on China,
as well as on the Soviet Union, for support. Now, Hanoi may see the
United States as its necessary buffer against its big and powerful
northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``America now is an alternative to China,'' the Vietnamese
economist said. ``To counter the Chinese threat we must lean toward
the West _ not because we like the West, but because the Chinese
army is 2.5 million strong.''

   Apart from China, only Vietnam is attempting the acrobatic feat
of creating a capitalist economy under the central control of a
communist government. Clearly, though, it is suffering from a
greater fear of heights.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vietnamese leaders insist that they follow no outside
models, they thrive on cautionary tales: the Soviet Union that
collapsed when it loosened its government's grip, Indonesia that
dissolved into disorder with the ouster of a strong leader, Asian
economies that imploded because of their dependence on the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis de Tray, the International Monetary Fund's senior
resident representative in Vietnam, says the country has its own
successful model to emulate in opening its economy _ the decision a
decade ago to end collectivized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went from near starvation to the world's second largest
rice exporter overnight,'' de Tray said. ``And they did it with one
simple change, by letting farmers keep their own rice. If you lived
through this, why not just go ahead, guys, go for it. This is as
good an example as I've seen in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, despite Vietnam's current stagnation, it has
covered a good deal of ground in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago this was a country that did not even have the
vocabulary of trade, the vocabulary of a legal system, the
vocabulary of economics, the vocabulary of a central banking
system,'' he said. ``So why are they hesitating now to take the
next step?''
</P>
<P>
   With a per capita income of just $360 a year, Vietnam is one of
the poorest nations in the world, with nearly 80 percent of its
population in the countryside, most of them on the edge of poverty.
The government, whatever its political agenda, is clearly committed
to raising living standards, according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But with agriculture making up only a small part of national
income, the next liberalizations must come in a growth of private
enterprise in other sectors, foreign experts agree. At the moment,
medium or large-scale private companies make up less than 2 percent
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam needs to open up the domestic private sector to get
things going beyond photocopy stands and noodle shops, to get
people investing in small manufacturing businesses instead of just
providing a service to their neighbors,'' said Robert Templer, the
author of ``Shadows and Wind: A View of Modern Vietnam'' (Little,
Brown 1998).
</P>
<P>
   And, said one Vietnamese who owns a small business in Hanoi,
local bureaucrats who enforce scores of often ambiguous regulations
must undergo a fundamental shift in attitude. ``It has to be `do
whatever is not forbidden,''' he said, ``rather than `do only what
is permitted.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But under Vietnam's political system, none of this is so simple.
</P>
<P>
   First, both Vietnamese and foreign experts say, the government
is hobbled by a decision-making process that demands consensus _
some say unanimity _ in a leadership with increasingly diverse
economic interests. Within government circles, it seems, a veto can
come from just about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the government is not yet convinced it can carry out its
acrobatic balancing act, fearing that an open marketplace will lead
_ as Americans themselves often like to say _ to political
pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, every time the economy opens up a bit, it seems,
restrictions on free speech and political activity grow tighter and
political rhetoric grows harsher.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment of uncertainty, for example, almost no
nonofficial Vietnamese would allow their names to be printed in
this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vietnam nowadays it is more free,'' said an army veteran in
Hanoi. ``But it is still not nice to put the names of people in the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one small businessman in Ho Chi Minh City put it, with a
touch of bitterness, ``We have freedom here, but it is under
control.''

   In a cozy refuge from the rain, six teenage boys sat in a tiny
arcade in Hanoi jumping and shouting in their seats as they played
war games on a row of computers.
</P>
<P>
   To the sounds of synthetic gunfire, the computers charted their
progress with exclamation points:
</P>
<P>
   ``Long was blown away by Ken's super rocket!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nam caught Ken's hand grenade!''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 25 years ago, boys their age were firing real rockets
and throwing hand grenades in North Vietnam's final assault on the
South.
</P>
<P>
   What did these postwar youngsters think of that? The question
was greeted with blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago?'' said one boy. ``Is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the large majority of Vietnamese who were born after the
war, or who were only children when it ended, much of it apparently
seems, literally, ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just one of a whole series of events that they are
supposed to revere in school, but for many of them it doesn't have
any more specific meaning than the Vietnamese victories over the
Chinese in the 10th century,'' said Peter Zinoman, a professor of
Vietnamese history at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another reason for their disengagement,'' he added, ``is this
whole new culture of consumption that does sort of preoccupy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has seen little of the kind of political debate,
national soul-searching or artistic reconsideration of the war that
has helped the United States to try to draw lessons since the fall
of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   In part this is because an unqualifiedly heroic version of the
war is essential to the legitimacy and authority of the Communist
Party. There is no disputing official propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   A result is that art, journalism and policy discussions remain
constricted by political boundaries as well as by a genuine respect
for the elderly heroes of the communist victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making compromises is something we have to do now,'' said a
Hanoi-based government official in his late 30s. ``We cannot make
our fathers feel so unhappy. They are our fathers. What can we do?
We must accommodate their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   For younger Vietnamese eager to get onto the world's fast track,
he conceded, this delicacy can be maddening.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my father often says, `You didn't live under the French.
You didn't see how people were starving.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Other countries in the region are moving ahead now and
they are prosperous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `They're in crisis.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Now they are emerging and they are moving faster than
we are. We should have taken advantage but we didn't take
advantage.'''
</P>
<P>
   The young official seemed ready to burst with frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Vietnam is doing now is toddling, like a child,'' he
said. ``So I say to them, `Why not try the adult method: firm, but
faster!'''
</P>
<P>
   As some Vietnamese like to say, 25 years is a long time in a
human life but a short time in history. Most people here agree that
change will come in its own good time.
</P>
<P>
   But without America's openness in discussing and digesting its
history, the future, when it does arrive, may indeed be the alien
visitor the country's leaders fear.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs that they may be losing control of their
own history. Tu Anh, for example, a company project manager who was
born in 1975, talked in surprising detail the other day about the
long-ago war.
</P>
<P>
   But her information did not come from textbooks or her elders.
The source she cited was a pirated copy of the movie ``Forrest

   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ For months, a giant portrait of
Vietnam's revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh, stared out across a
central square at a billboard showing the American fashion model
Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glorious victory of communism will last 1,000 years,'' the
portrait of Ho Chi Minh proclaimed. Crawford's portrait, offering
for sale an expensive watch to count the hours, smiled enticingly
and said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Crawford is gone now as this raucous, bustling
city _ still known to almost everybody as Saigon _ smartened itself
up to celebrate the high point of Vietnamese communism: What Hanoi
calls the liberation of the nation, after 30 years of war, from
foreign domination by the French and then the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago, on April 30, 1975, that the last fleeing
helicopter lifted off the roof of the U.S. Embassy and the first
tanks of the victorious North Vietnamese smashed through the gates
of the presidential palace a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Some 58,000 U.S. soldiers were dead, along with an estimated 3
million Vietnamese, military and civilian, both in the North and
South. The ruinous decade-long conflict known to Americans as the
Vietnam War, and to Vietnamese as the American War, was over.
</P>
<P>
   But in its way, a quarter of a century later, the war is still
being waged here, even though more than half the population of 78
million was born after 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the war is all over and they have the liberty and
independence and freedom they made such sacrifices for,'' said the
U.S. ambassador, Pete Peterson, himself a war veteran who spent six
years in a North Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the world has redefined those things,'' Peterson said.
``What is independence in the global economy? Now a country is more

WHEN IN ROME ... : RUSSELL CROWE FIGHTS ON IN `GLADIATOR' 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide of Russell Crowe in a scene from
``Gladiator.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Some guys are tough customers, and some are really tough
customers. Then there's Russell Crowe.
 &HT;    Ridley Scott, who directed the Australian actor in the costume
epic ``Gladiator,'' opening May 5, recalls that they had some
problems with an unruly Bengal tiger who was surly and
uncooperative, even biting a stunt man's arm at one point.
 &HT;    ``It was like he could sense our fear,'' Scott says, ``and the
animal had a certain take-no-prisoners mentality. Let's just say he
would not suffer fools.''
 &HT;    But when Crowe walked by, things were different.
 &HT;    ``The stupid thing would lay down on a rock with its paws tucked
under it like it was a house cat,'' Scott says, laughing. ``It
would hunker down. It didn't even let out a peep _ we could barely
get the damn thing to work. And the stupid cat was supposed to be
attacking Russell.''
 &HT;    Even when Crowe is at ease in the posh Century Plaza Hotel in
Century City, Calif., it's easy to see why the tiger was
intimidated. The actor has a take-no-prisoners attitude of his own,
and he means business.
 &HT;    When a writer asks him not to smoke, he scoffs, ``Oh, I forgot
that you're weak of constitution.''
 &HT;    Nor does he shrink from offending Hollywood VIPs such as
Lawrence Kasdan, director of ``The Big Chill'' (1983), ``The
Accidental Tourist'' (1988) and other hits.
 &HT;    ``I had a chat with Lawrence Kasdan last night,'' Crowe says.
``It was so funny, because he's talking to me like he never met me
before. We met on this project years ago. He can't f--king remember
it!
 &HT;    ``I knew I didn't want to work with him.''
 &HT;    Coming off an Oscar nomination for ``The Insider'' (1999), Crowe
_ who's 35, stands 6 feet tall and is casually clad in khaki pants
and a matching sweater _ can afford to ruffle a few feathers. Even
when it comes to ``Gladiator,'' a $107 million-plus adventure film
set in ancient Rome and replete with battle scenes, assassinations
and a climactic showdown in the gladiators' arena between Maximus
(Crowe) and his archenemy Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).
 &HT;    ``Frankly, when I got the script, it wasn't very good,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ``It was too modern and too cynical. I nearly
passed.''
 &HT;    Ultimately, he says, it was the chance to work with Scott,
director of the legendary ``Alien'' (1979) and ``Blade Runner''
(1982), that sold him on the project.
 &HT;    ``Face it,'' he says. ``If you're ever going to take a leap of
faith, it should be with Ridley Scott, who is a straight-talking
bloke. So am I.''
 &HT;    Scott and his crew took months to build a replica of the real
Roman Colosseum, which was re-created in 90-percent scale on Malta.
There Crowe survived some truly staggering battle scenes.
 &HT;    ``You're dealing with going from one 10-day fight sequence to
immediately rehearsing for the next 10-day fight sequence,'' the
Australian says. ``In-between, I'm wrestling with a tiger.''
 &HT;    Both Crowe and Scott have notorious tempers, and some had
predicted that the production's most memorable wrestling might be
between them.
 &HT;    ``It was the exact opposite experience,'' Crowe says. ``I love
somebody who is searching for the absolute right nuance _ I love
that intensity level.
 &HT;    ``Working with Ridley was like doing quantum physics with
Picasso,'' he adds. ``He's got five camera crews, 2,000 extras, 500
horses and 10,000 flaming arrows flying through the air. It was
impressive, mate.''
 &HT;    It was a lot more impressive than the film sets in New Zealand
and Australia on which Crowe grew up, the son of parents who ran a
movie-catering business. He was occasionally drafted for on-camera
work, which he found to be a valuable training ground.
 &HT;    ``I didn't get a lead role until I was 25,'' he says, ``yet I
worked in front of a camera for the first time at age 6. So it was
a 19-year apprenticeship.''
 &HT;    By age 20 Crowe was hoping to become a rock star, but there were
glimmerings of his future career: One of his songs was titled, ``I
Want to Be Like Marlon Brando.''
 &HT;    ``Funny,'' Crowe jokes, ``but while shooting `The Insider,' I
was fat and bald and really looking like Marlon.''
 &HT;    Like his idol, Crowe has played a wide variety of roles, from a
dumpy, middle-aged whistle-blower in ``The Insider'' to a skinhead
in ``Romper Stomper'' (1992), from a clean-cut man of the law in
``L.A. Confidential'' (1997) to a hippie hockey player in
``Mystery, Alaska'' (1999).
 &HT;    Crowe says he was less disappointed at not winning the Oscar
than he was stunned and humbled to be nominated.
 &HT;    ``An Oscar nomination to me is a very important thing,'' he
says. ``It's a great privilege. I know lots of people who have had
stellar and very long careers who have never had the benefit of
being acknowledged by their peers.
 &HT;    ``I really appreciate it,'' he says. ``I'm very thankful. I'm an
Academy Award-nominated actor for the rest of my career, no matter
what s--t I do from here on.''
 &HT;    These days Crowe is filming Taylor Hackford's romantic thriller
``Proof of Life,'' in which he co-stars with Meg Ryan as a hostage
negotiator who falls in love with the wife of a kidnapped
businessman (David Morse).
 &HT;    Hackford is known for his knack for sexy films such as ``An
Officer and a Gentleman'' (1982), ``Against All Odds'' (1984) and
``White Nights'' (1985), but Crowe doesn't like thinking of himself
as a sex symbol.
 &HT;    ``This is not about me,'' he grumbles. ``I'm working with Taylor
because I really loved `An Officer and a Gentleman.' You've got to
pay out the guys who have given you the thrills.
 &HT;    ``Plus he's an out-there cat.''
 &HT;    Next up is a role as a freak-show beast in Jodie Foster's
``Flora Plum.'' After that, he has no firm plans.
 &HT;    ``That might be the last movie I ever do,'' he says with a
shrug. ``If I ended this career tomorrow, I'd be happy with the
fact that I've worked with a whole bunch of blokes who really know
how to make movies. I know guys who don't just shoot a film _ they
tear the thing apart.''
 &HT;    Crowe's lack of Hollywood attitude may reflect the time he
spends between films getting away from it all _ far, far away from
it all, actually, since he heads for his sprawling, 560-acre ranch
in the Australian bush some seven hours north of Sydney.
 &HT;    ``I get up in the morning and check out the cows. Of course,
that's a half day's work,'' Crowe says.
 &HT;    ``It's imperative,'' he continues. ``I need a bit of space. And
it's the things I do outside acting that actually fuel my art _ if
I spent my whole life living in Hollywood, I think I would be a
lesser man. I wouldn't know about life.''
 &HT;    Besides, he adds, certain farm products come in handy in
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I think many people in show business are slightly out of touch
with reality,'' Crowe says. ``For me, it's all about my bulls--t
detector. I want to go back to my farm and visit that kind of bull
s--t.''

INTO AFRICA: KIM BASINGER EXPLORES THE DARK CONTINENT 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Kim Basinger in a scene from ``I Dreamed
of Africa.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    She may have an Oscar to her credit, but Kim Basinger is as
insecure as ever.
 &HT;    ``I think we're all insecure,'' says Basinger, who earned her
Best Supporting Actress statuette as the Veronica Lake-like call
girl in ``L.A. Confidential'' (1997). ``We all have our
insecurities, whether we admit it or not. I'm still insecure from
time to time about certain things.
 &HT;    ``The Oscar, to me, was one of the greatest moments I'll ever
have in my life, professionally,'' Basinger admits. ``It gives you
credibility in the eyes of so many people, and they let you know
it.
 &HT;    ``It gave me confidence,'' she says. ``It gave me credibility.
It's nice to be welcomed in that way _ it absolutely gives you more
choices, and more people want to take chances on you.''
 &HT;    Settling in for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel,
Basinger shrugs.
 &HT;    ``It puts you in another place,'' she says. ``But as far as
making me less insecure, every project is the next project and each
one has its own emotional ride.''
 &HT;    Basinger's latest project is ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' which will
open nationwide on May 5. The actress stars in the based-on-fact
film as Kuki Gallmann, an Italian woman who traded a life of
European luxury for the wilds of Kenya.
 &HT;    In her memoir, also titled ``I Dreamed of Africa'' (Viking
Penguin, 1991), Gallmann recounts how she tragically lost her lover
and her son _ played in the film by Vincent Perez and Liam Aiken,
respectively _ but also how she gained strength by becoming a
protector of the land and the animals around her.
 &HT;    ``I read the book and I had a meeting with (producer) Stanley
Jaffe, and that was it,'' says Basinger, who's still gorgeous at 46
and retains more than a touch of her original Southern accent.
``The story had everything _ it had every element any actress could
ever ask for, and it touched me personally.
 &HT;    ``The book was so beautifully written I couldn't get through the
last part,'' she recalls. ``I knew where it was going, and I
couldn't get through it. Kuki is such a beautiful writer _ it was
like a diary.
 &HT;    ``By the last page I was so emotionally moved, and not just by
the tragedies that happened, but by her journey as a woman,'' the
actress says. ``To be able to cinematically fill those shoes, to be
able to play those scenes, it was a gift.''
 &HT;    Making the film, Basinger recalls, was a dream, albeit a dream
fraught with snakes, dust storms and the loss of most of the
luxuries of movie stardom. And it was a long dream, too, as
director Hugh Hudson led his cast and crew through six months of
location shooting in Italy, Kenya and South Africa.
 &HT;    ``I had to face a lot of fears, the biggest one being taking my
then-2-1/2-year-old daughter, Ireland, into the bush,'' says
Basinger, who was also accompanied by her husband, actor Alec
Baldwin. ``But it was an experience that changed me forever.
 &HT;    ``I worked seven days a week,'' she explains. ``On Sundays I was
riding horses or learning how to drive a jeep with my left hand.
 &HT;    ``As a person, to be cut off from what we think of as
civilization,'' Basinger says, ``to have very little electricity,
to have to have water flown in, to live in the bush with the Zulu
people and have my daughter pick up Zulu words ... I could never
sit here and verbally express the mystical, magical, spiritual,
wonderful time I had.
 &HT;    ``It was a time with my family,'' she adds. ``When we took off
from Johannesburg, my husband was holding my hand and I was holding
Ireland's hand. I was crying, he had tears in his eyes.
 &HT;    ``Ireland didn't want to leave at all,'' Basinger says. ``She
asks all the time, `When am I going back to Africa?'''
 &HT;    One of these days, Ireland may ask her mother another question,
one of a far more touchy nature. Early in Basinger's career, she
posed naked for Playboy. She later had several nude scenes opposite
Mickey Rourke in the erotically charged drama, ``Nine 1/2 Weeks''
(1986).
 &HT;    Basinger can't relish the question, but she doesn't dodge the
issue.
 &HT;    ``It's going to be a big question when she gets older,'' she
admits. ``At that time, I really don't know how I'll handle it.
 &HT;    ``But I know one thing: I'd never hide a thing from my
daughter,'' she says. ``I had a journey myself _ I had to go on it.
She will understand every step of the way why I did what I did at
the time and where I was at the time in my life. My daughter and I
don't keep anything from one another, and that's the way it will
be.
 &HT;    ``She understands that he is showing his boom-boom, meaning
(rear end) or that they have goobies, which are these,'' she adds,
pointing to her breasts.
 &HT;    ``We're in a rented house right now that's owned by a bachelor,
and he has a nude little drawing,'' she adds. ``So all of Ireland's
friends know that's the boom-boom and that's the whatever and that
you're not supposed to show those in public.
 &HT;    ``So, yes, it'll be a slight concern of mine, but she will know
me,'' the actress concludes. ``I don't think we'll ever come to
that place where she says, `Why did you do that?' I will have
informed her of why before she ever gets to that place where she
will ask me.''
 &HT;    A smile crosses Basinger's face.
 &HT;    ``Ireland's only 4,'' she adds. ``So we've got a little ways to
go.''
 &HT;    Moviegoers will next see Basinger in the supernatural thriller
``Bless the Child,'' a fall release that she describes as a cross
between ``Rosemary's Baby'' (1968) and ``Ghost'' (1990). Right now,
though, Basinger is spending time with Baldwin and their daughter
in East Hampton, N.Y., reading scripts and basking in her career
revival.
 &HT;    And, though she's well into her 40s in an industry which is
notoriously indifferent toward its aging leading ladies, Basinger
isn't complaining.
 &HT;    ``So far, so good, don't know about the future,'' she says,
reciting the words like a mantra. ``Really. So far, so good. I've
been very blessed and lucky to have been asked to do the last three
movies that I've done. And we just go on.''

WHOSE WHO?: A CLASSIC BAND EYES A NEW GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John
Entwistle and the late Keith Moon.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Back in 1965, the Who gave the world one of rock's most
indelible lyrics: ``Hope I die before I get old.''
 &HT;    Mostly they didn't, however, and after 35 years the sentiment
seems more facetious than rebellious.
 &HT;    The venerable British band, which staged a 1982 farewell tour
but has regrouped several times since, has reunited for a summer
tour that will start in June and, possibly, for a studio album that
would be its first in 18 years.
 &HT;    The impetus for the reunion was the release of two vintage
albums earlier this year: ``BBC Sessions,'' a collection of 1960s
and 1970s recordings, and ``The Blues to the Bush,'' a live album
from some 1999 shows that's available only via the Internet site
www.musicmaker.com.
 &HT;    In short, the Who may be getting old, but they're very much
alive.
 &HT;    ``I've always kind of laughed at people who say you're too old
to rock 'n' roll,'' says the 56-year-old Roger Daltrey, who sang
that line in ``My Generation.'' ``To me it's got nothing to do with
your age or any of that _ it's to do with the music and what the
music itself generates.''
 &HT;    That's certainly been true for Daltrey and his colleagues Pete
Townshend and John Entwistle, who remain very active. Daltrey, for
instance, has maintained a busy solo career as a performer,
recording artist and actor. Most recently he's fronted the British
Rock Symphony, which performs orchestral versions of classic rock
hits, and is producing director Brad Silberling's film biography of
the late Who drummer, Keith Moon.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the 55-year-old Entwistle continues to lead his own
band, which has recorded music for the children's cartoon
``Van-pires.'' He also creates rock-themed lithographs and is
writing a memoir about the Who.
 &HT;    The 54-year-old Townshend, who has been the Who's main
songwriter, has overcome bouts with alcoholism and drug addiction
to complete a variety of projects, including the Broadway hit ``The
Who's Tommy'' (1989) and a 1996 stage version of ``Quadrophenia''
(1973).
 &HT;    Most recently, he's resurrected the band's abortive rock opera
``Lifehouse,'' begun in 1970, as a radio play, a stage production
and an album that's available in different configurations via his
Web site at www.eelpie.com.
 &HT;    So it's not as if the three are short of work. But there's a
lure to being the Who that they can't seem to shake, no matter how
many times they promise ``never again.''
 &HT;    ``We've gone up and down over the years,'' Daltrey says. ``It's
never really gone away, though. We enjoy our company. We enjoy the
camaraderie of the band now. Pete has come an awful long way in his
addiction program now _ he hasn't gotten all the old hangups he
used to. It's really great fun being back together.''
 &HT;    Entwistle agrees.
 &HT;    ``It's really natural, kind of like a sixth sense,'' he says.
``You turn your brain off and, as long as you don't think of what
you're playing, it just falls together very naturally.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Entwistle cautions that, while the band does plan
some exploratory recording sessions, there's no guarantee that an
album will result.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, if we don't like it, it won't come out,'' says the
bassist/songwriter, whose contributions to the Who canon include
``Boris the Spider,'' ``My Wife'' and ``Had Enough.'' ``We've
agreed to go into the studio and have a go at one. It's basically
`What's the Who going to be like in the year 2000?'
 &HT;    ``And if you like the result, then there'll be an album.''
 &HT;    Townshend also emphasizes the provisional nature of their
upcoming studio work.
 &HT;    ``We don't have a record deal,'' he says. ``Nothing is going to
get me into the studio with a bullying producer to spend six months
trying to wring something out of my soul which is not appropriate
to either the band or the rock-'n'-roll market.
 &HT;    ``I can't imagine ever going into the studio and doing what we
used to do, with a hard-knock producer and spending six months
perfecting something,'' Townshend adds. ``I don't think the climate
now is about that, not with people making records in their garages
or bedrooms.''
 &HT;    What the band should sound like now is still very much up in the
air. Entwistle says he's hoping for something that hits hard and
heavy, like the Who of the 1960s and 1970s.
 &HT;    ``I hope it's going to go back to `Who Are You' (1978), rather
than `Face Dances' (1981) and `It's Hard' (1982),'' he says. ``I
think the feeling is it's going to be a lot more uptempo, upfront.
 &HT;    ``I've said that before,'' Entwistle adds, ``and I usually end
up with the only rock-'n'-roll songs on the album. But hopefully it
can be different this time.''
 &HT;    Daltrey, who has three songs for the next Who project already
finished and plans to write with Townshend for the first time ever,
is confident that the group can rekindle the vital, deep-reaching,
empathetic musical craft of its heyday.
 &HT;    ``It's a very unique band,'' he says. ``You can hear the
influences, but it's not derivative. If you hear the Stones, they
are derivative of Chuck Berry and the early blues people. With the
Who, you can hear the influences of those people, but it's become
something totally, totally different, with the way Pete wrote his
songs and the structures.
 &HT;    ``And what he wrote about ... where everybody else was writing
about sex and `I'd like to screw you, baby' in various different
ways, Pete was more interested in the psychological problems of the
adolescent and the young man,'' Daltrey adds. ``And that, of
course, is timeless, because it doesn't change. There's just a new
generation that comes around with the same set of problems.''
 &HT;    It remains to be seen, of course, whether that new generation
wants to hear those problems explored by three men in their 50s.
Daltrey concedes that it's important for the band to move beyond
the nostalgic appeal of its classic tunes to address its fans'
current issues.
 &HT;    ``I've always been of the opinion that, if Pete could write
about the problems of adolescence, why can't he write about the
problems of middle age?'' Daltrey says.
 &HT;    ``Our audience hasn't gone away,'' he adds. ``They're still
going through the same things I am, that Pete is, all those little
insecurities and everything. No one is completely cleaned up and
knows where they're going, ever in their life.
 &HT;    ``I don't think so, anyway,'' he says with a laugh. ``They may
think they know where they're going, but they probably won't end up
there.''
 &HT;    Whether any of these new songs will be heard in the upcoming
tour is another question, however. After seeing other bands perform
new material live, Daltrey admits that he's a little reluctant to
chance it.
 &HT;    ``Half the audience gets up and goes to the bar or the toilet,''
he says. ``We don't want to ram new stuff down the throats of
people who don't particularly want to hear new stuff, because we
can't at the present time play enough of our old stuff.''
 &HT;    That may be the band's next argument, though, because Townshend
definitely wants to give his audience new music.
 &HT;    ``When you look at the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, you
want to know where they are going to go now,'' he says. ``You know
where they have been, you want to know what they are going to do
next.
 &HT;    ``You want to hear what we're doing today.''

 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before May 14. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expectations were generally low when Fox launched ``Beverly
Hills 90210,'' way back on Oct. 4, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pilot episode, with privileged kids driving BMWs to
school while wearing Armani and talking on cell phones, wasn't
promising _ it looked like a mix of ``Eight Is Enough'' and
``Valley Of The Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, however, things improved. Each of the six leads
developed a distinct persona, both onscreen and off, and the
storylines settled into deeper material such as drugs, sex and
general teen angst.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, teens on television became a hot commodity, as
``90210'' became the first television phenomenon of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, it's time to say goodbye to ``90210.''
Continuously sliding ratings have ceased to justify the $2.2
million production cost of each episode, and although the series
still rates well among its target demographic ... well, let's face
it, the cast are getting a bit long in the tooth for a ``Dawson's
Creek'' world.
</P>
<P>
   Teaser trailers have revealed that the final episode, which will
air on May 17, features a wedding. Translation: Do you, Donna (Tori
Spelling), take this man, David (Brian Austin Greene), to be your
lawful wedded husband?
</P>
<P>
   There will also be some not-so-surprising returns _ paging
Gabrielle Carteris and Tiffani Amber Thiessen! _ since Fox plans to
send ``90210'' out on a happy, all-the-loose-ends-knotted note, a
la ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   But we come not to bury ``90210,'' but to praise it. What kept
viewers tuning in for 10 seasons? It's easy to write it off as the
appeal of the show's likeable, good-looking leads, but its tangy
writing must not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, ``90210'' was created and run by Aaron Spelling, the
same man who devised such long-running tacky-television classics as
``The Mod Squad'' (1968-1973), ``The Love Boat'' (1977-1986),
``Fantasy Island'' (1978-1984) and ``Dynasty'' (1981-1989). And one
of the first laws of Spelling Entertainment is that, if you want
viewers to keep coming back, you'd better throw one hell of a bitch
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned years ago,'' the producer says, ``that if you want
to keep things interesting, you put a cat in among the canaries.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Melrose Place,'' that role fell to blonde-tressed Heather
Locklear. On ``90210,'' at least in the early years, it was up to
the wretched Brenda Walsh, played by Shannen Doherty, currently
starring on WB's witchy series ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda was ostensibly the twin sister of Brandon _ a.k.a. Jason
Priestley, who was and is actually a bit prettier _ and almost all
the storylines for the first four seasons seemed to revolve around
Brenda, whether it was her on-again/off-again romance with the
rebellious Dylan (Luke Perry) or her madcap trip to France with
Donna and Kelly (Jennie Garth).
</P>
<P>
   Things got serious, too _ unlike the ``Dawson's Creek''
ensemble, the ``90210'' crowd were neither self-absorbed nor
completely sex-obsessed. They weren't as inaccessibly wordy _ in
fact, most of the time they spoke like real teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all of their actions were accompanied by
repercussions, especially sex. The first-season episode in which
Brandon lost his virginity to a visiting ex-girlfriend stood out:
He ended up feeling guilty and confused, a stark contrast to the
elation that typically follows every television character's first
sexual experience.
</P>
<P>
   Today the cult of ``90210'' is global. The series airs in more
than 80 countries, and the Internet is cluttered with devoted fan
sites. In Japan, ``90210'' cultists have given the show and its
American Teen Dream a crazed reverence, with memorabilia trading
for incredible prices.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is common among all fans, though: They refer to the
show's golden age as ``the Brenda Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``90210's'' early success was due to Doherty's wild-girl
rampage through Hollywood. The media couldn't get enough of her
ever-escalating antics. Like the mallrat from hell, she left a
trail of broken windows, black eyes and ex-boyfriends in her wake,
and the show's ratings skyrocketed as viewers delighted in seeing
the offscreen bad girl being forced to play a slightly snippy
high-schooler on television.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe ``90210'' faltered after Doherty was
unceremoniously dumped in 1994 over what were delicately called
``creative differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine works a lot better now,'' co-star Ian Ziering said
at the time. ``The lunatic is no longer running the asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans clamored for Doherty's return, but co-executive producer
Steve Wasserman vowed, ``She'll never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't, and many felt that the show was never the same.
Thiessen did her best, but never quite captured fans' attention the
way Doherty had, and each ensuing season was a little blander than
the last.
</P>
<P>
   There have certainly been some bright spots along the way,
however, most notably the touching episode last year, written by
Ziering, that dealt with Alzheimer's disease and earned an Emmy
nomination for guest star Milton Berle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decade of its existence, many actors and actresses have
moved through the zip code, but few who left have been able to
replicate their success on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Perry left for a big-screen career, failed and returned to the
fold. Garth stuck to the small-screen, and found a niche as a
teen-set Jane Seymour in innumerable ``issue-oriented'' television
movies. Priestley has also made a few movies, but got more
attention from a 1999 drunk-driving incident.
</P>
<P>
   The ``90210'' yearbook contains two very surprising
developments, however. One is the emergence of Spelling as an
actress unafraid of quirky choices, one with a knack for zany
comedy. Her winning turn in the dark independent movie ``The House
of Yes'' (1997) was a wake-up call to her detractors, and her
self-effacing role in ``Trick'' (1999) earned some outright raves.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that actress who played Steve Sanders' single-mom
love interest a few years back. Remember her? She went on to do an
obscure little indie film ... ``Boys Don't Cry'' (1999). Yes,
Hilary Swank is a ``90210'' alumnus, the first to land a Best
Actress Oscar after passing through the zip code.
</P>
<P>
   That should encourage some of those who are now preparing to be
thrust from the nest. With the last episode already in the can,
Spelling is shooting a pilot comedy for Fox. Thiessen is shooting
one as well, called ``The Peter Principle.'' The other cast members
are reading scripts, so count on seeing them all again, very soon.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it's time to draw the curtain on ``Beverly Hills
90210,'' if for no other reason than that the series has simply run
its course. The original show aspired to focus on the lives of
Hollywood teens as they edge into adulthood, and it's done so _ the
original cast members are now in their late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The show's most substantial legacy is the flock of
teen-populated series that have sprung up in its footsteps. It's a
safe bet that ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Party of Five,'' ``Popular''
and their like would never have existed if ``90210'' hadn't paved
the way.
</P>
<P>
   So ring the bell one more time _ for the class of 1990, school
is finally out.

WHEN IN ROME ... : RUSSELL CROWE FIGHTS ON IN `GLADIATOR'

 (Includes a color slide of Russell Crowe in a scene from
``Gladiator.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Some guys are tough customers, and some are really tough
customers. Then there's Russell Crowe.
 &HT;    Ridley Scott, who directed the Australian actor in the costume
epic ``Gladiator,'' opening May 5, recalls that they had some
problems with an unruly Bengal tiger who was surly and
uncooperative, even biting a stunt man's arm at one point.
 &HT;    ``It was like he could sense our fear,'' Scott says, ``and the
animal had a certain take-no-prisoners mentality. Let's just say he
would not suffer fools.''
 &HT;    But when Crowe walked by, things were different.
 &HT;    ``The stupid thing would lay down on a rock with its paws tucked
under it like it was a house cat,'' Scott says, laughing. ``It
would hunker down. It didn't even let out a peep _ we could barely
get the damn thing to work. And the stupid cat was supposed to be
attacking Russell.''
 &HT;    Even when Crowe is at ease in the posh Century Plaza Hotel in
Century City, Calif., it's easy to see why the tiger was
intimidated. The actor has a take-no-prisoners attitude of his own,
and he means business.
 &HT;    When a writer asks him not to smoke, he scoffs, ``Oh, I forgot
that you're weak of constitution.''
 &HT;    Nor does he shrink from offending Hollywood VIPs such as
Lawrence Kasdan, director of ``The Big Chill'' (1983), ``The
Accidental Tourist'' (1988) and other hits.
 &HT;    ``I had a chat with Lawrence Kasdan last night,'' Crowe says.
``It was so funny, because he's talking to me like he never met me
before. We met on this project years ago. He can't f--king remember
it!
 &HT;    ``I knew I didn't want to work with him.''
 &HT;    Coming off an Oscar nomination for ``The Insider'' (1999), Crowe
_ who's 35, stands 6 feet tall and is casually clad in khaki pants
and a matching sweater _ can afford to ruffle a few feathers. Even
when it comes to ``Gladiator,'' a $107 million-plus adventure film
set in ancient Rome and replete with battle scenes, assassinations
and a climactic showdown in the gladiators' arena between Maximus
(Crowe) and his archenemy Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).
 &HT;    ``Frankly, when I got the script, it wasn't very good,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ``It was too modern and too cynical. I nearly
passed.''
 &HT;    Ultimately, he says, it was the chance to work with Scott,
director of the legendary ``Alien'' (1979) and ``Blade Runner''
(1982), that sold him on the project.
 &HT;    ``Face it,'' he says. ``If you're ever going to take a leap of
faith, it should be with Ridley Scott, who is a straight-talking
bloke. So am I.''
 &HT;    Scott and his crew took months to build a replica of the real
Roman Colosseum, which was re-created in 90-percent scale on Malta.
There Crowe survived some truly staggering battle scenes.
 &HT;    ``You're dealing with going from one 10-day fight sequence to
immediately rehearsing for the next 10-day fight sequence,'' the
Australian says. ``In-between, I'm wrestling with a tiger.''
 &HT;    Both Crowe and Scott have notorious tempers, and some had
predicted that the production's most memorable wrestling might be
between them.
 &HT;    ``It was the exact opposite experience,'' Crowe says. ``I love
somebody who is searching for the absolute right nuance _ I love
that intensity level.
 &HT;    ``Working with Ridley was like doing quantum physics with
Picasso,'' he adds. ``He's got five camera crews, 2,000 extras, 500
horses and 10,000 flaming arrows flying through the air. It was
impressive, mate.''
 &HT;    It was a lot more impressive than the film sets in New Zealand
and Australia on which Crowe grew up, the son of parents who ran a
movie-catering business. He was occasionally drafted for on-camera
work, which he found to be a valuable training ground.
 &HT;    ``I didn't get a lead role until I was 25,'' he says, ``yet I
worked in front of a camera for the first time at age 6. So it was
a 19-year apprenticeship.''
 &HT;    By age 20 Crowe was hoping to become a rock star, but there were
glimmerings of his future career: One of his songs was titled, ``I
Want to Be Like Marlon Brando.''
 &HT;    ``Funny,'' Crowe jokes, ``but while shooting `The Insider,' I
was fat and bald and really looking like Marlon.''
 &HT;    Like his idol, Crowe has played a wide variety of roles, from a
dumpy, middle-aged whistle-blower in ``The Insider'' to a skinhead
in ``Romper Stomper'' (1992), from a clean-cut man of the law in
``L.A. Confidential'' (1997) to a hippie hockey player in
``Mystery, Alaska'' (1999).
 &HT;    Crowe says he was less disappointed at not winning the Oscar
than he was stunned and humbled to be nominated.
 &HT;    ``An Oscar nomination to me is a very important thing,'' he
says. ``It's a great privilege. I know lots of people who have had
stellar and very long careers who have never had the benefit of
being acknowledged by their peers.
 &HT;    ``I really appreciate it,'' he says. ``I'm very thankful. I'm an
Academy Award-nominated actor for the rest of my career, no matter
what s--t I do from here on.''
 &HT;    These days Crowe is filming Taylor Hackford's romantic thriller
``Proof of Life,'' in which he co-stars with Meg Ryan as a hostage
negotiator who falls in love with the wife of a kidnapped
businessman (David Morse).
 &HT;    Hackford is known for his knack for sexy films such as ``An
Officer and a Gentleman'' (1982), ``Against All Odds'' (1984) and
``White Nights'' (1985), but Crowe doesn't like thinking of himself
as a sex symbol.
 &HT;    ``This is not about me,'' he grumbles. ``I'm working with Taylor
because I really loved `An Officer and a Gentleman.' You've got to
pay out the guys who have given you the thrills.
 &HT;    ``Plus he's an out-there cat.''
 &HT;    Next up is a role as a freak-show beast in Jodie Foster's
``Flora Plum.'' After that, he has no firm plans.
 &HT;    ``That might be the last movie I ever do,'' he says with a
shrug. ``If I ended this career tomorrow, I'd be happy with the
fact that I've worked with a whole bunch of blokes who really know
how to make movies. I know guys who don't just shoot a film _ they
tear the thing apart.''
 &HT;    Crowe's lack of Hollywood attitude may reflect the time he
spends between films getting away from it all _ far, far away from
it all, actually, since he heads for his sprawling, 560-acre ranch
in the Australian bush some seven hours north of Sydney.
 &HT;    ``I get up in the morning and check out the cows. Of course,
that's a half day's work,'' Crowe says.
 &HT;    ``It's imperative,'' he continues. ``I need a bit of space. And
it's the things I do outside acting that actually fuel my art _ if
I spent my whole life living in Hollywood, I think I would be a
lesser man. I wouldn't know about life.''
 &HT;    Besides, he adds, certain farm products come in handy in
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I think many people in show business are slightly out of touch
with reality,'' Crowe says. ``For me, it's all about my bulls--t
detector. I want to go back to my farm and visit that kind of bull
s--t.''

INTO AFRICA: KIM BASINGER EXPLORES THE DARK CONTINENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 (Includes a color slide of Kim Basinger in a scene from ``I Dreamed
of Africa.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    She may have an Oscar to her credit, but Kim Basinger is as
insecure as ever.
 &HT;    ``I think we're all insecure,'' says Basinger, who earned her
Best Supporting Actress statuette as the Veronica Lake-like call
girl in ``L.A. Confidential'' (1997). ``We all have our
insecurities, whether we admit it or not. I'm still insecure from
time to time about certain things.
 &HT;    ``The Oscar, to me, was one of the greatest moments I'll ever
have in my life, professionally,'' Basinger admits. ``It gives you
credibility in the eyes of so many people, and they let you know
it.
 &HT;    ``It gave me confidence,'' she says. ``It gave me credibility.
It's nice to be welcomed in that way _ it absolutely gives you more
choices, and more people want to take chances on you.''
 &HT;    Settling in for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel,
Basinger shrugs.
 &HT;    ``It puts you in another place,'' she says. ``But as far as
making me less insecure, every project is the next project and each
one has its own emotional ride.''
 &HT;    Basinger's latest project is ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' which will
open nationwide on May 5. The actress stars in the based-on-fact
film as Kuki Gallmann, an Italian woman who traded a life of
European luxury for the wilds of Kenya.
 &HT;    In her memoir, also titled ``I Dreamed of Africa'' (Viking
Penguin, 1991), Gallmann recounts how she tragically lost her lover
and her son _ played in the film by Vincent Perez and Liam Aiken,
respectively _ but also how she gained strength by becoming a
protector of the land and the animals around her.
 &HT;    ``I read the book and I had a meeting with (producer) Stanley
Jaffe, and that was it,'' says Basinger, who's still gorgeous at 46
and retains more than a touch of her original Southern accent.
``The story had everything _ it had every element any actress could
ever ask for, and it touched me personally.
 &HT;    ``The book was so beautifully written I couldn't get through the
last part,'' she recalls. ``I knew where it was going, and I
couldn't get through it. Kuki is such a beautiful writer _ it was
like a diary.
 &HT;    ``By the last page I was so emotionally moved, and not just by
the tragedies that happened, but by her journey as a woman,'' the
actress says. ``To be able to cinematically fill those shoes, to be
able to play those scenes, it was a gift.''
 &HT;    Making the film, Basinger recalls, was a dream, albeit a dream
fraught with snakes, dust storms and the loss of most of the
luxuries of movie stardom. And it was a long dream, too, as
director Hugh Hudson led his cast and crew through six months of
location shooting in Italy, Kenya and South Africa.
 &HT;    ``I had to face a lot of fears, the biggest one being taking my
then-2-1/2-year-old daughter, Ireland, into the bush,'' says
Basinger, who was also accompanied by her husband, actor Alec
Baldwin. ``But it was an experience that changed me forever.
 &HT;    ``I worked seven days a week,'' she explains. ``On Sundays I was
riding horses or learning how to drive a jeep with my left hand.
 &HT;    ``As a person, to be cut off from what we think of as
civilization,'' Basinger says, ``to have very little electricity,
to have to have water flown in, to live in the bush with the Zulu
people and have my daughter pick up Zulu words ... I could never
sit here and verbally express the mystical, magical, spiritual,
wonderful time I had.
 &HT;    ``It was a time with my family,'' she adds. ``When we took off
from Johannesburg, my husband was holding my hand and I was holding
Ireland's hand. I was crying, he had tears in his eyes.
 &HT;    ``Ireland didn't want to leave at all,'' Basinger says. ``She
asks all the time, `When am I going back to Africa?'''
 &HT;    One of these days, Ireland may ask her mother another question,
one of a far more touchy nature. Early in Basinger's career, she
posed naked for Playboy. She later had several nude scenes opposite
Mickey Rourke in the erotically charged drama, ``Nine 1/2 Weeks''
(1986).
 &HT;    Basinger can't relish the question, but she doesn't dodge the
issue.
 &HT;    ``It's going to be a big question when she gets older,'' she
admits. ``At that time, I really don't know how I'll handle it.
 &HT;    ``But I know one thing: I'd never hide a thing from my
daughter,'' she says. ``I had a journey myself _ I had to go on it.
She will understand every step of the way why I did what I did at
the time and where I was at the time in my life. My daughter and I
don't keep anything from one another, and that's the way it will
be.
 &HT;    ``She understands that he is showing his boom-boom, meaning
(rear end) or that they have goobies, which are these,'' she adds,
pointing to her breasts.
 &HT;    ``We're in a rented house right now that's owned by a bachelor,
and he has a nude little drawing,'' she adds. ``So all of Ireland's
friends know that's the boom-boom and that's the whatever and that
you're not supposed to show those in public.
 &HT;    ``So, yes, it'll be a slight concern of mine, but she will know
me,'' the actress concludes. ``I don't think we'll ever come to
that place where she says, `Why did you do that?' I will have
informed her of why before she ever gets to that place where she
will ask me.''
 &HT;    A smile crosses Basinger's face.
 &HT;    ``Ireland's only 4,'' she adds. ``So we've got a little ways to
go.''
 &HT;    Moviegoers will next see Basinger in the supernatural thriller
``Bless the Child,'' a fall release that she describes as a cross
between ``Rosemary's Baby'' (1968) and ``Ghost'' (1990). Right now,
though, Basinger is spending time with Baldwin and their daughter
in East Hampton, N.Y., reading scripts and basking in her career
revival.
 &HT;    And, though she's well into her 40s in an industry which is
notoriously indifferent toward its aging leading ladies, Basinger
isn't complaining.
 &HT;    ``So far, so good, don't know about the future,'' she says,
reciting the words like a mantra. ``Really. So far, so good. I've
been very blessed and lucky to have been asked to do the last three
movies that I've done. And we just go on.''

WHOSE WHO?: A CLASSIC BAND EYES A NEW GENERATION

Entwistle and the late Keith Moon.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Back in 1965, the Who gave the world one of rock's most
indelible lyrics: ``Hope I die before I get old.''
 &HT;    Mostly they didn't, however, and after 35 years the sentiment
seems more facetious than rebellious.
 &HT;    The venerable British band, which staged a 1982 farewell tour
but has regrouped several times since, has reunited for a summer
tour that will start in June and, possibly, for a studio album that
would be its first in 18 years.
 &HT;    The impetus for the reunion was the release of two vintage
albums earlier this year: ``BBC Sessions,'' a collection of 1960s
and 1970s recordings, and ``The Blues to the Bush,'' a live album
from some 1999 shows that's available only via the Internet site
www.musicmaker.com.
 &HT;    In short, the Who may be getting old, but they're very much
alive.
 &HT;    ``I've always kind of laughed at people who say you're too old
to rock 'n' roll,'' says the 56-year-old Roger Daltrey, who sang
that line in ``My Generation.'' ``To me it's got nothing to do with
your age or any of that _ it's to do with the music and what the
music itself generates.''
 &HT;    That's certainly been true for Daltrey and his colleagues Pete
Townshend and John Entwistle, who remain very active. Daltrey, for
instance, has maintained a busy solo career as a performer,
recording artist and actor. Most recently he's fronted the British
Rock Symphony, which performs orchestral versions of classic rock
hits, and is producing director Brad Silberling's film biography of
the late Who drummer, Keith Moon.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the 55-year-old Entwistle continues to lead his own
band, which has recorded music for the children's cartoon
``Van-pires.'' He also creates rock-themed lithographs and is
writing a memoir about the Who.
 &HT;    The 54-year-old Townshend, who has been the Who's main
songwriter, has overcome bouts with alcoholism and drug addiction
to complete a variety of projects, including the Broadway hit ``The
Who's Tommy'' (1989) and a 1996 stage version of ``Quadrophenia''
(1973).
 &HT;    Most recently, he's resurrected the band's abortive rock opera
``Lifehouse,'' begun in 1970, as a radio play, a stage production
and an album that's available in different configurations via his
Web site at www.eelpie.com.
 &HT;    So it's not as if the three are short of work. But there's a
lure to being the Who that they can't seem to shake, no matter how
many times they promise ``never again.''
 &HT;    ``We've gone up and down over the years,'' Daltrey says. ``It's
never really gone away, though. We enjoy our company. We enjoy the
camaraderie of the band now. Pete has come an awful long way in his
addiction program now _ he hasn't gotten all the old hangups he
used to. It's really great fun being back together.''
 &HT;    Entwistle agrees.
 &HT;    ``It's really natural, kind of like a sixth sense,'' he says.
``You turn your brain off and, as long as you don't think of what
you're playing, it just falls together very naturally.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Entwistle cautions that, while the band does plan
some exploratory recording sessions, there's no guarantee that an
album will result.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, if we don't like it, it won't come out,'' says the
bassist/songwriter, whose contributions to the Who canon include
``Boris the Spider,'' ``My Wife'' and ``Had Enough.'' ``We've
agreed to go into the studio and have a go at one. It's basically
`What's the Who going to be like in the year 2000?'
 &HT;    ``And if you like the result, then there'll be an album.''
 &HT;    Townshend also emphasizes the provisional nature of their
upcoming studio work.
 &HT;    ``We don't have a record deal,'' he says. ``Nothing is going to
get me into the studio with a bullying producer to spend six months
trying to wring something out of my soul which is not appropriate
to either the band or the rock-'n'-roll market.
 &HT;    ``I can't imagine ever going into the studio and doing what we
used to do, with a hard-knock producer and spending six months
perfecting something,'' Townshend adds. ``I don't think the climate
now is about that, not with people making records in their garages
or bedrooms.''
 &HT;    What the band should sound like now is still very much up in the
air. Entwistle says he's hoping for something that hits hard and
heavy, like the Who of the 1960s and 1970s.
 &HT;    ``I hope it's going to go back to `Who Are You' (1978), rather
than `Face Dances' (1981) and `It's Hard' (1982),'' he says. ``I
think the feeling is it's going to be a lot more uptempo, upfront.
 &HT;    ``I've said that before,'' Entwistle adds, ``and I usually end
up with the only rock-'n'-roll songs on the album. But hopefully it
can be different this time.''
 &HT;    Daltrey, who has three songs for the next Who project already
finished and plans to write with Townshend for the first time ever,
is confident that the group can rekindle the vital, deep-reaching,
empathetic musical craft of its heyday.
 &HT;    ``It's a very unique band,'' he says. ``You can hear the
influences, but it's not derivative. If you hear the Stones, they
are derivative of Chuck Berry and the early blues people. With the
Who, you can hear the influences of those people, but it's become
something totally, totally different, with the way Pete wrote his
songs and the structures.
 &HT;    ``And what he wrote about ... where everybody else was writing
about sex and `I'd like to screw you, baby' in various different
ways, Pete was more interested in the psychological problems of the
adolescent and the young man,'' Daltrey adds. ``And that, of
course, is timeless, because it doesn't change. There's just a new
generation that comes around with the same set of problems.''
 &HT;    It remains to be seen, of course, whether that new generation
wants to hear those problems explored by three men in their 50s.
Daltrey concedes that it's important for the band to move beyond
the nostalgic appeal of its classic tunes to address its fans'
current issues.
 &HT;    ``I've always been of the opinion that, if Pete could write
about the problems of adolescence, why can't he write about the
problems of middle age?'' Daltrey says.
 &HT;    ``Our audience hasn't gone away,'' he adds. ``They're still
going through the same things I am, that Pete is, all those little
insecurities and everything. No one is completely cleaned up and
knows where they're going, ever in their life.
 &HT;    ``I don't think so, anyway,'' he says with a laugh. ``They may
think they know where they're going, but they probably won't end up
there.''
 &HT;    Whether any of these new songs will be heard in the upcoming
tour is another question, however. After seeing other bands perform
new material live, Daltrey admits that he's a little reluctant to
chance it.
 &HT;    ``Half the audience gets up and goes to the bar or the toilet,''
he says. ``We don't want to ram new stuff down the throats of
people who don't particularly want to hear new stuff, because we
can't at the present time play enough of our old stuff.''
 &HT;    That may be the band's next argument, though, because Townshend
definitely wants to give his audience new music.
 &HT;    ``When you look at the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, you
want to know where they are going to go now,'' he says. ``You know
where they have been, you want to know what they are going to do
next.
 &HT;    ``You want to hear what we're doing today.''

 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before May 14. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expectations were generally low when Fox launched ``Beverly
Hills 90210,'' way back on Oct. 4, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pilot episode, with privileged kids driving BMWs to
school while wearing Armani and talking on cell phones, wasn't
promising _ it looked like a mix of ``Eight Is Enough'' and
``Valley Of The Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, however, things improved. Each of the six leads
developed a distinct persona, both onscreen and off, and the
storylines settled into deeper material such as drugs, sex and
general teen angst.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, teens on television became a hot commodity, as
``90210'' became the first television phenomenon of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, it's time to say goodbye to ``90210.''
Continuously sliding ratings have ceased to justify the $2.2
million production cost of each episode, and although the series
still rates well among its target demographic ... well, let's face
it, the cast are getting a bit long in the tooth for a ``Dawson's
Creek'' world.
</P>
<P>
   Teaser trailers have revealed that the final episode, which will
air on May 17, features a wedding. Translation: Do you, Donna (Tori
Spelling), take this man, David (Brian Austin Greene), to be your
lawful wedded husband?
</P>
<P>
   There will also be some not-so-surprising returns _ paging
Gabrielle Carteris and Tiffani Amber Thiessen! _ since Fox plans to
send ``90210'' out on a happy, all-the-loose-ends-knotted note, a
la ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   But we come not to bury ``90210,'' but to praise it. What kept
viewers tuning in for 10 seasons? It's easy to write it off as the
appeal of the show's likeable, good-looking leads, but its tangy
writing must not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, ``90210'' was created and run by Aaron Spelling, the
same man who devised such long-running tacky-television classics as
``The Mod Squad'' (1968-1973), ``The Love Boat'' (1977-1986),
``Fantasy Island'' (1978-1984) and ``Dynasty'' (1981-1989). And one
of the first laws of Spelling Entertainment is that, if you want
viewers to keep coming back, you'd better throw one hell of a bitch
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned years ago,'' the producer says, ``that if you want
to keep things interesting, you put a cat in among the canaries.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Melrose Place,'' that role fell to blonde-tressed Heather
Locklear. On ``90210,'' at least in the early years, it was up to
the wretched Brenda Walsh, played by Shannen Doherty, currently
starring on WB's witchy series ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda was ostensibly the twin sister of Brandon _ a.k.a. Jason
Priestley, who was and is actually a bit prettier _ and almost all
the storylines for the first four seasons seemed to revolve around
Brenda, whether it was her on-again/off-again romance with the
rebellious Dylan (Luke Perry) or her madcap trip to France with
Donna and Kelly (Jennie Garth).
</P>
<P>
   Things got serious, too _ unlike the ``Dawson's Creek''
ensemble, the ``90210'' crowd were neither self-absorbed nor
completely sex-obsessed. They weren't as inaccessibly wordy _ in
fact, most of the time they spoke like real teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all of their actions were accompanied by
repercussions, especially sex. The first-season episode in which
Brandon lost his virginity to a visiting ex-girlfriend stood out:
He ended up feeling guilty and confused, a stark contrast to the
elation that typically follows every television character's first
sexual experience.
</P>
<P>
   Today the cult of ``90210'' is global. The series airs in more
than 80 countries, and the Internet is cluttered with devoted fan
sites. In Japan, ``90210'' cultists have given the show and its
American Teen Dream a crazed reverence, with memorabilia trading
for incredible prices.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is common among all fans, though: They refer to the
show's golden age as ``the Brenda Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``90210's'' early success was due to Doherty's wild-girl
rampage through Hollywood. The media couldn't get enough of her
ever-escalating antics. Like the mallrat from hell, she left a
trail of broken windows, black eyes and ex-boyfriends in her wake,
and the show's ratings skyrocketed as viewers delighted in seeing
the offscreen bad girl being forced to play a slightly snippy
high-schooler on television.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe ``90210'' faltered after Doherty was
unceremoniously dumped in 1994 over what were delicately called
``creative differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine works a lot better now,'' co-star Ian Ziering said
at the time. ``The lunatic is no longer running the asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans clamored for Doherty's return, but co-executive producer
Steve Wasserman vowed, ``She'll never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't, and many felt that the show was never the same.
Thiessen did her best, but never quite captured fans' attention the
way Doherty had, and each ensuing season was a little blander than
the last.
</P>
<P>
   There have certainly been some bright spots along the way,
however, most notably the touching episode last year, written by
Ziering, that dealt with Alzheimer's disease and earned an Emmy
nomination for guest star Milton Berle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decade of its existence, many actors and actresses have
moved through the zip code, but few who left have been able to
replicate their success on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Perry left for a big-screen career, failed and returned to the
fold. Garth stuck to the small-screen, and found a niche as a
teen-set Jane Seymour in innumerable ``issue-oriented'' television
movies. Priestley has also made a few movies, but got more
attention from a 1999 drunk-driving incident.
</P>
<P>
   The ``90210'' yearbook contains two very surprising
developments, however. One is the emergence of Spelling as an
actress unafraid of quirky choices, one with a knack for zany
comedy. Her winning turn in the dark independent movie ``The House
of Yes'' (1997) was a wake-up call to her detractors, and her
self-effacing role in ``Trick'' (1999) earned some outright raves.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that actress who played Steve Sanders' single-mom
love interest a few years back. Remember her? She went on to do an
obscure little indie film ... ``Boys Don't Cry'' (1999). Yes,
Hilary Swank is a ``90210'' alumnus, the first to land a Best
Actress Oscar after passing through the zip code.
</P>
<P>
   That should encourage some of those who are now preparing to be
thrust from the nest. With the last episode already in the can,
Spelling is shooting a pilot comedy for Fox. Thiessen is shooting
one as well, called ``The Peter Principle.'' The other cast members
are reading scripts, so count on seeing them all again, very soon.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it's time to draw the curtain on ``Beverly Hills
90210,'' if for no other reason than that the series has simply run
its course. The original show aspired to focus on the lives of
Hollywood teens as they edge into adulthood, and it's done so _ the
original cast members are now in their late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The show's most substantial legacy is the flock of
teen-populated series that have sprung up in its footsteps. It's a
safe bet that ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Party of Five,'' ``Popular''
and their like would never have existed if ``90210'' hadn't paved
the way.
</P>
<P>
   So ring the bell one more time _ for the class of 1990, school
is finally out.

&HT;     GROUP RALLIES ASIAN-AMERICAN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary

   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ Political ``empowerment'' has become a Holy
Grail for many Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One group aggressively pushing this envelope is the 80-20
Initiative, an Asian-American political action committee. It is the
brainchild of S.B. Woo, a physics professor at the University of
Delaware who is a former Democratic lieutenant governor of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Woo also ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for a
U.S. Senate seat in the state and wanted, but did not get, a
high-level appointment in the Clinton administration in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, he and about a dozen like-minded
Chinese-Americans (including former University of California at
Berkeley chancellor Chang-lin Tien), launched 80-20 largely as a
cyberspace movement to try to influence the two major parties'
presidential candidates this year. The goal is to deliver 80
percent of the Asian-American vote and contributions in California,
New York and New Jersey to the candidate who commits to the group's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, it is unlikely the group will meet that
goal given the highly diverse and internally contentious
Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   The group's agenda includes an implicit demand that an
Asian-American be appointed to the next presidential Cabinet (which
would be a first).
</P>
<P>
   Also wanted are other presidential appointments, as well as
congressional hearings on why highly educated and highly qualified
Asian-Americans aren't better represented in corporate management
and university faculties.
</P>
<P>
   According to Woo, the group began with an e-mail support list of
300. It now has 150,000, he said, and aims to have 2.5 million in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, 80-20 held a fund-raising banquet attended by some
300 people at the glitzy Marriott Hotel in downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The group billed the occasion as ``historic'' because it raised
$100,000, an amount the group called a record for Asian-American
political fund-raisers in San Francisco. Other political observers
aren't so sure that amount is a record. In any event, $100,000,
while a tidy sum, won't excite fund-raising professionals in the
two major parties who regularly see millions of dollars raised at
events in Hollywood, New York, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some in the crowd called the movement important
because it is a concerted attempt to galvanize the nascent
political yearnings of Asian-Americans who have heretofore not been
politically engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the strength of 80-20 appears to be immigrant
Chinese-American, middle-aged academics and scientists who are
fluent in Mandarin, which is only one segment of the multifaceted
Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   As 80-20 has grown, it has upset Asian-American activists in
both major parties. Just before the California primary election in
March, 80-20 called for a boycott of the Republican Party because
two of its candidates at the time, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, did not respond to the group's demand
to sign its declaration, while the two Democratic candidates, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, had.
Shortly before its San Francisco fund-raiser, however, the group
rescinded its call for a GOP boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Even though 80-20 urged its supporters to work for either Gore
or Bradley during the primary season, some Asian-American
Democratic loyalists have questioned what 80-20 will do with the
$250,000 it has raised thus far. Woo said the group intends to
spend the money on voter registration drives, get-out-the-vote
efforts and hiring staff.
</P>
<P>
   The next big step for the group is its endorsement process this
summer. A committee made up of one-third Democrats, one-third
Republicans and one-third independents will decide which
presidential candidate to endorse based on deeds between January
1999 and this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party that has done the most for us will get our
endorsement,'' Woo said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many other Asian-American political groups are active
throughout the nation, 80-20 sometimes gives the impression it is
the only such game in town. And it has managed to garner unusual
attention because of Woo's drive and a persistent e-mail campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the group exemplifies a hunger that continues
to go unfed by the mainstream political system.

TIME TO END MILITARY'S ``DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL'' POLICY

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Last December, Defense Secretary William Cohen directed the
Office of the Inspector General to survey military personnel
regarding the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy concerning
homosexuals. The policy requires that gay men, lesbians and
bisexuals in the Armed Forces keep silent about their sexual
orientation. They are also not permitted to engage in homosexual
acts.
 &HT;    Cohen requested an ``assessment in order to evaluate the climate
at representative military installations in each service with
regard to our policy on homosexual conduct.''
 &HT;    Cohen's directive came in the wake of the last July's murder of
21-year-old Pvt. Barry Winchell, who was bludgeoned to death at
Fort Campbell, Ky. by fellow service members.
 &HT;    Recently, Cohen released the results of that survey, conducted
at 38 bases and on 11 ships and submarines, from Jan. 24 through
Feb. 11, 2000. The results indicate serious problems in a
pervasively hostile, antigay climate in all four branches of the
Armed Forces.
 &HT;    A whopping 80 percent of the 71,500 service members questioned
reported hearing antigay remarks during 1999. Moreover, 33 percent
said they heard such remarks often or very often. The types of
antigay behavior reported by service members included the
following.
 &HT;    _ Offensive speech: 89 percent
 &HT;    _ Hostile gestures: 35 percent
 &HT;    _ Threats of intimidation: 20 percent
 &HT;    _ Graffiti: 15 percent
 &HT;    _ Physical assault: 9 percent
 &HT;    _ Vandalism of personal property: 8 percent.
 &HT;    The survey also found that junior personnel most frequently
perpetuated the harassment against other junior enlisted service
members. Regardless, 73 percent said that even when senior
personnel witnessed such harassment, they did nothing to stop it.
 &HT;    What is even more alarming is the fact that 37 percent of those
who participated in the survey said they had either witnessed or
seen harassment based on sexual orientation.
 &HT;    Cohen said he was ``surprised at the numbers'' of service
members who had witnessed some form of antigay harassment. ``The
incidents and use of abusive language are more widespread than I
had anticipated,'' he reported to the Houston Chronicle.
 &HT;    The only positive outcome of these disturbing findings is that
after years of denial, Pentagon officials are finally acknowledging
that they have a serious, long-standing problem on their hands.
 &HT;    Why has it taken the military top brass so long to believe that
antigay remarks and harassment abound in the Armed Forces?
 &HT;    For more than six years, the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, or SLDN, has been documenting violations in connection
with the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Earlier this month, the
network published its sixth annual report, citing 968 incidents of
antigay harassment during the past year, including assaults, death
threats and verbal gay-bashing. They report an increase in
harassment of nearly 150 percent from the previous year's 400
reported incidents.
 &HT;    The Pentagon survey ``simply corroborates what we've been
telling them for the last six years,'' said SLDN co-executive
director Dixon Osborn to the New York Times.
 &HT;    SLDN co-executive director Michelle Benecke told the Houston
Chronicle why harassment has become such a serious problem.
 &HT;    ``Ultimately, the key to stopping harassment and other
violations of 'don't ask, don't tell' violence against gays in the
military is leadership and accountability.'' Benecke said. ``Unless
they take immediate steps, someone else is going to get hurt.''
 &HT;    The policy, which was intended to help gays serve in the Armed
Forces, has proven to be detrimental and demeaning. Thousands of
gay service members have been discharged in recent years.
 &HT;    Prior to and during the implementation of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' military officials have asserted that the presence of
openly gay service members would undermine morale and unit
cohesion.
 &HT;    Now, with the undeniable results of this survey, Cohen is in the
embarrassing position of having to admit that antigay harassment
itself is what undermines the good order and discipline that is
critical to an effective fighting force.
 &HT;    ``When you have a policy that treats an entire class of people
as second-class citizens, it suggests that you can treat them that
way,'' Osborn told The New York Times.
 &HT;    It is time for the policy to change. The country needs the kind
of policy shift that President Harry Truman initiated when he fully
integrated the military after World War II.
 &HT;    Cohen must advocate for the abolishment of the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy. He must act now, before another private loses
his or her life to violence at the hands of fellow country men. &HT;

ARE ATHLETES OF AFRICAN DESCENT SUPERIOR?

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    March Madness is over, and the process of deciding which college
athletes will be drafted by the NBA has begun. In the NBA
approximately 80 percent of the players are of African descent. In
the WNBA, 70 percent of the female team members are black. Given
these statistics, the NBA and WNBA pose questions about race and
sport.
 &HT;    Jon Entine, a white journalist, addresses the subject of the
alleged predominance of black athletes, ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes
Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It''
(PublicAffairs, LLC 1999). The book jacket reads, in part:
``Drawing on the latest scientific research, Entine persuasively
shows why biology and ancestry are significant components of the
stunning ascension of black athletes ...''
 &HT;    Entine hopes his book will produce a dialogue. He wants us to
examine why black athletes dominate sports and why we are afraid to
talk about it.
 &HT;    Fine, let's have a dialogue, but let's begin with some facts.
The reality, according to sociologist and professor Harry Edwards,
is that white athletes dominate 95 percent of all sports.
 &HT;    White athletes dominate archery, auto racing, badminton,
bicycling, discus, diving, extreme sports, fencing, golf,
gymnastics, hockey, horse racing, javelin, pole vault, rowing,
shot-put, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, walking, water polo,
yachting, and all of the winter sports.
 &HT;    Entine's thinks we are afraid to discuss the possibility that
people of African descent have some genetic predisposition to
athleticism. The subject is hardly new. Decades ago, scientists
examined black athletes to determine if there were any anatomical
reasons for their athletic success. They found none.
 &HT;    In 1936, Jesse Owens was poked and prodded for evidence of
racial superiority. At that time, researchers were unconvinced that
``Negroid physical characters are anatomically concerned with the
present dominance of Negro athletes.''
 &HT;    Is it nearly impossible to determine the genetic factors that
may or may not be involved in a black athlete's performance. How
can you prove how much of a trait is shaped by genes or the
environment? What other variables that contribute to an athlete's
success should we consider as well?
 &HT;    John Phillips, who is quoted in Entine's book, offers a counter
view to the notion of black athletic predominance, which raises
different and, perhaps, more relevant questions.
 &HT;    ``Black athletes are concentrated in those sports in which
blacks in general have access _ in terms of coaching, facilities
and competitions. For sports in which blacks are rare, the best
facilities, coaching and competition are found in private clubs. If
blacks were dispersed across all sports, their apparent superiority
would largely disappear,'' Phillips said.
 &HT;    Instead of asking if athletes of African descent are superior,
perhaps we should ask simpler questions. For instance, why aren't
more people of color involved in sports like swimming? And why
aren't blacks more involved in coaching, management and ownership
of sports teams at all levels?
 &HT;    These are questions that speak not only to race and sports, but
to class and opportunity.

 By AMY WU 
 &HT;    The uncertainty of Elian Gonzalez's fate has spurred massive
protests in Little Havana. The raucous scene, described by some as
``an out-of-control banana republic,'' has also caused many
Cuban-Americans to question their national allegiance and identity.
 &HT;    Recent press reports reveal that Cuban-American police officers
at the scene are confused about their cultural identity. They feel
pressured by the crowds, who want the officers to sympathize with
their pleas to let Elian remain in America because they share
similar roots. On the other hand, some officers want to distance
themselves from this battle. One cop, quoted in The Wall Street
Journal, said, ``I'm first and foremost an American.''
 &HT;    The custody battle that has divided the Cuban-American community
has reminded me of my own mixed feelings about my Chinese ancestry
and American identity.
 &HT;    Recently, I found myself walking along crowded Canal Street in
New York City's Chinatown. It was familiar territory, since I had
walked the same path as a teen _ only then I did it unwillingly.
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, my family's weekly ritual was to take an
hour-long drive to Chinatown. Back then, I protested the ritual
because I was ashamed of being surrounded by people who clearly
looked very similar to me but, to my mind, were in another world.
 &HT;    The Chinese who occupied the open markets, mom-and-pop stores
and laundromats of Chinatown were new immigrants. Their clothes
were worn, and they spoke in a foul-sounding dialect called
Cantonese.
 &HT;    I distanced myself from them by refusing to speak Chinese and
reveal the existence of my Chinese name. In short, I distanced
myself from anything ``Asian.''
 &HT;    My father had a cousin from China who became a waiter at one of
Chinatown's restaurants. I remember ignoring him and feeling
ashamed whenever we all stopped to chat.
 &HT;    Much like today's Cuban-American police officers, I thought to
myself, ``I am an American first and foremost.''
 &HT;    But my strong feelings about, and memories of, New York City's
Chinatown began to change when, at 21, I sought a promising
journalism career in Hong Kong and had to stroll through that
city's streets, which eerily mirrored those of New York's Asian
district.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, I was thrown into a world where everyone looked
like me, and I held the false belief that I would fit in simply
because all of us shared similar features and names.
 &HT;    The sales ladies spoke to me in Cantonese, as did the bus
drivers and bank tellers, and they all froze in disbelief when I
answered them in English.
 &HT;    In contrast to my childhood thoughts, I now felt a strong desire
to belong. I wanted to soak in their dialect, eat their foods,
understand the humor in their jokes, watch their TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    In short, I wanted to binge on the culture and ``become
Chinese.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, I found myself caught between cultures and
confused about wanting to assimilate and disassimilate.
 &HT;    A Chinese-American friend who had lived in Hong Kong for four
years told me there are no in-betweens. I had to choose to either
be a local or a foreigner.
 &HT;    During my time in Hong Kong, I learned that gaining an identity
was not as simple as slipping a new outfit over an old one.
Relearning the language and eating the native foods wasn't enough.
Like any foreign culture, the Chinese people have a unique state of
mind and follow a different set of principles.
 &HT;    For example, as a woman born and raised in the United States, I
believe in being independent and in the importance of my career.
Going dutch on dates is the norm in America (at least in the
beginning). In Hong Kong _ and, frankly, in most of Asia _ that is
simply foolish. In Hong Kong, well-educated women dream of
secretarial positions at big companies, where they will hopefully
marry the boss. During my stay, I neither shared their beliefs nor
understood the intricacies of their jokes.
 &HT;    Over time, I found comfort in accepting the fact that complete
assimilation is a myth, and it was something I no longer desired. I
also learned that distancing oneself from one's roots is tragic.
 &HT;    I recently returned to New York City's Chinatown and walked the
same streets I despised as a teen. I saw those same people who once
repulsed me. This time around, however, I felt at ease. The street
peddlers and new immigrants were still working, but I no longer
felt the need to completely associate with, or disassociate from,
them. I realized I could maintain my sense of self _ be a proud
Chinese-American _ and still learn about my culture from them.
 &HT;    I decided I would speak the language and eat the food safely,
and that I would not look down or reject these people with whom I
shared similar roots _ but little else. I did not have to hate them
for who they are or hate myself for who I am.
 &HT;    It is OK to be confused about your identity, but you should
never amputate yourself from your roots.
 &HT;    If anything positive is to come from little Elian's fate, it may
be that first-generation and second-generation hyphenated-Americans
will re-examine who they are and how they see themselves living in
hyphenated-America.

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nearly 150 years after the Confederate battle flag last flew
above a rebel army, the meaning of that bit of cloth is still
controversial.
 &HT;    Is it an innocent, harmless symbol of a region's cultural
heritage, without political or racial implications?
 &HT;    Or is it the most sacred symbol of slavery, the
institutionalized essence of racism?
 &HT;    Suspend the debate. Go to the archives and read, and let the
Confederates themselves supply the answer.
 &HT;    First let's consult one of the Confederacy's most articulate
founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, who
served under Jefferson Davis as vice president of the Confederate
States of America.
 &HT;    Addressing his fellow Georgians in Savannah on March 21, 1861 _
less than a month before Confederates gathered in South Carolina at
Charleston Bay and fired on Fort Sumter _ Stephens began by
disclosing that the Union's founding fathers were privately
convinced that slavery was ``wrong in principal, socially, morally
and politically,'' and that ``the institution would be evanescent
and pass away.''
 &HT;    Speaking on behalf of the Confederacy, Stephens begged to
differ.
 &HT;    ``Our government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea,'' he
declared. ``Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. That
slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and
normal condition.''
 &HT;    Describing the embryonic Confederate States of America, Stephens
made clear that racism was part and parcel of its conception.
 &HT;    ``This, our new government, is the first in the history of the
world based upon this great physical and moral truth'' that the
``negro, by nature or by the curse of Canaan, is fitted for the
condition which he occupies in our system.''
 &HT;    He went on to explain that blacks were held in slavery in a
fulfilment of nothing less than the will of God.
 &HT;    ``The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted
by nature for it,'' Stephens said, ``and by experience we know that
it is best, not only for the superior but for the inferior race,
that it should be so. It is indeed in conformity with the ordinance
of the Creator.''
 &HT;    Stephens also criticized the United States Constitution, under
which we live today, holding that it was not racist enough to
guarantee the durability of slavery.
 &HT;    While the old Constitution embraced a fugitive-slave clause and
specified that blacks should count as three-fifths of a white man
for tax purposes, the leaders of the new Confederate government
felt that it did not spell out white superiority boldly and
directly enough.
 &HT;    The rebellion leaders were for real. Driven by a racist
philosophy not widely at odds with the anti-Semitism preached by
Hitler. rebel leaders wanted to make their racial views universal,
endowing themselves with a messianic racial mission.
 &HT;    ``The progress of disintegration in the old Union may be
expected to go on with almost absolute certainty,'' Stephens
announced. ``We are now the nucleus of a growing power, which, if
we are true to ourselves, our destiny and high mission, will become
the controlling power on this continent.''
 &HT;    But the Confederates did not limit their racial goals to this
continent alone. Like Hitler's dream of Aryan superiority, theirs
was a ``tomorrow the world'' ideology.
 &HT;    ``It is upon this (that) our actual fabric is firmly planted,''
Stephens proclaimed, ``and I cannot permit myself to doubt the
ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout
the civilized and enlightened world.''
 &HT;    Yes, the man said ``enlightened world.''
 &HT;    But please don't write off Stephens as an oddball. His racial
views were typically Confederate.
 &HT;    When Texas leaders, meeting at a Secession Convention on
February 1, 1861, voted to became the seventh state to join the
rebellion, for example, they accused the North of ``hostility to
these Southern states and their beneficent and patriarchal system
of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality
of all men, irrespective of race or color.''
 &HT;    To Texas secessionists, racial equality was ``a doctrine at war
with nature,'' and they insisted that ``the servitude of the
African race ... is abundantly authorized and justified by the
experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty
Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations.''
 &HT;    The banner under which that ideology marched off to war, fired
its guns, drew swords and filled hundreds of thousands of graves
was the Confederate battle flag. It is that flag which today
insults all blacks citizens in South Carolina and Georgia,
declaring the survival of a doctrine still at war with human
decency.
 &HT;    When will enough Americans summon the guts to state, with firm
resolution, the simple truth that the Confederates themselves had
no difficulty enunciating: The Confederate battle flag is no simple
emblem of an ``honorable regional cultural heritage,'' but the
embodiment of a sentiment and mission only marginally better than
that expressed, not so long ago, by the swastika.
 &HT;    That flag has no place waving above or on the grounds of any
city, county, state or federal building in the United States.

TIME TO END MILITARY'S ``DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL'' POLICY

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Last December, Defense Secretary William Cohen directed the
Office of the Inspector General to survey military personnel
regarding the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy concerning
homosexuals. The policy requires that gay men, lesbians and
bisexuals in the Armed Forces keep silent about their sexual
orientation. They are also not permitted to engage in homosexual
acts.
 &HT;    Cohen requested an ``assessment in order to evaluate the climate
at representative military installations in each service with
regard to our policy on homosexual conduct.''
 &HT;    Cohen's directive came in the wake of the last July's murder of
21-year-old Pvt. Barry Winchell, who was bludgeoned to death at
Fort Campbell, Ky. by fellow service members.
 &HT;    Recently, Cohen released the results of that survey, conducted
at 38 bases and on 11 ships and submarines, from Jan. 24 through
Feb. 11, 2000. The results indicate serious problems in a
pervasively hostile, antigay climate in all four branches of the
Armed Forces.
 &HT;    A whopping 80 percent of the 71,500 service members questioned
reported hearing antigay remarks during 1999. Moreover, 33 percent
said they heard such remarks often or very often. The types of
antigay behavior reported by service members included the
following.
 &HT;    _ Offensive speech: 89 percent
 &HT;    _ Hostile gestures: 35 percent
 &HT;    _ Threats of intimidation: 20 percent
 &HT;    _ Graffiti: 15 percent
 &HT;    _ Physical assault: 9 percent
 &HT;    _ Vandalism of personal property: 8 percent.
 &HT;    The survey also found that junior personnel most frequently
perpetuated the harassment against other junior enlisted service
members. Regardless, 73 percent said that even when senior
personnel witnessed such harassment, they did nothing to stop it.
 &HT;    What is even more alarming is the fact that 37 percent of those
who participated in the survey said they had either witnessed or
seen harassment based on sexual orientation.
 &HT;    Cohen said he was ``surprised at the numbers'' of service
members who had witnessed some form of antigay harassment. ``The
incidents and use of abusive language are more widespread than I
had anticipated,'' he reported to the Houston Chronicle.
 &HT;    The only positive outcome of these disturbing findings is that
after years of denial, Pentagon officials are finally acknowledging
that they have a serious, long-standing problem on their hands.
 &HT;    Why has it taken the military top brass so long to believe that
antigay remarks and harassment abound in the Armed Forces?
 &HT;    For more than six years, the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, or SLDN, has been documenting violations in connection
with the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Earlier this month, the
network published its sixth annual report, citing 968 incidents of
antigay harassment during the past year, including assaults, death
threats and verbal gay-bashing. They report an increase in
harassment of nearly 150 percent from the previous year's 400
reported incidents.
 &HT;    The Pentagon survey ``simply corroborates what we've been
telling them for the last six years,'' said SLDN co-executive
director Dixon Osborn to the New York Times.
 &HT;    SLDN co-executive director Michelle Benecke told the Houston
Chronicle why harassment has become such a serious problem.
 &HT;    ``Ultimately, the key to stopping harassment and other
violations of 'don't ask, don't tell' violence against gays in the
military is leadership and accountability.'' Benecke said. ``Unless
they take immediate steps, someone else is going to get hurt.''
 &HT;    The policy, which was intended to help gays serve in the Armed
Forces, has proven to be detrimental and demeaning. Thousands of
gay service members have been discharged in recent years.
 &HT;    Prior to and during the implementation of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' military officials have asserted that the presence of
openly gay service members would undermine morale and unit
cohesion.
 &HT;    Now, with the undeniable results of this survey, Cohen is in the
embarrassing position of having to admit that antigay harassment
itself is what undermines the good order and discipline that is
critical to an effective fighting force.
 &HT;    ``When you have a policy that treats an entire class of people
as second-class citizens, it suggests that you can treat them that
way,'' Osborn told The New York Times.
 &HT;    It is time for the policy to change. The country needs the kind
of policy shift that President Harry Truman initiated when he fully
integrated the military after World War II.
 &HT;    Cohen must advocate for the abolishment of the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy. He must act now, before another private loses
his or her life to violence at the hands of fellow country men.

ARE ATHLETES OF AFRICAN DESCENT SUPERIOR?

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    March Madness is over, and the process of deciding which college
athletes will be drafted by the NBA has begun. In the NBA
approximately 80 percent of the players are of African descent. In
the WNBA, 70 percent of the female team members are black. Given
these statistics, the NBA and WNBA pose questions about race and
sport.
 &HT;    Jon Entine, a white journalist, addresses the subject of the
alleged predominance of black athletes, ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes
Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It''
(PublicAffairs, LLC 1999). The book jacket reads, in part:
``Drawing on the latest scientific research, Entine persuasively
shows why biology and ancestry are significant components of the
stunning ascension of black athletes ...''
 &HT;    Entine hopes his book will produce a dialogue. He wants us to
examine why black athletes dominate sports and why we are afraid to
talk about it.
 &HT;    Fine, let's have a dialogue, but let's begin with some facts.
The reality, according to sociologist and professor Harry Edwards,
is that white athletes dominate 95 percent of all sports.
 &HT;    White athletes dominate archery, auto racing, badminton,
bicycling, discus, diving, extreme sports, fencing, golf,
gymnastics, hockey, horse racing, javelin, pole vault, rowing,
shot-put, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, walking, water polo,
yachting, and all of the winter sports.
 &HT;    Entine's thinks we are afraid to discuss the possibility that
people of African descent have some genetic predisposition to
athleticism. The subject is hardly new. Decades ago, scientists
examined black athletes to determine if there were any anatomical
reasons for their athletic success. They found none.
 &HT;    In 1936, Jesse Owens was poked and prodded for evidence of
racial superiority. At that time, researchers were unconvinced that
``Negroid physical characters are anatomically concerned with the
present dominance of Negro athletes.''
 &HT;    Is it nearly impossible to determine the genetic factors that
may or may not be involved in a black athlete's performance. How
can you prove how much of a trait is shaped by genes or the
environment? What other variables that contribute to an athlete's
success should we consider as well?
 &HT;    John Phillips, who is quoted in Entine's book, offers a counter
view to the notion of black athletic predominance, which raises
different and, perhaps, more relevant questions.
 &HT;    ``Black athletes are concentrated in those sports in which
blacks in general have access _ in terms of coaching, facilities
and competitions. For sports in which blacks are rare, the best
facilities, coaching and competition are found in private clubs. If
blacks were dispersed across all sports, their apparent superiority
would largely disappear,'' Phillips said.
 &HT;    Instead of asking if athletes of African descent are superior,
perhaps we should ask simpler questions. For instance, why aren't
more people of color involved in sports like swimming? And why
aren't blacks more involved in coaching, management and ownership
of sports teams at all levels?
 &HT;    These are questions that speak not only to race and sports, but
to class and opportunity.

 By AMY WU 
 &HT;    The uncertainty of Elian Gonzalez's fate has spurred massive
protests in Little Havana. The raucous scene, described by some as
``an out-of-control banana republic,'' has also caused many
Cuban-Americans to question their national allegiance and identity.
 &HT;    Recent press reports reveal that Cuban-American police officers
at the scene are confused about their cultural identity. They feel
pressured by the crowds, who want the officers to sympathize with
their pleas to let Elian remain in America because they share
similar roots. On the other hand, some officers want to distance
themselves from this battle. One cop, quoted in The Wall Street
Journal, said, ``I'm first and foremost an American.''
 &HT;    The custody battle that has divided the Cuban-American community
has reminded me of my own mixed feelings about my Chinese ancestry
and American identity.
 &HT;    Recently, I found myself walking along crowded Canal Street in
New York City's Chinatown. It was familiar territory, since I had
walked the same path as a teen _ only then I did it unwillingly.
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, my family's weekly ritual was to take an
hour-long drive to Chinatown. Back then, I protested the ritual
because I was ashamed of being surrounded by people who clearly
looked very similar to me but, to my mind, were in another world.
 &HT;    The Chinese who occupied the open markets, mom-and-pop stores
and laundromats of Chinatown were new immigrants. Their clothes
were worn, and they spoke in a foul-sounding dialect called
Cantonese.
 &HT;    I distanced myself from them by refusing to speak Chinese and
reveal the existence of my Chinese name. In short, I distanced
myself from anything ``Asian.''
 &HT;    My father had a cousin from China who became a waiter at one of
Chinatown's restaurants. I remember ignoring him and feeling
ashamed whenever we all stopped to chat.
 &HT;    Much like today's Cuban-American police officers, I thought to
myself, ``I am an American first and foremost.''
 &HT;    But my strong feelings about, and memories of, New York City's
Chinatown began to change when, at 21, I sought a promising
journalism career in Hong Kong and had to stroll through that
city's streets, which eerily mirrored those of New York's Asian
district.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, I was thrown into a world where everyone looked
like me, and I held the false belief that I would fit in simply
because all of us shared similar features and names.
 &HT;    The sales ladies spoke to me in Cantonese, as did the bus
drivers and bank tellers, and they all froze in disbelief when I
answered them in English.
 &HT;    In contrast to my childhood thoughts, I now felt a strong desire
to belong. I wanted to soak in their dialect, eat their foods,
understand the humor in their jokes, watch their TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    In short, I wanted to binge on the culture and ``become
Chinese.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, I found myself caught between cultures and
confused about wanting to assimilate and disassimilate.
 &HT;    A Chinese-American friend who had lived in Hong Kong for four
years told me there are no in-betweens. I had to choose to either
be a local or a foreigner.
 &HT;    During my time in Hong Kong, I learned that gaining an identity
was not as simple as slipping a new outfit over an old one.
Relearning the language and eating the native foods wasn't enough.
Like any foreign culture, the Chinese people have a unique state of
mind and follow a different set of principles.
 &HT;    For example, as a woman born and raised in the United States, I
believe in being independent and in the importance of my career.
Going dutch on dates is the norm in America (at least in the
beginning). In Hong Kong _ and, frankly, in most of Asia _ that is
simply foolish. In Hong Kong, well-educated women dream of
secretarial positions at big companies, where they will hopefully
marry the boss. During my stay, I neither shared their beliefs nor
understood the intricacies of their jokes.
 &HT;    Over time, I found comfort in accepting the fact that complete
assimilation is a myth, and it was something I no longer desired. I
also learned that distancing oneself from one's roots is tragic.
 &HT;    I recently returned to New York City's Chinatown and walked the
same streets I despised as a teen. I saw those same people who once
repulsed me. This time around, however, I felt at ease. The street
peddlers and new immigrants were still working, but I no longer
felt the need to completely associate with, or disassociate from,
them. I realized I could maintain my sense of self _ be a proud
Chinese-American _ and still learn about my culture from them.
 &HT;    I decided I would speak the language and eat the food safely,
and that I would not look down or reject these people with whom I
shared similar roots _ but little else. I did not have to hate them
for who they are or hate myself for who I am.
 &HT;    It is OK to be confused about your identity, but you should
never amputate yourself from your roots.
 &HT;    If anything positive is to come from little Elian's fate, it may
be that first-generation and second-generation hyphenated-Americans
will re-examine who they are and how they see themselves living in
hyphenated-America.

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nearly 150 years after the Confederate battle flag last flew
above a rebel army, the meaning of that bit of cloth is still
controversial.
 &HT;    Is it an innocent, harmless symbol of a region's cultural
heritage, without political or racial implications?
 &HT;    Or is it the most sacred symbol of slavery, the
institutionalized essence of racism?
 &HT;    Suspend the debate. Go to the archives and read, and let the
Confederates themselves supply the answer.
 &HT;    First let's consult one of the Confederacy's most articulate
founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, who
served under Jefferson Davis as vice president of the Confederate
States of America.
 &HT;    Addressing his fellow Georgians in Savannah on March 21, 1861 _
less than a month before Confederates gathered in South Carolina at
Charleston Bay and fired on Fort Sumter _ Stephens began by
disclosing that the Union's founding fathers were privately
convinced that slavery was ``wrong in principal, socially, morally
and politically,'' and that ``the institution would be evanescent
and pass away.''
 &HT;    Speaking on behalf of the Confederacy, Stephens begged to
differ.
 &HT;    ``Our government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea,'' he
declared. ``Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. That
slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and
normal condition.''
 &HT;    Describing the embryonic Confederate States of America, Stephens
made clear that racism was part and parcel of its conception.
 &HT;    ``This, our new government, is the first in the history of the
world based upon this great physical and moral truth'' that the
``negro, by nature or by the curse of Canaan, is fitted for the
condition which he occupies in our system.''
 &HT;    He went on to explain that blacks were held in slavery in a
fulfilment of nothing less than the will of God.
 &HT;    ``The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted
by nature for it,'' Stephens said, ``and by experience we know that
it is best, not only for the superior but for the inferior race,
that it should be so. It is indeed in conformity with the ordinance
of the Creator.''
 &HT;    Stephens also criticized the United States Constitution, under
which we live today, holding that it was not racist enough to
guarantee the durability of slavery.
 &HT;    While the old Constitution embraced a fugitive-slave clause and
specified that blacks should count as three-fifths of a white man
for tax purposes, the leaders of the new Confederate government
felt that it did not spell out white superiority boldly and
directly enough.
 &HT;    The rebellion leaders were for real. Driven by a racist
philosophy not widely at odds with the anti-Semitism preached by
Hitler. rebel leaders wanted to make their racial views universal,
endowing themselves with a messianic racial mission.
 &HT;    ``The progress of disintegration in the old Union may be
expected to go on with almost absolute certainty,'' Stephens
announced. ``We are now the nucleus of a growing power, which, if
we are true to ourselves, our destiny and high mission, will become
the controlling power on this continent.''
 &HT;    But the Confederates did not limit their racial goals to this
continent alone. Like Hitler's dream of Aryan superiority, theirs
was a ``tomorrow the world'' ideology.
 &HT;    ``It is upon this (that) our actual fabric is firmly planted,''
Stephens proclaimed, ``and I cannot permit myself to doubt the
ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout
the civilized and enlightened world.''
 &HT;    Yes, the man said ``enlightened world.''
 &HT;    But please don't write off Stephens as an oddball. His racial
views were typically Confederate.
 &HT;    When Texas leaders, meeting at a Secession Convention on
February 1, 1861, voted to became the seventh state to join the
rebellion, for example, they accused the North of ``hostility to
these Southern states and their beneficent and patriarchal system
of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality
of all men, irrespective of race or color.''
 &HT;    To Texas secessionists, racial equality was ``a doctrine at war
with nature,'' and they insisted that ``the servitude of the
African race ... is abundantly authorized and justified by the
experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty
Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations.''
 &HT;    The banner under which that ideology marched off to war, fired
its guns, drew swords and filled hundreds of thousands of graves
was the Confederate battle flag. It is that flag which today
insults all blacks citizens in South Carolina and Georgia,
declaring the survival of a doctrine still at war with human
decency.
 &HT;    When will enough Americans summon the guts to state, with firm
resolution, the simple truth that the Confederates themselves had
no difficulty enunciating: The Confederate battle flag is no simple
emblem of an ``honorable regional cultural heritage,'' but the
embodiment of a sentiment and mission only marginally better than
that expressed, not so long ago, by the swastika.
 &HT;    That flag has no place waving above or on the grounds of any
city, county, state or federal building in the United States.

DEAL REPORTED FOR HALT TO ZIMBABWE VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ President Thabo Mbeki, handling his first
regional crisis, has brokered a deal with President Robert Mugabe
of Zimbabwe to end the violent invasions of white-owned farms and
bail out that country's hobbling economy, a senior South African
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, according to the official, Britain and the
United States have agreed to fund a structured land-reform program;
the International Monetary Fund would restore frozen relations with
Mugabe and prop up Zimbabwe's cash-strapped state-owned electricity
and fuel companies; and South Africa will seek to restore foreign
investors' confidence in its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   In return, according to regional officials, Mugabe agreed to end
the two-month campaign against commercial farmers and take steps to
hold free and fair parliamentary elections due within four months.
Meeting with regional counterparts on Friday at Victoria Falls, in
Zimbabwe's northwestern corner, Mugabe indicated that police would
begin removing his supporters, many veterans of the liberation
wars, from the farms this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is the beginning of an African engagement, of the
search for an African solution to an African problem within the
rule of law,'' Peter Hain, Britain's Foreign Office minister, told
BBC radio Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   US and British confirmation of their participation in Mbeki's
deal could not be obtained. But a Zimbabwean delegation was
expected to fly to London this week to seal the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Already caught in its worst economic crisis in at least a
decade, with critical shortages of fuel and foreign exchange,
Zimbabwe has been brought to the brink of anarchy in the past two
months as angry veterans, encouraged by Mugabe, seized commercial
farms owned by whites. Land is the country's most emotional issue.
</P>
<P>
   White-owned farms were the primary battlegrounds of the
liberation war against white-minority-ruled Rhodesia in the 1970s.
Since independence in 1980, however, most of the best agricultural
land has remained in white hands.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to end the invasions marked a significant diplomatic
milestone for Mbeki, who faced in Zimbabwe his first urgent
regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is South Africa's leading trading partner, and the
violence, which has claimed the lives of two white farmers and at
least four blacks, has made South African investors jittery. With
inflation and unemployment at 50 percent, and the critical tobacco
crop in jeopardy, financial analysts worried that Zimbabwe's crisis
is weakening South Africa's rand. The currency reached a two-year
low against the US dollar on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized by opponents at home, Mbeki remained curiously silent
on Zimbabwe until late last week, opting to pursue a ``softly,
softly'' diplomatic approach. In the two weeks prior to the
Victoria Falls summit, Mbeki personally called President Clinton,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, EU leader Romano Prodi, and IMF
officials to broker the plan, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president would not have done all this if he didn't
realize the impact of Zimbabwe's situation on South Africa,'' said
Parks Mankahlana, Mbeki's spokesman. ``You can't begin to imagine
what would happen to the region if Zimbabwe fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at Victoria Falls, the regional leaders _ Mbeki,
President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, and Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano _ warned Mugabe privately that the farm invasions, which
were twice ruled illegal by Zimbabwe's High Court, could
destabilize the region. But publicly they called Mugabe a
``champion of the rule of law'' as they emerged from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The accolades, however, weren't all show. Behind the deal, one
South African official said, lie fierce loyalties forged among the
region's liberation movements during decades of struggle against
repressive white regimes. The ruling parties in Namibia, Zimbabwe,
South Africa, and Mozambique are all former freedom organizations.
None of them want Mugabe to fall, even though polls indicate that a
majority of Zimbabweans want change.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping popular economic frustrations, a new opposition group,
the Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, has grown at remarkable
speed throughout Zimbabwe. In one measure of its strength, it
orchestrated the vote against the draft constitution in February.
The MDC's manifesto includes a wide range of economic and political
reforms, including land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   But its leader, former trade union chief Morgan Tsvangirai, has
angered Mbeki's South Africa, the official said. In his mid-40s and
without liberation credentials, Tsvangirai has obtained funding and
support from white South African businessmen and opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how bad things get in Zimbabwe, Thabo Mbeki is able
to look at Mugabe and have a starting point: Comrade Bob,'' the
official said. ``Under Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe would be run by foreign
commercial interests. To be honest, we don't take him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming elections for parliament do not directly affect
Mugabe, whose current term ends in 2002. But Tsvangirai said that
if his party obtains enough legislative seats, it will be able
under the constitution to start impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question, however, was whether the invasions would
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the liberation war started invading white-owned
farms in late February, shortly after voters rejected Mugabe's
draft constitution in a nationwide referendum. Earlier this month,
the president pushed a constitutional amendment through parliament
enabling the government to seize land without compensation. The
bill used the same language contained in the rejected constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the veterans have clamored for land for 20 years, the
invasions have been more about politics than a yearning to grow
soybeans, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked by defeat at the ballot box and facing his first serious
challenger in 20 years, Mugabe paid the war veterans $500,000 to
wage attacks against the white farming community. Most of the
estimated 10,000 squatters occupying some 600 farms are unemployed
women and youths. Victims of violence on the farms, including
laborers and owners alike, claim their assailants beat them into
pledging allegiance to Mugabe's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   War veterans and government supporters invaded at least two more
farms over the weekend, and veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi
reiterated that his followers would neither vacate nor allow
elections until a land-reform program was in place. In addition to
the farms already seized, he said, the veterans demanded another
841 farms.
</P>
<P>
   When he came into power, Mugabe promised to put 162,000 black
families on new land within a decade. The government has purchased
about 8.65 million acres of land from whites, but 20 years later,
it has resettled only 70,000 families. Much of the land remains
idle. In the meantime, about 1.2 million acres have gone to
Mugabe's government and business cronies.

A CAT'S PAWS PUT WRITING ON PAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An item in last Thursday's New York Times reported that a
computer company is marketing a software utility ``that offers to
keep unintentional cat computing to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   But does a cat ever do anything unintentionally?
</P>
<P>
   The $20 software, by BitBoost Systems, is called PawSense.
According to the item, if the device detects ``catlike typing'' it
will block input from the keys to prevent unwanted commands or
deletions to your computer and files. It can also be programmed to
emit a loud noise to scare the cat away.
</P>
<P>
   PawSense is able to distinguish cat typing from bad human typing
by analyzing recognizable key combinations pressed by cat paws,
patterns determined with the help of several tester cats.
</P>
<P>
   This piece of new technology is fine as far as it goes, but what
cat people really need is some innovation that would discourage
cats from placing themselves on us or between us and our computers,
typewriters, notebooks, pads of paper, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally someone asks, ``Do you work at home?'' and I
answer, ``No. I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't work at home because no matter where I try to write, or
what I try to write on, my cat Killer manages to get between me and
the work. He seems to be getting more persistent as he ages. I used
to try to shoo him away, or pick him up and put him elsewhere. It
was useless. Now I look at him, so frail and yet still so feisty,
and I haven't got the heart to try to move him. He'll just come
right back, and I know the effort must take a lot out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Killer gets between me and whatever I'm reading, too. He reminds
me of a ``Mother Goose and Grimm'' comic strip that had Ms. Goose
trying to read a newspaper over the head of her dog, Grimm. Pet
owners, the caption said, have to learn to read between the ears.
</P>
<P>
   I tell myself that cats don't understand reading and writing,
but perhaps they do, in a way. Killer sees me focused on reading
instead of on him and does me the favor of placing himself between
me and the paper. He knows instinctively that he's more worthy of
my attention. What's the news of the world, what's anything for
that matter, compared with the purr of a happy cat?
</P>
<P>
   I remember reading that Virginia Woolf kept a Manx cat. Perhaps
that's why she was unable to finish a novel until she was nearly 30
years old. I imagine the cat sprawling before her on the paper,
batting at her pen, preventing her from writing.
</P>
<P>
   The cat problem has probably vexed many well-known writers.
Would Jane Austen have written more novels if the Austen family
hadn't kept cats?
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether James Joyce lived with a cat, but parts
of his work shows signs of possible feline interference. Some
particularly difficult passages of ``Finnegans Wake'' could be the
result of Joyce attempting to write over, or maybe even through, a
cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cat just leads to another,'' said Ernest Hemingway,
perhaps literature's most passionate cat lover. He surrounded
himself with cats. Maybe that's why he wrote such short sentences.
The famous Hemingway style may well have been the result of his
efforts to cope with his cats.
</P>
<P>
   How many profound thoughts have gone unrecorded, how much great
literature has never seen the light of day, how much pleasure have
readers been denied because one writer or another couldn't get past
a cat? On the other hand, the world may have been spared a lot of
junk and nonsense through the efforts of persistent cats. I'll keep
that in mind the next time Killer comes between me and whatever I'm
trying to write.

BUILDING BOOM: REAL ESTATE SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real estate Web sites give a new meaning to the phrase ``home
page.''
</P>
<P>
   You can search the Internet for a home anywhere _ from Maine to
California _ by price range or number of bedrooms or style. You can
view pictures, or even take a virtual tour. And you can find out
what comparable homes in your neighborhood have sold for, or what
your boss paid for his new abode.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest Web sites, Domania.com, lets you find
comparable sales, estimate the value of the house you already own,
and calculate approximate property taxes on the home you're
interested in purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as HomePriceCheck.com, Boston-based Domania.com
went online this month with financial backing from CMGI Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to consider ourselves a complement to the realtor. All
parties benefit when you have an educated consumer,'' said Owen
Eagan, communications manager for Domania.com.
</P>
<P>
   And for people who already own a home, he said, the Web site
``allows consumers to manage their most prized and valuable asset.
They can keep track of their home's value over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, such as VirtualRelocation.com and
realestate.Yahoo.com, let you check out schools and compare cities,
based on economic and quality-of-life factors.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialize in houses being sold by owners, while one site
bills itself as the leading online real estate brokerage. All
promise to save you on commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Web addresses reviewed offer links to mortgage
companies, or calculators to figure out how much house you can
afford and whether it makes sense to pay points for a loan with a
slightly lower interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many real estate sites that a Massachusetts firm
that rates Web sites limits its latest reviews to 22 sites that
offer at least 10,000 home listings nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors (www.Gomez.com) scores the online home-buying
sites on such factors as ease of use and on-site resources. It also
allows users to compare sites, based on whether they are old hands
at buying homes or new to the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   But when making any kind of a purchase over the Internet _
especially one as major as a house _ a buyer must beware.
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate sites offer a link to only one or two
affiliated mortgage companies, which may not necessarily offer the
best interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the sites' claims _ that they offer hundreds of
thousands or, in one case, more than a million listings _ may be
inflated, according to a study last year by Clareity Consulting, a
real estate consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a review of some real estate sites on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   --www.Domania.com _ With what it calls the ``largest free online
bank of home sales comparables,'' this site promises to ``provide
all the tools and information you need to save time and money in
the real estate game.''
</P>
<P>
   You can check sales prices from as recently as two months ago
and estimate the current value of a home you own or project its
future value, based on sales data in your ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of INPHO, a company that provided real estate
information over the phone, Domania.com remains an information
service, Eagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're designed by homeowners for homeowners,'' he said.
``We're not a transaction-related site,'' like those put up by real
estate brokers or mortgage lenders. You'll find no listings of
homes for sale _ just data to make your real estate decision an
informed one.
</P>
<P>
   Domania.com also provides data to Yahoo, America Online,
zipRealty.com, and other Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   --realestate.Yahoo.com _ You can search its ads nationwide for a
home based on location, price, type of residence (single-family or
condo, for example), and number of bedrooms and baths.
</P>
<P>
   You can compare cities, based on cost of living, median family
income, average home purchase price, and crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a fun tool: You can compare salaries and the cost of

`QUALITY TV' REQUIRES A QUANTITY OF TISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about these ``quality TV'' dramas that makes root
canals seem like a better way of spending time? Why was I not
addicted, like people I respect, when there were new episodes of
shows as disparate, but highly regarded, as ``The X-Files,''
``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``Once and Again,'' and the two ``Law &AMP;
Order'' programs?
</P>
<P>
   The fog finally lifted when the latest of these quality shows,
``Wonderland'' hit the airwaves for two segments before being
canned. This was the program that incurred the wrath of mental
health professionals for its stark depiction of the population they
treat. As you might expect, the subject matter ranged from
schizophrenia to depression and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that true of all these shows? Doesn't everyone on the
above-mentioned programs look as if he or she is one teardrop away
from taking the big plunge? Even sex, of which there's plen-
</P>
<P>
   ty, is marked by a maximum amount of anxiety or even desperation
and a minimum amount of joy. The world that's presented on these
shows is, with rare moments of light, an utterly mirthless one,
which is represented not only by the script writing, but an often
laughably morose style of acting; soft-focus cinematography (``Once
and Again''); and shaky _ i.e., gritty _ and frenetic hand-held
camerawork (``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue'').
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not that these shows explore the dark side of life.
That has been one of the roles of art since there have been artists
_ and these shows aspire to art as much as entertainment. The
problem is that they have become so predictably mannered and
superficial in that exploration. Characters often have good reasons
to be down in the dumps but on these shows everybody looks as if
his wife has been gunned down by a psychopath or his sister has
been abducted by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago I taped episodes of ``Once and Again'' and
``NYPD Blue'' for vidoegraphic evidence of must-weep TV. You could
freeze-frame either show at random and see Sela Ward, her daughter,
and ex-husband in tears or on the verge. When you add in the
black-and-white psychotherapy sessions and W. G. Snuffy Walden's
new-age musical noodlings, you have enough ennui for an Antonioni
festival. On ``NYPD Blue,'' Rick Schroder constantly had his head
in his hands; Dennis Franz looked as if the Metamucil hadn't kicked
in for weeks; and the various female officers _ don't ask about
their biological clocks.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Sopranos'' is marked by the normalness of the mobsters'
abnormal lives, these shows are marked by the extraordinariness of
these ordinary lives. Thus nurses, prosecuting attorneys, and wives
of policemen are dashed off to the next world if the actors'
contracts aren't renewed; even when police officers die, such as
Jimmy Smits's Bobby Simone, it's as likely to be from disease as
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The proof of a television show's worth is usually in the
writing, and the writing in some television programs is often as
good as just about anything you'll find in the movies or the
theater _ ``The Sopranos,'' ``The West Wing'' and ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' are probably the top three.
</P>
<P>
   What each of them has that the others don't, for starters, is a
decent sense of humor. From Shakespeare to Beckett and beyond,
dramatists have recognized the importance of comedy to carry a
tragedy. What would ``King Lear'' be without his fool? When
``Waiting for Godot'' isn't funny, it isn't very good. Only the
Scandinavians like Ibsen and Bergman seem able to do without comic
relief of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   As Schroder's character said to a fellow cop _ whose harassment
of a drunk was about to lead to a fatal beating _ ``You know, we
lose our senses of humor, what and where are we? We're dead on our
feet. We're dead as doornails.'' That's a pretty good one-paragraph
description of all these shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall Herskovitz-Ed Zwick school _ ``thirtysomething''
along with ``Once and Again'' _ is more humor-impaired than Al
Gore. The Steven Bochco school, which includes his ``NYPD Blue''
collaborator David Milch, does have a sense of humor, though its
darkness and faux working-class crassness grows increasingly
tiresome. After Schroder broke down in officer Kim Delaney's arms,
he apologized: ``I got your hair full of snot.''
</P>
<P>
   Glib one-liners are the stock in trade on ``Law &AMP; Order'' as
well as ``NYPD Blue,'' and what an equally glum cast of characters,
from Jerry Orbach and his terminally hangdog expression to Sam
Waterston, whose picture is in the dictionary next to
self-righteousness, to Steven Hill, who looks as if he's never
gotten over losing the ``Mission Impossible'' lead to Peter Graves.
And these guys are party animals next to Mariska Hargitay, who
looks as if someone is constantly holding smelling salts under her
nose, and her self-satirical crew on ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims
Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   At least with ``The X-Files,'' the tongue is often in the cheek
of the writers as they give David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson one
more reason to think that there's something to all these conspiracy
theories, as when the Cigarette Smoking Man fixed it so that the
Buffalo Bills would never win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And ``ER''? Anthony Edwards _ what an actor _ has a range of
exhausted expressions that go from self-disgust to world-weary pity
as he attends to the grim politics at his hospital or his father's
bed-wetting at his apartment. The ``ER'' writers' idea of comic
relief is having Noah Wyle tell a scam artist trying to collect on
disability that he really is sick, with a case of leukemia that's
probably fatal. It was a mistaken diagnosis. Har-de-har-har. It
turns out a much nicer guy was going to die. Natch.
</P>
<P>
   All these shows have a pretense of profundity. Thus when we see
Schroder break down in tears we're supposed to think what a
multidimensional character he's playing. Or Waterston's decision to
prosecute a man who killed his wife despite the fact he has
Alzheimer's is supposed to show how law must prevail if we're going
to have order. What they're really doing, though, is substituting
one form of one-dimensionality for another. Compare the power of
Tom Cruise breaking down in ``Magnolia'' with Schroder and the
``Once and Again'' weepers to see how smart, developed writing can
be far more powerful than wearing one's sensitivity on one's
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unfair to compare programs in a medium that is by
and large a medium meant to entertain people and sell hamburgers to
independent films or nonprofit theater, but the best of dramatic
television, at least since ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``St.
Elsewhere'' and probably before, can stack up against less
commercial artistic fare. What seems to be at work here, after all,
isn't that these shows are after ratings but that they are taking
themselves too seriously. Either because the writers are suffering
from an inferiority complex or because they truly are inferior,
they think that piling gloom upon doom adds up to something more
significant than television that is purely entertainment. When
television _ or any writing _ tries too hard to be art, the result
is often pretentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there is wonderful dramatic programming on television.
You don't even have to go outside the genre for examples. David E.
Kelley is the one writer who knows how to balance a script between
lows and highs, comedy and tragedy, all the while creating
multidimensional characters. That has been true of his writing
since taking the place of Bochco, his mentor, as head of ``L.A.
Law,'' to ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.'' There's a sense
lately that he, too, has gone over the edge, but you couldn't prove
it by the first episode of the retooled ``Chicago Hope.'' James
Garner stepped in as the head of the HMO that bought the hospital
with the kind of performance that's rarely allowed on these more
smug shows _ part ``Maverick'' antihero and part capitalist
uberpig. Taking a page from George Bernard Shaw and ``Major
Barbara,'' Kelley gave the villain the best lines of the show,
which brought the whole script up to ``The West Wing'' territory.
When an experimental operation that he authorized (for perhaps the
wrong reasons) goes awry, there's even more at stake than the lives
of the characters and the careers of the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' doctors have their share of bureaucrats to deal with as
well, but it's usually easy to tell the good characters from the
bad, the good ones having graduated from Waterston's acting classes
in moral indignation and the bad ones wearing the ``I am a
scumbag'' signs around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Bad politics as well as bad drama can result from thinking that
there's depth to such shallowness, from ``X-Files'' conspiracy
theories on the right (Waco) and the left (Fells Acres and other
day-care prosecutions) to a general feeling that all our
institutions are broken and all it would take is a straight-talking
Sipowicz (Jesse Ventura) to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not lose our sense of humor along with the characters
on these shows. With ``West Wing,'' ``Buffy,'' and ``Chicago
Hope,'' there's no reason to despair. And if all else fails,
remember: There is less than a year left until another season of
``The Sopranos.''

&HT;     PARK SERVICE TAMES NON-NATIVE DEER POPULATION AT POINT REYES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Contrary to a scandalous rumor, the National
Park Service has not authorized a secret program to kill off the
spectacular non-native fallow deer and axis deer so popular with
visitors at Point Reyes National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   What the Park Service is doing, explained park superintendent
Don Neubacher, is ``continuing a culling program'' to stabilize the
non-native deer populations stable at about 700 animals and keep
them from overrunning native blacktail deer.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that, park rangers have shot an average of 100 fallow
and axis deer per year over the past 26 years, he said, a total of
2,600 deer. The program was first authorized after considerable
debate in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eradication isn't the goal,'' Neubacher said. ``We want to
control their numbers so they don't continue to spread and they
don't outcompete native blacktail deer.'' He called the controlled
hunts a management device, ``one of the tools in the toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report circulating, men wearing camouflage with
rifles and high-power scopes have been systematically trying to
eliminate the non-native deer species at the national park. No way,
Neubacher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last shooting was last winter and we have no plan to do it
further this year,'' Neubacher said. ``All the shooting is
conducted by rangers in uniform in times and areas so it is
non-intrusive, very controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, rangers often pick winter mornings on
weekdays in areas receiving no hiking use.
</P>
<P>
   The fallow deer and axis deer fascinate many visitors who see
them at Point Reyes, most commonly spotted in the Limantour and
Muddy Hollow areas of the park. The fallow deer are larger than
blacktail, often with odd antler configurations, with about 20
percent of the fallow deer colored pure white.
</P>
<P>
   The axis deer are nearly as dramatic, colored with spots as if
giant fawns of blacktails. Both species were introduced in the
1930s by a Sonoma County dentist who was fascinated with exotics.
</P>
<P>
   Since the wildfire of October 1995, the high amount of sprouting
grasses, wildflowers, bushes and trees has provided an abundant
food supply on the west slopes of Inverness Ridge, especially with
so many wet years that have followed. Despite the culling program,
it is likely there are actually more deer than ever of all species,
not less.
</P>
<P>
   The management goal, Neubacher said, is for the Point Reyes herd
to support 350 fallow deer, 350 axis deer and 1,500 blacktail. In
addition, 27 tule elk were recently transplanted to the Limantour
area from the herd at Pierce Ranch near Tomales Point (that herd
numbers about 500 after starting with an original transplant of 10
from Grizzly Island near Fairfield).
</P>
<P>
   Because of apparent population expansions in the past five years
since the wildfire, Neubacher said a new management plan is likely
because of the land's higher carrying capacity from so much food
being available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a response to the fire, that the productivity of
the land is higher,'' Neubacher said. ``So what we're doing now is
bringing in more people and getting a new census done before there
is any more shooting, to update the management plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the public to comment by writing him at:
Superintendent, Point Reyes National Seashore, Point Reyes, CA
94956.
</P>
<P>
   This ongoing story is significant because within many park
departments and wildlife agencies is a cult-like sect that advances
the opinion that all non-native species should be wiped out,
regardless of their benefits, as if it were a cleansing of the
land. They almost never recognize that the biggest non-native
species of them all are people, and that they are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Many non-native species are widespread and add rich texture to
the California landscape, including pheasant, wild turkey, chukar,
Rocky Mountain elk, fallow deer, largemouth bass, striped bass,
brown trout and many others. It is true, on the other hand, that
the introduction of some non-native species can be extremely
harmful, especially plant species.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is the proliferation of ice plant, once planted
routinely by the military and the Department of Transportation. At
Fort Funston in San Francisco, ice plant has been removed and
replaced with native plants, inspiring the recent return of
burrowing owls and swallows for the first time in many years.

HONEYMOON BECOMES A JOKE TO MULTIMILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maybe Rick Rockwell could have cut his losses and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, like other celebrities born out of personal scandal, he
could have sold his story. Or made a weight-loss commercial. Or
gotten his own radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockwell, also known as the multimillionaire who got married
on TV in front of 23 million viewers, pledging devotion to a
stranger who dumped him 36 hours later in one of the most frenzied
tabloid stories of the year, is not just any
real-estate-mogul-turned-television-groom.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   And if his life is going to be a national joke, he wants to be
the one telling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty weird, aren't I?'' he said, strolling out on stage at
the DC Improv Comedy Club last Thursday night, dressed in a black
turtleneck and brown trousers.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd giggled. It seemed everyone in the full house had been
thinking that very thing.
</P>
<P>
   Nine weeks earlier, Rockwell was transformed into a favorite
subject on late-night comedy through a succession of humiliating
headlines (he had a restraining order from an old girlfriend! He
had a toilet in his backyard! He wasn't really a multimillionaire
at all!). He was the butt of serious criticism, too, as feminists
questioned what kind of man would go on national television to
essentially buy a wife.
</P>
<P>
   But on this particular night last week, people seemed ready to
take Rockwell's side. Or at least hear his self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell calls it the ``Annulment Tour.'' At times, ``Rockwell's
Revenge'' seems more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   One punch: ``Who the hell marries someone named Darva Conger?
It's not even a real name.''
</P>
<P>
   And another: ``Darva Conger? I married Lorena Bobbitt, for
Chrissakes. She just snipped me verbally.''
</P>
<P>
   And another: ``So what do you think? Is my wife going to pose in
one of those girly magazines? Of course she is. I don't have a
problem with that, either. Call me old-fashioned. I'd like to see
my wife naked.''
</P>
<P>
   And another: ``Fifty choices, I pick an ice cube,'' he said,
sipping a drink as he shook his head, thinking back on the other 49
bride candidates. He lifted his glass and gave a sarcastic toast:
``To my wife's health.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, he has been the quiet one. When his two-day bride,
Conger, hit the talk-show circuit after their tense honeymoon to
explain how horrified she was by what she'd done, public opinion
swung her way. She described Rockwell as presumptuous, trying to
hold her hand on their honeymoon. She conveyed her nausea at that
first, public kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell didn't say much then. He did little, in fact, but make
unwitting appearances on tabloid shows.
</P>
<P>
   Before the wedding, of course, Rockwell had wanted to be in the
public eye. He was a comedian, not exactly struggling, but not even
close to being a household name. Then he turned to real estate,
where he made the multimillions qualifying him for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rockwell denies he used Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire?'' to garner publicity for his comedy career.
</P>
<P>
   He even denies the ordeal buoyed his act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience response was always the same,'' he said, somewhat
defensively, when asked about it after the show.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little arguing with the fact that the Darva Conger
affair makes for some good standup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you plan on ever talking to Darva?'' one man shouted from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that's the irony. Most husbands, when they want to
tune their wives out, turn on the TV,'' Rockwell shot back.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed confident, his eyes bulging slightly the way they did
on that fateful television night. His hair was slightly grayer. He
appeared to have a better tan.
</P>
<P>
   He joked about picking up single ladies in the audience. About
his religion. About the e-mails he gets.
</P>
<P>
   He read aloud from a few. ``You're a good-looking, honest guy
who Larva should have been honored to marry,'' he read, chuckling.
``Darva the Larva,'' he repeated, chuckling some more.
</P>
<P>
   The audience cheered him on. One woman taunted him, and he
reminded her about his restraining order, to even louder roars. He
seemed so natural in the role of jilted husband, so confident, as
if he had planned it all along, several patrons thought.
</P>
<P>
   Some women even thought he was cute. Funnier in person.
Definitely worth 17 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But still a mystery, said Stephan Marmai, 31, an analyst at
Fidelity Investments in Boston who happened to be in town and ``had
to'' see the show. ``I just don't know why he did it,'' Marmai
said. Which is perhaps what made the whole affair so funny all
along.

HIP AND NEW? YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you old economy?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are, but don't want to admit it. That's why the
business world is so tense _ thousands of old-economy people trying
to pass as hot, hip and new, even as they experience vertigo
staring at the flying purple logo on the company Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, they can flash their Palm Pilots, carry their cell
phones into the bathroom, and know how to turn ``IPO'' into a verb,
as in ``That son of a gun Herb just IPO'd another one!'' But at
least once a day, wham _ in flies a thought straight out of 1955.
</P>
<P>
   And the thought might be this: (itals)I wish the boss wouldn't
stare at his computer screen and read his messages when he's
allegedly having a conversation with me.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic old-economy neurosis, stemming from a fear of
multitasking managers and rooted in the belief that people who are
attempting to communicate face to face should be looking at each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The antiquated thinking can be cured with therapy, but first a
person must recognize the problem. The following psychological quiz
is designed to help people focus on the warning signs of O.E.S.
(Old Economy Syndrome), and to move out of denial and into
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   1. Watching the current roller coaster markets, do you secretly
root for the blue chips? Alone in the car, listening to a business
report, have you ever slapped a fist on the dashboard and shouted,
``Come on toasters and soap!''
</P>
<P>
   2. When the Nasdaq tanks, do you ever high-five a graying
coworker and utter the phrase ``Dot-coms must die''?
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you think Fast Company is a humor magazine? Do you carry
one around to try to look cool while keeping a Reader's Digest
stuffed inside?
</P>
<P>
   4. Whenever you see the ad for the online freelance job bank
FreeAgent.com _ boasting that it is ``Saving the world from the
company picnic. One person at a time'' _ do you want to run a sack
race? Have you ever gone out to the parking lot and actually tried
to run one?
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you think your software is out to get you? Have you tried
to appease the technology gods by promising to add memory to the
hard drive if they let you finish the project without crashing?
</P>
<P>
   6. Are you haunted by the lyrics to an old Bob Dylan song
because in this revolution 40 years later you're identifying with
Mr. Jones?
</P>
<P>
   7. Have you ever worn a suit to lunch with dot-com
entrepreneurs? Did you ask them for a tour of the factory?
</P>
<P>
   8. Have you worked at the same company for more than five years,
and did you think becoming vested in the pension plan was a really
big deal?
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Alief Middle School, with a giant yellow pencil jammed
like a javelin into the front lawn, seems the very model of Texas
education being promoted by Governor George W. Bush. The school has
soaring student test scores, is undergoing a costly renovation, and
has an array of programs to help its mostly minority population.
</P>
<P>
   But peel back the layers at the school and throughout the
surrounding district, and a far more complex story emerges about
Texas education, and Bush's role in boosting it. Yes, test results
have improved markedly, but some researchers who have studied the
system said the test content has been diluted and that the rising
scores may mask an unhappy statewide trend: a surge in dropouts
among lower-performing students.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is true that millions of state dollars are flowing
into schools like Alief, much of the money comes from a
court-mandated program that Bush detests.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called ``Robin Hood,'' sends money from wealthier
districts, at a rate of a half-billion-dollars per year, to the
state's poorest schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is praised in Texas for his advocacy of education issues,
and for his determined push to hold students, faculty, and schools
more accountable. And the Bush campaign, believing that the
governor's education record may be a key to winning the presidency,
has boasted that the ``remarkable success'' of the Texas reforms
proves his leadership mettle.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer examination finds that while Bush gets and plainly
deserves credit for boosting education spending and for pressing
for reforms, some of the successes he cites were enacted under
prior governors. Or, where he was the prime mover, the measures are
so new that their impact cannot be fairly measured.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bush's much-discussed plan to end ``social
promotion'' of students and to enact tougher testing requirements
won't take full effect for three years, making the outcome of the
initiatives impossible to judge.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush lacks a track record in his home state on two of his
most significant national proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He tried and failed to win Texas passage of a voucher program,
raising questions about how he would persuade Congress to pass a
national version of his proposal to use public funds to help pay
for private school education.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush did win approval for quasipublic charter schools,
the Texas program is dogged by funding problems and has a mixed
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdict is still out on charter schools,'' Bush
acknowledged in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as he often does, pointed to rising scores on
state-administered tests as proof of his success, taking particular
pride in the shrinking performance gap between white and minority
students in this ethnically diverse state.
</P>
<P>
   But a soon-to-be-released report by the Center for Study of
Testing at Boston College said the rising test scores may be
misleading because so many students who might fail the test are
dropping out. The report said Texas has an overall dropout rate of
20 percent and that the rate runs as high as 50 percent for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials said the overall rate is 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this myth of the miracle of Texas education,'' said
the study's author, professor Walter Haney of Boston College.
``Texas has gotten a huge amount of press, but in my view, it is
largely a scam. The test scores have been going up because they
have been pushing huge numbers of kids out.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and his critics disagree about his accomplishments,
his greatest achievement may be that he has changed the Republican
Party debate on education, which, until recently, has been about
how to eliminate the US Department of Education and cut spending.
Bush's goal is different.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to rebuild the nation's education policy by using the
Texas model, an emphasis that invites scrutiny of what has really
happened in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand how Texas has overhauled its educational system,
the clock must be turned back to 1984. Standards were so lax then
that many high school diplomas were considered meaningless.
Football was king.
</P>
<P>
   When state education officials conducted accreditation reviews
of the schools, ``they wanted to make sure the flag was flying and
restrooms were clean,'' according to James Smith, the
superintendent of the Alief School District. The state had one of
the nation's worst education records.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Ross Perot. Long before the Dallas businessman ran for
president, he was a fierce critic of the Texas education system.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by the then-governor, Democrat Mark White, to
propose ways to clean up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's best-known reform, called ``no pass-no play,'' required
that students pass their courses in order to participate in
extracurricular activities. But the other reforms were equally
important.
</P>
<P>
   They included a maximum class size of 22 students for
kindergarten through fourth grade and a mandatory state test to
graduate high school.
</P>
<P>
   But Perot's push to require that poor and rich schools have
equal access to resources may have had the most lasting impact. At
the same time the Perot committee made that recommendation, a group
of schools dominated by lower-income Mexican-Americans sued Texas
in a bid for increased funding.
</P>
<P>
   After several governors struggled with the issue, the Texas
Supreme Court in 1994 approved the prosaically named ``Chapter
41,'' better known as Robin Hood. Bush took office the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   Before Robin Hood was passed, it was not unusual for rich
districts to spend $6,000 per student, compared to about $3,500 in
the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools in lower-income areas were falling apart and had
trouble attracting quality teachers. After Robin Hood became law,
the expenditure per student equalized at about $5,400, though some
wealthier districts raised taxes to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly overnight, the poor districts had an extra $2,000 per
student to spend, a dramatic increase by any measure. Suddenly,
tens of millions of dollars were pouring into the poorer districts,
enabling them to build new schools, hire better teachers, and begin
afternoon programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, asked why he never mentions Robin Hood as a key part of
the improved Texas education picture, played down the importance of
the program, saying it was ``a court-ordered system that I tried to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he tried _ and failed _ to replace Robin Hood's
reliance on property taxes with a program that relied on general
state revenues, which are used in the equivalent program in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Many education officials, including Bush supporters, said Robin
Hood has been crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in our finance system has certainly been a
factor,'' said the Texas commissioner of education, Jim Nelson,
while stressing that Bush's emphasis on accountability has been
important. ``The fact we have been able to put more resources'' in
the poorer ``districts clearly has allowed them to do things they
couldn't do otherwise.''

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 HOUSTON: ... do otherwise.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impact is readily seen on opposite sides of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the Deer Park District, where 72 percent of the students are
white, one of the world's greatest concentrations of oil refineries
rises from the flat landscape, providing a property tax bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of dollars in extra property taxes have enabled the
district to build a dazzling array of state-of-the-art schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fairmont Junior High School, nestled among the houses of a
planned suburban community, has facilities that rival many colleges
and country clubs, with high-tech labs, two sparkling gymnasiums,
and an indoor swimming pool. The average teacher's pay is $37,000.
Principal Billye Smith said she is visited daily by real estate
agents, who pepper her with questions about test scores that are
crucial to potential home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the district voice anger at sending 42 percent of
the school property taxes to poorer areas, a drain that has created
a $4 million deficit in the upcoming budget and is expected to lead
to a layoff of 50 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unpopular,'' said Deer Park assistant
superintendent John Piscacek. ``It has leveled us down to some
extent.''
</P>
<P>
   On the western side of Houston, the Alief School District is
home to the state's most ethnically diverse population, with 60
languages spoken, and immigrants from Vietnam, Nicaragua, and many
other countries housed in apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Alief Middle School has a minority population of 95 percent,
with many students coming from lower-income families. Many classes
are taught in temporary trailers hidden behind the school in
double-file rows.
</P>
<P>
   But Alief is undergoing a transformation, thanks to Robin Hood.
The money is helping pay for a $10 million reconstruction, computer
labs, many after-school programs, and specialists who focus on
helping improve student test scores. Most importantly, the money
has allowed Alief to raise starting teacher salaries to $33,000,
making it competitive with wealthier districts.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, local observers said, has contributed to the rising
test scores that make Bush beam.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the Alief superintendent, said the Robin Hood money,
combined with the emphasis on accountability, has been the key to
improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics of the system certainly were in place when
George Bush became governor, there is no doubt about that,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think there is any doubt about the fact that Bush
is a real leader in education. As superintendent, I had never been
called to the governor's office in my life until George Bush was
elected governor. It impressed me that the governor asked me to sit
down and talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's educational ideals were on vivid display earlier this
month throughout Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   It was test day, when students as young as third-graders take
the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, commonly called TAAS. For
months, students had prepared for the test with prep sessions and
hours of drills. At Fairmont Junior High in Deer Park, the students
learned test skills at the Breakfast Club, the Lunch Bunch, pep
rallies, sleepovers, hot dog dinners, and even bake sales. Now the
school was enveloped in an eerie silence during the all-day test.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous. Students who fail the test, scoring
under 70 percent, risk being forced to repeat their grade. If a
school has too many failing students, it can be taken over by the
state and, in theory, the principal and teachers could be fired.
</P>
<P>
   But the tests, which Bush wants to replicate across the country,
have sparked much controversy, just as the similar _ but tougher _
MCAS tests in Massachusetts recently led to protests about the
fairness of putting so much emphasis on a standardized exam.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Stotsky, a Harvard University researcher who analyzed the
Texas tests for the Tax Research Association of Houston, concluded
that the reading level of the tests administered from 1995 to 1998
had been lowered on a regular basis. That could explain, at least
in part, the rising test scores Bush cites so often, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to determine that the reading level was going down
fairly systematically at two of the three grade levels being
assessed,'' said Stotsky, who is now deputy commissioner of
education in Massachusetts. As a result, Stotsky said, Texas ``may
not necessarily be showing an improvement in reading ability and
may not necessarily be showing that the gap has decreased between
different ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret LaMontagne, Bush's senior state education adviser,
denied the reading level has gone down.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush often speaks about the Texas requirement that a
student must pass a test before graduating high school, the test is
widely considered to be too easy. The test, which is taken during
10th grade, is based on the minimum skills that a student is
expected to master by the eighth grade, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the minimum eighth-grade skills. It's ridiculous,'' said
Sandy Kress, a former head of the Dallas School Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kress, who praised Bush's education policies, noted that the
governor recently won passage of legislation that would require an
11th-grade test based on 10th-grade knowledge, but that won't take
full effect until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the rising TAAS scores prove his education plan is
working. But Haney, the Boston College professor who researched the
Texas tests, concludes that the higher scores have come partly
because Texas has greatly underestimated its dropout rate. Haney
said the Texas dropout rate is more than 20 percent, and may be as
high as 50 percent for minority students. Texas officials dispute
the figure, but acknowledge that at least 15 percent of
seventh-graders don't graduate and another 15 percent take
continuing education or graduation equivalency tests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the dropout rate is too high. ``We've got to do a
better job, and it starts with teaching people to read at young
ages, and that's exactly where our initiatives are aimed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about whether some school
administrators have cheated, either by altering test results or
arranging for the students who are considered likeliest to fail to
skip the tests.
</P>
<P>
   In the most celebrated case, the Austin School District, where
Bush's twin daughters attend high school, was indicted last year on
charges of manipulating test scores to increase school ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of pressure,'' said Carolyn Graf,
principal of Jollyville Elementary School in a neighboring district
in the Austin suburbs. ``The pressure comes maybe not so much
outward, but from each one of us. Our test scores are printed in
the Austin American Statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, the pressure on schools will increase in the
next several years, as more students are required to take tougher
tests.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts worry the preparation for the test puts so much
emphasis on math, writing, and reading skills that many other
important subjects are given short shrift, including humanities,
social studies, and science. A new Bush plan will eventually
broaden the content of the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now we have an educational system that is
watering down the quality,'' said Linda McNeil of the Center for
Education at Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's view, a variation of this system can be implemented
nationwide, with school test results published on the Internet. If
schools that receive federal funds fail to improve their standings
in a three-year period, Bush said, then students should be able to
get a $1,500-per-year subsidy that could be used to help pay for
private school in a voucher-like program.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no track record in Texas on whether such a program
will work. Bush wanted a generous voucher system, with students
allowed to take the full $5,400-per-pupil annual expenditure to a
private school, aides said. But the measure died in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the conservative emphasis of the primary campaign
behind him, Bush is hoping his education plans will be attractive
to moderate suburban parents who send their children to public
schools. So, he hardly makes mention of the word ``voucher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying for a voucher program,'' Bush said. ``It's an
accountability system.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush has no interest in focusing on the key role that
the Robin Hood program played in improving so many Texas schools.
Instead, he is betting on a combination of testing, accountability,
and early reading initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   While the plan yet may prove successful, some wonder how far
Bush can go without Robin Hood by his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ironic,'' said Craig Foster, executive director of the
Equity Center, which fought for the Robin Hood program. ``Bush
benefits from the higher test scores politically, but he owes it to
something he hates.''

<P>
   As the sun falls and an Easter vigil fire burns outside their
churches, they are escorted inside by candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   Standing by the baptismal font, they first renounce Satan, and
then embrace Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Donning a dark robe representing the power of darkness, they are
immersed in water; donning a white robe representing a life of
faith, they are anointed in perfumed olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Catholics at last, they receive for the first time the
wafer and wine that the church believes has become the body and
blood of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   This ritual, performed in churches around the world on the night
before Easter, is the final step in an ancient conversion rite that
is enjoying an astonishing revival after 1,500 years of dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   Data being collected by the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops indicate the Catholic Church in the United States this year
is experiencing a significant, if somewhat mysterious, surge in the
number of adults joining the church.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the number of adults being baptized as Catholics is
up by as much as 10 percent this year, and the number of Catholic
adults who were baptized as infants but who are just now receiving
First Communion and being confirmed is rising slightly faster.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the numbers are even more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 Greater Boston residents went to the Cathedral of
the Holy Cross a month ago to sign the Book of Election _ the
penultimate ritual in the Rite of Christian Initiation as Adults,
the yearlong preparation program to become a Catholic. That is up
from 600 people last year, and 150 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the number of Protestants converting to
Catholicism and in lapsed Catholics completing their religious
training is welcome news to an American church that is battling
declining numbers of men and women joining religious orders and
declining attendance at Mass. In Boston, Mass attendance has risen
slightly during the past two years, but archdiocesan officials
still estimate that only one-third of Catholics regularly attend
worship services.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic officials attribute the growth in conversions, as well
as the increasing return to the church of those who dropped out
after being baptized, to a variety of changes in how the church
interacts with non-Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But those joining the church generally cite different reasons,
such as an interfaith marriage, the birth of children, a
life-changing tragedy, or a spiritual quest.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Cardinal Bernard F. Law says he is delighted by the
phenomenon, which he, as well as other church officials, also
attributes to renewed church energy associated with this Jubilee
Year, in which Christianity is celebrating its 2,000th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Other Catholic clergy and scholars say the surge of new
Catholics is the result of a little-noticed overhaul in how adults
are trained to become Catholics. The traditional process, in which
an individual is trained by a priest, has been replaced by group
sessions that are less insistent on the rote memorization of dogma,
focusing more on group discussions, participatory ritual, and
building community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's misconception is that they give you a bunch of
books and you memorize these prayers, but it's not like that at
all,'' said Jason R. Swartz, 26, of Winthrop, the child of a
Catholic mother and a Jewish father who will be baptized as a
Catholic. ``There's an understanding that this is a journey, that
everybody's at a different place on the journey at different times,
and you'll pick it up along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan M. Rummel, who leads the Rite of Christian Initiation for
Adults program at St. Richard in Danvers, puts it bluntly: ``We
don't teach them rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually a child comes into a faith community because it's the
tradition of their family,'' Rummel said. ``The adults have come
consciously searching for something, and ultimately what that turns
out to be is a relationship with God. So it's a process of
self-discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the increase, according to some Catholic
officials, is a more inviting church posture toward people with
messy marital histories and people who were baptized as
Protestants. These attitudinal changes are a byproduct of a renewed
effort at US evangelization by the church, which has long been
better known for its international missionary work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be part of something that's vibrant and
alive,'' said the Rev. John E. Hurley, director of evangelization
for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. ``The parishes
that have a tremendous increase in numbers usually are very
evangelizing and reconciling communities of faith that are very
contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon can be seen at parishes around Boston, which are
enjoying record numbers of new communicants _ people who never
before were baptized as Christians, who were baptized as
Protestants but have decided to become Catholics, or who were
baptized as Catholics but were never confirmed or received First
Communion, steps required to regularly receive Communion in a
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communion is the main thing that makes people come to the
Catholic Church,'' said Michelle Akinyele, 20, of Lawrence, one of
several people interviewed who said they felt left out at church
because they could not receive Communion. ``Having the body of
Christ is the best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most new Catholics have some Christian heritage and are not
coming from non-Christian faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to church, but I didn't feel like I was part of it _ I
didn't know why they did certain things, like blessing themselves
when they went in, and I wanted to learn more,'' said Faith S.
Hocter, 40, of Middleton, who grew up in a Congregationalist church
but began attending a Catholic church after marrying a Catholic and
raising their son Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, understanding it more . . . I feel comfortable, as though
this is where I should have been,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The churches that have the highest numbers of new Catholics seem
to share two characteristics, according to interviews with
participants and church officials. The successful programs are
generally run by charismatic priests, nuns, or laypeople who help
guide participants through the year, and the programs are willing
to work with participants who are divorced, who are single parents,
who do not speak English, or who begin the process despite
misgivings about some aspects of church policy.
</P>
<P>
   In language that might surprise some, people becoming Catholics
as adults use such words as ``relaxed'' and ``open'' to describe
the church.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like most about the Catholic Church is that it is very
open-minded,'' said Niurka Ruiz, 21, of Lawrence. ``I remember
going to some other churches that were not Catholic and they tried
to inculcate, to force you to join, and I didn't like it. And the
Catholic Church is definitely not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are drawn to the church by dramatic personal
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Welch, 40, of Lawrence, came to the church while trying to
cope with the death of his 18-year-old son in a car accident last
fall. Although Welch was raised Presbyterian, his son was Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my son died, I went to all these meetings of parents who
lost children. I went to a psychiatrist, but the only thing that
helped me was church,'' he said. ``The more I pray, the closer it
makes me feel to my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is arguably part of a broader national pattern of
faith-seeking by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a movement of people who are in midlife, searching
for meaning, and returning to church,'' said Robin M. Jensen,
associate professor of the history of Christianity at Andover
Newton Theological School in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the new Catholics use the language of seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was missing in my life,'' said Kathleen Haley, 23,
of Lawrence, who was baptized as a Catholic but never went to
church as a child. She is now going through the Rite of Christian
Initiation in order to be confirmed and receive First Communion.
``I wouldn't be happy if I didn't come to church. It makes me
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   From the year 215 through the 5th century, people interested in
becoming Christians had to undergo three years of rigorous
preparation before baptism, and in 1972 the Vatican required that
the modern rite of adult baptism be revised to resemble the ancient
process. The new rite, adopted in the United States in 1988, is
only now catching on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I thought it would be a paper drill _ I would fill
out some papers, go to some classes, and boom, you're a Catholic,''
said Kevin R. Babcock, 39, of Beverly. ``Thankfully, it wound up
being a lot more than that. I can't say I'm going out and preaching
on street corners or anything, but it made me examine my life and
how I'd been living, and church is now an important part of my
life.''

FRAUD CHARGED IN CANCER CURE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WOBURN, Mass. _ The nondescript warehouse is a sports supply
store now, but it was in the front lines in the mid-1990s for a
bizarre chapter in the war against cancer, a place where federal
investigators say life-saving research mingled freely with consumer
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the fledgling Private Biologicals Corp. shipped a
promising new cancer drug called LK-200 to doctors and patients in
Mexico, the Bahamas, and the United States. Independent researchers
were excited about LK-200's prospects because in some cases it
shrank tumors by boosting the body's own defenses without causing
severe toxic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But the career of LK-200 ended abruptly in 1995 when federal
agents raided the plant in a small industrial park and shut it
down. Private Biologicals ran an elaborate scam to rip off
investors, they contended, through a company run by a phony doctor
and employing an offshore address to evade federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five years later, US Attorney Donald K. Stern has filed
criminal charges against two men in connection with Private
Biologicals. Thomas R. Theodore of Sandwich allegedly defrauded
investors of $2 million and misled doctors and patients by
illegally distributing a drug that was not approved for human use
in the United States and was made in an unsanitary, unlicensed
facility.
</P>
<P>
   A second man, Thomas M. Rodgers Jr. of Atlanta, faces
misdemeanor charges in connection with the drug manufacturing and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the two defendants face fines or imprisonment for
their roles in promoting LK-200, the flashes of anticancer potency
the drug once showed continue to nag scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I am convinced there is something in there,''
says Dr. Charles Dinarello, a former New England Medical Center
researcher who studied LK-200, which he got from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Theodore allegedly misled investors by
saying that LK-200 was produced by a ``highly secret and
proprietary'' process. In fact, the substance, which is derived
from the fluid surrounding human white blood cells grown in the
laboratory, was easy to produce, said the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Dinarello and Dr. James Mier, a cancer researcher at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center who previously studied CT scans of
patients from Mexico treated with LK-200, say they thought Private
Biologicals was trying to develop the drug legally. Unknown to
them, Mier said, the company was sending the drug to the Bahamas _
where it could be legally used _ and then back to the United States
_ where the drug's use was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they wanted to do,'' Mier said recently, ``was
set up a small bunch of clinics in Mexico and the Bahamas and
compete for the alternative medicine market. And they would have
succeeded'' had they not flouted the Food and Drug Administration's
rigorous drug development regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The misbegotten plan is a striking example of how the demand for
cancer drugs by desperate patients can lure unscrupulous
entrepreneurs into taking shortcuts, avoiding the long and costly
drug approval process. Though the FDA's reviews have many critics,
the risk of skirting them is that sick people will put their hopes
in useless or dangerous cures.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear whether the partners at one time planned a
legitimate business. But either way, LK-200 seemed doomed to fail,
according to Ralph Moss, a New York consultant on alternative
medicines. They were treating too many patients not to draw
regulators' attention, yet they were too small to do the research
necessary for FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were skating on thin ice,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of LK-200, say people knowledgeable about the field,
date to work done in the 1970s and 1980s by Ben Papermaster, an
immunologist at the University of Missouri. In animal and human
experiments, Papermaster reported that the fluid from human white
blood cells grown in his laboratory caused an inflammation-like
response when given to patients, and in a few cases shrank tumors.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently under Papermaster's direction that human
experiments were conducted in Mexico, with some success. When the
FDA crackdown came in 1995, colon cancer patient Sara Stone-Alston
of Seattle wrote to Moss defending LK-200. ``It had no side effects
and kept my tumor under control and even seemed to shrink it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   How Private Biologicals, Rodgers, and Theodore became involved
in producing LK-200 is hazy. There appears to have been
disagreement between Private Biologicals and Papermaster, who left
after a short stint as a consultant. He died in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, Rodgers, an Atlanta businessman, was chairman of the
board and majority stockholder. Meanwhile, Theodore, who had been
convicted of mail fraud in 1987 and stripped of his license by the
Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine, was in charge of
the Woburn plant, according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers's attorney, Nick Littlefield, downplayed the charges
against his client, stressing that Rodgers is cooperating with the
government in the case. Unlike Theodore, Rodgers was not charged
with fraud or misleading investors, Littlefield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is charged with . . . technical regulatory misdemeanor
offenses that don't even require specific intent or knowledge,''
said Littlefield, of the law firm Foley, Hoag and Eliot. ``We look
forward to getting the matter resolved promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators portray Theodore as the scientific front
man, falsely presenting himself as a doctor, and illegally using
the mails and Federal Express to ship LK-200 and tout its benefits.
The board said that Theodore did not possess a degree from an
approved medical school, and didn't even have an undergraduate
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore's attorney, John Noonan, said that his client was just
a consultant to Private Biologicals and wasn't on the premises of
the Woburn plant during the times of his alleged criminal
activities. He said that the plant was set up ``by the best minds
in the business,'' including several physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan also said that Theodore has a degree from a medical
school in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding problems for defendants Theodore and Rodgers, a
report on the Internet wrongly linked LK-200 to Dr. Stanislaw
Burzynski, a controversial physician in Texas who has long battled
the federal government over cancer drugs he has developed called
``antineoplastons.'' The Globe reported this erroneous connection
in an earlier article.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, before the 1995 raid, LK-200 had a reputation that was good
enough to attract the attention of serious researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The two physicians at New England Medical Center, Dinarello and
Mier, became interested in the substance in the 1990s after hearing
about the dramatic results in some patients in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Dinarello, an infectious disease specialist who left NEMC in
1995, said he was intrigued by LK-200 because of what it was, a
mixture of immune system chemicals known individually as having
important roles in inflammation, infection, and cancer. In
addition, he said, he saw some photographs of patients treated for
skin cancers with LK-200.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I sat in a room with you and showed you pictures of these
patients'' before and after treatment, ``you'd be impressed,'' he
said. Dinarello, comparing LK-200 to supposedly anticancer
substances found in natural plants, said, ``This drug had a
portfolio far more interesting than some bug juice from the
Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a small delegation from the federal Office of
Alternative Medicine visited a clinic in Monterrey, Mexico, where
results of LK-200 in some patients were presented.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adrienne Fugh-Berman, a physician formerly with the federal
office, recalled that the drug ``looked really promising'' and she
wrote a report to that effect. Shortly afterward, she left the
office, which has been reconstituted as the National Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Mier and Dinarello said that shortly before the Woburn plant was
closed down, the company had brought in consultants, one of them
reportedly a former FDA employee, to tell them what kind of
research data they would need to apply for an Investigational New
Drug permit from the FDA. The permit allows a new drug to be tested
in patients for safety, and then for effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mier, Theodore was dismissed from the company after
some of his alleged misrepresentations were discovered. Of Rodgers,
Mier said, ``I think he was duped. I don't think he was
malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Private Biologicals cast a cloud over research
into LK-200, but, remarkably, a Vienna, Va., company has picked up
on a similar concept.
</P>
<P>
   Cel-Sci Corp. is testing a product called MultiKine, which, like
LK-200, is described as a mixture of lymphokines and cytokines that
stimulate immune responses. Eyal Talor, vice president of research,
said MultiKine is a patented preparation that is similar to LK-200
but is extracted from whole blood.
</P>
<P>
   MultiKine is being tested in several foreign countries,
including Israel, under the new drug permit. The drug has been
injected into patients prior to surgery to remove head and neck
cancers. He said there have been a number of encouraging responses
and that testing will also be done in the United States in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Cel-Sci spokeswoman Daryl Strahl criticized the FDA's ``outdated
rules'' for drug approvals, but she said her company has no
intention of taking any shortcuts. Potential treatments, she said,
have to be studied in scientifically sound and lengthy trials ``to
find out what happens next.''

<P>
   SHCHUCHYE, Russia _ Distrust and fear run deep in this
impoverished town in western Siberia, deeper than the large pools
of snowmelt that have filled gardens and cellars, sewage ducts and
wheatfields, streets and yards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the residents of Shchuchye were stunned to learn that
they had been the unwitting hosts for one of the world's largest
and deadliest stockpiles of chemical weapons _ nearly 6,000 tons of
lethal nerve agents, created to wipe out humans the way
insecticides kill bugs.
</P>
<P>
   And they have not forgotten that their leaders in faraway
Moscow, 975 miles to the west, lied to them for years, repeatedly
denying the arsenal's existence until long after the Cold War was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Russian government plans to destroy the weapons, using
American funding and know-how, and bury the residual waste in
bunkers located above the level of groundwater. Ask folks in
Shchuchye what they think of that and the answer, right now in
flood season, is invariably the same: not in my back lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around town, and tell me where the surface water ends and
the groundwater begins,'' quipped Alexander Zaikov, the affable
chief doctor at Shchuchye's woefully underequipped hospital, as he
drove visitors through the waterlogged neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Tatyana Sirota, a vendor at Shchuchye's small produce market,
was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like flies who will be poisoned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not just the story of an abusive, secretive
government indifferent to the concerns of its people. Russia has
changed, and nowhere is that more evident than in the efforts of
the very people who once designed these weapons and kept them a
well-guarded secret. Now they are trying to get rid of them safely
and keep the people who live here informed and involved in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons, some 2 million shells and missile warheads laid out
like wine bottles in a sprawling underground facility near
Shchuchye, are an unsightly legacy of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials and chemical arms specialists, until recently
forbidden by law even to mention the weapons, now answer questions
at public meetings and open hearings in the local legislature.
Public outreach offices, with the approval of the military, issue
detailed briefings to answer public concerns about the safety of
the project. US military officials, once seen as the ideological
enemy, are now accepted as partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Sergei Baranovsky, pointing to publicly available
maps of once-secret weapons sites and military bases and piles of
pamphlets and brochures, ``is nothing less than a revolution.''
Baranovsky heads the Russian chapter of the Green Cross, an
international environmental group that runs the outreach offices in
Shchuchye and the regional capital, Kurgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine anything like this being open 15 years ago?,''
he asked. ``We would have been put in jail. Now, we can talk about
the problem like civilized people.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that so far, chemical weapons disarmament in
Russia has been mostly talk. Russia has made headlines with its
recent ratification of nuclear arms reduction and test-ban
treaties. Its chemical arsenal, no less deadly, is all but ignored,
like some second-rate weapon of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   By April 29, states that signed the 1997 Chemical Weapons
Convention are supposed to have eliminated 1 percent of their
stockpiles. The United States has already destroyed 17 percent of
its 32,000-ton arsenal, the world's second largest.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, with 44,000 tons, will miss that deadline. Lieutenant
General Valery Kopashin, head of Russian's chemical weapons
elimination program, said Moscow remains committed to the treaty,
but cannot cover the $6 billion cost alone.
</P>
<P>
   The $888-million, US-Russian project to build an
industrial-sized weapons destruction facility in Shchuchye would
help. But the project has met with numerous delays, and this year
the US Congress cut all funds for the program from the budget.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has not gone down well in the Russian military.
Colonel Andrei Kosarev is one of the Russian officers who have been
trying to convince people in Shchuchye that destroying chemical
weapons with American help is in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people see NATO expanding to the east, they see the war
in Kosovo, and they think, we may need these weapons,'' Kosarev
said. ``It took a long time for people to believe the Americans
wanted to help us. So when the US cuts off funding, what am I
supposed to tell people?''
</P>
<P>
   The US Congress wants to see more evidence that the Russians
intend to fulfill their side of the bargain, which includes
modernizing Shchuchye's infrastructure. That is a daunting task.
The town is heated mainly by aging coal furnaces. Fresh water and
electricity are sporadic. New housing is badly needed to replace
the town's dilapidated wood huts.
</P>
<P>
   Kopashin says he is working on it, but only $1.8 million of
Russia's $20.5 million budget for chemical weapons elimination is
going to Shchuchye. The rest is probably earmarked for six other
weapons stockpiles throughout Russia, though no one can say for
sure. How any of the money gets spent is a state secret.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople in Shchuchye say they see no evidence of the new
water and gas pipelines and 17 apartment buildings promised by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the proof is in the pudding,'' said
Thomas E. Kuenning, head of the US Cooperative Threat Reduction
program that oversees joint disarmament projects, as he inspected
the construction sites on the outskirts of Shchuchye.
</P>
<P>
   Kuenning traveled to Shchuchye this month as part of an effort
to get US funding for the project back on track. As a symbol of
progress, he and Kopashin received a deed from the regional
governor for the land where the weapons destruction facility will
be built.
</P>
<P>
   Kuenning also got a firsthand look at what it will take to
convince the local population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streets are under water; the lights go off twice a day.
How can we talk about building a factory to destroy chemical
weapons?,'' asked Yekaterina Ponomaryova, who was selling canned
goods at the abandoned movie theater (still adorned with Lenin's
motto ``Of all the arts, the most important for us is Cinema.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any money, I'd just leave,'' she said. Pomomaryova
and other townspeople say they have heard that the military has
begun burning phosgene, a choking agent that dates to World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Kuenning's arrival stoked another favorite local rumor: that the
United States is building Shchuchye so that it can destroy its own
chemical weapons far from home.
</P>
<P>
   These days, American and Russian officials can smile at that
one. This is another job for the public outreach office.
</P>
<P>
   The office, which occupies a room in the schoolhouse, is run by
Galina Vepreva, a former teacher who has made herself an expert on
chemical weapons and their destruction. She has been to the US
facility in Tooele County, Utah. She has seen how each nearby house
there is equipped with a radio that connects to an emergency
center. She knows that in Shchuchye, most houses do not even have
phones.
</P>
<P>
   But Vepreva talks to people, and she has been sensing a change.
If three years ago everyone was against building the facility, now
she is asked whether there will be jobs there for local people.
</P>
<P>
   Vepreva is also the one who handles the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   She tells people the Russian plan to eliminate the weapons
entails no burning. The two-stage process involves mixing the
poisonous chemicals with a neutralizing agent that reduces toxicity
well below lethal levels, then mixing the resulting liquid with
asphalt to make solid ``bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   The US and Russian governments are investigating whether the
chemicals might leach from the asphalt bricks into rain or
groundwater. So far, their studies have not found serious risks,
though long-term investigations are still underway on whether the
chemicals, if they escaped, could trigger cancer, genetic
mutations, immune system effects, or birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   One test involved feeding the mixture to rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rats love it,'' said Miguel Morales, a spokesman for the
US Cooperative Threat Reduction program. ``They gained weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian specialists are convinced the bricks pose no danger. One
idea has been to use them to pave airport runways _ except that the
30,000 tons expected to be produced by disarming the weapons at
Shchuchye would provide only enough asphalt for half a mid-sized
runway, said Valery Demichuk, deputy director of the research
institute that developed most of these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Shchuchye can be forgiven for not believing
anything their government tells them. For years, people suspected
that the stockpiles were here, but Soviet, and from 1991 until
1993, Russian, authorities denied it.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Soviets also denied three major accidents at the
Mayak nuclear production facility in the neighboring Chelyabinsk
region, which polluted the Techa River that runs through Shchuchye
district with radionuclides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that it was worse here than in Chernobyl,'' said
Lyudmila Ganeyeva, a regional legislator who helped uncover the
Mayak disasters in the late 1980s. When people found out about the
chemical weapons stockpiles in Shchuchye , Ganeyeva said, ``our
first thought was `get it out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Russian law forbids the transport of chemical weapons; other
regions do not want the stuff in their backyards, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some time to realize that there was nothing to do
but destroy these weapons right where they are now,'' she said.

HARVARD WEIGHS TIGHTER RULES ON FACULTY'S INTERNET VENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In Harvard's first university-wide effort to
revise its conflict of interest policy since 1948, a high-level
committee has released a set of new, Internet-minded guidelines
that, if adopted, would subtly tighten rules regulating the
faculty's outside teaching, research, and consulting.
</P>
<P>
   While some professors view the proposed rules as a necessary
step to define the boundaries broadened by cyberspace, others see
them as a potential violation of their academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Once unimaginable educational opportunities, such as professors
distributing lectures over the Internet or setting up Web-based
firms dispensing advice, are not covered under the existing rules.
The current policy allows professors to consult, teach or research
outside Harvard so long as the work doesn't consume more than 20
percent of their time, compromise the university, or conflict with
their obligations to students, colleagues or Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But time is not the overriding factor under the proposed new
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Under them, faculty members would probably be prohibited from
teaching courses over the Internet for other institutions and doing
certain other forms of freelance work, even if it is done on their
own time _ after hours, during vacation, or over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the ease of dissemination makes it possible to
teach vast numbers of students around the world, often without
leaving campus and with only a modest investment of time. That,
according to a draft of the proposed guidelines obtained by the
Globe, opens up new forms of competition and potential conflict for
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal follows the administration's decision in the fall
to force Harvard law professor Arthur Miller to give up an online
course he produced last summer for Concord University School of
Law.
</P>
<P>
   These new recommended guidelines issued by the provost's faculty
advisory group, Miller said, would only serve to further limit
academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this proposal, I would say Harvard owned a part of my
body; now they have my heart and soul,'' said Miller, a voluble
professor once known for his TV show ``Miller's Court,'' which
helped explain the law to nonlawyers. ``I think it's very graphic
in demonstrating the expanded control Harvard is trying to exert
over the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard Law School Dean Robert Clark put an end to
Miller's fling with Concord, an online degree-granter founded by
Washington Post Co.'s Kaplan Educational Centers for which last
summer he taped 11 lectures, the new rules wouldn't categorically
bar professors from such ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, professors would have the opportunity to seek
permission from the dean of their respective school and the
corporation, Harvard's top administrative body. Yet, the parameters
deans would have to use in arriving at such a decision make
approval unlikely in most cases, the proposal's authors acknowledge
in their report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a flat prohibition,'' said Bob Mnookin, a law school
professor who helped draft the recommendations. ``Whether or not
someone is hemmed in depends on the reaction of their dean to what
is being proposed, and we can't really know that yet. My own hunch
is that deans are certainly sensitive to issues of academic
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposal differs in several ways from the 52-year-old
policy, a document amended last in 1997 when the administration
allowed professors a slight increase in the amount of summertime
money they could earn.
</P>
<P>
   Without approval, it bars professors from teaching, consulting,
or doing research at or for another educational institution or
for-profit organization at any time, not just during the academic
year. Those words were chosen to cover virtual teaching over the
Internet as well as work done during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also specifically states that professors, associate
professors or assistant professors may not hold academic
appointments at other institutions, except approved joint programs.
Though this has been tacitly understood, the existing guidelines do
not address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations make it clear professors must be careful in
using the university's name and insignia in their outside work. In
such cases, the proposal explains, professors should limit
identification with Harvard to listing their formal titles, and
only when it's relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they must ensure the organization doesn't
misrepresent Harvard, suggesting sponsorship when no formal
association exists.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Thompson, Harvard's assistant provost and chairman of the
committee that wrote the proposal, insisted Miller's case did not
prompt the review of the current policy. Instead, he said, the
administration has recognized over the past few years that the new
information technologies have made it necessary to revise the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say, though, it was often used as an example of what any
adequate policy should be able to answer,'' Thompson said. ``What
Arthur Miller's case shows is that deans have to interpret the
extent to which a professor's relationship with another university
qualifies as a course.''
</P>
<P>
   Other professors, however, viewed Miller's venture as adding
urgency to why new rules are necessary sooner rather than later.
Sidney Verba, a professor of government also on the provost's
committee, said even after the rules are agreed on, ambiguity would
continue. Precedents such as Miller's case will establish case law,
he said, and that will continue to refine the lines.
</P>
<P>
   As for Miller preparing online lectures, Verba says prohibiting
them was justified because Concord had advertised that its course
starred a Harvard professor and because it fell under current rules
barring activities competitive to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the ambiguity comes from the fuzzy relationship
people have with the new medium,'' he said. ``I think a lot of this
will be shaken out over time.''
</P>
<P>
   While clarifying vagaries clouding online education is a good
thing, according to law school professor Charles Nesson, the
university has to tread a fine line, being careful not to blunt new
forms of expression as Harvard protects its name.
</P>
<P>
   And for Nesson, who runs the law school's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society and has been approached to teach online
courses or sit on dot-com advisory boards, the issues are not
merely hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal does crimp freedom, but I respect it,'' he said.
``But if the administration confines faculty, and doesn't give them
any meaningful outlet, then it's got really negative connotations.
That remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller is already convinced that the new proposal denotes
more than connotes a negative turn for academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, the committee expects to hear back on
the proposed guidelines from Harvard deans. Members of the Harvard
corporation are expected to take a final vote on the
recommendations by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has become familiar to millions of Americans through
his high-profile forays into TV including a stint as legal editor
of ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' says the Internet is the next
frontier for teaching law to the masses. And he doesn't want to be
shut out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is so bothersome about this is that I've been
here about 30 years and there has never been this kind of
restriction on my behavior,'' Miller said. ``I've been loyal to
Harvard, but there are skills I have that I like to share outside
of Harvard. ''

DECREASE RISK AS TIME TO USE COLLEGE SAVINGS NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have held onto Windsor II after its steep decline until it
has just about returned to the price at which I bought it. I would
like to exchange some or all of it for another Vanguard fund. What
is your suggestion? I just bought the Total Stock Market Index
fund. Should I be in Index 500 or Index Growth?
</P>
<P>
   D.C., Cambridge, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This portfolio is much too aggressive for its
short-to-intermediate-term time frame. Presumably your grandchild
will need to begin drawing on the funds in about six to seven
years, so I would favor a much more cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand your impatience with Windsor II, but I wouldn't
quit on it now; this is a fund with a long and proven track record,
and I fear that if you sell now you may eventually find you jumped
ship just as the value investments that dominate its portfolio were
returning to favor. With a portfolio dominated by durable goods
manufacturers, utilities, financials, and energy stocks, this
should be a solid foul-weather fund, and foul weather is precisely
what I see on the market horizon. I suggest you look not to its
1999 loss of 5.8 percent, nor its 0.8 percent year-to-date loss in
2000, but rather to its five-year record of 17.31 percent average
annual gains and its 10-year record of 14.31 percent average gains.
Its portfolio P/E ratio of 23.3 is also comforting to me.
</P>
<P>
   You could also take comfort in looking at a comparison of the
results of Windsor II and its large-cap value peers during the last
couple of years _ with Windsor II consistently running ahead of its
peer group until early this year, and currently running a bit ahead
of the pack in this currently unpopular market sector.
</P>
<P>
   As you probably know, Vanguard Health Care fund is also a
longtime favorite of mine but not for a portfolio such as this. I
suggest you sell half of that position, putting the proceeds into
Vanguard Balanced Index. And I would sell all of the Total Stock
Market Index fund, putting the proceeds there in Vanguard GNMA
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I would allocate future contributions along similar
lines, not only putting the new money in funds such as the Balanced
and GNMA offerings, but also slowly decreasing the stock market
risk as your granchild nears the first year of college. I'd begin
at about the time your grandchild is a freshman in high school,
slowly liquidating the Windsor II and Health Care positions so that
by the time college looms, the entire portfolio would be on the
fixed-income side, most of that in CDs, short-term bonds, and money
market positions. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I expect to net $50,000 from the sale of my home this year.
Of this, $20,000 will be used as the down payment on a condo and
$5,000 will go into an emergency savings account. As for the
remaining $25,000, what do you advise? I have been considering
either putting it into a fixed-income fund, the proceeds of which
would go to pay premiums on a long-term health care policy, or
adding the money to my portfolio. If I take the latter course,
should I add to my current portfolio or add to my holdings by
betting into a combination of risky high-tech funds balanced by
some conservative blue chips?
</P>
<P>
   K.C., Shrewsbury, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm far from an expert on this, but my visceral feeling is
that unless you have, or expect you might soon have, some unusual
health situation, you would be better off in the long run if you
added that $25,000 to your investments rather than putting it in
fixed-income holdings that would pay premiums on a health-care
policy.
</P>
<P>
   If you agree with that thinking, I would advise that you pursue
a combination of the two alternatives you propose. I would add to
the current portfolio by increasing the stake in the ICM/Isabelle
Small-Cap Value fund by about $5,000. This is an intriguing little
fund, begun only in March 1998 with only $19 million in assets. But
it produced a gain of 49.5 percent in 1999, and so far this year it
has a 9.68 percent gain. These are especially spectacular numbers
when you consider the unpopular market segment _ small-cap value
stocks _ in which it has been operating.
</P>
<P>
   It also is fairly risky, so a bigger position here might fill
your apparent appetite for something dicey. Its portfolio is
concentrated into only 44 stocks, with those concentrated in small
industrial and durable stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If you go along with that suggestion, you would have a little
more than 30 percent of your fund portfolio in issues with
above-average risk _ Isabelle and Vanguard Health Care. That's
enough. At that point, I would seek to build a more traditional
core portfolio, dividing the remaining $20,000 evenly between
Vanguard Mid-Cap Index fund and Vanguard Index 500. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am contributing 10 percent of my salary to my company's
401(k) fund. I would like to know which funds among the 10
available in the plan would give the maximum growth.
</P>
<P>
   V.A., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Questions like that can be answered only in hindsight. But it
appears to me that you have your portfolio pretty well out of
balance with your current allocations. More than 70 percent of your
holdings are in the small-cap and mid-cap arenas, and while these
market sectors have been doing fairly well lately, most investors
prefer to have their portfolio dominated by the large-cap stocks.
Besides the three funds that you are now using, your 401(k) offers
three other stock funds _ Prices International Stock fund, its
Equity Index fund, and its Equity-Income fund. (You are correct to
ignore the three fixed-income funds and the balanced fund; at your
age you want to be entirely in stock funds for maximum long-term
growth.)
</P>
<P>
   If I were allocating a long-term portfolio with these choices I
would go with 40 percent in the Equity-Index fund, which simply
tracks the results of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. I would
then put another 10 percent in Price's Equity-Income fund, which
holds a portfolio of large-cap value-oriented stocks, and is the
only fund offered that will give you participation in the value end
of the large-cap market. I would then cut the holdings in New
Horizons, a small-cap fund, and in Mid-Cap Growth fund to 20
percent each. I would then fill out the allocation by putting the
final 10 percent in Price's International Stock fund. That last
move increases your exposure to international equity markets from
the current 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What do I have against the Spectrum Growth fund? Nothing,
really. It is a fund that puts its assets in shares of eight
different Price stock funds, with the International Stock fund at
the head of the list, closely followed by New Horizons. It's a
solid fund, but it's easier to track the performance of different
segments of your portfolio if your holdings are in specific market
funds rather than jumbled together in a single offering. Funds such
as this are basically designed for people who just want a single
fund that will touch all the bases. Since you can select your own
variety through the 401(k) allocation, that's the course I would
take. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money Musings: Reading the notice of the annual meeting of a
mutual fund can be about as instructive and exciting as most
boilerplate is, and maybe even worse. But occasionally, you can
find a nugget.
</P>
<P>
   I use the Alger family of funds as a source for investing odd
bits of money that stumble in. From time to time I have been
alternating between investments in the Small-Cap, Mid-Cap Growth
and Capital Appreciation funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Alger fund family was established by a father, and his son
came into the business later and is now the manager of record of
the funds. When I looked into the notice for the annual meeting,
part of that boilerplate detailed where the Algers had put their
own money: They had fairly small holdings in each of the funds and
big concentrations in both the Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Growth
entries.
</P>
<P>
   What better insider information do you need? This approach won't
work with mammoth fund families such as Fidelity and Vanguard, but
if you use a small fund family, taking a few moments to go through
the meeting notice can be informative.

DNA READINGS TO PUT US BLACKS ON AFRICA'S MAP

<TEXT>
<P>
   Promising to reconnect a bond broken by the horrors of the
trans-Atlantic slave trade, a team of geneticists plans to offer a
DNA test this summer that would allow African-Americans to pinpoint
their roots on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   By using a blood test that matches DNA sequences to samples
taken from native African populations, scientists at Howard
University say, they could, for example, link a black man from
Roxbury to the mountains of Ghana's Ashanti region, where his kin
walked centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the test, which could cost up to $300, could
easily spark the kind of movement that followed Alex Haley's book
and television miniseries ``Roots'' in the 1970s, when thousands of
blacks set across the Atlantic, hoping to reclaim their lost
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything to know that some of my people came
from Africa, but if I can pinpoint a culture, a religion, and
language, then it can strengthen my sense of identity and
relationship with Africa,'' said Richard Newman of Harvard
University's W.E.B. DuBois Institute for African-American Research.
</P>
<P>
   But as members of a new generation search the past for a sense
of identity, they might not find what they expect, warn historians,
educators, and genealogists. Some African-Americans will discover
the branches of their family tree lead not to a bend in the Niger
River, but to England and Germany. DNA tests, Howard University
geneticists say, have already revealed that about 30 percent of
African-American men descended from a European on their father's
side _ largely the legacy, they say, of raped women slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Others, predicted genealogist Tony Burroughs, will flock to
Africa searching for similar sounding last names and family
resemblances only to discover that they have nothing in common with
the people there but the color of their skin. Burroughs recalled
many blacks went to Africa after ``Roots,'' but came back feeling
confused and ultimately, unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way we have roots, blood, and regional ties in Africa,
but in other ways it's still a foreign country,'' said Burroughs,
an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The years that have passed since we have been off the African
shores have been difficult on both sides of the ocean, and there
has been little attempt to bridge those gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kittles, the 34-year-old geneticist at Howard University in
Washington who initiated the study, has been the main researcher.
He insists that while the test will offer only a glimmer of the
past, even a hint of their African roots is more than most
African-Americans have ever hoped for. The slave trade erased
family histories, and, before the discovery of DNA, nobody imagined
that the stories could be written anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a lot of blacks, knowing a little bit of the story is
important, he said. ``This will definitely contribute a lot to
understanding the history of African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard University will be able to do two versions of the test,
Kittles said. The first looks at mitochondrial DNA, which is handed
down, unchanged, from mother to child. The other uses the male, or
Y, chromosome, which is passed on from father to son unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers can then compare the test subject with a database of
more than 2,000 samples they have assembled from about 40
populations across Western Africa, where the trans-Atlantic slave
trade originated. Small, distinctive mutations in the DNA of each
of these populations serve as fingerprints, allowing researchers to
make the match.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles has also collected a separate database with Native
American, Asian, and European DNA to cross-reference genes that
cannot be traced to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Such a test makes no attempt to tell a full family story; it
tells where only one line of the family tree came from, researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs said the DNA results may give people a ``false sense
of security.'' People may head to Nigeria because the DNA results
say they may have roots in that country, but there are many people
there who have a different genetic makeup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another pitfall is that researchers have extracted genetic
fingerprints from only a limited number of African populations. If
an African population has scattered since the slave trade, or if
researchers have not yet isolated a population's DNA, then the test
will not lead anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles said the researchers are collecting additional DNA
samples so they can expand the database and identify more African
populations. He also said they do not know when the test will be
available to the public, but they hope to have it ready this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limitations of the test, Kittles said he is already
getting calls from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think African-Americans will be receptive to this. Right
from the start there has always been a spiritual link to Africa,
though there was never any physical link,'' said Manisha Sinha,
assistant professor of Afro-American studies and history at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles said the idea for the test came to him when he was a
graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Kittles was tracing the origin of skeletal
remains found in a lost burial ground in Manhattan. As he worked to
compare DNA sequences in the bones with African populations _ to
establish that the bones were those of enslaved African _ he
realized he could use the same method to find the origins of living
African descendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are from Europe, you know where your relatives probably
came from, and if you are Native American, you know what tribe you
are from, but if you are black and want to go to Africa, where do
you go?'' asked Sam Ford, 46, one of the subjects whom Howard has
used to refine the test.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has always been told that he looks Nigerian, but had
no way of knowing the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are like an adoptive child trying to find out where your
family came from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Months after Ford took the test, Kittles sat him in front of his
computer and explained that a pattern on his Y chromosome linked
him to people from the area of Ibadan, a city in southwestern
Nigeria. Ford's ancestors on his father's side are probably
Yorubas, one of the largest tribes in Nigeria. Mitochondrial DNA
showed that ancestors on his mother's side were probably from an
area that includes modern-day Somalia and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least now there is some place for me to go,'' said Ford,
who plans to travel to Nigeria soon.

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Fight Club'' _ Almost any actor can look good
with a solid script and a decent director. This mess of a movie
features neither. And Edward Norton, as a down-and-outer, is still
great. Criticized for its violence on all sides, that's not the
problem. Director David Fincher is so sophomorically aware of his
testosterone metaphor _ boxing as a symbol of male nuttiness _ that
he transforms what might have been watchable into a pretentious
preliminary bout. It's for anyone who believes that a shaky camera
and a shakier sense of drama is a formula for art.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' _ This must have sounded better at the pitch
meeting than it plays on the screen. Arnold must save the world
from the Devil. Schwarzenegger vs. Satan. While Gabriel Byrne's
turn as the arch fiend is terrific, at the end of these days, there
are no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' _ Lawrence Kasdan's best film in years is an
affectionate sendup of small-town paranoia and psychiatry. While
Loren Dean carries the picture as the shrink wrapped up in his

Paymer steal the picture.

GORE STUMBLES AS BUSH PROVES HE'S NO FEATHERWEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last we left the presidential campaign, the script was
clear: Having dispatched _ nay, demolished _ Democratic rival Bill
Bradley, Al Gore had successfully remade himself as a lean, mean,
politicking machine. As for Bush, his acrimonious primary fight
with rival John McCain had pinned him down on his party's right
wing, and revealed him as an intellectual featherweight.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their primary colors, Gore looked like the man to beat
in November. Or so the story line went.
</P>
<P>
   But as public and media attention has focused elsewhere, this
campaign _ already filled with revelatory reversals and sudden
switchbacks _ has turned expectations on their ear once again.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been on the offensive with an array of thoughtful
policy proposals _ ranging from education to the environment to
health care to home ownership _ that have brought him determinedly
back to the political center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, has suffered from self-inflicted wounds for
much of the same period, blundering with a clumsy break with the
Clinton administration on Elian Gonzalez, the shipwrecked Cuban
waif-cum-political pawn. Hunkered down, Gore's not met with the
national press in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long time till November, but certainly one can say the
roles have been reversed,'' says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary campaign, the prevailing critique of Bush was
that his so-called compassionate conservatism was little more than
a few rhetorical blandishments, a smattering of Spanish, and clever
photo opportunities with minority children.
</P>
<P>
   But since wrapping up the GOP nomination, the Texas governor has
moved quickly to unveil ideas that inform his rhetorical framework.
As one might expect from a Republican governor, his is a program
that emphasizes incentives rather than mandates and state
flexibility rather than federal decrees. And in the age-old
private-goods-vs.-public-goods debate _ in this case, tax cuts vs.
new government spending _ his package of plans is certainly skewed
toward the former.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's notable is that Bush has pushed aggressively on
issues Republicans more generally pay only lip service to or
concede to Democrats altogether.
</P>
<P>
   First he proposed a $5 billion, five-year program to focus
intensively on reading in the lower grades. Then he offered a $2
billion plan to hasten the cleanup of brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a $35 billion, five-year plan to offer refundable tax
credit of up to $2,000 a year to help moderate-income families
purchase health insurance, plus a $3.6 billion, five-year scheme to
build new health care clinics in needy or remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush called for $1.7 billion in tax breaks to entice
developers to build and rehab homes in struggling areas and to let
people use Section 8 rental vouchers toward down payments on homes
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of those proposals will be the subject of months
of campaign debate; and as Gore demonstrated in the Democratic
primary, he can focus with laser-like accuracy on the weaknesses _
real or imagined _ in an opponent's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, taken together, Bush's first month as the Republican
nominee presumptive sends an unmistakable signal: He intends to
conduct his campaign in the center, where elections are won and
lost, and not on the ideological extremes, where the congressional
Republicans have steered their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is not a congressional Republican,'' says GOP
pollster Neil Newhouse. ``This is a guy who has been a governor who
governs from the mainstream _ and he is using issues to demonstrate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now look at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Two big events define his campaign in the time since the primary
campaign ended. The first is his plan for campaign-finance reform,
an obvious attempt to appeal to disappointed supporters of McCain
who are searching for a new home. But rather than supporting true
public financing, Gore hopes to build an endowment fund on the
cheap, by offering tax deductions for contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore was forced to concede that, after the abuses of the
1996 campaign, he was an ``imperfect messenger for this cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But a bigger problem lies in the mechanics of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   How, exactly, would a tax deduction _ which, after all, amounts
to only a fraction of the actual value of the donation _ induce
anyone to contribute to a fund that would also finance candidates
he opposes?
</P>
<P>
   By far the bigger issue, however, has been Gore's abrupt break
with the Clinton administration's position that Elian Gonzalez
should return to his father and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sudden support of legislation to grant the boy and his
father, as well as other family members, permanent resident alien
status and to move the matter to family court is hardly beyond the
policy pale; that really only brings him into sync with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   However, in abandoning the Clinton administration to strike that
pose, the vice president leaned hard into his reputation as an
expedient politician willing to mortgage principle in pursuit of
electoral victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if Gore said, `Let's see, what criticism is
Bush using against me that has the most reality to it and how can I
prove him right?' '' says Larry Sabato, director of the University
of Virginia's Center for Governmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't met a single Democrat who thinks he did a smart
thing with his Elian Gonzalez comment,'' adds Democratic consultant
Dan Payne.
</P>
<P>
   Since his widely panned initial foray on the subject, Gore has
redefined his position several more times, but without ever
neutralizing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he has said the warring branches of the boy's
family should reach ``a family solution'' _ something that seems
exceedingly unlikely _ and avoided other comment. But that, too,
has exacted a campaign cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't even have a press conference, because he knows it
would be consumed by Elian questions,'' says Hess.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush appears to have won himself some better treatment by his
willingness to engage reporters, a certain skepticism has started
to creep into media accounts of Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the post-primary period, Bruce Buchanan, a professor
of government at the University of Texas at Austin, says, ``Bush
has helped himself by stressing things popular with swing voters,
while Gore has had a bad month because of the Elian issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Gallup survey, released April 12, bolsters the
widespread perception that Bush has done well, while Gore has
performed poorly. That survey shows Bush now leads Gore 50 percent
to 41 percent. Not a huge gap, certainly. But it does show a
significant improvement from the previous Gallup survey, when the
race was a statistical tie, 46 percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby poll released April 17 shows a smaller Bush lead _ 4.5
percent, which is just outside the margin of error _ but shows the
same trend toward the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Republicans are heartened about their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a perception after the primaries that George W. was
not nearly as strong as he had appeared early on and that Al Gore
was significantly stronger,'' says Newhouse. ``The last month has
shown they are fairly evenly matched, which means it should be a
hell of a stretch run.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats acknowledge Bush has done better than
expected _ though with some important qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has always operated well when not pressed, but when he
gets into the fray of battle he looks weak and diminished,'' says
Democratic strategist John Sasso. ``Gore has proved that
hand-to-hand combat is his strength, so when the battle is really
joined, I think Gore will shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant, puts it: ``In
April, it is a personality contest, and Bush is winning that race.
But in October, the race is about trust, and that is one Al Gore
should be able to win.''
</P>
<P>
   All that may well be true. Nevertheless, at this early juncture,
Bush has surprised everyone by winning round one _ handily.

N.H. CONTEST COULD BE KEY TO DEMOCRATS RETAKING CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If fund-raising reports are any indication, Democrats are in a
good position this year to regain control of Congress _ and New
Hampshire could play a key role in making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need to win six more seats in this year's election to
retake the House. Both parties are looking at 11 seats that could
be viewed as legitimate contests.
</P>
<P>
   Among those 11 races, eight Democratic challengers have set
records during the last half of 1999 in outraising Republican
incumbents, giving Democrats the best fund-raising year in history,
according to Federal Election Commission reports.
</P>
<P>
   The eight are among 11 Democrats who have already raised
$400,000 this year, in sharp contrast to the election cycle of
1998, when only one non-incumbent Democrat raised that amount. The
fund-raising records suggest that these races will, at a minimum,
be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democratic victories will not come easily. With one
exception, all the GOP incumbents in question won by double-digit
margins in the 1998 election. And most of those incumbents appear
to be ahead in the polls. But the Democratic challengers, as well
as state and national party leaders, see in their fund-raising
totals a hope that they can pull some upsets in November.
</P>
<P>
   One race the Democrats are closely watching is the New Hampshire
2d Congressional District race between GOP incumbent Charles Bass
and Democrat Barney Brannen, a trial lawyer and community activist.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Democrats believe Brannen could be their key to
taking back the House if one or two close races decide that battle.
Democrats, who have held the seat only once since 1912, say Brannen
has several advantages in the race.
</P>
<P>
   One is Bass himself. Bass, who unseated Democrat Dick Swett in
1994, is the only GOP incumbent who did not win by double-digit
margins in 1998. He won with only 53 percent of the vote, and he
won his two previous elections with just 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his favorability rating, according to one poll, is
only 47 percent. The conventional wisdom of politics suggests that
when an incumbent's favorability with voters drops below 50
percent, that incumbent is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Brannen is running in a district that has been trending
Democratic in recent years, particularly in the southern part of
the state, according to various reports.
</P>
<P>
   Bass is viewed as conservative on fiscal issues, but more
moderate on other issues; for example, he's been a consistent
supporter of abortion rights. Brannen is seen as a Democratic
moderate who wants stronger safeguards for social security,
improved education, environmental protections, and guaranteed
health care for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Brannen has outraised Bass, $123,000 to $53,000, during the last
half of 1999. Although at year's end Bass had a $242,000 balance
compared with Brannen's $112,000, Brannen has the fund-raising
momentum in his favor. From January through March of this year, he
has raised $143,000 to Bass's $88,650.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's other congressional seat appears safely in
Republican hands. GOP Congressman John E. Sununu _ son of the
former governor and White House aide _ has only token opposition
this year, which allows the state's Democrats to focus most of
their attention, and their resources, on the 2d District race.
</P>
<P>
   Other House races being closely watched by both parties include
the California contest between GOP incumbent Brian P. Bilbray and
Democratic state assemblywoman Susan Davis. Although Davis
outraised Bilbray in the last half of last year, Davis ended up
with a balance of only $370,000 compared with Bilbray's $828,000.
But the fund-raising momentum appears to be with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic hopefuls also outraised GOP congressional incumbents
in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While these fund-raising records give Democrats hope of taking
back the House, the GOP also sees a chance of gaining
Democratic-held congressional seats this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in contests for seats that will be vacated by
Democrats, Republicans outraised Democrats in Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Virginia, and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Democrats have a fund-raising advantage in three
GOP-held seats that will be vacated by retiring Republicans in
Montana, Florida, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may have another advantage: the feeling among many
voters that the GOP-controlled Congress has been largely
unproductive, more concerned about its own personal agenda than the
voters' interests.
</P>
<P>
   As Brannen said in a recent interview in the Washington Post,
his ability to raise money quickly is attributed largely to ``a lot
of disappointment right now about the lack of productivity in
Congress on a number of important issues like health care,
education, and protecting Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   With the still-popular Clinton stumping for some of the
Democratic challengers, and with the economy still going strong,
Democrats see this election as their greatest chance in recent
years to recapture the House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats believe the Bass-Brannen race is a bellwether
that will signal how far New Hampshire has shifted from its
Republican roots. But it may also be the determining factor as to
whether the House will shift from Republican to Democratic control
in November.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, political winds from New Hampshire to Florida
appear to be shifting favorably toward the Democrats.

THE PROSPECTS FOR JEANNE SHAHEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ It was a remark delivered so calmly it was almost
offhand. But New Hampshire's Governor Jeanne Shaheen was talking
about far more than the campaign for governor this year, at least
by implication. And that implication is full of national meaning
because it directly affects Al Gore's options in choosing his
running mate against George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   What she said was that she would be announcing her plans about
seeking reelection this fall to a third term as governor in a few
weeks or so _ about a month before the June filing deadline. Down
here for some fund-raising, a little shoulder-rubbing with the Gore
family, and an opportunity to show off before the Democratic
Governors' Association's monthly
come-see-a-real-live-Democratic-governor forum, she had also said
she probably would be running.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that the governor's likelihood of being
Gore's running mate, of even being part of the mix down the stretch
toward the Democratic National Convention in August, has taken a
tumble down to longest of long shots. And from watching and
listening to her here and up in Boston this month, it seems clear
that this is her choice about her life.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing a dozen of these running-mate decisions evolve over
the years, you learn to put conditional words in all your
sentences. Surprise and last-minute lurches are the norm.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the political calendar, what Shaheen has said
appears pretty clear. From Gore's perspective _ and I believe the
country's as well _ this is more than unfortunate. The political
calendar, a pesky reality check sometimes, has in effect made it
difficult to the point of impossible for him to consider a female
Democratic politician for Vice President.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Dianne Feinstein, whom Walter Mondale almost picked as
his running mate in 1984 when she was mayor of San Francisco, is
not only also up for reelection this year; she has already been
through her primary and raised gobs of money for her race. She gets
mentioned as a running mate all the time (though from what I hear,
it was Jeanne Shaheen the Gore campaign was eyeing all along) _ but
picking Feinstein in August would be disruptive in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   And the job title of Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend of Maryland, Robert Kennedy's first-born, says it all. She
is considered a certain candidate to succeed Parris Glendenning two
years hence; were she to win, she would immediately be a factor in
presidential politics. But to skip a rung on the career ladder
doesn't make sense for her or for Gore, who will be emphasizing the
word ``experience'' straight through to November.
</P>
<P>
   The only other female name who shares Gore's core beliefs as a
New Democrat that I've heard _ Laura Tyson _ symbolizes how long a
female long shot has become. Tyson is top-drawer, an architect of
the Clinton's administration's successful economic policies in his
first term and now the highly thought-of dean of the University of
California's business school. But for now that's a notion, not even
a viable possibility.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, it was Jeanne Shaheen who was in Gore's
sights, precisely because her gender was an added, not the sole,
benefit. In fact, her boosters for veep are said to have included
the campaign's chief kibbitzer, President Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance politics, like gender, was also involved, but that,
too, was an extra dimension. The fact is, it was was more than
Shaheen's endorsement that helped Gore beat Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire's pivotal primary on Feb. 1. It was also more than the
fact her husband and one of the state party's legendary operatives,
Billy Shaheen, was running the Gore operation months before she
went public.
</P>
<P>
   The real key was that the concept of the primary that came from
the governor's operation _ that the fulcrum for the primary would
be the economy, state and national, and that Gore needed to make it
clear that he would fight for working families and not merely come
up with policy ideas _ carred the day.
</P>
<P>
   But what would have made Shaheen a certain short-listee is her
status and record as a successful New Democrat. Her strength in
creating a vital center in New Hampshire has been visible in her
landslide majorities and in the quiet support for her patient,
consensus-building emphasis on governance over quixotic, swaggering
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom of Shaheen's approach becaomes more evident every
month. Already the state share of education has jumped from a dime
on the dollar to more than half. An advisory commission will tell
the state with authority what its options are and what their
economic impact would be and Shaheen will run for reelection on a
proposal of her own.
</P>
<P>
   My money's on the guv. But before this becomes purely a state
matter, it's worth noting that the judgment of national party
leaders, including Clinton and Gore, was that her character and
record had prepared her for national office. They were right.

&HT;     THE BRITISH GROUP THAT HELPED CHANGE THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAIG MARINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even if you hate the Sex Pistols, even if punk
rock turns your stomach and you wouldn't pierce a body part for all
the stock options in the Silicon Valley, you might consider seeing
``The Filth and the Fury,'' director Julien Temple's documentary on
the seminal English band.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Sex Pistols changed your life, whether you know it
or not. Once the Sex Pistols roared through the public
consciousness like a runaway freight train destined for the
inevitable nasty ending, the world could never return to its former
bloated, passive ways.
</P>
<P>
   Try this on for size: all of you jokers who made hundreds of
thousands of dollars on stocks this year should send the Sex
Pistols a thank you note, at least the ones that are still alive.
(As for those of you who hung on a tad too long and lost the farm,
well . . . blame disco.)
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to explain this far-from-radical premise is with
a bit of historical comparison. Here we are back in the 1400s, and
since there were no BMW engines to hone to absolute, minute
perfection, Johann Gutenberg turned his inbred anal tendencies
toward another time-consuming task.
</P>
<P>
   Gutenberg is credited with being the first European to print
with movable type. Wait, don't turn to the comics yet. Johann
rocked his world because movable type meant you could print things
on the cheap. Previously, if you wanted to print a book, every page
had to be carved out of wood _ it was cheaper to write books out by
hand.
</P>
<P>
   So Gutenberg has his type, starts churning out Bibles, and the
next thing you know, everyone is reading their own Bibles, which
means they are making their own interpretations of God's word,
which means the Church has a significant loss of influence among
the populace, since the clergy can no longer hand down
proclamations based upon exclusive knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo _ a less docile populace, a massive questioning of
established authority and the next thing you know, Lou Reed is
going to play for the Pope on May Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward from the 15th century to the bloated 1970s:
Emerson, Lake and Palmer are actually selling records and filling
stadiums with tedious re-arrangements of classical riffs the public
is too ignorant to recognize. The world of rock music is, on the
whole, dominated by overproduced, soulless arena bands. Kansas,
Styx _ it's too painful to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Out of England comes this incredibly angry sound, the apparent
humor in the lyrics not enough to mask the raw rage at a political
system with a boot on the throat of the common man. Musically, it's
three chords cranked to 10 on the amplifier and a singer who loses
whatever melody a song might contain in his need to shout out his
message at the top of his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the Pistols proudly display their refusal to join the
mainstream _ it appears they consider a bath or a washing machine a
political compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Rebellion is back in rock 'n' roll. And, as with Gutenberg's
contribution, the Sex Pistols once again get people to begin
questioning authority. The '60s were passive. Buffalo Springfield's
``For What it's Worth,'' passed for revolutionary music, even
though its central message, ``Something's happening here, what it
is ain't exactly clear,'' is inherently foggy.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Pistols have no confusion whatsoever: ``Don't
know what I want, but I know how to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   This message, combined with the fact that as musicians they bit
the big tamale, was all it took. The sheep shook off whatever it is
that sheep would shake off when they stopped being sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, people started doing, instead of watching. Who says
they have to be good to form a band? Who cares? Do it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the revolution. Everywhere, people began taking
risks. The pervasive attitude became one of action. This
infiltrated society as a whole, as revolutions tend to do, and next
thing you know, every geek with a pocket protector is starting a
company, Apple (founded in 1976, the same year the Pistols started
rocking Britain) takes off, and kaboom! NASDAQ goes through the
roof, you're driving a Saab (badly, with a cell phone) and
listening to crap on your CD player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury'' is great at setting the band within
its era, even if it spends a little too much time on the whinefest
over whether manager Malcolm McLaren or Johnny Rotten deserves more
credit for the band's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Rotten, real name John Lydon, with his legit working-class
credentials lending credibility to his role as the group's chief
lyricist, always has a way of keeping things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm was a wanker who knew how to stir up a load of s. and
had zero idea on how to deal with things once they came down,''
Rotten said in a recent interview. ``He thought all press was good
press, when all that did was make it impossible for us to ever be
heard. I liked infusing our songs with humor _ it's a British
working-class way of dealing with abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the anger and refusal to ignore the obvious misery anymore
was also real. I was never able to spend any time on that part of
what we were saying, because if we did any interviews at all, they
were inevitably confrontational from the start. And I was never one
to take any guff from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Take his word for it. After all, he did change your world.

DARWIN'S MACHINE: DUMB, BUT IT WORK 
</HEADLINE>

DARWIN'S GHOST 
The Origin of Species Updated 
By Steve Jones. Random House. 377 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was both tragedy and triumph that when ``On the Origin of
Species'' was published in 1859, Charles Darwin's name became a
synonym for evolution. Though Darwin studiously avoided mentioning
humans in his book, religious leaders immediately saw ``Darwinism''
as a dangerous anti-religion, a godless belief system that removed
the Creator from creation and made his greatest idea, man, the
grandchild of mere apes.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Darwin's ideas have prevailed. Most mainstream
religions have come to an accommodation with them, though a vocal
minority still rejects evolution and propounds biblically-derived
creationist theories.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of Darwin was the brilliant way the former ministry
student distilled and explained the mechanism of life. His thesis
of descent with modification via natural selection immediately
clicked with people who took the time to consider it. So obvious
was it to zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley that he exclaimed, ``How
extremely stupid not to have thought of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darwin did not just cause readers to smack their heads and
utter, ``Duh.'' He fundamentally changed the way all of us _
including every rejectionist, whether he admits it or not _ see the
world. In ``Darwin's Ghost,'' a fascinating and witty book that
tours the same intellectual territory as Darwin, Steve Jones, a
British geneticist, shows how extensively Darwin's theory explains
the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, his is an argument with both the remaining skeptics of
evolution and those who persist in misapplying Darwin's theory in
realms such as sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Natural selection, Jones neatly observes, is a dumb but
relentless machine that works with the materials at hand. Most of
its products do not last. ``Who could ever have designed a tree
kangaroo?'' But ``clumsy as the animal may seem, it is infinitely
better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and plainly
bears the stamp of far higher workmanship, than anything achieved
by man.'' Which is why engineers of recent years have been studying
natural forms to tease out design ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The more sophisticated school of creationism, of course, may see
in the word ``workmanship'' a hint of ``intelligent design'' and
thus of a deus in the machina of natural selection. Empty logic,
says Jones. Natural selection is the ``plodding accumulation of
error.'' Given enough time to work through enough mistakes,
anything _ velociraptor, tree kangaroo, homo sapien _ will turn up.
So why get caught up in a material-world argument, asks Jones.
``The birth of Adam, whether real or metaphorical, marked the
insertion into an animal body of a post-biological soul that leaves
no fossils and needs no genes.'' The flesh, he wisely notes, is not
a good place to go hunting for the things of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Jones's book is devoted to human, as opposed to
natural, selection _ the breeding programs and hybridization
campaigns that humans have conducted with cattle, dogs, wheat, and
a thousand more species for the past 13,000 years. Domesticated
life forms, he says, are ``silent witnesses to the malleability of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   That very malleability, combined with human technological
prowess, is why we have arrived at a portentious moment. Though he
doesn't spend much time on the subject, it is clear that Jones
believes human cloning and increasingly bizarre forms of
hybridization are, if not now underway somewhere, certainly
imminent and probably dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Jones does not wave the chicken-little banner of ``Frankenfood''
in this book, but here is a geneticist clearly alarmed at the
dangers of genetic manipulation. Already, he points out, beneficial
genes inserted into oilseed rape to promote herbicide resistance
have seeped into wild mustards and radishes. ``Industry's optimism
about the nature and stability of species is unfounded,'' he says.
``Those who cast down the barriers to hybridism will soon be
reminded of what evolution can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin's Ghost'' is written with great authority and a fluid
style, and it is refreshing not to have footnotes littering the
text. But Jones fails to include substantial back-of-the-book
chapter notes to anchor disembodied quotes and expand upon
interesting facts. It is true that light or nonexistent footnotes
are more the British than the American style, but combined with
breezy writing the effect on a reader is an unnecessary wobbliness
about facts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the conceit of this book _ the ``Darwin's ghost''
theme. It is a little misleading. Happily, Jones does not walk in
Darwin's footsteps or retrace the voyage of the Beagle. That would
get old fast. He properly honors Darwin throughout the book, but
his republication of Darwin's chapter summaries and recapitulation
seem contrived. ``Origin'' is readily available (even on the Net).
Unannotated chunks of it do little good in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Where Jones is especially good is in a quick putdown of some of
the wilder claims of sociobiology. ``Evolution is a political sofa
that molds itself into the buttocks of the last to sit upon it,''
he notes. Marxists and ultra-capitalists have both seized on it at
times. So, too, have agenda-driven scientists and journalists. In a
whack at the all-in-our-genes school, he says, ``Sexual fidelity or
promiscuity seems, according to taste, the natural thing to do;
families are often a joy, and patriotism arouses some, but we do
not need natural selection to tell us why.''
</P>
<P>
   If Darwin had a ghost _ a free-floating post-biological soul _
it would enjoy that defense of his theory against the latest crop
of misusers.

MIAMI RELATIVES OF ELIAN GONZALEZ TAKE BATTLE TO WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Irate Republicans joined Elian Gonzalez's Miami
relatives Sunday in accusing federal authorities of lying, breaking
the law, and collaborating with Cuban President Fidel Castro, as an
already divisive controversy began expanding into a wider and more
vituperative dispute.
</P>
<P>
   US officials adamantly denied every allegation and suggested
that Elian's relatives were the ones distorting the truth. The
officials insisted that, after months of unrewarded patience and
fruitless negotiations, they'd been left with no choice but to send
armed Immigration and Naturalization Service agents to gain custody
of the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened Sunday was not the rule of law. . . It was an
abuse of power, and it was a violent abuse of power,'' said
Republican Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire. He sponsored a news
conference on Capitol Hill at which anguished members of the
Florida branch of the Gonzalez family and their supporters called
Attorney General Janet Reno a liar, portrayed President Clinton as
a draft-dodging flag-burner, and questioned whether the government
had altered photographs to make it appear that Elian was happy to
be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``An enforcement action like this is a frightening event,'' INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner acknowledged on CBS's ``Face the
Nation.'' But she added, ``This was a last resort.'' Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' said every effort was made to reach an agreement with the
Miami relatives but ``they would agree to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on all sides of the issue flooded the television news
programs on Easter, alternately leveling angry accusations and
defending themselves, as Elian and his father spent a second quiet
day together in guest quarters at Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington, D.C. As they had a day earlier, the Miami family tried
to enter the air force base Sunday to see the boy or arrange a
meeting with the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but they were again
denied entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally they have some time together, some space together,
some privacy together, some silence around them so that the circus
atmosphere and that environment down in Miami (are) no longer
inflicted upon this boy,'' said Gregory Craig, the father's
attorney, on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Elian's forced removal from his great-uncle's
home, months of debate about whether he should remain in this
country were rapidly supplanted by scathing personal attacks _
mainly by GOP members of Congress, but also by some Democrats _
against Reno and Clinton. The critics contended that US officials
had not bargained in good faith to peacefully transfer the child to
his father, and that the INS had used excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders asked for congressional investigations of the
matter, regardless of what happens in the courts or between the
Gonzalez family in Florida and Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a frightening event, that American citizens now can
expect that the executive branch on their own can decide on whether
to raid a home,'' said the third-ranking leader in the House, GOP
whip Tom DeLay of Texas. DeLay, who said he was ``sickened'' by the
raid, implied that the INS had broken the law because he said it
hadn't gotten a court order for the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department and INS officials explicitly denied that
allegation. The officials cited several agency and judicial
authorizations, and said they had obtained a search warrant as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Republican leaders lambasted the Clinton
administration for Elian's seizure, and some _ along with members
of the Miami family _ asserted that Reno and the president, perhaps
operating through Craig, were deliberately taking sides with
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans who spoke out were majority leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi, Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch of
Utah, and the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Texas
Governor George W. Bush. Lott said that when he learned of the
armed operation in Little Havana, ``my first thought was that this
could only happen in Castro's Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a Democrat sometimes mentioned as
a possible vice presidential prospect, said Clinton had promised
him personally that Elian would not be taken in the nighttime.
Graham said on ABC's ``This Week'' that he didn't know whether the
president had been aware that subordinates were breaking that
commitment, but Graham clearly sounded upset by the government's
actions _ especially by what he described as the ``excessive
force'' employed to take the boy and by the ``insensitivity'' of
carrying out the operation during Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even as bad reviews like those seemed likely to extend the
drama's life on the political stage, lawyers for Elian's Miami
relatives indicated that his treatment may also generate additional
and potentially lengthy legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys said they would not only fight during already
scheduled judicial proceedings to keep the boy in the United
States, but also were considering filing suit against the federal
government for the aggressive way in which the child was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters of the Miami relatives said the federal
authorities didn't abide by legal procedures for such a raid, such
as knocking first and identifying themselves clearly. US officials
strongly denied that, maintaining that every aspect of the
operation had gone by the book.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most damning accusations were that the agents pointed
their rifles at people in the house and threatened to shoot them if
they didn't cooperate, and that the pictures distributed Saturday
of Elian smiling broadly next to his father had somehow been
altered. The critics also continued to deride the government's
explanation for an armed assault _ that it had received reports
that people in or outside the house may have had weapons _ saying
there was no evidence to support that.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner, among others, categorically rejected the assertions
about the pointed rifles and the phony photographs, and said the
INS would have been derelict to send unarmed forces into a
potentially explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reality, the vastly differing pictures painted by
the two sides demonstrated just how far apart they remain about
virtually every aspect of the controversy. As many people continued
to suggest Sunday that Elian would benefit if his feuding family
members could get together to smooth the transition for him, the
degree of rancor between the two sides made it difficult to see how
that could happen anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who was described as angry and upset with
his Miami relatives, refused to meet with them or to permit them to
see his son. And his cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, who continues to
depict herself as Elian's surrogate mother, lashed out at Juan
Miguel during the family's news conference on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman who rescued Elian from the sea
five months ago _ and who, in the photo that has come to define the
raid in Little Miami, is seen clutching the boy as an INS agent
points his rifle in their direction _ offered a scathing
description of Clinton during the same news conference. Saying his
own father had fought in World War II and Korea, Dalrymple added,
sobbing: ``You, Mr. President, burned the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Other family members and one of their attorneys also spoke at
the event. But Marisleysis, clearly angry and distraught, dominated
it with an angry description of what she said had happened Saturday
morning and with personal attacks on the people she deemed
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Reno and apparently alluding to the fact that the
attorney general has never been married, the 21-year-old woman
said, ``You still don't know what being a mother is.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, who said an INS agent had held a rifle to
her chest and threated to kill her, wept as she maintained that
``Elian cannot be without me'' and pleaded for public condemnation
of Saturday's action.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the raid's immediate aftermath, however, most
Americans appeared to support the government. A poll conducted
Saturday and released Sunday by Cable News Network and the Gallup
Organization showed that respondents approved of Elian's physical
removal from his relatives' home by 57 to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent said that the boy should return to Cuba with
his father, while 27 percent replied that he should remain with his
relatives in this country. And 54 percent said the government had
done all it could to resolve the dispute without using force,
compared to 30 percent who disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   While all those statistics presumably pleased US officials, one
other result indicated critics may win some support: Just 36
percent said federal authorities used the right amount of force to
get Elian, while 40 percent answered ``too much.'' The telephone
survey of 613 adults had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

MA TAKES A NEW `APPALACHIAN JOURNEY' FOR YOUNG AUDIENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every record Yo-Yo Ma makes is a bestseller, but some of them
sell better than others. One of his greatest hits is ``Appalachia
Waltz,'' which Sony Classical released five years ago. Now the
cellist has followed it up with a sequel, joining fiddler Mark
O'Connor and bassist Edgar Meyer again for ``Appalachian Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   The first live performance of ``Appalachia Waltz'' was at a
benefit concert for Young Audiences of Massachusetts in 1995 _ the
concert took place prior to the recording sessions. Now Ma,
O'Connor, and Meyer perform ``Appalachian Journey'' at another
benefit for Young Audiences _ the 11th benefit in Cambridge, Mass.
he has played for the organization since 1988, and, for the time
being, the last.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent phone conversation, Ma said, ``In terms of
regularity, this will be my last Young Audiences benefit for a
while, but in terms of my heart, Young Audiences will always be
there. Over the last dozen years Young Audiences has grown so much
_ when I started playing these benefits, the budget was about
$300,000, but now, this year, it is up to $1 million. Young
Audiences programs reach 50,000 kids every year, in 600 schools in
every part of the state; the organization puts on more than 2,400
music, dance, and theater programs a year. There were only 900
programs when I started.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma first heard of Young Audiences when he was a student at
Harvard and living in Leverett House. Later Ma's wife, Jill Horner,
joined the board of Young Audiences. ``She's been the person who
has led the effort in terms of my participation,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Ma has always tried to do something unsual for the benefit
concert. He has appeared in recitals with pianists Judith Gordon
and Peter Serkin. He has played with vocalist Bobby McFerrin;
violinists Pamela Frank, Joseph Swenson, Lynn Chang, and Lucy
Stoltzman; the Amaryllis String Quartet and members of the Orion
String Quartet; clarinetist Richard Stoltzman; and the New
York-Buenos Aires Connection in a collaboration on a tango program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a kind of history of my seminal friendships,'' Ma
says of these concerts. ``For example, I admired Peter Serkin for
years and years but never dared to talk to him, there on his own
mountain, so our Young Audiences benefit was our first concert
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma sounds particularly happy to be rounding things off with Mark
O'Connor and Edgar Meyer again. ``I remember after our last concert
of the `Appalachia Waltz' tour _ it was at Cornell University in
Ithaca, New York _ and we all absolutely felt we would like to try
to do something else together. So here we are again. The way Mark
talks about it, he says, when we first got together we were three
voices, and now there are four voices _ we've added the voice of
the group. We feel secure enough about working together to have the
nerve to invite some of our other friends to participate, so James
Taylor and Alison Krauss appear on the album with us.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a special focus to the album, a family focus. ``James
wrote a piece called `Benjamin' for his son, which we all loved. So
Mark wrote a piece for Emily, my daughter, and Edgar wrote a piece
for his son George, and then Alison wrote a slumber song. There's a
subtheme of family on the album which is completely appropriate for
Young Audiences. Family is what all of us believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma's own children are growing up _ his son Nicholas is 16 (``Can
you believe it?'') and Emily is 14, and both are away at school.
``We've found the right place for each of them for their particular
interests and characters,'' Ma says, ``and it all seems to be
working. But it's so sad to be getting towards the time when they
will be leaving home for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma's other projects include his collaboration with the composer
Bright Sheng to explore the music of the ``Silk Road,'' the
historic trade route than ran between the Roman Empire and China.
``Tanglewood has been very generous in providing us with space, and
at the end of June and the beginning of July we will have a lot of
composers from Mongolia, Central Asia _ all the way west to
Lebanon. We have commissioned about 16 pieces and the composers are
coming. We will rehearse the music that has come in and see where
we're going to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ma has completed a second baroque album with Ton
Koopman, and he would very much like to record the ``Goldberg''
variations by contemporary composers that he played at his Symphony
Hall concert earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, even a superstar like Ma has been affected by the
crisis in the record industry. ``Now all the companies are global,
which in some ways is more effective, and in other ways less
effective. I've always thought it would be great to be able to do
more things locally, to inform people about the wonderful things
that happen right here, but I've never gotten a positive answer.
`It won't work,' I'm always told, but I'm still very up for ideas
on how to do things that should be done locally. It would be
wonderful to show that something like this could work. Obviously
some things you do nationally and internationally, that's the
nature of the beast, but it would be better if we could do other
things in other ways, so that the music could speak the way it
should, so it can find its own right level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma is very conscious of his dual life as an international artist
and a local resident. He loves traveling (``I am doing what I
believe in, and I love being a guest in other communities; somehow
it works'') but he also loves community and community building.
``I've been talking with the stage director Peter Sellars a lot
lately about what he's doing in Adelaide, Australia, and I'm
learning a lot about what it takes to build community from those
conversations. What I admire about Peter is that he talks things
through, and then he goes and does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma has supported Young Audiences through benefits that raise
money for its activities. But he has also worked more directly and
actively with young people. ``I'm really proud of the little bit I
did with `Mr. Rogers' and `Sesame Street.' Kids see a five-minute
thing in a world that belongs to them; you are a guest in their
world. But somehow it connects. They bug their parents about
playing an instrument until their parents relent _ often the
parents have no idea where this is coming from. And then the kids
will go through hoops to get to a concert and then line up
afterwards for an autograph because they want another kind of
connection with this world. Music has touched their special,
personal world in a private, direct, and fascinating way.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ma ends this string of benefit concerts, Horner is leaving
the board of Young Audiences. ``They have a fabulous person running
the organization now in Harold Berman,'' Ma says, ``and under his
leadership it has grown tremendously. They're in great shape, so
this seems a good moment to hand things over. That's what it's all
about.''

RESHOOTING THE SEX PISTOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many filmmakers get to revisit their past by doing a second
movie about the same subject?
</P>
<P>
   British director Julien Temple, 45, didn't plan it this way.
Twenty-one years ago, he directed the Sex Pistols
pseudo-documentary ``The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle,'' a project
shepherded by the band's former manager Malcolm McLaren and made
without the active participation of the band members, who had split
up the previous year. Temple is back now with ``The Filth and the
Fury,'' a Pistols documentary told from the surviving members'
point of view, with singer Johnny Rotten (ne John Lydon) and
guitarist Steve Jones serving as prime narrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a sudden, kind-of, `My God, we've got to make
another film about the Sex Pistols!''' says Temple, though he
admits ``it is a strange thing to do. You're not really meantto
film that same subject again. Other people are supposed to do the
remake. But, in some ways, what you're not meant to do is often the
best thing to do, as it turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and The Fury'' is a trip through the time tunnel, a
quick jolt back to 1976-77, when punk rock raged in England and the
Sex Pistols were its most notorious purveyors, the wiliest of
antagonists as devil-may-care court jesters. Plus _ and this is at
the root of it all _ they wrote snarling, hook-packed songs that
captured the ethos of desperation and disillusionment among British
working-class youth at the time. They seized the day; they seized
the zeitgest.
</P>
<P>
   Why go back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wasn't banging on doors trying to get the film
made,'' says Temple. ``It was a chance meeting with John Lydon at a
restaurant in LA that opened the way for me working with him again.
This was back in the early '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   They rebonded, agreed to do the documentary. Lydon, who hates
McLaren (and won a lawsuit against him in the '90s, regaining Sex
Pistols rights and royalties), loathed ``Swindle,'' just as he
detested Alex Cox's ``Sid &AMP; Nancy.'' He believed the latter film
glorified Vicious's drug abuse and the former was a conceit of
McLaren's massive ego and self-serving imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Temple has a different twist. `` `The Great Rock 'n' Roll
Swindle' was a very deliberate and provocative film,'' he says,
from his home in Somerset, England. ``It was designed to annoy and
confuse the fans who had become total idol worshippers of the Sex
Pistols in the way people had worshipped Rod Stewart in the early
'70s.'' The film presented the Pistols as a McLaren creation with
him as a master puppeteer cagily staging one uproar after another,
the better of which to play into the pliable media's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Swindle,' '' says Temple, was ``something to deflate the
aura of pop stardom . . . unlike most pop films commissioned by
bands, `A Hard Day's Night' or whatever, where they're basically
selling lovable teddy bears. With all the mythologizing that's gone
on about the Pistols, in some circles it's been taken as a kind of
literal, truthful presentation of the situation, which it was never
meant to be. This is a truer film, but it doesn't replace the other
film. It complements it.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple realized there were many reels of unseen live footage
housed in a huge London film warehouse called the Vault. He
excavated them, he says; they weren't on a shelf but ``in a corner
on the floor, film canisters spilling film out.'' Somehow, this is
metaphorically appropriate. Initially, he wasn't sure what kind of
footage he needed to make the documentary, but then he realized he
had more than he needed, including scenes shot on the streets of
London. Temple weaves the band and its music into the tapestry of
'70s social upheaval, in a country with high unemployment among
youth about to celebrate its Silver Jubilee. In capturing that mood
and presenting the Sex Pistols as reflective of it, Temple sees the
film as ``not really a documentary, as it is more an architect's
film.'' It's not, he says, a broad look at punk _ its history, its
competing bands and fractious relationships. ``It's produced by
(the Pistols) and made by myself and it's very much from within.
The text is not trying to be a kind of `objective' TV-style
documentary where you get all the opposing guys and a lot of
talking heads who agree to differ, and you somehow make things
reach `the truth.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rotten says he participated in the film because
the production company, England's FilmFour, ``gave us the freedom
to tell the Sex Pistols story as it really was. It's the band's
chance to set the record straight. We don't praise ourselves or wax
lyrical about our influence. We just tell the truth. For the last
20 years, people have exaggerated and blown up the Sex Pistols into
something they never were. I think the truth is far more shocking
and more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With their first two singles, ``Anarchy in the UK'' and ``God
Save the Queen,'' the Pistols showed they possessed an aura of
nihilism. ``Your future dream is a sharpie's scheme!'' railed
Rotten in ``Anachy in the UK.'' But what was _ and still is _
misunderstood is their humor, their celebration of life in all its
squalor. ``The Filth and the Fury'' brings that to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nihilism is really a weapon to point out such
things,'' says Temple. ``You can't remove the politics and the
attitudes and ideas that came from that band from the music. If the
music had been no good, it wouldn't have worked at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a productive, dysfunctional marriage _ bassist-songwriter
Glen Matlock's melodic craftsmanship, Jones's rudimentary guitar
skills but ferocious attack, Cook's rock-ribbed solidity, and
Rotten's lyrical genius, scabrous vocal style, and electifying
stage presence. All in all, the Pistols were provocative and
volatile, and all this comes across on screen.
</P>
<P>
   What is rather shadowy are the Pistols themselves _ that is, the
fortysomething former Pistols. They are shot in silhouette. ``It
was to spare the world any more wrinkly old rock stars in
armchairs,'' says the director. ``I can't think of a more boring
and overcooked image, the old rock star reminiscing about the good
old days. I also had some kind of Witness Protection Program idea
in there. But most importantly, I think by removing another kind of
mediation, you can take the audience there more directly.'' And
that allows, at some level, for the band to remain forever young.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Matlock was sacked, Vicious, a good friend of Rotten's,
joined the band despite his inability to play bass. He was given
his moniker as an ironic jest. (The man born John Simon Ritchie was
weedy and weak.) But the ante for outrage was upped. Vicious, for
instance, would sport a T-shirt bearing a swastika. ``It was the
pure element of shock,'' worn to get a rise, not to promote Nazism,
says Temple.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Vicious's notoriety, says Temple, ``I think if people
met Sid, they'd be very fond of him. He was a very engaging
character, a real presence. He was young and pushing it to the
edge, but he was a far more witty, funny, intelligent guy'' than
people think.
</P>
<P>
   But Temple uses an infamous interview clip from the Sex
Pistols-on-tour movie, ``D.O.A.,'' that features a drugged Vicious
nodding out and his sycophantic girlfriend Nancy Spungen (whom
Vicious was later accused of murdering) poking and taunting him.
``When he became a junkie, he became a huge junkie,'' says Temple.
``It's not a happy thing to witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about this film is it's about people who went
through this kind of media chemotherapy, and only three of them
(Rotten, Jones, Cook) got out and the three that got out are still
very scarred by it. I think it probably has defined every minute of
the rest of their lives.'' Temple says he puts the number at three
because Matlock was booted midway through and essentially ``backed
out.'' (Matlock did, however, join the Pistols on a 1996 reunion
tour.)
</P>
<P>
   Temple has not been inactive between Pistols documentaries. He
has directed music videos and British TV projects. In feature
films, he helmed 1985's ``Absolute Beginners'' and ``Earth Girls
Are Easy'' in 1988, a comedy starring then-unknowns Jim Carrey and
Geena Davis. His ``Vigo,'' a love story inspired by the '20s French
film director Jean Vigo, is awaiting US distribution. For the BBC
he is wrapping up ``Pandemonium,' a film starring Robert Carlyle
(``Trainspotting,'' ``Angela's Ashes''), based on the friendship
between 18th-century poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William
Wordsworth. A period piece. Sound a bit high-brow? Temple laughs.
No, he says, the relationship between the two was just as
contentious as anything between the Sex Pistols.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
 
!!! 1/2 ``Croupier'' An absorbing, unpredictable little minefield
of a crime movie from Britain. Clive Owens's slightly sinister
croupier wants to just cut the cards and stay cool, but is drawn
into the expectations of a couple of women he meets while dodging
his con-man dad. (Unrated) 
 
!!! ``East Is East'' Om Puri sputters entertainingly as a Pakistani
dad trying to keep the lid on his seven kids in a Manchester
suburb. Unable to see that they're just replicating his own
youthful rebellion, he's left wondering why they insist on eating
skillets of pork and chasing English girls at discos instead of
hanging out at the mosque. (R) 
 
!!! 1/2 ``The Filth and the Fury'' Director Julien Temple's second
Sex Pistols rockumentary is presented from the band's point of
view, not from the manipulative manager's, as was 1980's ``The
Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.'' Temple links the social upheavel of
England in 1976-77 to the Pistols' vitriolic and nihilistic punk
rock; he also depicts the joy of sticking it to the establishment,
be it media, government, or the music biz. Temple captures the buzz
of a time before rage was codified _ and the music mattered.
(Unrated) (Jim Sullivan) 
 
!!! 1/2 ``Love &AMP; Basketball'' A breakthrough film about a woman
basketball player and a breakout performance by Sanaa Lathen as a
spirited player who wonders why she can't shoot for the same career
as her neighbor and love interest, Omar Epps. Both are warm and
appealing and you root for them to make it work in this film that
attaches as much importance to hearts as to hoops. (PG-13) 
 
!! ``Me Myself I'' A lightweight vehicle driven to watchability by
Australia's Rachel Griffiths in a dual role when her career woman
worried about missing the personal-fulfillment boat finds herself
plunked into the marriage she regretted not having entered into 13
years ago. (R) 
 
! 1/2 ``Gossip'' James Marsden, Lena Headey, and Norman Reedus play
college roommates who spark a nasty rumor as an academic exercise,
with disastrous results. Yet another
jaded-20-somethings-behaving-badly film with a contrived plot and
hunks and dolls masquerading as characters, ``Gossip'' offers
nothing more than the average daytime soap opera except its
pretensions. (R) (Loren King) 
 
!! 1/2 ``U-571'' A slick action-packed throwback to World War II
submarine thrillers that comes up short on character definition and
relies inordinately on the Germans' bad aim. They never hit the
endangered sub with their torpedoes or depth charges, while we
never miss. But the film's technical experts, many of whom worked
on ``Das Boot,'' are in great form, and Jonathan Mostow's
jackhammer pacing keeps us from dwelling on the flaws. (PG-13)

`RAVELSTEIN' IS LESS A NOVEL THAN A PORTRAIT OF FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
RAVELSTEIN 
By Saul Bellow 
Viking Penguin. 233 pp. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saul Bellow's crankish, indomitable wit has never bothered to
wear much camouflage in his fiction. Most of his protagonists are
antiheroes whose alienation is part of their survival package: Cast
out by the piety of former wives or the idiocies of mainstream
(often gentile) culture, they savor their triumphs not in spite of
their disaffection, but because of it. Born of modernity and
eternally suffering within it, Bellow's dangling man would scarcely
know what to do with his feet on terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   Bellow's long and vast affection for the social theorist Allan
Bloom, who died in 1992 at age 62, fits well within this model of
discontent. Colleagues at the University of Chicago, the novelist
and the political philosopher were finely matched _ each in his own
way breathtakingly intelligent and wickedly unruly in a cerebral
street fight. Though Bloom was younger than Bellow by two decades,
he played mentor to his elder when it came to ancient Greece,
contemporary politics, or the mating rites of shared acquaintances.
He urged Bellow to train his intellectual sights on biography;
Bellow, in turn, urged Bloom to popularize his round-table
teachings. The result was Bloom's 1987 bestseller, ``The Closing of
the American Mind,'' which sought to pinpoint an intellectual
crisis in American culture without ever getting winded. For sheer
Renaissance-man chutzpah, it is little wonder that either fellow so
admired the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelstein'' is Bellow's fictionalized homage to Bloom and to
their friendship; it is also being touted as the first full-fledged
novel Bellow has given us in more than a decade. But ``Ravelstein''
is hardly a novel, at least in the sense that Bellow himself has
defined the form over the past half-century. It is instead a
loosely woven portrait, sometimes pleasant and sometimes
irritating, of an intellectual wild man whom Bellow loved. The
names have been changed _ the dying professor is Abe Ravelstein;
the author-biographer telling his story is a writer called Chick _
which I suppose qualifies the work as a roman a clef. That, of
course, is often a Frenchified way of labeling gossip as
literature, which Bloom would be the first to point out.
</P>
<P>
   The character of Ravelstein, a man huge in size and appetite, is
someone whose charms and eccentricities are certainly worthy of
record: At a colossal 6 feet 6 inches, he dresses in $5,000 suits,
shaves his immense head, brings adoring students over to his
art-drenched apartment to partake of pizza and the Chicago Bulls or
Maria Callas. HIV-positive and entering the realm of physical
decline, he falls prey to one infection after another, then brings
his great bulk back into fighting position and flies off to France.
He chain-smokes in front of his doctors, fusses over buying a new
$80,000 BMW for his partner, Nikki, operates a phone system of
command central through which Paris, New York, and Washington,
D.C., check in several times a day. (Most of these calls are from
Ravelstein's former students, who are now running the world.
Reporting in on the Gulf War or myriad shenanigans on Capitol Hill,
they're more likely to quote Machiavelli or Shakespeare than they
are Deep Throat.)
</P>
<P>
   He loves rumors as well as Platonic truths, in other words, and
his immense presence _ his mind, his attitudes, his hubris _ has
clearly dazzled the friend who seeks to deliver Ravelstein beyond
the grave. ``There were two people in Paris who knew him
intimately,'' Chick tells us, ``And three on this side of the
Atlantic. I was one of them.'' And so he must play Boswell to
Ravelstein's Johnson: Ravelstein has asked him to tell his story
after he is gone. (The professor's expressed altruistic motives,
which range from providing Chick with an intellectual purpose to
liberating him from the abyss, seem less clear than Ravelstein's
wish to be remembered.) In fulfilling his duties, Chick has
wandered through the fields of memory where both men walked: the
rigorous intellectual debates they shared (about God, Jewishness, a
moral life); the oddball neighbors and friends and even enemies
they had in common. And for all his cool analytic powers,
Ravelstein also emerges as a man whose intuition is precise in
matters of the heart. He sees through the pastoral glaze of
hypocrisy coating Chick's marriage to a chaos physicist, Vela, long
before Chick himself is ready to give up those illusions. When
Chick marries the kinder, younger Rosamund, one of Ravelstein's
former students, the professor is begrudging only because he didn't
have the sense to see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   By simple force of its unfettered devotion, many elements of
``Ravelstein'' are touching, and Bellow's raw intelligence is
always worth following through many a thicket and bramble. But the
unfortunate fact of this book is that much of the thundering beauty
of Bellow's voice is missing. In assuming the ironic-acolyte
position of Chick to Ravelstein, he has eclipsed his own narrative
skills and authorial presence, delivering instead a story that is
too often rambling, repetitive, and, God help us, dull.
</P>
<P>
   Things perk up considerably when the ramblings revert back to
the narrator's story. After Ravelstein's death, Chick and Rosamund
decide to leave behind their mournful Chicago neighborhood for a
new chapter of life in New England. Relocated from Midwest to East,
they head to Saint Martin for vacation, where Chick ingests a cigua
toxin from infected fish that nearly kills him. The last portion of
``Ravelstein'' (which also mirrors Bellow's life) follows this
frightening, sometimes hallucinatory journey through illness and
airports and the ICU. Hovering throughout is that Bellovian
consciousness that sees the jokes in religious belief and the
spiritual essence of humor; alongside him is the character of
Rosamund, who _ saintly and sensible at once _ nearly manages to
steal the show from the two men this book is purportedly about.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly the first time Bellow has infused fiction with
facts from his own life; one of his great novels, ``Humboldt's
Gifts,'' is drawn from the life of the poet Delmore Schwartz. But
there he usurped a piece of real life and transformed it; in
``Ravelstein,'' the symphonic possibility that ought to govern the
story within is rarely in sight. At one moment, Chick explains
something about himself to Rosamund _ about how he struggled with
the problem of grasping a particularly unpleasant truth about
someone he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't know where to begin?'' she asks him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I had a Jewish life to lead in the American language,''
he tells her, ``and that's not a language that's helpful with dark
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those brief words are pure Bellow: confident, laconic, and
elegant, hinting at something of great dimension. However heartfelt
and elegiac, ``Ravelstein'' may recall such Bellovian depths, but
rarely ventures there itself.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
DUMB MONEY: Adventures of A Day Trader. 
By Joey Anuff and Gary Wolf. 
Random House. 219 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joey Anuff was already a card-carrying member of the Internet
community when the revelation hit him. ``Thousands of unremarkable
people have already become ultra-rich. Last year I finally woke up
to the big question: Why not me?''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Anuff began his career as a day trader. ``Dumb
Money,'' is a short, generally enjoyable account of his experience,
written with Gary Wolf. Anuff didn't get ultra-rich. He was only
modestly successful. But he is an ideal guide for a journey through
the world of day trading. He is smart, funny, cynical, and doesn't
take anything too seriously, including himself.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading, we quickly learn, has little in common with
investing. Day traders frequently have no information about the
companies in which they invest. Anuff got annual reports in the
mail and never opened them. Why do research on a company you may
own for a few minutes?
</P>
<P>
   The key in this field is speed. You want to jump into a stock on
its way up or down _ it doesn't matter which _ and then jump out
again before the direction changes. It comes as no surprise to find
out that video-game players and airline pilots do well in this
business.
</P>
<P>
   There is some method to the madness. Like other shrewd
investors, Anuff quickly recognizes that Wall Street often
overreacts to news, especially bad news. If Company A reports
disappointing earnings, Wall Street may punish the stock
unmercifully, then have a change of heart and correct its mistake.
A skillful trader can anticipate that pattern and make some money .
</P>
<P>
   Experience also teaches Anuff that when positive news gets
reported on CNBC, the all-day business television network, the
stock in question gets a brief bounce. A good trader can buy the
stock when the news first gets reported over the wires, wait for
CNBC to announce it, and make a buck or two before the momentum
fades. ``My goal is to beat the crowd by a few seconds,'' writes
Anuff.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a few good trades and a successful investment in eBay,
the online auction house, Anuff begins to think he has the right
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling doesn't last long. The second half of the book is a
tale of disillusionment that reads like a love affair gone sour.
Anuff, wearing his journalist's hat, goes out to meet some of the
superstars of the day-trading world, people whose legendary skills
are celebrated on a variety of cyber-bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these heroes are quite impressive, but Anuff becomes
suspicious when he learns that most of them actually earn their
living teaching other people how to become day traders. He writes
of Anthony, one of the stars: ``Anthony has discovered that the
best business in the bull market is helping other people get into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anuff's bubble deflates even further when he reads the history
of some of the great debacles in investment history like the Great
Crash of 1929 or the South Sea Bubble. The lessons of history are
irrefutable: In good times even dummies can make money; in bad
times, even smart investors get wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A circus chimp could have doubled his money buying the stocks
I was playing,'' Anuff ruefully concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Anuff's one great coup _ his investment in eBay _ turns out
not to have anything to do with day trading at all. Like Fidelity's
Peter Lynch, who advised investors to buy what they know, Anuff
buys eBay stock because he uses the site and recognizes that it has
great potential. A smart investor could have had the same insight
about the automobile or Wal-Mart. The Internet generation didn't
invent intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dumb Money'' has a few slow spots. Day trading involves a lot
of technology, and Anuff tells you more than you want to know about
the mechanics of the business. At times, you may feel that you are
plowing through an owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, however, the book nicely captures the intensity _
and ultimately the insanity _ of day trading. ``Dumb Money'' should
be required reading for anyone contemplating a career in this
field. Like those grisly prison movies they show to juvenile
delinquents, it should have the effect of scaring off those who
think day trading represents a risk-free, effort-free path to
success.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to stop dreaming about getting rich. Just don't
assume you are going to get there as a day trader.

MALARIA EXACTS HIGH ECONOMIC TOLL ON AFRICA, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Malaria hurts African economies more than has been
recognized but could be better controlled for relatively little
money, according to a new study to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Harvard Center for International Development
and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will be
presented in Nigeria at the first conference at which African heads
of state will meet to discuss malaria, which kills more than 1
million people a year, most of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the effects of malaria on 27 African economies between
1965 and 1990, the study concluded that the disease cut one
percentage point a year from the annual growth rates of those
economies. If malaria had been eliminated in 1965, the annual gross
domestic product of Africa would now be $400 billion rather than
$300 billion, the study estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The study's economic models, according to Jeffrey Sachs,
director of the Harvard center, took into account more than the
costs of treatment and losses associated with death. They also
estimated the losses from tourists and foreign investors who avoid
malaria-prone countries, the damage done by large numbers of sick
children missing school and the increase in population and
impoverishment when parents have extra children because they know
some will die.

   In most affected countries, the disease crosses class lines.
``It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor _ your chances of
catching it are high,'' said Nils Delaire, president of the Global
Health Council, a participant in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The conference this week in Abuja, Nigeria, is sponsored by the
World Health Organization and will draw together U.N. agencies, the
World Bank, Western donors and the heads of 20 African countries in
a Roll Back Malaria campaign that hopes to halve deaths from
malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The chief weapon the sponsors endorse is a simple one: bed nets
treated with insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they favor more spraying to kill mosquito larvae,
education of rural people in the use of simple blood tests and
cheap drugs to keep patients alive until they can reach doctors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nets alone could cut the disease by half, but only 2 percent of
all African children sleep under them. Each $8 spent on prevention
adds about a year of healthy life to an African, according to Ann
Mills, one of the London School analysts who worked on the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``World spending on malaria control and research for Africa is
maybe 10 cents per case per year,'' said Sachs. ``It's quite
dreadful. World Bank lending for malaria is de minimus. The big
pharmaceutical companies see it as a disease of the very poor, so
they never view it as much of an investment priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, many malaria-prone countries have per capita
incomes of less than $300 and health budgets too small for ``these
very reasonable interventions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sachs suggested that Western nations could significantly cut the
disease by spending $1 billion a year on malaria. The U.S. share of
that, he said, would be 75 cents per American.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where we're enjoying riches beyond what was
imagined 20 years ago, we can afford to do more than we do,'' Sachs
said. He might even, he said, dare to also suggest $1 billion for
AIDS and $1 billion for tuberculosis, for a total of $2.25 per
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Americans would readily come up with $10 per person if
they believed it was cost-effective,'' he said. ``And bed nets
aren't going to end up in a bank account in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is offering tax breaks of up to $1
billion for any company that invents a malaria vaccine, and the
Gates Foundation, created by the founder of Microsoft, is investing
$250 million in the research.

FRAUD CHARGED IN CANCER CURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOBURN, Mass. _ The nondescript warehouse is a sports supply
store now, but it was in the front lines in the mid-1990s for a
bizarre chapter in the war against cancer, a place where federal
investigators say life-saving research mingled freely with consumer
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the fledgling Private Biologicals Corp. shipped a
promising new cancer drug called LK-200 to doctors and patients in
Mexico, the Bahamas, and the United States. Independent researchers
were excited about LK-200's prospects because in some cases it
shrank tumors by boosting the body's own defenses without causing
severe toxic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But the career of LK-200 ended abruptly in 1995 when federal
agents raided the plant in a small industrial park and shut it
down. Private Biologicals ran an elaborate scam to rip off
investors, they contended, through a company run by a phony doctor
and employing an offshore address to evade federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five years later, US Attorney Donald K. Stern has filed
criminal charges against two men in connection with Private
Biologicals. Thomas R. Theodore of Sandwich allegedly defrauded
investors of $2 million and misled doctors and patients by
illegally distributing a drug that was not approved for human use
in the United States and was made in an unsanitary, unlicensed
facility.
</P>
<P>
   A second man, Thomas M. Rodgers Jr. of Atlanta, faces
misdemeanor charges in connection with the drug manufacturing and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the two defendants face fines or imprisonment for
their roles in promoting LK-200, the flashes of anticancer potency
the drug once showed continue to nag scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I am convinced there is something in there,''
says Dr. Charles Dinarello, a former New England Medical Center
researcher who studied LK-200, which he got from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Theodore allegedly misled investors by
saying that LK-200 was produced by a ``highly secret and
proprietary'' process. In fact, the substance, which is derived
from the fluid surrounding human white blood cells grown in the
laboratory, was easy to produce, said the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Dinarello and Dr. James Mier, a cancer researcher at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center who previously studied CT scans of
patients from Mexico treated with LK-200, say they thought Private
Biologicals was trying to develop the drug legally. Unknown to
them, Mier said, the company was sending the drug to the Bahamas _
where it could be legally used _ and then back to the United States
_ where the drug's use was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they wanted to do,'' Mier said recently, ``was
set up a small bunch of clinics in Mexico and the Bahamas and
compete for the alternative medicine market. And they would have
succeeded'' had they not flouted the Food and Drug Administration's
rigorous drug development regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The misbegotten plan is a striking example of how the demand for
cancer drugs by desperate patients can lure unscrupulous
entrepreneurs into taking shortcuts, avoiding the long and costly
drug approval process. Though the FDA's reviews have many critics,
the risk of skirting them is that sick people will put their hopes
in useless or dangerous cures.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear whether the partners at one time planned a
legitimate business. But either way, LK-200 seemed doomed to fail,
according to Ralph Moss, a New York consultant on alternative
medicines. They were treating too many patients not to draw
regulators' attention, yet they were too small to do the research
necessary for FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were skating on thin ice,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of LK-200, say people knowledgeable about the field,
date to work done in the 1970s and 1980s by Ben Papermaster, an
immunologist at the University of Missouri. In animal and human
experiments, Papermaster reported that the fluid from human white
blood cells grown in his laboratory caused an inflammation-like
response when given to patients, and in a few cases shrank tumors.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently under Papermaster's direction that human
experiments were conducted in Mexico, with some success. When the
FDA crackdown came in 1995, colon cancer patient Sara Stone-Alston
of Seattle wrote to Moss defending LK-200. ``It had no side effects
and kept my tumor under control and even seemed to shrink it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   How Private Biologicals, Rodgers, and Theodore became involved
in producing LK-200 is hazy. There appears to have been
disagreement between Private Biologicals and Papermaster, who left
after a short stint as a consultant. He died in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, Rodgers, an Atlanta businessman, was chairman of the
board and majority stockholder. Meanwhile, Theodore, who had been
convicted of mail fraud in 1987 and stripped of his license by the
Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine, was in charge of
the Woburn plant, according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers's attorney, Nick Littlefield, downplayed the charges
against his client, stressing that Rodgers is cooperating with the
government in the case. Unlike Theodore, Rodgers was not charged
with fraud or misleading investors, Littlefield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is charged with . . . technical regulatory misdemeanor
offenses that don't even require specific intent or knowledge,''
said Littlefield, of the law firm Foley, Hoag and Eliot. ``We look
forward to getting the matter resolved promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators portray Theodore as the scientific front
man, falsely presenting himself as a doctor, and illegally using
the mails and Federal Express to ship LK-200 and tout its benefits.
The board said that Theodore did not possess a degree from an
approved medical school, and didn't even have an undergraduate
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore's attorney, John Noonan, said that his client was just
a consultant to Private Biologicals and wasn't on the premises of
the Woburn plant during the times of his alleged criminal
activities. He said that the plant was set up ``by the best minds
in the business,'' including several physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan also said that Theodore has a degree from a medical
school in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding problems for defendants Theodore and Rodgers, a
report on the Internet wrongly linked LK-200 to Dr. Stanislaw
Burzynski, a controversial physician in Texas who has long battled
the federal government over cancer drugs he has developed called
``antineoplastons.'' The Globe reported this erroneous connection
in an earlier article.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, before the 1995 raid, LK-200 had a reputation that was good
enough to attract the attention of serious researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The two physicians at New England Medical Center, Dinarello and
Mier, became interested in the substance in the 1990s after hearing
about the dramatic results in some patients in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Dinarello, an infectious disease specialist who left NEMC in
1995, said he was intrigued by LK-200 because of what it was, a
mixture of immune system chemicals known individually as having
important roles in inflammation, infection, and cancer. In
addition, he said, he saw some photographs of patients treated for
skin cancers with LK-200.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I sat in a room with you and showed you pictures of these
patients'' before and after treatment, ``you'd be impressed,'' he
said. Dinarello, comparing LK-200 to supposedly anticancer
substances found in natural plants, said, ``This drug had a
portfolio far more interesting than some bug juice from the
Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a small delegation from the federal Office of
Alternative Medicine visited a clinic in Monterrey, Mexico, where
results of LK-200 in some patients were presented.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adrienne Fugh-Berman, a physician formerly with the federal
office, recalled that the drug ``looked really promising'' and she
wrote a report to that effect. Shortly afterward, she left the
office, which has been reconstituted as the National Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Mier and Dinarello said that shortly before the Woburn plant was
closed down, the company had brought in consultants, one of them
reportedly a former FDA employee, to tell them what kind of
research data they would need to apply for an Investigational New
Drug permit from the FDA. The permit allows a new drug to be tested
in patients for safety, and then for effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mier, Theodore was dismissed from the company after
some of his alleged misrepresentations were discovered. Of Rodgers,
Mier said, ``I think he was duped. I don't think he was
malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Private Biologicals cast a cloud over research
into LK-200, but, remarkably, a Vienna, Va., company has picked up
on a similar concept.
</P>
<P>
   Cel-Sci Corp. is testing a product called MultiKine, which, like
LK-200, is described as a mixture of lymphokines and cytokines that
stimulate immune responses. Eyal Talor, vice president of research,
said MultiKine is a patented preparation that is similar to LK-200
but is extracted from whole blood.
</P>
<P>
   MultiKine is being tested in several foreign countries,
including Israel, under the new drug permit. The drug has been
injected into patients prior to surgery to remove head and neck
cancers. He said there have been a number of encouraging responses
and that testing will also be done in the United States in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Cel-Sci spokeswoman Daryl Strahl criticized the FDA's ``outdated
rules'' for drug approvals, but she said her company has no
intention of taking any shortcuts. Potential treatments, she said,
have to be studied in scientifically sound and lengthy trials ``to
find out what happens next.''

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIE WAGNER KRENZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back then it was special to go shopping in
downtown San Francisco. My earliest memories were of those
wonderful Saturdays when Mother dressed me in a little coat with
matching hat, white gloves, and black patent Mary Janes (shined
with a dab of salad oil).
</P>
<P>
   Although we sometimes drove, it was easier and more fun to take
the streetcar. It was airy and comfortable and groaned along at
consistent speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The motorman wore a visored cap and tapped a bell on the floor
with his foot. The conductor stood on the back platform and kept a
wary eye for neighborhood boys who tried to steal rides on the
cowcatcher.
</P>
<P>
   We'd trek to various stores, then have lunch _ which was often
chicken a la king in a pastry shell. Best of all was an ice cream
soda at Haas' Candy Store, Goldberg Bowen or the Golden Pheasant.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed and I became a teen-ager, then an adult, and Mother
and I shopped throughout the years. Neither of us would have
dreamed of going downtown without hat, gloves, heels and stockings.
We even wore scarves of glassy-eyed furry creatures, and no one
accosted us for our lack of sensitivity. The greatest sartorial
gaffe would have been to wear white shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Service was excellent at a multitude of fine stores, now gone:
I. Magnin, Joseph Magnin, H. Liebes, Ransohoff, Livingstons, Maison
Mendesolle, the White House, the City of Paris, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing gloves was a major operation. A well-groomed
salesperson would position our elbows on a small pillow and smooth
numerous pairs on our waiting fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting hosiery was almost as complicated. A salesperson with
beautiful hands opened box after box to find just the right color.
</P>
<P>
   It would never have occurred to us to carry home that package,
small as it was. Everything was delivered without charge. During
the war years, Mother and I had only one pair of nylons between us,
and we had to make do with those ugly rayon things that took
forever to dry. Panty hose had yet to be invented.
</P>
<P>
   The nicer stores were not cluttered with racks and stacks of
clothes. We waited on little settees as the saleslady brought
garments for our inspection, then brought more to replace the
rejects.
</P>
<P>
   We had many favorite places for lunch _ some more elegant than
others _ Old Poodle Dog, Normandy Lane, El Prado, Bardelli, Blum's,
the St. Francis. An all-time favorite was Townsend's on Geary for
creamed spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we would drive downtown. When it was time to go home,
we walked to the Union Square underground garage and gave the
attendant our ticket. We sat comfortably on padded benches until he
brought up our car and helped us inside.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has always been a cosmopolitan city with different
languages heard on every corner, but it used to be that only
tourists wore shorts and sport shirts when shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Now we see few women in dresses or men in coats and neckties;
almost everyone is casually dressed, and most women wear pants.
White shoes are everywhere.
</P>
<P>

special quality it once had. Although the streets are much the
same, I miss the people who once walked there _ especially the lady
who walked with me.

   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14. Those who have, over the past

   As the Elian Gonzalez soap opera drags on daily, Miami's Cuban
exiles are increasingly, utterly immovable on one point: they will
not deal with Cuba while Fidel Castro is in power. He is the devil,
and six-year-old Elian their saint. How misguided they are. The
Economist yields to nobody when it comes to contempt for Castro,
but to use Elian for propaganda purposes, as the exiles now are, is
exactly the tactic Castro would choose. He is getting enormous
mileage out of this case. It shows, even better than the trade
embargo can, how vindictive and inhumane the United States can be. &QL;

   The rest of the Americas celebrated, or mourned, their

Columbus's landfall. But that meant little to Brazil. Its discovery
by the Portuguese came eight years later, on April 22, 1500, and by
accident, when a fleet bound for India was blown off course.
Brazilians mark that event this weekend, amid much soul-searching
about what makes them unique. After 500 years, it is now high time

   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this election year is the environment. Understandably so. The
vice president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really
deeply, about the planet is well known. On the evidence of his 1992
book-manifesto, ``Earth in the Balance,'' whose second edition
arrives in bookstores this weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day
2000,'' Gore is, in fact, a hypocrite of heroic proportions. His
description of the environmental ``crisis,'' and his way of
thinking about it, could not be more extreme. Is Gore's expounded
hot air contributing to global warming? &QL;

   In most states a retiring president is treated like a returning

   It was not a replay of riotous Seattle, but neither was it a
damp squib. Some 10,000 protesters descended on Washington, D.C.,
last weekend, intent on shutting down the spring meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on April 16 and 17.
Despite a few photographs of students being clobbered, the police
were widely praised for doing a good job of containment. As D.C.
Police Chief Charles Ramsey, seen chatting with demonstrators,
said, ``They're just kids with a cause. God bless 'em. That's what
America is all about.'' &QL;

   Southeast Asia's poor relation, Laos, could be facing a

</P>
<P>
   Fresh on the heels of Vladimir Putin's election last month as
Russia's new president, the American government has wasted no time
in asserting its interests in the oil-rich region of the ex-Soviet
Central Asian republics. It dispatched a series of senior
government officials _ including CIA head George Tennet, FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ to
the region immediately following the Russian election. &QL;

<P>
   Saudis have long accepted their rulers' lavish way of life as
the price for rapid development and relative stability. But Saudi
Arabia's almost limitless reserves of oil are no longer quite
enough to pay for everything _ even with prices at a steep $25 or
so a barrel. With income per person having tumbled from $16,650 in
dear-oil 1981 to $6,526 in cheap-oil 1998, it is becoming painfully
clear that the Saudi regime cannot keep itself and all of its
citizens solvent without a major economic overhaul. &QL;

maintained its aura of 1960s Organization Man. Driving to customer

changed little in decades. Alas, not for much longer. E-business,

   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this election year is the environment. Understandably so. The
vice president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really
deeply, about the planet is well known. On the evidence of his 1992
book-manifesto, ``Earth in the Balance,'' whose second edition
arrives in bookstores this weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day
2000,'' Gore is, in fact, a hypocrite of heroic proportions. His
description of the environmental ``crisis,'' and his way of
thinking about it, could not be more extreme. Is Gore's expounded
hot air contributing to global warming? &QL;

International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on April 16 and 17.
Despite a few photographs of students being clobbered, the police
were widely praised for doing a good job of containment. As D.C.
Police Chief Charles Ramsey, seen chatting with demonstrators,
said, ``They're just kids with a cause. God bless 'em. That's what

   Fresh on the heels of Vladimir Putin's election last month as
Russia's new president, the American government has wasted no time
in asserting its interests in the oil-rich region of the ex-Soviet
Central Asian republics. It dispatched a series of senior
government officials _ including CIA head George Tennet, FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ to
the region immediately following the Russian election. &QL;

   Saudis have long accepted their rulers' lavish way of life as
the price for rapid development and relative stability. But Saudi
Arabia's almost limitless reserves of oil are no longer quite
enough to pay for everything _ even with prices at a steep $25 or
so a barrel. With income per person having tumbled from $16,650 in
dear-oil 1981 to $6,526 in cheap-oil 1998, it is becoming painfully
clear that the Saudi regime cannot keep itself and all of its
citizens solvent without a major economic overhaul. &QL;

<P>
   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent central bank increases interest rates at the first
sign of overheating, before inflation actually takes off. So far
the Federal Reserve has been too lax, and that now makes its task
doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jump in consumer-price inflation _ to 3.7 percent in
March, up from 1.7 percent a year ago _ can be blamed on higher oil
prices. Inflation should drop a bit once these fall out of the
year-on-year figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several optimists still say the March number will turn out to be
a blip caused by special factors. But after a time it becomes
implausible to keep asserting that inflation is subdued if only one
leaves out all the prices that are actually rising.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the ``core'' rate of inflation (excluding volatile
energy and food) is also now creeping up. Plenty of other
indicators suggest that America's economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales jumped by 10 percent in the 12 months to March. GDP
figures out next week are expected to show real growth continuing
at an annual rate of 5-6 percent in the first quarter of this year.
Credit is expanding alarmingly. And the trade and current-account
deficits continue to hit records as rampant domestic demand sucks
in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June the Fed has raised interest rates, in
quarter-point steps, from 4.75 percent to 6 percent. But this
followed a sharp cut in rates in the autumn of 1998 in the wake of
Russia's financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are still only half a point higher than they were
in the summer of 1998. And because inflation has risen, real rates
have actually fallen slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the fact that share prices are still 30 percent higher,
on average, than in August 1998, helping to fuel domestic spending
because consumers feel so much wealthier, and overall financial
conditions are looser today than they were in 1998, despite the
economy's annual average growth since then of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in stock market wealth has been an important
driving force behind consumer spending. From this point of view,
indeed, the recent weakness in equities is welcome. It is certainly
no reason for the Fed to stop pushing up interest rates. A failure
to raise rates would probably cause share prices to surge upwards
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Fed has been too cautious. Each time the markets
have been well prepared for a modest rise, and share prices have
rallied after the Fed has acted, blunting the impact of higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fed officials would have preferred to move faster, but Alan
Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has been more sympathetic to the
idea that the faster productivity growth of the new economy has
significantly increased the economy's safe speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   He is right to detect some evidence of this. But the snag is
that actual demand has increased faster still. It will now be even
harder for the Fed to engineer a soft landing, with growth slowing
smoothly to a sustainable rate.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in inflation suggests that the economy is already
operating well above capacity, so growth will need to be slowed
more sharply to below its trend rate. This increases the risk of a
hard landing, in which output actually declines.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the Fed been too slow to raise interest rates to
prevent inflation from rising, but it has also failed to dispel the
belief of many investors that it is ready to ease immediately after
share prices drop _ as it did after the market fell in both 1987
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a moral hazard that has encouraged investors to
take bigger risks. And it makes it even more important that the Fed
does not flinch from the task of raising interest rates, even if
stock markets remain wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed should therefore raise interest rates by half a point at
its next policy meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years America's economy has enjoyed a virtuous circle.
Rising share prices have lured foreign capital and pushed up the
dollar; this, in turn, has helped to hold down inflation and
interest rates, and so supported share prices.
</P>
<P>
   The risk now is that the circle could turn vicious: if stock
markets tumble, foreigners could flee, pushing the dollar down and
inflation up, leading to further monetary tightening. In such
conditions, rising inflation would leave the Fed with less room to
cut interest rates to protect the economy from a severe stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have, over the past few years, made much of the
Goldilocks economy (neither too hot, nor too cold) should have
remembered that the tale ends with Goldilocks being chased away by
the bears. &QL;

<P>
   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent central bank increases interest rates at the first
sign of overheating, before inflation actually takes off. So far
the Federal Reserve has been too lax, and that now makes its task
doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jump in consumer-price inflation _ to 3.7 percent in
March, up from 1.7 percent a year ago _ can be blamed on higher oil
prices. Inflation should drop a bit once these fall out of the
year-on-year figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several optimists still say the March number will turn out to be
a blip caused by special factors. But after a time it becomes
implausible to keep asserting that inflation is subdued if only one
leaves out all the prices that are actually rising.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the ``core'' rate of inflation (excluding volatile
energy and food) is also now creeping up. Plenty of other
indicators suggest that America's economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales jumped by 10 percent in the 12 months to March. GDP
figures out next week are expected to show real growth continuing
at an annual rate of 5-6 percent in the first quarter of this year.
Credit is expanding alarmingly. And the trade and current-account
deficits continue to hit records as rampant domestic demand sucks
in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June the Fed has raised interest rates, in
quarter-point steps, from 4.75 percent to 6 percent. But this
followed a sharp cut in rates in the autumn of 1998 in the wake of
Russia's financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are still only half a point higher than they were
in the summer of 1998. And because inflation has risen, real rates
have actually fallen slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the fact that share prices are still 30 percent higher,
on average, than in August 1998, helping to fuel domestic spending
because consumers feel so much wealthier, and overall financial
conditions are looser today than they were in 1998, despite the
economy's annual average growth since then of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in stock market wealth has been an important
driving force behind consumer spending. From this point of view,
indeed, the recent weakness in equities is welcome. It is certainly
no reason for the Fed to stop pushing up interest rates. A failure
to raise rates would probably cause share prices to surge upwards
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Fed has been too cautious. Each time the markets
have been well prepared for a modest rise, and share prices have
rallied after the Fed has acted, blunting the impact of higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fed officials would have preferred to move faster, but Alan
Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has been more sympathetic to the
idea that the faster productivity growth of the new economy has
significantly increased the economy's safe speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   He is right to detect some evidence of this. But the snag is
that actual demand has increased faster still. It will now be even
harder for the Fed to engineer a soft landing, with growth slowing
smoothly to a sustainable rate.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in inflation suggests that the economy is already
operating well above capacity, so growth will need to be slowed
more sharply to below its trend rate. This increases the risk of a
hard landing, in which output actually declines.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the Fed been too slow to raise interest rates to
prevent inflation from rising, but it has also failed to dispel the
belief of many investors that it is ready to ease immediately after
share prices drop _ as it did after the market fell in both 1987
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a moral hazard that has encouraged investors to
take bigger risks. And it makes it even more important that the Fed
does not flinch from the task of raising interest rates, even if
stock markets remain wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed should therefore raise interest rates by half a point at
its next policy meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years America's economy has enjoyed a virtuous circle.
Rising share prices have lured foreign capital and pushed up the
dollar; this, in turn, has helped to hold down inflation and
interest rates, and so supported share prices.
</P>
<P>
   The risk now is that the circle could turn vicious: if stock
markets tumble, foreigners could flee, pushing the dollar down and
inflation up, leading to further monetary tightening. In such
conditions, rising inflation would leave the Fed with less room to
cut interest rates to protect the economy from a severe stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have, over the past few years, made much of the
Goldilocks economy (neither too hot, nor too cold) should have
remembered that the tale ends with Goldilocks being chased away by
the bears. &QL;

MIAMI'S CUBAN-AMERICANS ARE PLAYING INTO CASTRO'S HANDS

Times Syndicate is for use by clients of The Economist.

<P>
   April has never been a gentle month for Janet Reno, America's
attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, 1993, when she was brand-new to her job, four
federal agents were killed and 87 people incinerated in the siege
of the Branch Davidians' headquarters outside Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, to the very day, a bomb planted in revenge for
Waco in Oklahoma City killed 169 people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perilously near those anniversaries, crowds are massing in
Miami to prevent the seizure by federal agents of Elian Gonzalez, a
six-year-old Cuban refugee who must, under American law, be
returned to his father and to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   For all her uncompromising talk, Reno clearly does not know
which way to turn. The parallels with Waco are disquieting. In that
case, Reno justified her intervention because children were said to
be being abused inside the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, too, the charges and countercharges are now
about child abuse: whether his Miami relatives, who took him in
last November, are turning the boy against his father, or whether
his father would treat him more cruelly by taking him back to
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, Reno now faces _ as at Waco _ a crowd of
believers, convinced that Elian has been saved by a miracle for a
life in the United States and determined to die martyrs' deaths to
keep him there.
</P>
<P>
   It need not have come to this. When Elian was first rescued from
the sea, one of three survivors of a raft-load of Cubans, it seemed
that matters would be sorted out swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Both national and international law are clear on the issue: a
child belongs with his surviving parent, unless that parent is
unfit. Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, had nothing that could
be held against him _ except that he lived in Cuba. But that was
enough.
</P>
<P>
   As the relatives became increasingly attached to Elian, their
attitudes hardened, and one can understand why. Since Elian's
mother had risked everything on that hazardous journey across the
Florida Straits, it was surely her wish that her son should become
an American.
</P>
<P>
   To send him back would mark another ``betrayal'' by the
government, a betrayal as callous as when it abandoned the band of
paramilitaries who were sent by the CIA, in 1961, to try to invade
Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. That anniversary, too, fell this week.
</P>
<P>
   Elian thus became, and remains, a captive of the poisonous
relationship between Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, the two countries have neither traded nor had
diplomatic relations with each other. They lie a mere 90 miles
apart, the citadel of free enterprise and the western world's last
sad, failed remnant of communist central planning.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba longs for the dollars on which it subsists; much of Miami
yearns to be reunited with struggling Cuban relations. But both
sides are far too proud to admit to any complications in their
public loathing of each other.
</P>
<P>
   This long hatred is now summed up in one bitterly divided
family. Neither side trusts, or will even speak to, the other.
Elian's father, dispirited, waits in Maryland, while the Miami
relatives try to engineer yet more legal delays.
</P>
<P>
   They have defied a court order to turn Elian over; his father,
they say, is simply a tool of Cuba's dictatorial leader, Fidel
Castro. Politicians are not helping: the two local mayors, both
facing tough election fights, have said they will not lend support
to any federal agents who are sent to seize the child.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, both George W. Bush and Al Gore are
scrambling for Floridian votes by saying that Elian should stay.
</P>
<P>
   He should not stay. Despite the best efforts of his relatives to
lure him with toys, clothes and video games, his place is with his
father. But it is hard to see how matters can be resolved without
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban exiles, though their power has been waning in
recent years, are utterly immovable on one point: they will not
deal with Cuba while Fidel Castro is in power. He is the devil, and
Elian their saint.
</P>
<P>
   His case has become the pivot on which all their arguments, and
all their hopes, turn. They are determined not to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   This small boy encapsulates their message that Cuba is evil,
America is good, and that the two sides must not do business with
each other until the regime has changed. If they have to defy their
own government to make this point, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   How misguided they are. The Economist yields to nobody when it
comes to contempt for Castro. But to use Elian for propaganda
purposes, as the exiles now are, is exactly the tactic Castro would
choose.
</P>
<P>
   He is getting huge mileage out of this case. It shows, even
better than the trade embargo can, how vindictive and inhumane the
United States can be.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives believe they are doing the best thing
for him, literally saving his life. But actually they are playing
into the devil's hands; and, in the process, they are also
restricting Elian's choices as surely as Castro would.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more fundamental point. These exiles came to
America after the Cuban revolution not just because they believed
in capitalism, but because, presumably, they believed in the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   They are now treating the rule of law as contemptuously as
Castro himself does. They will abide by it merely if it suits them.
</P>
<P>
   This defiance does not show Castro, and Cuba, that America is a
morally superior place. On the contrary, it displays a country
where even an administration with law on its side may be bullied
out of doing the right thing because it is election year. &QL;

<P>
   Are outsiders making too much of the disturbances in Zimbabwe?
</P>
<P>
   Africa has become a violent continent. Only six years ago, it
was the scene, in Rwanda, of the world's greatest genocidal
slaughter for half a century. Since then, war has spread from
Ethiopia and Eritrea across a swathe in the middle to Angola in the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Warlords have butchered and mutilated the people of Sierra
Leone. At the end of February, hundreds of Nigerians died in an
outbreak of ethnic violence that raised the spectre, at least for a
few days, of a repetition of civil war in the continent's most
populous country.
</P>
<P>
   Far more people were killed in a single explosion in Congo last
week than have died in two months of farm invasions in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Is the western world's concern about the turn of events there
just a reflection of the fact that some of the people being beaten
and shot in Zimbabwe are white?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. There is no other honest answer. Yet that should give
comfort to no one. Outsiders are right to be concerned about
Zimbabwe, not least because what happens there will have an effect
upon what happens in other parts of Africa, and therefore upon all
Africans, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe, it is true, is not a very rich country, nor even a big
one. But it has been a hopeful country, one of relatively few in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 20 years of independence, the former British
colony of Southern Rhodesia has been tranquil, harmonious and
reasonably prosperous. This was no mean achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabweans had reason to be bitter: the majority-chosen
government that they might have expected in the mid-1960s was
denied them by Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence.
This led to 14 years in which the white minority imposed a
semi-sanitized form of apartheid and the black majority
increasingly took up arms as guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mugabe, who in 1980 eventually led Zimbabwe to
independence, never showed the capacity for reconciliation that
Nelson Mandela was later to show in South Africa next door, but
neither was he vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   Many whites stayed on. They contributed usefully to an economy
that the IMF and others considered well run. The press was lively.
The judiciary was, and is, commendably independent.
</P>
<P>
   Many black Zimbabweans died in a series of massacres in
Matabeleland in the early 1980s, but after that the country seemed
set for a decent future.
</P>
<P>
   With political stability, a fair infrastructure and a large
tourist potential, it could expect investment and other support
from abroad. It would be refreshingly different from the
bloodstained basket cases that have done so much to tarnish
Africa's name.
</P>
<P>
   Now all of that is in doubt. The country is still far from
degenerating into butchery. Indeed, deplorable as it is, the
violence that has so often accompanied the occupation of white
farms is not, in itself, the main cause for concern. Nor are the
calls for land reform, a longstanding and legitimate demand in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The sinister feature, rather, is the president's role in the
current campaign. He ``regrets'' the deaths, but he supports the
takeovers in which they happen, calling white farmers ``the enemy
of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he refuses to condemn the violence unequivocally and
have it stopped. The High Court has ruled the occupations illegal;
the vice-president too has said they must end. But the president
says, ``This is not a problem that can be corrected by the
courts.'' He thereby, in effect, lends his support to mob rule.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why Mugabe is doing this. The generally
hopeful picture of his country outlined above is nowadays largely a
memory. The president's rule has become ever more autocratic, the
government ever more corrupt and the economy ever more enervated.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by inflation, unemployment, chronic fuel shortages and
their country's involvement in a pointless war in Congo,
Zimbabweans are increasingly turning away from their president's
party, which must face an election before August.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe received a bloody nose when he put the draft of a new
constitution to the voters in February. No doubt he thinks the
issue of land reform, violent or not, will help him do better in
the coming poll.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that no one can bring him to his senses. It certainly
will not be Robin Cook, Britain's foreign secretary: any
intervention from the former colonial power is likely only to
antagonize Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   A better bet would be an African voice, preferably several.
Apart from that of Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, they
have been notably silent so far, perhaps because they are talking
privately, perhaps because they have some sympathy for Mugabe or at
least fear that criticism might lose them support in their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, they should lose their inhibitions. If Mugabe
continues to override the rule of law in Zimbabwe, the violence
will intensify, whites will leave, investment will dry up _ and the
infection will spread.
</P>
<P>
   All of Africa's countries risk some damage, but those that stand
to lose most are those closest by. Of these, much the most
influential is South Africa. It can exert economic pressure:
Zimbabwe depends on it for oil and electricity. It can also speak
with moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the strongest of reasons to do so. The
degeneration of Zimbabwe into lawlessness and instability would be
seen as confirmation of the opinion, long held by white racists,
that majority rule in Africa inevitably means autocracy,
incompetence and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that view been held more firmly than in South
Africa, and nowhere has it been shaken more effectively, thanks to
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   By staying silent, Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's new president,
risks being seen as condoning the behavior of Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever feelings of solidarity Mbeki has for a fellow president
_ one who, like him, struggled against white rule _ he has a duty
to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe needs the rule of law, an unfettered opposition and
free elections. If it does not get them, and Mbeki stays mute, the
inevitable conclusion will be that they are at risk in South Africa
_ a dreadful prospect for the last, best hope in a strife-torn
continent. &QL;

<P>
   The rest of the Americas celebrated, or mourned, their
``discovery'' by Europeans back in 1992, the quincentenary of
Columbus's landfall. But that meant little in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Its discovery by the Portuguese came eight years later, on April
22, 1500, and by accident, when a fleet commanded by Pedro Alvares
Cabral and bound for India was blown off course.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians mark that event this weekend, with a few protests,
and much soul-searching about what makes them unique. Elsewhere,
the anniversary is being almost wholly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Both reactions are predictable. Language, geography and history
have combined to isolate Brazil from its Spanish-speaking neighbors
on the far side of the Amazon rain forest and the Parana Basin, let
alone from the wider world.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation has bred introversion. That partly reflects Brazil's
vast size, self-sufficiency and fairly peaceful history. But it
reflects, too, a sense of shame, much of it derived from slavery,
which lasted longer and involved larger numbers in Brazil than
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Its legacies include ugly everyday violence and deep-rooted
social inequalities. Brazil's self-confidence has been shaken, too,
by recurring economic crises, and by difficulties in establishing a
stable democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at 500, Brazil is in many ways still a young country, and of
unappreciated achievements. Only Japan recorded faster economic
growth between 1900 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   And though Brazil is not free of racism, it has been strikingly
more successful than the United States and many other countries in
creating a multiracial society.
</P>
<P>
   Its recent democratic governments have made big efforts to
tackle other social problems, ranging from education to land
reform. Having overcome hyperinflation, and ridden out last year's
devaluation, the economy is now set to grow again.
</P>
<P>
   Much remains to be done. Yet if Brazil's prospects now look
brighter, it is partly because over the past decade the country has
moved far in opening itself up: it has slashed tariffs, abolished
state monopolies and sold off state-owned businesses to private
investors, many of them foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Some Brazilians argue that change has gone far enough. They are
cautious about further trade liberalization, through a proposed
Free-Trade Area of the Americas, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who as president since 1994 has
pushed through many of the reforms, is right when he argues that
Brazil has more to gain than to lose from further market opening,
and from playing a more active role in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments may seem odd. After all, a degree of economic
introversion is typical of countries of ``continental'' scale and
large domestic markets, such as India, Russia, China or, yes, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas India's geopolitical ambitions have equipped it
merely with nuclear weapons, Brazil's democracy has scrapped a
military dictatorship's nuclear-arms plans, and swapped a prickly
rivalry with Argentina for cooperation in Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   If they care about it at all, though, Brazilians tend to see
Mercosur as a refuge from the wider world. Not, it is true, a very
elaborate refuge: they have not shown themselves eager to turn it
into a genuine common market, still less to contemplate the loss of
sovereignty involved in deepening it in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Mercosur, nor economic reform, transformed Brazil's
export performance. Between 1989 and 1999, India's exports
increased by 128 percent, China's by 271 percent and those of the
United States by 91 percent, while Brazil's rose by a paltry 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's share of world trade is smaller than in the mid-1970s.
Brazil is less poor than India, China or Russia, but it is in some
ways less open: its total trade amounts to a lower share of GDP
than in any of those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing that decline might be helped if Brazil were to
overcome its lingering inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's diplomats have traditionally been reluctant to strut
the world stage, or even the region's. They do not often take the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Cardoso's initiative in calling, for September, a
meeting of South American leaders to discuss democracy an
interesting one. But it is no substitute for a stronger effort to
compete in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   At 500, inexperience is hardly an excuse. &QL;

<P>
   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this year is the environment. Understandably so. The vice
president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really deeply,
about the planet is not in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In case anybody needed reminding of how very, very deeply he
cares, a second edition of ``Earth in the Balance,'' the green
tract he first published in 1992, arrives in the bookshops this
weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day 2000,''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in contrast looks vulnerable on the issue. Republicans in
Congress have refused to ratify the Kyoto Accord on carbon-dioxide
emissions, thereby signalling, in the view of many
environmentalists, a preference (based on narrow commercial
reasons) for the imminent destruction of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps that, as Gore's new foreword points out, Houston,
in Bush's home state, has replaced Los Angeles as the American city
with the worst air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans these days tell pollsters that environmental
protection should be given priority over economic growth (by a
majority of 70 percent to 23 percent, according to a Gallup poll in
January).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps voters would change their minds if they saw what putting
that preference into practice would mean, but Gore is certainly not
crazy enough to test the strength of their conviction.
</P>
<P>
   His fearless position is that you can have rapid growth and a
pristine environment at the same time. Despite his talk of bold
measures and radical solutions, therefore, what he offers is virtue
without sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   As a political program this is hard to beat. Republicans play
into the vice president's hands when they accuse him of being an
environmental extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reply to this charge is, in effect, ``Yes, and what
responsible citizen is not?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-quoted proposals from the first edition of
``Earth in the Balance'' was Gore's plan to eliminate the internal
combustion engine within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the new book he says, Yes, I did write that: ``It is
possible; it needs to be done; it will create more jobs, not
destroy jobs. I'm proud that I wrote those words in 1992, and I
reaffirm them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, so brave, so principled. But look a little closer at this
``plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore calls for a worldwide Strategic Environment Initiative.
This initiative, centered on ``intensive international
discussions,'' would aim to devise ways of encouraging greener
technologies, partly through stricter enforcement of
intellectual-property rights, subsidies for R&AMP;D, government
purchasing programs for ``early marketable versions of the new,''
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   There would be tax incentives and tax disincentives, too. When
it comes to eliminating the internal combustion engine,
``disincentives'' are the crux of the matter _ so on this Gore is
extremely vague.
</P>
<P>
   He favors a carbon tax in principle, but gives no indication of
how big it would have to be. (Adopting an interestingly holistic
approach to fiscal policy, Gore also proposes to spend whatever the
proceeds from this tax may be twice over, once on subsidizing clean
technologies, and then a second time on ``completely'' offsetting
cuts in other taxes. Undeniably, this is how to get better value
from your tax dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore spends more time discussing the constitutional arrangements
of the Iroquois (he admires them) than he does estimating the scale
of any carbon tax.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it would need to be vast, on a par with the oil price
hikes of the 1970s, to have any hope of bringing America into
compliance with the Kyoto limits that Gore says he favors _ let
alone to have a chance of quickly eliminating the internal
combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Gore must be grateful to congressional Republicans for making it
clear that such taxes are out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of his book, Gore is not therefore an
environmental extremist _ not, at any rate, judged by what he has
promised to do. He is, rather, a hypocrite of heroic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   His description of the ``crisis,'' and his way of thinking about
it, could not be more extreme. Both are in fact pure Unabomber. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Global warming caused by man is not a theory or even a contested
empirical finding but a spiritual revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental issues are questions of ethics (it is wrong to
``rip'' things out of the ground), not primarily or even
substantially of economics. Cost-benefit analysis (which puts a
discount rate on the future, and measures in dollars and cents) is
wicked.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption (``ravenous, insatiable'') is a kind of addiction;
those who question whether the environment is in terminal crisis
are addicts in denial. Mankind is engaged in ``frenzied
destruction'' of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Gore is losing his sense of proportion. ``The
struggle to save the natural world is in one way much more
difficult than the struggle to vanquish Hitler, for this time the
war is with ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He explicitly derides ``marginalist'' and ``adaptive'' responses
to environmental issues (such as those he himself proposes) as
``another form of appeasement,'' and calls for ``an all-out
response to this unprecedented threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``We now face the prospect of a kind of global civil
war between those who refuse to consider the consequences of
civilization's relentless advance and those who refuse to be silent
partners in the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people of conscience are joining the effort to
resist, but the time has come to make this struggle the central
organizing principle of world civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the IMF-World Bank protesters in Washington this week
might hesitate to go so far. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF 350-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet what weapons will this ferocious prophet of the
eco-underground take up against the irredeemably evil forces of
global capitalism?
</P>
<P>
   A little tax-break here, a little subsidy there, maybe a little
tax on gasoline, even, but nothing anybody will notice _ and, oh
yes, plenty of ``intensive international discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The chasm between ends and means is startling, but reassuring
too. If Gore believed the anti-capitalist, anti-individual,
anti-liberal, eco-fundamentalist nonsense he pours out in this
book, the possibility of his election to the White House would be
truly frightening to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, though, as his proposals show, he does not.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, what this book on the environment is really
about is politics, and the deplorable tendency of political
leaders, as Gore says of others, ``to base important decisions on
the perception of their impact on the next election or even on the
next public opinion polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Don't you just hate that? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK _ In most states a retiring president is treated
like a returning hero, the ultimate ``local boy made good.'' But
not in Arkansas, and not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of America turns its attention to George W. Bush
and Al Gore, Arkansas is still riveted by a man it can't quite work
out whether to hail or sue.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' decision to retire to a smart ``New York mansion''
has not gone down well in Little Rock. Many people here consider it
an act of treachery: the Clintons are abandoning the state that
supported the family for more than 25 (often trying) years.
</P>
<P>
   But what should make them stay? The enticements the state now
offers the Clintons include a local lawsuit entangling Bill's
presidential library, various moves to disbar either or both of
them from practicing law, and a whole barbecue-full of gossip that
the first family would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to disbar Clinton revolve around the allegedly
false testimony he gave in the Paula Jones harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation
of Atlanta, which filed one of the complaints, says disbarment
should be automatic when Clinton's case goes before the Arkansas
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wanted the matter postponed until he leaves office next
year. A judge refused. Clinton has until April 21 to respond but,
as The Economist went to press, he seemed likely to ask for another
extension.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Clinton paid $850,000 to settle Jones's complaint, which
is not part of the conduct committee's complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he did not fight a civil contempt citation over what
a federal judge, Susan Webber Wright, called ``intentionally
false'' testimony about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is also under pressure, in her case from the Whitewater
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary arm of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reviewing
allegations by Landmark Legal Foundation, another conservative
group, that Mrs. Clinton violated the state's code of conduct,
which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation wants the court to look at a real-estate document
which Mrs. Clinton created and was later used to deceive federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   It allegedly assisted the payment of $300,000 in real-estate
commissions to the father-in-law of Mrs. Clinton's former law
partner, Webster Hubbell (who pleaded guilty last June to various
Whitewater charges). These complaints will rumble on.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest immediate headache is the building that Clinton has
said should be ``a museum, not a mausoleum.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a team of New York architects ponders designs for the
$125 million Clinton presidential library and policy institute, no
actual ground-breaking work can be done because of Gene Pfeifer,
who owns two of the 27 acres of the area the library needs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifer's complaint is not about the price _ he thinks the
$400,000 the city has offered is fair enough, even too much _ but
about the city's acquisition methods and what the area really is.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Pfeifer argues that the city can take over
private land only if it sees fit to create a park. This bit of
land, he says, is outside the zoning area for parks, so it is not _
and cannot be _ a park.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the city recently re-zoned the presidential
library area, but designated it for urban use instead of as green
space for a park.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock's lawyer, Tom Carpenter, replies that if the city
calls something a park then a park it must be. A judge is due to
give a ruling by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton wins this battle, the library faces other
challenges. Some people have questioned the use of city bonds to
buy the land which will be given to the National Archives for the
library.
</P>
<P>
   The city's board of directors floated $16.4 million in bonds,
vowing to pay them off with revenues raised at city recreation
facilities, including the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   But Little Rock's zoo is hard up, and has lost its accreditation
with the National Zoological Association because it has been
accused of, among other things, not looking after its animals
properly.
</P>
<P>
   There are anyway doubts about the part of Little Rock chosen for
the Clinton shrine. The seedy warehouse district and the
rat-infested weeds on the banks of the Arkansas River have never
been exactly a popular spot.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists point out that what they call the River Market has
been livened up with some new hotels, the inevitable convention
center and the odd tourist bar. But the claim by the library's
supporters that it will be the only presidential library with its
own marina seems a little desperate.
</P>
<P>
   All this has led to rumors that Clinton may choose a new site _
perhaps Georgetown University in Washington _ for his library. That
still looks unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has chosen a loyal friend in Arkansas as the private
contractor to build the library. But it would not be the first time
that the first couple have broken a promise; and to take the
library off to Washington would add to Little Rock's fury about the
house-removal to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is supposed to make a few formal remarks about his
library on a visit to the state on April 27. Optimists talk of
Clinton persuading U2, an Irish band, to play at a free concert to
celebrate the library's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Less kindly people are already smirking about the library's
possible interactive displays (a three-dimensional hall of
mistresses and so on).
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the frustration on both sides lies a shared wish: to
recapture a glimmer of the magic that illuminated the state eight
years ago, before scandal tarnished both the state and the man who
should be its favorite son. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not Seattle, but neither was it a damp
squib.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 protesters descended on Washington last weekend,
intent on shutting down the spring meetings of the IMF and the
World Bank on April 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in Seattle, the aim was to use ``nonviolent civil
disobedience'' to stop the meetings from taking place. In other
words: block roads by forming human chains, and stop anyone getting
through.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters failed to shut down the meetings of the Fund and
the Bank, but they did paralyze large parts of downtown Washington
and cause the delegates much inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   The police sealed off a huge 90-block area around the Bank and
Fund buildings. By the eve of the meetings hundreds of policemen
were on guard in full riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the staff of the Bank and the Fund spent the night in
their offices, with videos and inflatable mattresses. Others were
told to report for work at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were driven to the meetings from their hotels in
police-escorted buses soon after dawn. Those who tried later
(including Laurent Fabius, the French finance minister) failed to
make it past the human chains.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone naive enough to wander among the demonstrators in a suit
was likely to be treated to an impromptu lecture on the evils of
global capitalism. Most of the time, the mood was festive.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of placards (``Imperialist Monetary Fiend,''
``Indigenous Manipulation Fund,'' ``Spank the Bank''). Huge banners
spanned the streets (``IMF/World Bank: start shakin'; today's pig
is tomorrow's bacon'').
</P>
<P>
   Bare-breasted women demanded the end of corporate rule;
makeshift bands of drummers banged empty water bottles on plastic
buckets; three young women from Vermont, in bright red evening
dresses, pranced around quoting from the ``Communist Manifesto,'' a
book whose message they felt was ``pretty accurate for right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find any protesters with a coherent explanation
of why they were there. The usual responses were mumbled slogans
saying that the World Bank and the IMF oppressed the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators seemed to be students, many inspired
by recent teach-ins on the evils of the IMF at their college
campuses. Several admitted that they had not heard of these
organizations two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some were even younger: a group of 14-year-olds from a suburban
Washington high school claimed they were there to protest against
the World Bank's ``corrupt'' loan system.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sinister element. Groups of black-masked anarchists
_ similar to those who smashed windows in Seattle _ roamed around
looking for trouble. But by Seattle standards it was all fairly
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested around 1,300 people, including 600 the day
before the main protest started and another 400 who were
``voluntarily arrested'' after they crossed a police line.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no vandalism (a few cars got smashed); and
some pepper spray was used. Despite a few photographs of students
being clobbered, the police were widely praised for doing a good
job.
</P>
<P>
   Their boss, Charles Ramsey, became something of a media star as
he walked around chatting with demonstrators. ``They're just kids
with a cause,'' he said at one of the many press briefings. ``God
bless 'em. That's what America is all about.'' &QL;

   MINNEAPOLIS _ De Soto bathed in it in 1542, Joliet and Marquette
canoed along it in 1673. But the modern story of the Mississippi
River does not begin until a century and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1851, some land-hungry whites got the Dakota Indians to sign
a treaty that gave them much of the territory around the upper
Mississippi. Soon afterwards, in 1854, the Chicago and Rock Island
Railroad pushed its way up to the river. Travellers from the east
could now reach the Mississippi in a mere three days.
</P>
<P>
   The railway's managers celebrated its completion with a Grand
Excursion. They invited some 1,200 stockholders, journalists,
novelists and academics (plus an ex-president, Millard Fillmore) to
board seven steamboats at Rock Island, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The boats' great paddle wheels propelled the excursionists
upstream to St. Paul, almost as far as the boats could then go.

   One stricken New York Times writer swooned: ``Over 150 miles of
unimaginable fairyland, genieland and world of visions have we
passed during the last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Back east, this sort of thing increased the fervor of restless
would-be pioneers. By the time Mark Twain visited St. Paul in 1882,
71,000 people lived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a manufacturing city, of course _ all the cities of the
region are _ but he is peculiarly strong in the matter of
commerce,'' wrote Twain, in his muscular way.
</P>
<P>
   Downstream, Twain saw St. Paul's bigger twin, Minneapolis,
bustling with river trade. Mills powered by the Falls of St.
Anthony mashed wheat into flour. There was a flourishing of
sawmills, cotton mills, paper and oil mills.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis had become the milling capital of the world by 1880,
and would keep the title for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two extraordinary towns were ten miles apart, a few
months ago,'' Twain said, ``but were growing so fast that they may
possibly be joined now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, the Twin Cities were still bustling with
trade. But the mills began to run on steam, not hydropower; so they
no longer needed to be next to the river. Riverside industry faded.
</P>
<P>
   The planners began to look for new ways of using the land. In
1970, Minneapolis created the Riverfront Development Coordination
Board to reclaim industrial land alongside the river. The railways
were persuaded to move some of their tracks to open up space for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the river is having a new boom. In Minneapolis,
developers are converting empty mills and warehouses into expensive
apartments with views of the river; nearly $1 billion of private
capital has been put into riverside projects.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Paul, public agencies and private companies have built a
science museum, a hockey arena and a convention center. Officials
are asking for millions of dollars of public money to build a park
on land once used by the railroads.
</P>
<P>
   In September, there will be a ceremonial opening of Harriet
Island in the middle of the Mississippi, featuring a ``healing
garden'' and steps that descend into the river.
</P>
<P>
   There is quite an argument over a proposal to build a cable-car
connecting the city and the island. Those in charge of these grand
projects operate on the theory that, as technology makes geography
less and less important, they must use historical charm to create
the ``sense of place'' that lures the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 2004, cities from St. Paul to Davenport, Iowa, plan to
celebrate the sesquicentennial of the Grand Excursion by doing it
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the new excursion will put the northern
Mississippi back on the map for international tourists in search of
an ``authentic'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also, of course, a solid economic motive. The new
excursion, it is reckoned, should help the river cities to convince
legislatures and voters to support their riverside redevelopment
plans.
</P>
<P>
   These riverside towns also hope to bargain for federal dollars
in order, among other things, to clean up the land that riverside
industry polluted.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, notables and journalists _ this time from all around
the world _ will be invited to climb on board (restored) steamboats
at Rock Island. They will then travel upstream to ``rediscover''
the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Actors will impersonate the first excursion's characters.
Someone will dress up as Millard Fillmore and parrot the former
president's praise of this once virginal river.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the decks may be less than a rediscovery of Eden.
The steamboats will have to navigate a gauntlet of locks and dams,
and paddle among huge barges heading downstream laden with coal and
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   They will pass federal Superfund sites and will see, for the
most part, a riverfront vastly different from that which the first
excursionists gazed at so ardently 150 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The excursion's organizers trust that the new
celebrants will enjoy themselves enough to send glowingly nostalgic
reports back home.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people who live in the cities and towns that flank the
Mississippi have forgotten that a river as grand and nearly as long
as the Nile flows beside them.
</P>
<P>
   The planners of the coming 150th anniversary are hoping to
reconnect people and water. They want to revive an awareness of
what the Algonquin Indians, intimate with its power, called
michi-sipi, the Big Water. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In all the upheaval that has been brought about by
changing technology, one constant has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, where so many denizens of the high-tech world have
acquired purple hair and started bringing their budgerigars to
work, the sales force has kept its aura of 1960s Organization Man.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to customer calls, white-shirted and neatly coiffed, the
salesman seems to have changed little in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The sales force serving the technology industry is immense. IBM
has nearly 30,000 salesmen; Oracle another 10,000; the four
next-biggest software companies that many again.
</P>
<P>
   Not for much longer. E-business, transformer of all corporate
processes, has arrived in the land of strong handshakes and special
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, Oracle and IBM, SAP and other big
software firms have started selling their expensive flagship
products over the Web, in many cases bypassing their sales forces
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, the company that is leading the way, all the
mysteries of pricing, from incentive discounts to ``bundle
savings,'' which have so long been the salesman's stock-in-trade
are going or gone.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are a la carte menus, with greatly simplified
pricing options and the same prices for everybody. The salesman has
become an ``educator'' and ``evangelist,'' even a ``consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   The grubby work of actually striking the deal is now
increasingly done by software robots. Over the next year, Oracle
plans to shift 80 percent of its sales to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has started to sell its software, from databases to Lotus
Notes, on private extranets connected to the consultancies and
systems integrators that are its business partners; soon it will
start to offer them to everybody on its public Web site, too.
</P>
<P>
   SAP already sells some of its cheaper products this way; for
more expensive products, it now allows customers to pick software
configurations on the Web, stopping short only at the price, which
still requires a call to the company. But it, too, sees automated
selling as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple change, but one with enormous consequences. Take
the sales force out of the loop and suddenly opaque pricing becomes
transparent pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Access to price information shifts the balance of power to the
buyers: they can buy as little or as much as they need, treating
the order form as if it were a spreadsheet, to see the effect of
volume discounts or of adding or removing features.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that the average prices of these products on the
Web will go down. Indeed, anticipating this, Oracle cut its prices
when it introduced Web ordering. But, at the same time, a company
with Web sales is likely to reach more customers, including the
dot.com start-ups that would be too small to justify a sales call
even if the salesman had heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're betting that the increase in volume will more than
compensate for the fall in prices,'' says Ray Lane, Oracle's
president.
</P>
<P>
   It is, though, just a bet, and despite a lot of financial
modelling before the change, he admits that he can only guess at
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the straightforward commoditized e-commerce of the
sort employed by Dell or Amazon. The big databases and
enterprise-resource planning suites from these companies cost
anything from tens of thousands to millions of dollars, and can
take a dizzying array of configurations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most sales came either through a consultant or
systems integrator or through the firm's sales force. Each was
priced according to a mysterious calculus tainted by greed or
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Salesmen knew that deep discounts could cement relationships
with big customers or close a deal before the crucial end of the
quarter. But they also knew that the biggest commissions came with
complex packages that threw together multiple products and service
plans _ perhaps more than the customer needed.
</P>
<P>
   The result was often confusion, and not just for buyers. Oracle,
says Lane, used to have ``as many different kinds of contract as we
had customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Without standardization, contracts had to be approved and
tracked separately, limiting efficiencies of scale. The sales force
spent much of its time negotiating deals and processing order
paperwork. And because the different contracts made comparisons
difficult, the firm could not easily track trends, predict revenues
or make the most of its customer database.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the move to Web sales has already saved Oracle tens
of millions of dollars in sales and processing time, contributing
to its record revenues and margins in recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the sales force itself? Initially, says George
Roberts, the head of Oracle's North American sales division, sales
reps were horrified to have pricing, one of their most powerful
tools, wrenched from their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say: `My value-add before was negotiating contracts.
What's my value-add now?''' The answer, he says, is that the sales
rep becomes more of a consultant _ a job with less tedium and
paperwork, and more challenge and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This is not as odd as it sounds. After all, many management
consultants actually serve as salesmen, recommending and
contracting new IT systems for clients. Why should the opposite not
hold as well?
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is retraining most of its sales force in e-business
technology and business practices in the hope that, now that they
no longer have to haggle over contract terms, they can spend more
time understanding the customer and the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some day salesmen could even charge customers by the
hour for their visits. Organization Man would be proud. &QL;

RE-INVENTING THE WHEEL: PIRELLI TIRES TREAD NEW GROUND    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDITORS: Note 2 trims, totaling 500; 1,475 words uncut)   (ATTN. EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by clients of The Economist. Nonsubscribers

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every company dreams of changing its industry. Pirelli, an
Italian industrial group spanning tires and cables, may actually
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If a new and flexible tire-production system fulfils its
potential, tire making will never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Steel was transformed by mini-mills and sheet glass by the
float-glass process. Given the tire industry's chronic overcapacity
and low profitability, Pirelli's new method not only makes better
tires, but also promises to shatter the economics of a business
worth $70 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such claims have been made before. Indeed, most of the world's
big tire companies have pet technologies aimed at making tires more
efficiently. Yet little in the way of new production has been
achieved with all this technology, something that leads analysts to
wonder whether technological ambitions have not been thwarted by a
fear of ruining existing manufacturing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Michelin, then the world's biggest tire firm,
introduced ``C3M,'' a flexible-production method, into its plant at
Clermont-Ferrand in France. It hinted at productivity benefits of
up to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the process remains highly secret and appears to have had
little of its promised impact: only a handful of C3M units are in
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Similar miracles have been promised by Bridgestone's ``Tochigi''
and Goodyear's ``IMPACT'' systems. Again, details of these
manufacturing systems are as hazy as the promises are grand.
Goodyear, for instance, will take 15 years before its plants are
all using IMPACT _ scarcely a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Pirelli's claims seem equally open to question.
Although the company is the market leader in high-performance
tires, it is only the sixth-largest world producer, and an unlikely
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The new manufacturing technique has been under development for
two years and is still in a research facility, hidden among the
grubby buildings of Pirelli's sprawling Bicocca plant on the
outskirts of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   A few chunky robots sit among strange tubular machines alongside
which are buckets containing ropes of rubber. Steel wires and tapes
run everywhere in apparent chaos. If this is the future, it seems
disturbingly hectic.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the system starts to run does its elegance suddenly
become apparent. While the robots sway and dance with startling
precision, a high-performance tire appears as if by magic.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the large tire makers, Pirelli has shown a
remarkable willingness to demonstrate its ``modular integrated
robotized system'' (MIRS) to big car and motorcycle makers such as
BMW, and to the press, which will be able to see the first factory
version of the system when it begins continuous operation in a few
months' time.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS has several features that distinguish it from traditional
labor-intensive tire factories. Perhaps the most striking is that
tires are produced entirely by machine.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by software, a series of robots carry the tires right
through construction to molding and vulcanization. Thanks to its
robots, MIRS improves labor productivity by up to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The system is small and modular, unlike traditional tire making,
which has big economies of scale. The basic production line fits in
a mere 350 square meters and costs a modest (euro)45 million-50
million ($42 million-47 million).
</P>
<P>
   Working continuously seven days a week, this mini-factory can
produce a million tires a year, at an overall cost one-quarter less
than that of a mid-size traditional plant, which might produce 6
million tires a year. This frees Pirelli from the physical
constraints of traditional large-scale production.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS can be installed almost anywhere, if necessary right next
to a car maker's factory so that it delivers tires directly as they
are needed. It is also easy to add more production lines.
Additional modules can sit alongside the existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a MIRS plant can be assembled quickly wherever it
is needed. The contrast with the capital-intensive and huge
traditional tire plant could not be greater.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 patents protect the MIRS system, 12 of them related to
the method of building each tire, the rest to the software
processes.
</P>
<P>
   The main technology was invented by Pirelli 20 years ago, but
proved uneconomic. But what was then impractical has become
possible with today's robots. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 425 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIRS builds each tire around an appropriately shaped aluminium
drum. Raw rubber is heated and extruded on to the drum, followed by
successive layers of steel wires and strips as the tire takes
shape. At the end of the process, the drum ingeniously collapses,
leaving the finished tire ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   The system is flexible. Change the shape of the drum and you
change the tire that emerges. With the right software programming,
MIRS can build car, motorcycle, truck and tractor tires. A
prototype motorcycle tire is in preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Pirelli boasts improvements in quality as well as productivity.
Traditional tire making is done in huge batches, with tires
assembled gradually. At any moment, only 12 percent of materials in
a given batch are being processed. The rest are in storage, waiting
until required.
</P>
<P>
   It takes six days to get from raw materials to tires. MIRS takes
72 minutes. But it also points to why tires made using MIRS are
better.
</P>
<P>
   Stored batch materials cool and must be reheated before use,
conditions that can create flaws in the rubber, as well as waste.
MIRS creates tires at a uniform temperature in a single process,
eliminating both problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pirelli says that leading car makers have been so excited by the
improvements in quality that they have rushed the new tires into
their test programs.
</P>
<P>
   The road ahead If MIRS's benefits were limited to the creation
of a better class of tire, it would be of somewhat academic
interest. But, says Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli's chairman
and chief executive, the system's scope is far greater.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks it will change Pirelli in fundamental ways, helping
the firm to work more closely with its customers. These are not
just the vehicle makers, for whom the main advantages are clear.
They are also dealers who sell and maintain tires and who control
the retail aftermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the car makers. In future, they can have a
just-in-time tire-making facility wherever they want, allowing them
to squeeze inventory costs a precious notch. But they can do
something more profound.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS is controlled by a software system, so in theory tire
makers can feed their requirements directly into a production line,
changing ingredients and design features as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   This opens new possibilities for integrated vehicle and tire
design, as well as for accelerated testing of new ideas. That could
help to elevate tires from humble load bearers to sophisticated
elements of a vehicle's overall design. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pirelli is already developing new ideas to take advantage of
MIRS. For instance, the system makes it easier to embed intelligent
sensors into tires. These could be linked to a car's electronic
information system and continuously pass on measurements of, say,
pressure, triggering an alarm if it predicts a puncture. Optical
sensors could monitor wear to determine when a service is due.
</P>
<P>
   Such improvements could have a big impact on any large fleet of
vehicles, but especially on trucks, which make money by spending as
little time as possible off the road. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,225) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equally exciting, says Tronchetti Provera, is the effect that
MIRS will have on Pirelli's relations with dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of MIRS will allow Pirelli to slash dealers'
inventories, giving it a big advantage over other tire firms.
Dealers can order what they want online and know that it will
arrive just as they require it.
</P>
<P>
   The largest dealers might replace their costly inventories with
a MIRS unit inside their own plant, so that Pirelli can build
different tires as needed. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,475) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike competitors who have mostly dabbled with their new
systems, Pirelli is placing MIRS at the heart of its strategy for
tires, which represent roughly half the firm's overall business.
</P>
<P>
   Tronchetti Provera says that he wants a quarter of his
production to use MIRS within two years, an ambitious target. The
effort will focus on Pirelli's existing strength, the top end of
the market, supplying high-performance tires to car makers such as
BMW, Porsche and Jaguar, as well as to the popular four-wheel-drive
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS's strength is not just its technological elegance, but its
energetic backing from Pirelli. The firm could have used MIRS
simply to cement its market position. But that would have meant
laying off thousands of workers from traditional plants _ one
reason why larger firms have been secretive and slow to roll out
their new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pirelli is aiming to expand, increasing its presence in
the less valuable, mass-market, bits of tire making. With the
arrival of MIRS the rest of the tire industry might have little
choice but to be more adventurous. &QL;

<P>
   VIENTIANE _ Broadly smiling faces grace a calendar that calls on
people to ``Visit Laos Year 2000.'' Tourist dollars are important
for this sparsely populated, landlocked country, where the economy
is struggling and most of the 5 million people survive on
subsistence farming.
</P>
<P>
   But now Southeast Asia's poor relation could be facing the
resurgence of a war that many had forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Last month an explosion in a restaurant in the capital,
Vientiane, injured 13 people. Although some attribute the incident
to a business dispute, the Communist government has blamed it on
insurgents from the Hmong, an ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they were responsible for attacking the
restaurant, there is evidence of a renewed campaign by surviving
remnants of the Hmong guerrilla army that America's CIA used to
fight Lao communists during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have ambushed army convoys and burned houses in
the central province of Xieng Khouang.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas continued a low-intensity war long after their
enemy, the Vietnam-backed Pathet Lao, claimed victory in Laos in
1975. Now Hmong fighters seem to be gaining more support, perhaps
because of growing discontent with the government.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the guerrillas had few coherent aims. But they have
now started to attack corrupt leaders, and those involved in
unpopular resettlement policies. In one recent raid, they killed
local officials who were said to have been hoarding currency.
</P>
<P>
   They are also believed to have tried to defend families forced
to move from their highland homes to the plains. Although the
government has said that these moves are necessary to preserve the
ecology of the mountains, many suspect the resettlement was
primarily to help logging operations, from which the army profits.
</P>
<P>
   Laos has enjoyed steady growth since it began opening up its
economy more than a decade ago. But most of the benefits have gone
to the government and the army. Some onlookers reckon the army
takes nearly half the profits from Lao casinos.
</P>
<P>
   For most ordinary people, times have become harder, especially
since financial trouble first struck Laos's neighbors in 1997. The
currency, the kip, collapsed last year. It has now stabilized, but
things could still go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong rebels may have interpreted these economic
difficulties as evidence of a weak government. If so, they are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist regime, largely dominated by generals, has
recently improved the efficiency of its secret police and has
brought in army recruits from the countryside. These recruits have
no qualms about cracking down on any sign of dissent in Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
   At Vientiane National University, long a meeting place for
intellectuals, students are now discouraged from mingling on
campus. Most of them go home immediately after class rather than
risk trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters planned an anti-government demonstration in Vientiane
last October, but were detained before the march. The whereabouts
of at least six of them is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Even the few Vientiane residents who can get independent news _
an even smaller number than in notoriously mediaphobic Myanmar _
are too frightened to speak out, let alone organize.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, says Sunai Phasuk, a Laos specialist at
Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, the conditions for peaceful
political change simply do not exist in Laos. Nor do government
opponents expect much support from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments tend to criticize Laos less severely than
Myanmar, perhaps because the country does not have an attractive
opposition leader like Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the United States has suspended normal trading
relations, and is likely to continue to do so until the matter of
``the disappeared'' is cleared up, according to Stanley Roth, a
senior State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   These particular ``disappeared'' are Houa Ly and Michael Vang,
two Hmong-Americans who vanished last April while visiting the
Thai-Lao border. The government says it knows nothing about them,
but suggests that they may have been crossing into Laos to meet
Hmong insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ly helped to rescue American pilots who were brought
down in Laos during the war, and Vang is related to Vang Pao, a
former Hmong leader, their relations insist that the men have
nothing to do with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 Hmong live in America, most of whom arrived
after the Communists took over. Like Cuban-Americans, they are a
vocal pressure group.
</P>
<P>
   Now Laos has another problem with disappearances. Recently,
several Thais have vanished near the border, which has prompted
calls for an inquiry from people in Bangkok. Laos can hardly afford
to alienate Thailand, the richest of its neighbors, and a major
source of visitors, especially to the country's profitable
casinos. &QL;

   ASTANA _ The election victory last month of Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, was hailed by the presidents of the
ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. But in private they are anxious
to see what policies Putin will have in store for Russia's former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The American government, however, has wasted no time in
asserting its interests in the oil-rich region by dispatching a
series of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the CIA, George Tennet, and the FBI's director,
Louis Freeh, both visited the region immediately after the Russian
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hot on their heels came Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, who travelled to the capitals of Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and
Uzbekistan this week.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission was to discuss regional security and democracy with
the three countries' authoritarian presidents. Each was offered $3
million to assist in dealing with an increasing cross-border flow
of weapons, drugs and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the carrot came the stick: Mrs. Albright
admonished the presidents for the manifest shortcomings of recent
elections in all three countries, for persecuting political
opponents and, in Uzbekistan, for using the threat of Islamic
fundamentalism and terrorism to repress the Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Central Asian presidents were evidently flattered
by such a high-level American charm offensive, it may not have the
desired result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is our God-given neighbor,'' says Nursultan Nazarbaev,
Kazakhstan's president. He would like to establish a political and
economic partnership with Russia, but also enjoy close relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia matters, not least because a third of the country's
population is Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Kirgizstan, one of the smaller countries in Central Asia, also
has little choice about where to look for friends. Last autumn,
hundreds of Islamic militants invaded southern Kirgizstan, taking
four Japanese geologists hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were caught unprepared and Kirgizstan's
president, Askar Akaev, asked Russia for help. After two months,
the hostages were released and the kidnappers escaped to
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before Mrs. Albright's arrival in Kirgizstan, Russia's
spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, had met Akaev in the
capital, Bishkek, and Uzbekistan's president, Islam Karimov, in the
Uzbek capital, Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed joint measures to combat terrorism and religious
extremism. Yastrzhembsky believes that there is a connection
between the rebels in Chechnya, the incursion in Kirgizstan and
terrorist bombings in Uzbekistan in February last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's argument that democracy is the best defense
against extremism probably fell on deaf ears in Uzbekistan. Karimov
has antagonized many of his citizens by muzzling any form of
opposition, arresting thousands after last year's bomb blasts, in
which he himself narrowly escaped death.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think his iron rule is at least partly responsible
for the extremism he is now struggling against. Russia says it is
ready to help and will do so without making demands for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The one issue on which America's dogged efforts to influence
Central Asia's leaders may pay off is oil.
</P>
<P>
   The American government is determined to decrease Central Asia's
dependence on Russia's pipelines for transporting oil to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbaev, who would like to see several pipelines built so that
Kazakhstan can be as independent as possible, has reiterated his
commitment to a 1,730-km (1,075-mile) oil pipeline to run from
Azerbaijan's capital Baku on the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is due to start next year, but the pipeline will be
economic only if Kazakhstan commits 20 million tons of oil a year
to the project. Recently, its officials have seemed to be backing
away from any such commitment, perhaps because they think
Kazakhstan will not be able to produce enough oil, at least before
2004.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States cannot stop Russia from resuming a leading
role in Central Asia, the Americans hope they can at least prevent
a reunification with Russia of some of the former Soviet republics.
They may not succeed even in this aim.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin became Russia's acting president at the end of last
year, Slavic organizations in Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan called for
referendums on joining the Russia-Belarus Union. Though there is
little support for this among the non-Slav population, many people
feel that their future would be safer under Russian protection.
</P>
<P>
   Independence is attractive, but the countries of Central Asia,
with small populations in relation to their size, feel vulnerable
to Islamic ambitions from Afghanistan. China, too, a giant
neighbor, is historically distrusted by Central Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be a friend, but it is far away. &QL;

<P>
   RIYADH _ The view from the bluffs above the Wadi al-Laban gully
in Riyadh encapsulates the dilemma facing Saudi Arabia's
less-than-harmonious royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The locals who gather there at sunset have come to admire the
elegant and expensive new suspension bridge that links a once
isolated quarter to the center of the city. But, in the distance,
hawk-eyed visitors can make out the cranes that Prince Abdelaziz
bin Fahd, one of King Fahd's sons, is using to build himself a
grandiose replica of Spain's Alhambra palace.
</P>
<P>
   Saudis have long accepted their rulers' lavish way of life as
the price for the rapid development and relative stability that
they have brought to the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Saudi Arabia's almost limitless reserves of oil are no
longer quite enough to pay for everything _ even with prices at a
steep $25 or so a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The sums are alarmingly simple. In 1999, Saudi Arabia clocked up
its 17th straight year of deficits. Public debt has reached around
120 percent of national income, which is about the same level as
Lebanon's, impoverished after its long years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The government calculates that the electricity industry alone
will require investment of $80 billion over the next 20 years to
cater to the country's mushrooming population. But last year, with
salaries and interest payments eating up most of its revenue, it
could set aside only $450 million for infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
   The government's problems are all the greater since most Saudis
look to it, not the private sector, to provide employment.
</P>
<P>
   The population has been growing a couple of percentage points
faster than the economy for most of the past 20 years, helping
income per person to tumble from $16,650 in dear-oil 1981 to $6,526
in cheap-oil 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has always tended to inflate its population
figures, perhaps to exaggerate its place in the world: it claims
around 16 million Saudi citizens, but some think that 12 million or
so might be nearer the mark.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, to generate new jobs for all the young Saudi men
entering the labor force (let alone the few women who make it), the
economy would have to grow by some 6 percent annually. Last year it
managed about 1 percent, and this year it may reach 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming clear that the Saudi regime cannot keep itself
and all its citizens solvent without a major economic overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   These worries have impressed themselves on Crown Prince
Abdullah, now in effect Saudi Arabia's ruler since his elder
brother, King Fahd, is a sick man.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when the oil price rises, Saudi Arabia's rulers dust
off their laurels and lay thoughts of reform to rest. But Prince
Abdullah has bluntly declared that all Saudis will have to tighten
their belts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, as the price of Saudi crude tripled, he
doubled visa fees for foreign laborers, introduced a hefty airport
departure tax and slashed subsidies on electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, with oil prices at their peak, the cabinet
approved a package of new measures to promote foreign investment.
The state telephone company will soon be sold off, with electricity
firms to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A tourist body has been set up in a bid to persuade Saudis to
spend their vacations at home and to persuade foreigners to visit.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered new economic council has promised to regulate the
stock market, revamp the tax code, amend the property and
employment laws and get the country into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds wonderfully resolute but, in the words of a jaded
banker, there is no such thing as a Saudi fast-track. It took the
council two months even to meet. And as Prince Abdullah tries to
ratchet up government revenue, his more profligate relations are
busy increasing their spending to match.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, thanks to rising oil prices, the treasury raked in $7
billion more than expected _ but over $4 billion of that
disappeared in a bonanza of unbudgeted expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent countryside tour, Prince Sultan, Prince Abdullah's
brother, rival and potential successor, dished out scholarships,
cars and cash to assorted supplicants with gay abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Saudis love to trade tales of royals muscling in on profitable
businesses, appropriating land or flogging their grace-and-favor
tickets on the national airline.
</P>
<P>
   As one of a group of powerful brothers, Prince Abdullah can read
the riot act all he wants but, until he becomes king, he does not
really have the authority to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, humbler Saudis are feeling the pinch. Many now
welcome the relatively menial jobs they once would have deemed too
lowly for a Saudi citizen, as hotel receptionists, for instance, or
supermarket cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, there were almost no Saudi security guards; now
foreigners are the exception.
</P>
<P>
   A disgruntled bedouin, who uses a borrowed car as an unlicensed
taxi, complains that he cannot pay the increased power bill for his
family of five. A teacher bemoans the rise in class sizes and the
fall in standards at state schools.
</P>
<P>
   Local journalists mutter about a crime wave. Yet, so far,
dissent remains muted. With a bit of bullying and bribing, the
government stamped out the anti-royal whispering campaign that was
stirred up by Islamists in the mid-1990s. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A devout Saudi professional argues that the royal family's
traditional claim to Islamic legitimacy has become as hollow as the
Chinese leadership's espousal of communism. But few Saudis care
enough to protest, he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of placing even more power in the hands of the
clerics horrifies a middle class that has already to put up with
countless restrictions in its private life in the name of
religion. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, strong family ties help keep destitution at
bay for most of the down-at-heel. The government can send the 5
million-strong expatriate population packing when unemployment
presses.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Saudis, who have more than $500 billion from the boom years
stashed away, can bankroll the public debt for a while yet. But all
these crutches only delay the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The future remains a race between the reformers' zeal and the
royal family's resistance. &QL;

<P>
   PORT OF SPAIN _ Africa apart, nowhere in the world suffers more
from AIDS than the countries of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 percent of their population, or half a million people,
are infected with HIV (the virus which causes the disease).
</P>
<P>
   Though this is a much lower rate than in several African
countries, the impact is broad, growing, and potentially
devastating to what are already some of the most vulnerable
countries in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Some places are worse hit than others. In Haiti, the incidence
of the disease is similar to that in sub-Saharan Africa: 12 percent
of Haitians in urban areas are infected, and 5 percent of those in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   At the main hospital in Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, a
study last year found nearly 40 percent of young men's deaths were
linked to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, Guyana and the Bahamas, routine
testing of pregnant women and blood donors (groups not especially
at risk) shows a prevalence of well over 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly effects of these figures will become fully clear only
in coming decades. AIDS is already the largest single cause of
death among young men (aged 15-44) in the English-speaking
Caribbean; within 20 years, it is expected to account for
three-quarters of all such deaths, according to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   The number of orphans in the Caribbean, now 83,000, is likely to
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   According to an estimate by the World Bank, the disease has
already cost the Caribbean region some 6 percent of its potential
wealth, because of lost workers, increased dependency on those who
do work, higher medical spending and reduced savings.
</P>
<P>
   Public awareness and understanding of AIDS has been slow in
coming. Health campaigns have faced big obstacles in efforts to
change sexual practices (a billboard in Guyana used to advise men
to ``wear a fresh condom every time'').
</P>
<P>
   At first, treatment of those who admitted they had the disease
could be rudimentary and cruel. Some AIDS sufferers were allowed to
die in the streets; some hospital staff refused to touch corpses of
victims; and in Barbados an infected man was even stoned to death.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, better drugs and education have improved matters,
but problems remain. Peggy McEvoy, who heads UNAIDS in the
Caribbean, says the region is particularly vulnerable because its
people are young, and many are sexually active from an early age.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong influences of churches, whether Catholic or
evangelical Protestant, has led to public reluctance to discuss sex
or encourage the use of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception to this bleak regional picture, as in many
other health matters, is Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its historical intolerance of homosexuality, Fidel
Castro's regime has set up an effective screening and reporting
system for AIDS. As a result, the infection rate in Cuba has been
kept remarkably low, at just 0.02 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, too, some efforts are being made to tackle the
disease. A plan backed by all the region's governments aims to
boost public-health education.
</P>
<P>
   Good screening programs in the Bahamas have helped to slow the
infection rate, and drug treatments there and in Barbados that help
to prevent pregnant mothers passing the disease to their children
have been copied elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But too often politicians are not leading. ``In some countries,
during election years there is a deafening silence on the issue for
fear of clashes with the church,'' says McEvoy. &QL;

<P>
   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this year is the environment. Understandably so. The vice
president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really deeply,
about the planet is not in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In case anybody needed reminding of how very, very deeply he
cares, a second edition of ``Earth in the Balance,'' the green
tract he first published in 1992, arrives in the bookshops this
weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day 2000,''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in contrast looks vulnerable on the issue. Republicans in
Congress have refused to ratify the Kyoto Accord on carbon-dioxide
emissions, thereby signalling, in the view of many
environmentalists, a preference (based on narrow commercial
reasons) for the imminent destruction of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps that, as Gore's new foreword points out, Houston,
in Bush's home state, has replaced Los Angeles as the American city
with the worst air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans these days tell pollsters that environmental
protection should be given priority over economic growth (by a
majority of 70 percent to 23 percent, according to a Gallup poll in
January).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps voters would change their minds if they saw what putting
that preference into practice would mean, but Gore is certainly not
crazy enough to test the strength of their conviction.
</P>
<P>
   His fearless position is that you can have rapid growth and a
pristine environment at the same time. Despite his talk of bold
measures and radical solutions, therefore, what he offers is virtue
without sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   As a political program this is hard to beat. Republicans play
into the vice president's hands when they accuse him of being an
environmental extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reply to this charge is, in effect, ``Yes, and what
responsible citizen is not?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-quoted proposals from the first edition of
``Earth in the Balance'' was Gore's plan to eliminate the internal
combustion engine within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the new book he says, Yes, I did write that: ``It is
possible; it needs to be done; it will create more jobs, not
destroy jobs. I'm proud that I wrote those words in 1992, and I
reaffirm them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, so brave, so principled. But look a little closer at this
``plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore calls for a worldwide Strategic Environment Initiative.
This initiative, centered on ``intensive international
discussions,'' would aim to devise ways of encouraging greener
technologies, partly through stricter enforcement of
intellectual-property rights, subsidies for R&AMP;D, government
purchasing programs for ``early marketable versions of the new,''
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   There would be tax incentives and tax disincentives, too. When
it comes to eliminating the internal combustion engine,
``disincentives'' are the crux of the matter _ so on this Gore is
extremely vague.
</P>
<P>
   He favors a carbon tax in principle, but gives no indication of
how big it would have to be. (Adopting an interestingly holistic
approach to fiscal policy, Gore also proposes to spend whatever the
proceeds from this tax may be twice over, once on subsidizing clean
technologies, and then a second time on ``completely'' offsetting
cuts in other taxes. Undeniably, this is how to get better value
from your tax dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore spends more time discussing the constitutional arrangements
of the Iroquois (he admires them) than he does estimating the scale
of any carbon tax.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it would need to be vast, on a par with the oil price
hikes of the 1970s, to have any hope of bringing America into
compliance with the Kyoto limits that Gore says he favors _ let
alone to have a chance of quickly eliminating the internal
combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Gore must be grateful to congressional Republicans for making it
clear that such taxes are out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of his book, Gore is not therefore an
environmental extremist _ not, at any rate, judged by what he has
promised to do. He is, rather, a hypocrite of heroic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   His description of the ``crisis,'' and his way of thinking about
it, could not be more extreme. Both are in fact pure Unabomber. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Global warming caused by man is not a theory or even a contested
empirical finding but a spiritual revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental issues are questions of ethics (it is wrong to
``rip'' things out of the ground), not primarily or even
substantially of economics. Cost-benefit analysis (which puts a
discount rate on the future, and measures in dollars and cents) is
wicked.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption (``ravenous, insatiable'') is a kind of addiction;
those who question whether the environment is in terminal crisis
are addicts in denial. Mankind is engaged in ``frenzied
destruction'' of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Gore is losing his sense of proportion. ``The
struggle to save the natural world is in one way much more
difficult than the struggle to vanquish Hitler, for this time the
war is with ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He explicitly derides ``marginalist'' and ``adaptive'' responses
to environmental issues (such as those he himself proposes) as
``another form of appeasement,'' and calls for ``an all-out
response to this unprecedented threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``We now face the prospect of a kind of global civil
war between those who refuse to consider the consequences of
civilization's relentless advance and those who refuse to be silent
partners in the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people of conscience are joining the effort to
resist, but the time has come to make this struggle the central
organizing principle of world civilization.''
</P>

<P>
   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this year is the environment. Understandably so. The vice
president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really deeply,
about the planet is not in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In case anybody needed reminding of how very, very deeply he
cares, a second edition of ``Earth in the Balance,'' the green
tract he first published in 1992, arrives in the bookshops this
weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day 2000,''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in contrast looks vulnerable on the issue. Republicans in
Congress have refused to ratify the Kyoto Accord on carbon-dioxide
emissions, thereby signalling, in the view of many
environmentalists, a preference (based on narrow commercial
reasons) for the imminent destruction of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps that, as Gore's new foreword points out, Houston,
in Bush's home state, has replaced Los Angeles as the American city
with the worst air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans these days tell pollsters that environmental
protection should be given priority over economic growth (by a
majority of 70 percent to 23 percent, according to a Gallup poll in
January).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps voters would change their minds if they saw what putting
that preference into practice would mean, but Gore is certainly not
crazy enough to test the strength of their conviction.
</P>
<P>
   His fearless position is that you can have rapid growth and a
pristine environment at the same time. Despite his talk of bold
measures and radical solutions, therefore, what he offers is virtue
without sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   As a political program this is hard to beat. Republicans play
into the vice president's hands when they accuse him of being an
environmental extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reply to this charge is, in effect, ``Yes, and what
responsible citizen is not?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-quoted proposals from the first edition of
``Earth in the Balance'' was Gore's plan to eliminate the internal
combustion engine within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the new book he says, Yes, I did write that: ``It is
possible; it needs to be done; it will create more jobs, not
destroy jobs. I'm proud that I wrote those words in 1992, and I
reaffirm them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, so brave, so principled. But look a little closer at this
``plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore calls for a worldwide Strategic Environment Initiative.
This initiative, centered on ``intensive international
discussions,'' would aim to devise ways of encouraging greener
technologies, partly through stricter enforcement of
intellectual-property rights, subsidies for R&AMP;D, government
purchasing programs for ``early marketable versions of the new,''
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   There would be tax incentives and tax disincentives, too. When
it comes to eliminating the internal combustion engine,
``disincentives'' are the crux of the matter _ so on this Gore is
extremely vague.
</P>
<P>
   He favors a carbon tax in principle, but gives no indication of
how big it would have to be. (Adopting an interestingly holistic
approach to fiscal policy, Gore also proposes to spend whatever the
proceeds from this tax may be twice over, once on subsidizing clean
technologies, and then a second time on ``completely'' offsetting
cuts in other taxes. Undeniably, this is how to get better value
from your tax dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore spends more time discussing the constitutional arrangements
of the Iroquois (he admires them) than he does estimating the scale
of any carbon tax.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it would need to be vast, on a par with the oil price
hikes of the 1970s, to have any hope of bringing America into
compliance with the Kyoto limits that Gore says he favors _ let
alone to have a chance of quickly eliminating the internal
combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Gore must be grateful to congressional Republicans for making it
clear that such taxes are out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of his book, Gore is not therefore an
environmental extremist _ not, at any rate, judged by what he has
promised to do. He is, rather, a hypocrite of heroic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   His description of the ``crisis,'' and his way of thinking about
it, could not be more extreme. Both are in fact pure Unabomber. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Global warming caused by man is not a theory or even a contested
empirical finding but a spiritual revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental issues are questions of ethics (it is wrong to
``rip'' things out of the ground), not primarily or even
substantially of economics. Cost-benefit analysis (which puts a
discount rate on the future, and measures in dollars and cents) is
wicked.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption (``ravenous, insatiable'') is a kind of addiction;
those who question whether the environment is in terminal crisis
are addicts in denial. Mankind is engaged in ``frenzied
destruction'' of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Gore is losing his sense of proportion. ``The
struggle to save the natural world is in one way much more
difficult than the struggle to vanquish Hitler, for this time the
war is with ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He explicitly derides ``marginalist'' and ``adaptive'' responses
to environmental issues (such as those he himself proposes) as
``another form of appeasement,'' and calls for ``an all-out
response to this unprecedented threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``We now face the prospect of a kind of global civil
war between those who refuse to consider the consequences of
civilization's relentless advance and those who refuse to be silent
partners in the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people of conscience are joining the effort to
resist, but the time has come to make this struggle the central
organizing principle of world civilization.''

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK _ In most states a retiring president is treated
like a returning hero, the ultimate ``local boy made good.'' But
not in Arkansas, and not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of America turns its attention to George W. Bush
and Al Gore, Arkansas is still riveted by a man it can't quite work
out whether to hail or sue.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' decision to retire to a smart ``New York mansion''
has not gone down well in Little Rock. Many people here consider it
an act of treachery: the Clintons are abandoning the state that
supported the family for more than 25 (often trying) years.
</P>
<P>
   But what should make them stay? The enticements the state now
offers the Clintons include a local lawsuit entangling Bill's
presidential library, various moves to disbar either or both of
them from practicing law, and a whole barbecue-full of gossip that
the first family would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to disbar Clinton revolve around the allegedly
false testimony he gave in the Paula Jones harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation
of Atlanta, which filed one of the complaints, says disbarment
should be automatic when Clinton's case goes before the Arkansas
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wanted the matter postponed until he leaves office next
year. A judge refused. Clinton has until April 21 to respond but,
as The Economist went to press, he seemed likely to ask for another
extension.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Clinton paid $850,000 to settle Jones's complaint, which
is not part of the conduct committee's complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he did not fight a civil contempt citation over what
a federal judge, Susan Webber Wright, called ``intentionally
false'' testimony about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is also under pressure, in her case from the Whitewater
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary arm of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reviewing
allegations by Landmark Legal Foundation, another conservative
group, that Mrs. Clinton violated the state's code of conduct,
which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation wants the court to look at a real-estate document
which Mrs. Clinton created and was later used to deceive federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   It allegedly assisted the payment of $300,000 in real-estate
commissions to the father-in-law of Mrs. Clinton's former law
partner, Webster Hubbell (who pleaded guilty last June to various
Whitewater charges). These complaints will rumble on.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest immediate headache is the building that Clinton has
said should be ``a museum, not a mausoleum.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a team of New York architects ponders designs for the
$125 million Clinton presidential library and policy institute, no
actual ground-breaking work can be done because of Gene Pfeifer,
who owns two of the 27 acres of the area the library needs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifer's complaint is not about the price _ he thinks the
$400,000 the city has offered is fair enough, even too much _ but
about the city's acquisition methods and what the area really is.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Pfeifer argues that the city can take over
private land only if it sees fit to create a park. This bit of
land, he says, is outside the zoning area for parks, so it is not _
and cannot be _ a park.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the city recently re-zoned the presidential
library area, but designated it for urban use instead of as green
space for a park.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock's lawyer, Tom Carpenter, replies that if the city
calls something a park then a park it must be. A judge is due to
give a ruling by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton wins this battle, the library faces other
challenges. Some people have questioned the use of city bonds to
buy the land which will be given to the National Archives for the
library.
</P>
<P>
   The city's board of directors floated $16.4 million in bonds,
vowing to pay them off with revenues raised at city recreation
facilities, including the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   But Little Rock's zoo is hard up, and has lost its accreditation
with the National Zoological Association because it has been
accused of, among other things, not looking after its animals
properly.
</P>
<P>
   There are anyway doubts about the part of Little Rock chosen for
the Clinton shrine. The seedy warehouse district and the
rat-infested weeds on the banks of the Arkansas River have never
been exactly a popular spot.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists point out that what they call the River Market has
been livened up with some new hotels, the inevitable convention
center and the odd tourist bar. But the claim by the library's
supporters that it will be the only presidential library with its
own marina seems a little desperate.
</P>
<P>
   All this has led to rumors that Clinton may choose a new site _
perhaps Georgetown University in Washington _ for his library. That
still looks unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has chosen a loyal friend in Arkansas as the private
contractor to build the library. But it would not be the first time
that the first couple have broken a promise; and to take the
library off to Washington would add to Little Rock's fury about the
house-removal to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is supposed to make a few formal remarks about his
library on a visit to the state on April 27. Optimists talk of
Clinton persuading U2, an Irish band, to play at a free concert to
celebrate the library's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Less kindly people are already smirking about the library's
possible interactive displays (a three-dimensional hall of
mistresses and so on).
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the frustration on both sides lies a shared wish: to
recapture a glimmer of the magic that illuminated the state eight
years ago, before scandal tarnished both the state and the man who
should be its favorite son. &QL;

   MINNEAPOLIS _ De Soto bathed in it in 1542, Joliet and Marquette
canoed along it in 1673. But the modern story of the Mississippi
River does not begin until a century and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1851, some land-hungry whites got the Dakota Indians to sign
a treaty that gave them much of the territory around the upper
Mississippi. Soon afterwards, in 1854, the Chicago and Rock Island
Railroad pushed its way up to the river. Travellers from the east
could now reach the Mississippi in a mere three days.
</P>
<P>
   The railway's managers celebrated its completion with a Grand
Excursion. They invited some 1,200 stockholders, journalists,
novelists and academics (plus an ex-president, Millard Fillmore) to
board seven steamboats at Rock Island, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The boats' great paddle wheels propelled the excursionists
upstream to St. Paul, almost as far as the boats could then go.
</P>
<P>
   One stricken New York Times writer swooned: ``Over 150 miles of
unimaginable fairyland, genieland and world of visions have we
passed during the last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Back east, this sort of thing increased the fervor of restless
would-be pioneers. By the time Mark Twain visited St. Paul in 1882,
71,000 people lived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a manufacturing city, of course _ all the cities of the
region are _ but he is peculiarly strong in the matter of
commerce,'' wrote Twain, in his muscular way.
</P>
<P>
   Downstream, Twain saw St. Paul's bigger twin, Minneapolis,
bustling with river trade. Mills powered by the Falls of St.
Anthony mashed wheat into flour. There was a flourishing of
sawmills, cotton mills, paper and oil mills.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis had become the milling capital of the world by 1880,
and would keep the title for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two extraordinary towns were ten miles apart, a few
months ago,'' Twain said, ``but were growing so fast that they may
possibly be joined now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, the Twin Cities were still bustling with
trade. But the mills began to run on steam, not hydropower; so they
no longer needed to be next to the river. Riverside industry faded.
</P>
<P>
   The planners began to look for new ways of using the land. In
1970, Minneapolis created the Riverfront Development Coordination
Board to reclaim industrial land alongside the river. The railways
were persuaded to move some of their tracks to open up space for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the river is having a new boom. In Minneapolis,
developers are converting empty mills and warehouses into expensive
apartments with views of the river; nearly $1 billion of private
capital has been put into riverside projects.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Paul, public agencies and private companies have built a
science museum, a hockey arena and a convention center. Officials
are asking for millions of dollars of public money to build a park
on land once used by the railroads.
</P>
<P>
   In September, there will be a ceremonial opening of Harriet
Island in the middle of the Mississippi, featuring a ``healing
garden'' and steps that descend into the river.
</P>
<P>
   There is quite an argument over a proposal to build a cable-car
connecting the city and the island. Those in charge of these grand
projects operate on the theory that, as technology makes geography
less and less important, they must use historical charm to create
the ``sense of place'' that lures the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 2004, cities from St. Paul to Davenport, Iowa, plan to
celebrate the sesquicentennial of the Grand Excursion by doing it
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the new excursion will put the northern
Mississippi back on the map for international tourists in search of
an ``authentic'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also, of course, a solid economic motive. The new
excursion, it is reckoned, should help the river cities to convince
legislatures and voters to support their riverside redevelopment
plans.
</P>
<P>
   These riverside towns also hope to bargain for federal dollars
in order, among other things, to clean up the land that riverside
industry polluted.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, notables and journalists _ this time from all around
the world _ will be invited to climb on board (restored) steamboats
at Rock Island. They will then travel upstream to ``rediscover''
the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Actors will impersonate the first excursion's characters.
Someone will dress up as Millard Fillmore and parrot the former
president's praise of this once virginal river.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the decks may be less than a rediscovery of Eden.
The steamboats will have to navigate a gauntlet of locks and dams,
and paddle among huge barges heading downstream laden with coal and
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   They will pass federal Superfund sites and will see, for the
most part, a riverfront vastly different from that which the first
excursionists gazed at so ardently 150 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The excursion's organizers trust that the new
celebrants will enjoy themselves enough to send glowingly nostalgic
reports back home.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people who live in the cities and towns that flank the
Mississippi have forgotten that a river as grand and nearly as long
as the Nile flows beside them.
</P>
<P>
   The planners of the coming 150th anniversary are hoping to
reconnect people and water. They want to revive an awareness of
what the Algonquin Indians, intimate with its power, called
michi-sipi, the Big Water. &QL;

U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY PROPOSE DIVISION OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of considering an array of possible remedies in the
Microsoft antitrust case, the U.S. government intends to propose
breaking the company in two, sources familiar with the plan said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, they said, would involve forcing Microsoft to spin off
its Office software _ which includes word processing, spreadsheet,
database and presentation programs _ from the company's industry
standard Windows operating system business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they say, the government intends to propose a
series of conduct remedies likely to remain in effect for two to
three years. These would include mandating that Microsoft publish
the prices it charges PC manufacturers for Windows, a step intended
to prevent Microsoft from rewarding its industry friends with lower
prices while punishing manufacturers that distribute software that
competes with Microsoft with higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal, they say, would also prohibit Microsoft
from entering into exclusive contracts. Microsoft could include new
features in its Windows operating system, but it would be required
to offer an ``unbundled'' version of Windows without current
features like its Internet browser or new features like
voice-recognition software, which Microsoft has said it plans to
add to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, the government proposal is intended to prevent
Microsoft from using the market power of its monopoly in the
personal computer operating system business to unfairly defend its
dominance or to extend it into new software markets.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also seeks to change the incentives in Microsoft's
biggest businesses, according to people familiar with the
government plan. For example, they say, an independent Office
company would be more likely to make sure its applications programs
like Word and Excel run on operating systems that compete with
Windows, including Linux, a version of Unix that is distributed
free on the Internet. Microsoft already makes Office for Apple's
Macintosh operating system. Yet according to testimony at the
trial, the government alleged that Microsoft threatened to stop
making a Macintosh version of Office unless Apple made Microsoft's
Internet Explorer its main browsing software instead of Netscape's
competing browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock price fell sharply in morning trading Monday.
It was down more than $12 a share at 1 p.m. EST, to about $66 a
share. But the main reason for that drop was the disappointing
financial results Microsoft announced after the close of the market
last Thursday. With stock markets closed on Good Friday, Monday was
the first day the market could react to those results.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Microsoft reported solid quarterly earnings but its
revenue growth disappointed Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Wall Street's most influential Microsoft analyst
dropped the company from his ``recommended for purchase'' list _ on
which Microsoft had been included since March 1996. Richard
Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., mentioned Microsoft's
market trends instead of the government antitrust case as the
reason for his move.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is an increasing risk,'' Sherlund wrote, ``that
Microsoft might atrophy on the PC platform as IBM did on the
mainframe platform, while robust growth shifts to hand-held and
wireless devices.''
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft shareholders, the breakup that the government
intends to recommend this week _ possibly as early as Tuesday _
might well prove rewarding. The Microsoft Office share of the
market for so-called productivity applications is even higher than
the 85 percent of the market that Windows holds in the PC operating
system market.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street analysts have said the value of the two
``monopoly'' franchises might well be far higher than the stock
market value of the combined company. That, they note, is what
happened after the government broke up Standard Oil in 1914.

   MINNEAPOLIS _ De Soto bathed in it in 1542, Joliet and Marquette
canoed along it in 1673. But the modern story of the Mississippi
River does not begin until a century and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1851, some land-hungry whites got the Dakota Indians to sign
a treaty that gave them much of the territory around the upper
Mississippi. Soon afterwards, in 1854, the Chicago and Rock Island
Railroad pushed its way up to the river. Travellers from the east
could now reach the Mississippi in a mere three days.
</P>
<P>
   The railway's managers celebrated its completion with a Grand
Excursion. They invited some 1,200 stockholders, journalists,
novelists and academics (plus an ex-president, Millard Fillmore) to
board seven steamboats at Rock Island, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The boats' great paddle wheels propelled the excursionists
upstream to St. Paul, almost as far as the boats could then go.
</P>
<P>
   One stricken New York Times writer swooned: ``Over 150 miles of
unimaginable fairyland, genieland and world of visions have we
passed during the last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Back east, this sort of thing increased the fervor of restless
would-be pioneers. By the time Mark Twain visited St. Paul in 1882,
71,000 people lived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a manufacturing city, of course _ all the cities of the
region are _ but he is peculiarly strong in the matter of
commerce,'' wrote Twain, in his muscular way.

<P>
   Downstream, Twain saw St. Paul's bigger twin, Minneapolis,

   NEW YORK _ In all the upheaval that has been brought about by
changing technology, one constant has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, where so many denizens of the high-tech world have
acquired purple hair and started bringing their budgerigars to
work, the sales force has kept its aura of 1960s Organization Man.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to customer calls, white-shirted and neatly coiffed, the
salesman seems to have changed little in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The sales force serving the technology industry is immense. IBM
has nearly 30,000 salesmen; Oracle another 10,000; the four
next-biggest software companies that many again.
</P>
<P>
   Not for much longer. E-business, transformer of all corporate
processes, has arrived in the land of strong handshakes and special
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, Oracle and IBM, SAP and other big
software firms have started selling their expensive flagship
products over the Web, in many cases bypassing their sales forces
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, the company that is leading the way, all the
mysteries of pricing, from incentive discounts to ``bundle
savings,'' which have so long been the salesman's stock-in-trade
are going or gone.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are a la carte menus, with greatly simplified
pricing options and the same prices for everybody. The salesman has
become an ``educator'' and ``evangelist,'' even a ``consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   The grubby work of actually striking the deal is now
increasingly done by software robots. Over the next year, Oracle
plans to shift 80 percent of its sales to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has started to sell its software, from databases to Lotus
Notes, on private extranets connected to the consultancies and
systems integrators that are its business partners; soon it will
start to offer them to everybody on its public Web site, too.
</P>
<P>
   SAP already sells some of its cheaper products this way; for
more expensive products, it now allows customers to pick software
configurations on the Web, stopping short only at the price, which
still requires a call to the company. But it, too, sees automated
selling as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple change, but one with enormous consequences. Take
the sales force out of the loop and suddenly opaque pricing becomes
transparent pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Access to price information shifts the balance of power to the
buyers: they can buy as little or as much as they need, treating
the order form as if it were a spreadsheet, to see the effect of
volume discounts or of adding or removing features.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that the average prices of these products on the
Web will go down. Indeed, anticipating this, Oracle cut its prices
when it introduced Web ordering. But, at the same time, a company
with Web sales is likely to reach more customers, including the
dot.com start-ups that would be too small to justify a sales call
even if the salesman had heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're betting that the increase in volume will more than
compensate for the fall in prices,'' says Ray Lane, Oracle's
president.
</P>
<P>
   It is, though, just a bet, and despite a lot of financial
modelling before the change, he admits that he can only guess at
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the straightforward commoditized e-commerce of the
sort employed by Dell or Amazon. The big databases and
enterprise-resource planning suites from these companies cost
anything from tens of thousands to millions of dollars, and can
take a dizzying array of configurations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most sales came either through a consultant or
systems integrator or through the firm's sales force. Each was
priced according to a mysterious calculus tainted by greed or
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Salesmen knew that deep discounts could cement relationships
with big customers or close a deal before the crucial end of the
quarter. But they also knew that the biggest commissions came with
complex packages that threw together multiple products and service
plans _ perhaps more than the customer needed.
</P>
<P>
   The result was often confusion, and not just for buyers. Oracle,
says Lane, used to have ``as many different kinds of contract as we
had customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Without standardization, contracts had to be approved and
tracked separately, limiting efficiencies of scale. The sales force
spent much of its time negotiating deals and processing order
paperwork. And because the different contracts made comparisons
difficult, the firm could not easily track trends, predict revenues
or make the most of its customer database.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the move to Web sales has already saved Oracle tens
of millions of dollars in sales and processing time, contributing
to its record revenues and margins in recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the sales force itself? Initially, says George
Roberts, the head of Oracle's North American sales division, sales
reps were horrified to have pricing, one of their most powerful
tools, wrenched from their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say: `My value-add before was negotiating contracts.
What's my value-add now?''' The answer, he says, is that the sales
rep becomes more of a consultant _ a job with less tedium and
paperwork, and more challenge and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This is not as odd as it sounds. After all, many management
consultants actually serve as salesmen, recommending and
contracting new IT systems for clients. Why should the opposite not
hold as well?
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is retraining most of its sales force in e-business
technology and business practices in the hope that, now that they
no longer have to haggle over contract terms, they can spend more
time understanding the customer and the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some day salesmen could even charge customers by the
hour for their visits. Organization Man would be proud. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In all the upheaval that has been brought about by
changing technology, one constant has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, where so many denizens of the high-tech world have
acquired purple hair and started bringing their budgerigars to
work, the sales force has kept its aura of 1960s Organization Man.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to customer calls, white-shirted and neatly coiffed, the
salesman seems to have changed little in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The sales force serving the technology industry is immense. IBM
has nearly 30,000 salesmen; Oracle another 10,000; the four
next-biggest software companies that many again.
</P>
<P>
   Not for much longer. E-business, transformer of all corporate
processes, has arrived in the land of strong handshakes and special
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, Oracle and IBM, SAP and other big
software firms have started selling their expensive flagship
products over the Web, in many cases bypassing their sales forces
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, the company that is leading the way, all the
mysteries of pricing, from incentive discounts to ``bundle
savings,'' which have so long been the salesman's stock-in-trade
are going or gone.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are a la carte menus, with greatly simplified
pricing options and the same prices for everybody. The salesman has
become an ``educator'' and ``evangelist,'' even a ``consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   The grubby work of actually striking the deal is now
increasingly done by software robots. Over the next year, Oracle
plans to shift 80 percent of its sales to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has started to sell its software, from databases to Lotus
Notes, on private extranets connected to the consultancies and
systems integrators that are its business partners; soon it will
start to offer them to everybody on its public Web site, too.
</P>
<P>
   SAP already sells some of its cheaper products this way; for
more expensive products, it now allows customers to pick software
configurations on the Web, stopping short only at the price, which
still requires a call to the company. But it, too, sees automated
selling as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple change, but one with enormous consequences. Take
the sales force out of the loop and suddenly opaque pricing becomes
transparent pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Access to price information shifts the balance of power to the
buyers: they can buy as little or as much as they need, treating
the order form as if it were a spreadsheet, to see the effect of
volume discounts or of adding or removing features.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that the average prices of these products on the
Web will go down. Indeed, anticipating this, Oracle cut its prices
when it introduced Web ordering. But, at the same time, a company
with Web sales is likely to reach more customers, including the
dot.com start-ups that would be too small to justify a sales call
even if the salesman had heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're betting that the increase in volume will more than
compensate for the fall in prices,'' says Ray Lane, Oracle's
president.
</P>
<P>
   It is, though, just a bet, and despite a lot of financial
modelling before the change, he admits that he can only guess at
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the straightforward commoditized e-commerce of the
sort employed by Dell or Amazon. The big databases and
enterprise-resource planning suites from these companies cost
anything from tens of thousands to millions of dollars, and can
take a dizzying array of configurations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most sales came either through a consultant or
systems integrator or through the firm's sales force. Each was
priced according to a mysterious calculus tainted by greed or
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Salesmen knew that deep discounts could cement relationships
with big customers or close a deal before the crucial end of the
quarter. But they also knew that the biggest commissions came with
complex packages that threw together multiple products and service
plans _ perhaps more than the customer needed.
</P>
<P>
   The result was often confusion, and not just for buyers. Oracle,
says Lane, used to have ``as many different kinds of contract as we
had customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Without standardization, contracts had to be approved and

   VIENTIANE _ Broadly smiling faces grace a calendar that calls on
people to ``Visit Laos Year 2000.'' Tourist dollars are important
for this sparsely populated, landlocked country, where the economy
is struggling and most of the 5 million people survive on
subsistence farming.
</P>
<P>
   But now Southeast Asia's poor relation could be facing the
resurgence of a war that many had forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Last month an explosion in a restaurant in the capital,
Vientiane, injured 13 people. Although some attribute the incident
to a business dispute, the Communist government has blamed it on
insurgents from the Hmong, an ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they were responsible for attacking the
restaurant, there is evidence of a renewed campaign by surviving
remnants of the Hmong guerrilla army that America's CIA used to
fight Lao communists during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have ambushed army convoys and burned houses in
the central province of Xieng Khouang.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas continued a low-intensity war long after their
enemy, the Vietnam-backed Pathet Lao, claimed victory in Laos in
1975. Now Hmong fighters seem to be gaining more support, perhaps
because of growing discontent with the government.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the guerrillas had few coherent aims. But they have
now started to attack corrupt leaders, and those involved in
unpopular resettlement policies. In one recent raid, they killed
local officials who were said to have been hoarding currency.
</P>
<P>
   They are also believed to have tried to defend families forced
to move from their highland homes to the plains. Although the
government has said that these moves are necessary to preserve the
ecology of the mountains, many suspect the resettlement was
primarily to help logging operations, from which the army profits.
</P>
<P>
   Laos has enjoyed steady growth since it began opening up its
economy more than a decade ago. But most of the benefits have gone
to the government and the army. Some onlookers reckon the army
takes nearly half the profits from Lao casinos.
</P>
<P>
   For most ordinary people, times have become harder, especially
since financial trouble first struck Laos's neighbors in 1997. The
currency, the kip, collapsed last year. It has now stabilized, but
things could still go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong rebels may have interpreted these economic
difficulties as evidence of a weak government. If so, they are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist regime, largely dominated by generals, has
recently improved the efficiency of its secret police and has
brought in army recruits from the countryside. These recruits have
no qualms about cracking down on any sign of dissent in Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
   At Vientiane National University, long a meeting place for
intellectuals, students are now discouraged from mingling on
campus. Most of them go home immediately after class rather than
risk trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters planned an anti-government demonstration in Vientiane
last October, but were detained before the march. The whereabouts
of at least six of them is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Even the few Vientiane residents who can get independent news _
an even smaller number than in notoriously mediaphobic Myanmar _
are too frightened to speak out, let alone organize.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, says Sunai Phasuk, a Laos specialist at
Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, the conditions for peaceful
political change simply do not exist in Laos. Nor do government
opponents expect much support from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments tend to criticize Laos less severely than
Myanmar, perhaps because the country does not have an attractive
opposition leader like Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the United States has suspended normal trading
relations, and is likely to continue to do so until the matter of
``the disappeared'' is cleared up, according to Stanley Roth, a
senior State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   These particular ``disappeared'' are Houa Ly and Michael Vang,
two Hmong-Americans who vanished last April while visiting the
Thai-Lao border. The government says it knows nothing about them,
but suggests that they may have been crossing into Laos to meet
Hmong insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ly helped to rescue American pilots who were brought
down in Laos during the war, and Vang is related to Vang Pao, a
former Hmong leader, their relations insist that the men have
nothing to do with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 Hmong live in America, most of whom arrived
after the Communists took over. Like Cuban-Americans, they are a
vocal pressure group.
</P>
<P>
   Now Laos has another problem with disappearances. Recently,
several Thais have vanished near the border, which has prompted
calls for an inquiry from people in Bangkok. Laos can hardly afford
to alienate Thailand, the richest of its neighbors, and a major
source of visitors, especially to the country's profitable
casinos. &QL;

   ASTANA _ The election victory last month of Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, was hailed by the presidents of the
ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. But in private they are anxious
to see what policies Putin will have in store for Russia's former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The American government, however, has wasted no time in
asserting its interests in the oil-rich region by dispatching a
series of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the CIA, George Tennet, and the FBI's director,
Louis Freeh, both visited the region immediately after the Russian
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hot on their heels came Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, who travelled to the capitals of Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and
Uzbekistan this week.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission was to discuss regional security and democracy with
the three countries' authoritarian presidents. Each was offered $3
million to assist in dealing with an increasing cross-border flow
of weapons, drugs and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the carrot came the stick: Mrs. Albright
admonished the presidents for the manifest shortcomings of recent
elections in all three countries, for persecuting political
opponents and, in Uzbekistan, for using the threat of Islamic
fundamentalism and terrorism to repress the Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Central Asian presidents were evidently flattered
by such a high-level American charm offensive, it may not have the
desired result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is our God-given neighbor,'' says Nursultan Nazarbaev,
Kazakhstan's president. He would like to establish a political and
economic partnership with Russia, but also enjoy close relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia matters, not least because a third of the country's
population is Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Kirgizstan, one of the smaller countries in Central Asia, also
has little choice about where to look for friends. Last autumn,
hundreds of Islamic militants invaded southern Kirgizstan, taking
four Japanese geologists hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were caught unprepared and Kirgizstan's
president, Askar Akaev, asked Russia for help. After two months,
the hostages were released and the kidnappers escaped to
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before Mrs. Albright's arrival in Kirgizstan, Russia's
spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, had met Akaev in the
capital, Bishkek, and Uzbekistan's president, Islam Karimov, in the
Uzbek capital, Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed joint measures to combat terrorism and religious
extremism. Yastrzhembsky believes that there is a connection
between the rebels in Chechnya, the incursion in Kirgizstan and
terrorist bombings in Uzbekistan in February last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's argument that democracy is the best defense
against extremism probably fell on deaf ears in Uzbekistan. Karimov
has antagonized many of his citizens by muzzling any form of
opposition, arresting thousands after last year's bomb blasts, in
which he himself narrowly escaped death.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think his iron rule is at least partly responsible
for the extremism he is now struggling against. Russia says it is
ready to help and will do so without making demands for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The one issue on which America's dogged efforts to influence
Central Asia's leaders may pay off is oil.
</P>
<P>
   The American government is determined to decrease Central Asia's
dependence on Russia's pipelines for transporting oil to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbaev, who would like to see several pipelines built so that
Kazakhstan can be as independent as possible, has reiterated his
commitment to a 1,730-km (1,075-mile) oil pipeline to run from
Azerbaijan's capital Baku on the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is due to start next year, but the pipeline will be
economic only if Kazakhstan commits 20 million tons of oil a year
to the project. Recently, its officials have seemed to be backing
away from any such commitment, perhaps because they think
Kazakhstan will not be able to produce enough oil, at least before
2004.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States cannot stop Russia from resuming a leading
role in Central Asia, the Americans hope they can at least prevent
a reunification with Russia of some of the former Soviet republics.
They may not succeed even in this aim.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin became Russia's acting president at the end of last
year, Slavic organizations in Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan called for
referendums on joining the Russia-Belarus Union. Though there is
little support for this among the non-Slav population, many people
feel that their future would be safer under Russian protection.
</P>
<P>
   Independence is attractive, but the countries of Central Asia,
with small populations in relation to their size, feel vulnerable
to Islamic ambitions from Afghanistan. China, too, a giant
neighbor, is historically distrusted by Central Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be a friend, but it is far away. &QL;

   BALTIMORE _ Some movie trivia: What's the common thread
connecting ``The Blair Witch Project'' and ``Runaway Bride'' and
``Patriot Games'' and ``Hairspray'' and ``Tin Men'' and Alfred
Hitchcock's 1964 thriller ``Marnie''?
</P>
<P>
   Two thumbs up for those who knew that all were filmed in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Better known for its Chesapeake Bay oysters and crabs and for
its baseball Orioles, this scenically diverse state has been a
favorite locale for filmmakers for nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Gary Cooper portrayed a waterman in ``The First Kiss,''
which was filmed in St. Michaels, a fishing village on the Eastern
Shore of the Bay. Shirley Temple came to this historic city in 1949
to play a suffragist in ``Adventure in Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sissy Spacek and Kevin Kline filmed ``Violets Are Blue'' in the
beach resort of Ocean City in 1986. In the 1998 ``Enemy of the
State,'' Will Smith drove a car in a ventilator shaft below the
Fort Henry Harbor Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The state's supporting role in movies is entertainingly examined
in ``Filming Maryland,'' an exhibition that opened here this month
at the Maryland Historical Society Museum and will run through Oct.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the first movie shot in Maryland _ the 1908 short
``Barbara Freitchie: The Story of a Patriotic Woman'' _ the exhibit
traces a cinematic culture stretching to last year's surprise hit,
``The Blair Witch Project,'' shot in tiny Burkittsville.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Maryland moviemaking has been boosted by two
home-grown directors who have located many of their works in
Baltimore. Through these films, John Waters and Barry Levinson have
become as closely associated with their hometown as Woody Allen has
with New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never want to live anywhere but Baltimore,'' said
Waters, whose distinctive films ``Pink Flamingoes,'' ``Hairspray,''
``Serial Mom,'' ``Cry Baby'' and ``Pecker'' were all set here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look far and wide, but you'll never discover a
stranger city with such extreme style. It's as if every eccentric
in the South decided to move north, ran out of gas in Baltimore,
and decided to stay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson calls Baltimore his ``homeland'' and describes the city
as a unique setting for telling universal stories.
</P>
<P>
   His 1990 ``Avalon'' is a multi-generational story beginning with
Levinson's immigrant grandfather arriving in Baltimore. Up through
his 1999 ``Liberty Heights,'' the director says, his works contain
stories that ``are sort of Baltimore mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   During an all-night Baltimore shoot for his 1987 ``Tin Men,''
Levinson recalls, neighborhood folks came to the street with
soft-shell crab sandwiches for Danny DeVito, Richard Dreyfuss and
other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   The museum exhibit links Waters and Levinson with Baltimore
through their writings and videotaped appearances as well as with
film clips and artifacts from their movies. Their films grow from
their roots in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Waters used Baltimore TV's real ``Buddy Dean Show'' from the
early 1960s as the inspiration for the ``Corney Collins Show''
where Ricki Lake danced with other teen-agers in beehives and
ducktails in ``Hairspray.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual Baltimore diner where Levinson and his buddies hung
out in 1958 was gone when he got around to filming his
coming-of-age movie in 1981. The namesake eatery in the movie
``Diner'' was brought in from New Jersey, but now serves french
fries with gravy at the corner of Holliday and Saratoga Streets in
the filmmaker's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all filmmakers who work in Maryland are native
sons. Outsiders come for the varied locations.
</P>
<P>
   In filming ``Runaway Bride'' in Maryland, director Garry
Marshall found that the Worchester County villages of Berlin and
Snow Hill could be combined into fictitious Hale, hometown of
altar-wary Julia Roberts. Meanwhile, Baltimore masqueraded as New
York in street scenes for newspaper reporter Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Compact but full of ``visual diversity,'' Maryland has a
reputation with directors as being a sort of ``America in
miniature,'' explained Jed Dietz, president of the Maryland
Producers Club and a contributor to the museum exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey's rural Ohio homestead in the 1998 ``Beloved'' was
actually located at the Fair Hill Natural Resources Area in Cecil
County. The 19th-century New York portrayed in ``Washington
Square'' was actually Baltimore's Union Square and nearby historic
brick homes. The Paris scene in that 1997 Disney movie was shot in
Baltimore's Mount Vernon Place.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 ``Absolute Power,'' Clint Eastwood supposedly
sketches at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, but is
really at downtown Baltimore's Walters Art Gallery. Baltimore
serves as Dublin, Ireland, in ``Violets are Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Major League II,'' Baltimore's Camden Yards subs as the
home field for the Cleveland Indians. In ``Random Hearts,'' the
fateful Potomac plane crash was filmed at Maryland's Patapsco
River. In ``Guarding Tess,'' the Ohio home of First Lady Shirley
MacLaine was actually located in Baltimore's Mt. Washington
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing imposter locations, Maryland strives to
be an accommodating host to filmmakers, Dietz said. He recalled how
director and actor Jodie Foster was riding around Baltimore with
Jack Gerbes, a location scout with the Maryland Film Commission, in
preparation for shooting the 1995 movie, ``Home for the Holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster spotted a house on Hartford Road that she wanted to
examine. So, without any notice, Gerbes knocked on the door.
</P>
<P>
   A friendly couple answered, invited Foster inside, fed her
homemade cookies and played songs for her on an organ in their
living room, said Dietz. That house became the model for the film's
main interior soundstage.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Dietz said the film industry generates about $75 million a year
for the Maryland economy, about as much as provided by the
Baltimore Orioles operation.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Tremont Plaza Hotel has cultivated this cinematic
trade. Two floors have been turned into production offices for
visiting film crews, and a movie theater was built so directors can
review every day's filming.
</P>
<P>
   Many movies have been shot in Maryland simply because that's
where the story takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been 12 to 15 'Annapolis stories' _ all with
essentially the same plot'' about rival midshipmen wooing the same
girl and enduring the rigors of the Naval Academy, said Leith
Johnson, the exhibit's curator. Midshipmen have been portrayed by
leading men ranging from Johnny Mack Brown to John Derek, and all
have acted in scenes shot in Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' Meg Ryan plays a Baltimore Sun
reporter, so some scenes are shot at the paper and in the city. In
``He Said, She Said,'' Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Perkins also
portray Baltimore journalists, so that comedy focuses on the city.
Alfred Hitchcock thought the Baltimore waterfront would provide a
foreboding setting for ``Marnie'' and even researched hairstyles of
working-class women in the city for Tippi Hedren in the thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the state provided the horse-racing locales in the
1940 movie ``Maryland,'' starring Walter Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   Composing a list of all the movies made in Maryland has been a
challenge, Johnson said. He came up with 150 in preparing
literature for the exhibit _ and learned of four more shortly after
sending the list to the printer.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's filmography ``is a work in progress,'' he said.

   ASTANA _ The election victory last month of Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, was hailed by the presidents of the
ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. But in private they are anxious
to see what policies Putin will have in store for Russia's former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The American government, however, has wasted no time in
asserting its interests in the oil-rich region by dispatching a
series of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the CIA, George Tennet, and the FBI's director,
Louis Freeh, both visited the region immediately after the Russian
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hot on their heels came Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, who travelled to the capitals of Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and
Uzbekistan this week.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission was to discuss regional security and democracy with
the three countries' authoritarian presidents. Each was offered $3
million to assist in dealing with an increasing cross-border flow
of weapons, drugs and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the carrot came the stick: Mrs. Albright
admonished the presidents for the manifest shortcomings of recent
elections in all three countries, for persecuting political
opponents and, in Uzbekistan, for using the threat of Islamic
fundamentalism and terrorism to repress the Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Central Asian presidents were evidently flattered
by such a high-level American charm offensive, it may not have the
desired result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is our God-given neighbor,'' says Nursultan Nazarbaev,
Kazakhstan's president. He would like to establish a political and
economic partnership with Russia, but also enjoy close relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia matters, not least because a third of the country's
population is Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Kirgizstan, one of the smaller countries in Central Asia, also
has little choice about where to look for friends. Last autumn,
hundreds of Islamic militants invaded southern Kirgizstan, taking
four Japanese geologists hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were caught unprepared and Kirgizstan's
president, Askar Akaev, asked Russia for help. After two months,
the hostages were released and the kidnappers escaped to
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before Mrs. Albright's arrival in Kirgizstan, Russia's
spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, had met Akaev in the
capital, Bishkek, and Uzbekistan's president, Islam Karimov, in the
Uzbek capital, Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed joint measures to combat terrorism and religious
extremism. Yastrzhembsky believes that there is a connection
between the rebels in Chechnya, the incursion in Kirgizstan and
terrorist bombings in Uzbekistan in February last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's argument that democracy is the best defense
against extremism probably fell on deaf ears in Uzbekistan. Karimov
has antagonized many of his citizens by muzzling any form of
opposition, arresting thousands after last year's bomb blasts, in
which he himself narrowly escaped death.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think his iron rule is at least partly responsible
for the extremism he is now struggling against. Russia says it is
ready to help and will do so without making demands for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The one issue on which America's dogged efforts to influence
Central Asia's leaders may pay off is oil.
</P>
<P>
   The American government is determined to decrease Central Asia's
dependence on Russia's pipelines for transporting oil to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbaev, who would like to see several pipelines built so that
Kazakhstan can be as independent as possible, has reiterated his
commitment to a 1,730-km (1,075-mile) oil pipeline to run from
Azerbaijan's capital Baku on the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is due to start next year, but the pipeline will be
economic only if Kazakhstan commits 20 million tons of oil a year
to the project. Recently, its officials have seemed to be backing
away from any such commitment, perhaps because they think
Kazakhstan will not be able to produce enough oil, at least before
2004.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States cannot stop Russia from resuming a leading
role in Central Asia, the Americans hope they can at least prevent
a reunification with Russia of some of the former Soviet republics.
They may not succeed even in this aim.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin became Russia's acting president at the end of last
year, Slavic organizations in Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan called for
referendums on joining the Russia-Belarus Union. Though there is
little support for this among the non-Slav population, many people
feel that their future would be safer under Russian protection.
</P>
<P>
   Independence is attractive, but the countries of Central Asia,
with small populations in relation to their size, feel vulnerable
to Islamic ambitions from Afghanistan. China, too, a giant
neighbor, is historically distrusted by Central Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be a friend, but it is far away. &QL;

   MELBOURNE _ Twenty-five years after the fall of South Vietnam to
the Communists, and the ignominious American flight from Saigon,
the fear that other non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia would
topple like a row of dominoes seems farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Communist-ruled Vietnam and Laos have joined the
Association of South-East Asian Nations, the group of non-Communist
countries that they previously castigated and threatened to
subvert.
</P>
<P>
   But what would have happened if U.S. President Lyndon Johnson,
faced with the awful choice of opting in or out of Vietnam so early
in his presidency, had elected not to fight?
</P>
<P>
   Soon after dawn on Aug. 17, 1964, a crowd began gathering in
Merdeka Square outside the gleaming white presidential palace in
the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, when President Sukarno, the self-styled Great
Leader of the Revolution, mounted the podium to deliver his annual
independence day address, the crowd had grown to a million.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno once said that to intoxicate the masses was what he
lived for. Never before had he succeeded so well, and never would
he again. His address, interrupted by frequent applause, took three
hours to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery leader called 1964 ``A Year of Living Dangerously,'' a
title that was both apt at the time and prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, Indonesia had landed 50 guerrillas on
the west coast of the Malayan peninsula, striking for the first
time against the heartland of Malaysia, which then included
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno was launching an armed ``confrontation'' against what he
claimed was a British-sponsored neocolonial federation. Three weeks
later the air force followed with an airdrop of paratroops into
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed in the media by events in Vietnam, the southern
tier of Southeast Asia came close to war.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet Union and China had become bitter rivals,
Sukarno and the Indonesian Communist Party, with its 3 million
members and 10 million sympathizers, turned to China and received a
warm response.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Sukarno proclaimed the year of living dangerously,
the People's Daily in Beijing, speaking for the Chinese Communist
Party, linked the Malaysian and Vietnam crises as joint struggles
against U.S. imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival in Jakarta of Marshal Chen Yi, the Chinese foreign
minister, in October 1964, marked the start of violent
anti-American demonstrations in Indonesia. These were followed by
the establishment of what became known as a Beijing-Jakarta axis.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia walked out of the United Nations and formed an
alliance with China to make Jakarta the world center of
anti-imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta warned that if Britain, which had substantial military
forces in Malaysia, attacked Indonesia during its confrontation
with Malaysia, Chinese forces would intervene directly while
Beijing stirred up revolutionary elements in other parts of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai arrived in Jakarta in April
1965 to advise Sukarno to create a ``people's army'' outside the
control of the regular army, which remained anti-Communist although
it was being infiltrated by leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of weapons, shipped in from China as building equipment,
were distributed to Communist youth and women's units in Indonesia.
Communists took control of Antara, the official Indonesian news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of troops moved into eastern Sumatra, posing a
threat to the west coast of the Malayan peninsula. In Kalimantan,
the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo, some 15 battalions
took up positions close to the Malaysian states of Sabah and
Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
   All of this occurred when the situation in South Vietnam was
deteriorating rapidly. The Vietcong had become strong enough to
mount terror attacks in the heart of Saigon. They were also
threatening to cut South Vietnam in two. Regular North Vietnamese
forces were for the first time moving into the South.
</P>
<P>
   Without heavy American intervention, the war in Vietnam was
lost. Washington had two options: It could bow in massively or bow
out. President Johnson decided to intensify U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Jakarta, only the generals stood in the path of vigorous
pursuit of the revolution that Sukarno demanded. In a speech on the
night of Sept. 30, 1965, he called for those military leaders to be
crushed. That night six generals were killed in an attempted coup
in which the Communists were deeply involved.
</P>
<P>
   General Suharto, who led the successful countercoup, was
fortuitously left off the death list prepared by the coup planners.
He quickly took control.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia went into reverse gear. The Beijing-Jakarta axis
collapsed, and ``confrontation'' with Malaysia ended. Tens of
thousands of Communists were massacred and the party was banned.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly relations were re-established with the United States,
and Indonesia joined Malaysia and Singapore in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Marshall Green, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia at
this tumultuous time, wrote that a ``successful Sino-Indonesian
alliance would have created a great Communist pincer in Southeast
Asia, with the largest and fifth largest countries in the world
enclosing not only Vietnam but also the vulnerable countries of
mainland Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had withdrawn from Vietnam before the
attempted Indonesian coup, the effect would have been to strengthen
Sukarno's pro-Communist stance and his determination, with Chinese
backing, to crush Malaysia. It would have undermined the will and
means of the Indonesian generals to resist the Communist takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the late Indonesian foreign minister Adam Malik,
who became vice president under General Suharto, if the attempted
coup against the Indonesian generals had not taken place, Sukarno
would soon have presided over a Communist Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of Southeast Asia the situation was precarious. Laos
was all but in Communist hands. In Cambodia, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk had decided that Hanoi would win in Vietnam and had thrown
in his lot with China. Thailand faced a Beijing-sponsored war of
national liberation. And across the Strait of Malacca from
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia had separated bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely then that Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand,
caught in the pincers that Green referred to, would not have
survived the pressure. The dominoes would have fallen. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, on April 17, 1975, I was in
Phnom Penh. It was a city that had been under siege for months, a
place of fear and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge rockets rained down daily, bringing random death,
injury and destruction. The population had been swollen to 3
million, mainly by people fleeing the war-torn countryside.
</P>
<P>
   We were warned that Phnom Penh's defenses could not hold out
much longer. I remember hearing a Voice of America radio broadcast
in which President Gerald Ford warned Congress in a somber tone
that the situation in both Cambodia and South Vietnam had reached a
critical phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options before us are few and time is very short,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I was working as a Cambodian staff member of the American aid
agency CARE. I had my chance to leave Phnom Penh. In the early
morning of April 12, a U.S. Embassy official told me that I had to
get to the embassy within an hour if I wanted to be evacuated from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The American staff of CARE had gone, leaving the management of
its multimillion dollar program in our hands. My mind was on the
plight of more than 3,000 refugee families in the provincial town
of Kampong Speu.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Khmer Rouge tightened their noose around Phnom Penh,
we had been able to arrange trucks to carry food and medical
supplies to these refugees. Now the road had been cut and I was
preoccupied with a meeting that morning to finalize an airlift of
supplies instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, I suddenly realized that I was running
late for the rendezvous at the U.S. Embassy. I arrived just in time
to see the last of the evacuation helicopters taking off. There was
no other way out. I was trapped, like everyone else in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   People prayed that the Cambodian New Year that started the
following day would turn a fresh page in Cambodia's recently
tormented history. We knew that the war would soon be over. But we
did not know whether its end would bring peace or more death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, Khmer Rouge soldiers clad in black pajamas and
carrying AK-47 assault rifles walked into the city. Many were just
teenagers. People thought that between Cambodians we could work
things out.
</P>
<P>
   I went to one of the city's main hotels, where the Red Cross had
set up a neutral zone. I spent the day helping its staff in the
emergency room in one of the bungalows. Later that afternoon the
Khmer Rouge ordered the entire city emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Our family group of 16 left that night along with thousands of
others. Imagine 3 million people trying to get out of the city.
Among the forced evacuees were huge numbers of women, children,
elderly and infirm _ even thousands of hospital patients, many
seriously ill or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   This forced march was desperately slow. It took us 10 days to
get to Tonle Bati, usually reached from Phnom Penh in an hour. This
was just the beginning of the Killing Fields.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, also fell to
the communists.
</P>
<P>
   The next 10 months were a time of unimaginable horror in
Cambodia. I managed to survive by disguising my identity and slowly
working my way westwards towards the border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1976, I crossed into Thailand, joining other
Cambodians in refugee camps there. Later, I was taken to America.
But of the 16 members of my family, I was the only one to make it
to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Have Cambodia and Vietnam learned any lessons from this terrible
period?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alliance between the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese
communists during the years of the war in Indochina, both countries
underwent internal purges and fought against each other. The
conflict resulted in a 10-year occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cambodia and Vietnam have mended their relations.
Both are now members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, and espouse market economics. Both have relative stability
and considerable economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam's communist rule and its inability to end corruption
and bureaucratic red tape scare away many investors. Cambodia, too,
has governance problems. Yet even its less-than-fair elections have
awakened the population to the importance of having their voices
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cambodia and Vietnam must accept the bright light of
accountability and transparency before they can enjoy the full
benefits of democratic prosperity _ and be sure that the dark
period of their recent history is never repeated. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, on April 17, 1975, I was in
Phnom Penh. It was a city that had been under siege for months, a
place of fear and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge rockets rained down daily, bringing random death,
injury and destruction. The population had been swollen to 3
million, mainly by people fleeing the war-torn countryside.
</P>
<P>
   We were warned that Phnom Penh's defenses could not hold out
much longer. I remember hearing a Voice of America radio broadcast
in which President Gerald Ford warned Congress in a somber tone
that the situation in both Cambodia and South Vietnam had reached a
critical phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options before us are few and time is very short,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I was working as a Cambodian staff member of the American aid
agency CARE. I had my chance to leave Phnom Penh. In the early
morning of April 12, a U.S. Embassy official told me that I had to
get to the embassy within an hour if I wanted to be evacuated from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The American staff of CARE had gone, leaving the management of
its multimillion dollar program in our hands. My mind was on the
plight of more than 3,000 refugee families in the provincial town
of Kampong Speu.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Khmer Rouge tightened their noose around Phnom Penh,
we had been able to arrange trucks to carry food and medical
supplies to these refugees. Now the road had been cut and I was
preoccupied with a meeting that morning to finalize an airlift of
supplies instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, I suddenly realized that I was running
late for the rendezvous at the U.S. Embassy. I arrived just in time
to see the last of the evacuation helicopters taking off. There was
no other way out. I was trapped, like everyone else in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   People prayed that the Cambodian New Year that started the
following day would turn a fresh page in Cambodia's recently
tormented history. We knew that the war would soon be over. But we
did not know whether its end would bring peace or more death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, Khmer Rouge soldiers clad in black pajamas and
carrying AK-47 assault rifles walked into the city. Many were just
teenagers. People thought that between Cambodians we could work
things out.
</P>
<P>
   I went to one of the city's main hotels, where the Red Cross had
set up a neutral zone. I spent the day helping its staff in the
emergency room in one of the bungalows. Later that afternoon the
Khmer Rouge ordered the entire city emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Our family group of 16 left that night along with thousands of
others. Imagine 3 million people trying to get out of the city.
Among the forced evacuees were huge numbers of women, children,
elderly and infirm _ even thousands of hospital patients, many
seriously ill or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   This forced march was desperately slow. It took us 10 days to
get to Tonle Bati, usually reached from Phnom Penh in an hour. This
was just the beginning of the Killing Fields.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, also fell to
the communists.
</P>
<P>
   The next 10 months were a time of unimaginable horror in
Cambodia. I managed to survive by disguising my identity and slowly
working my way westwards towards the border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1976, I crossed into Thailand, joining other
Cambodians in refugee camps there. Later, I was taken to America.
But of the 16 members of my family, I was the only one to make it
to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Have Cambodia and Vietnam learned any lessons from this terrible
period?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alliance between the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese
communists during the years of the war in Indochina, both countries
underwent internal purges and fought against each other. The
conflict resulted in a 10-year occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cambodia and Vietnam have mended their relations.
Both are now members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, and espouse market economics. Both have relative stability
and considerable economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam's communist rule and its inability to end corruption
and bureaucratic red tape scare away many investors. Cambodia, too,
has governance problems. Yet even its less-than-fair elections have
awakened the population to the importance of having their voices
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cambodia and Vietnam must accept the bright light of
accountability and transparency before they can enjoy the full
benefits of democratic prosperity _ and be sure that the dark
period of their recent history is never repeated. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

INVESTING IN CONSUMABLES  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My job today is to decide what to do with all the money I saved
by not investing in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   While others were throwing their money away on dot-com this or
dot-com that, I was wisely investing in frozen chickens and
unleaded gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   As of this moment (Monday morning), I have 2 chickens in my
freezer. By the time you read this, they could be worth more than
100 shares of Microsoft stock. I also have approximately half a
tank of unleaded in my 1990 Oldsmobile. It was a costly investment,
sure, but I wanted my family to be well provided for once I'm gone.
</P>
<P>
   I am no financial analyst, but I wouldn't be surprised if, by
today, my half-tank of unleaded is worth more than a wheelbarrow
full of Peapod or Fogdog, whatever they are.
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean to gloat, but I also invested a substantial
portion of my nest egg ($83.14) in laundry detergent. Technology
stocks are trendy, sure, but the satisfaction that comes from
whiter whites and brighter brights never grows old.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say I am opposed to the occasional ``risky''
investment. Just yesterday, I paid a mechanic $8.50 to pull a screw
out of my left-rear tire. It was risky because you never know when
you're going to run over another screw or nail and have to pay a
mechanic another $8.50 to do it all over again. A more conservative
investor might have waited until he had collected several screws
and nails in his tire and then had them all taken out at once,
presumably at a rate much lower than the $8.50-per-screw charge.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is not the way I operate. If I see that I've run
over a screw or nail (it's easy to tell because the tire is flat),
I have it removed as quickly as possible. This is just one of the
many things I do to keep the economy humming and spread the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, if not likely, that the stock market's fall will
have reversed itself by the time you read this and my investment
strategy of frozen chickens and unleaded gasoline will fall in
public opinion from ``visionary'' to ``bone-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The world economy is extremely volatile these days and canny
investors such as myself have to be flexible and open-minded. If my
investment portfolio of frozen chickens and unleaded gasoline is
not yielding the returns I demand and expect, then I will simply
have to find more profitable ways of investing my $83.14.
</P>
<P>
   There are many possibilities. I could buy 100 rolls of toilet
paper or 6 Pokemon cards. I could run the air conditioner for about
10 days, replace the boy's skateboarding shoes that he wore out in
less than a month, buy flea pills for the dog, get the lawn mower
fixed or rent a movie, forget to take it back, and pay a month of
late charges.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification is the key to any successful investment
strategy. That way, if your toilet-paper futures tank, so to speak,
you've always got a Pokemon card or a half-tank of unleaded
gasoline to stave off financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a moment today to jam a couple of fryers into the back of
the freezer might not be such a bad idea, either.

WWTBAM IS A SOFTWARE HIT, TOO  
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the best-selling game software for the past few months?
Before giving your final answer, do you want to use one of your
three lifelines?
</P>
<P>
   Who Wants To Be A Millionaire CD-ROM (Windows; about $15-$20) is
as big a hit on the computer monitor as it has been on television
screens. It's dominated the top of the software best-seller list
since its debut late last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a hit, in fact, that the distributor, Disney
Interactive, has announced that a sequel, WWTBAM 2nd Edition, will
be out sometime next month. For fans of this hot trivia show, the
first version has enough going for it to recommend the second
version sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the CD version is hosted by Regis Philbin. Yes, there is
the same ``fastest finger'' round where contestants seek to put
four items in the right sequence in the fastest time in order to
play the game. (Up to 26 players can compete in the round to see
who gets to take the first shot at the prize.) Yes, players can get
lifelines. Yes, it is the same 15-question format leading to a top
prize.
</P>
<P>
   No, you do not get a check for $1 million from Regis if you make
it to the top of the CD's game ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the questions are just as interesting as the ones on
television: What type of animal is a humuhumunukunukuapuaa? A.
turtle; B. bird; C. fish; D. monkey. (Answer at the end of the
column.)
</P>
<P>
   The game moves along quickly. The stage setting and music have
been transported to the computer monitor so that the show becomes
interactive with the home player.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin will provide one-sided chatter during the game
including, of course, his ``Final answer?'' trademark. He'll also
make some deflating comments when players bomb out on low rounds
and ask if players want to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Each question also must be answered within a set amount of time.
That's mainly to provide equal competition if several people are
playing separate rounds for a high score. If you don't have enough
time and want to cheat, pressing the escape key pauses the program.
</P>
<P>
   Another cheat: Typing in no name when starting a game will
result in the name ``Kathy Lee'' being displayed and easier
questions being used; typing ``John Carpenter'' will trigger a
harder set of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, you may recall, was the first contestant to ever
reach the seven-figure goal, including all contestants on the
original British telecasts. He's also the one who used his lifeline
to call his father, not to ask for help on the final question, but
to say, ``Dad, I'm about to win the million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The three lifelines have been transposed from the television
show to the computer with minimum degradation. The 50/50 is easy
enough to do: The computer simply takes away two wrong answers.
Since the home player doesn't have an audience to ask, game
designers conducted an online poll prior to publishing the CD in
which visitors to a Web site were asked to select their answers to
the questions. The graphs show up on screen when a player uses that
lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Use the Phone-a-Friend lifeline and Regis will place the call.
Philbin and a prerecorded voice will make small talk, and then the
prerecorded ``friend'' will give the answer to the question.
Sometimes, the friend is dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   You can also play Millionaire online at the ABC Web site:
www.abc.com. You'll need Flash 4 loaded on your computer and have
to endure some advertising to get to the game site. Once there, you
might find that ``today's featured game'' or previous games may not
be currently available because of heavy traffic on the site.
</P>
<P>
   As for the answer to the question earlier in the column, the
humuhumunukunukuapuaa is a fish _ the state fish of Hawaii, in
fact. It's pronounced WHO-moo-WHO-moo-NEW-coo-NEW-coo-AH-poo-AH-ah.
The first part of the word means ``fit pieces together'' because
the fish is colored in sections that look like puzzle pieces. The
second part of the name means ``snout like a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's my final answer.
</P>

<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ In her first year on the job, Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute President Shirley Ann Jackson has amassed a
Washington-style team of assistants and corporate perks to
accommodate what school officials are calling a high-octane
schedule of travel, speeches and corporate meetings.
</P>
<P>
   New positions created by Jackson include a chief of staff, a
speech writer who once worked for FBI Director Louis Freeh and two
``personal security specialists,'' who also share duties as
Jackson's driver.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, formerly the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, called herself the ``Energizer Bunny'' upon landing the
RPI job in December 1998. To trustees and faculty, the support
staff is necessary to help her fulfill her promise of shoring up
the school's international reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the school had been run for the past 10 to 15 years the way
it is now, we may not have needed Shirley Ann Jackson,'' said
Warren Bruggeman, a retired vice president of the General Electric
Co. and RPI trustee. ``Her job is to enhance the image of the
university. If she can do that by being with influential people,
God bless her.''
</P>
<P>
   As the former head of a federal agency and the first black woman
to lead a major research university, Jackson also is in high-demand
to appear for speeches and academic panels.
</P>
<P>
   Her combination of ingredients and breadth of commitments are
rare, but so far, faculty members are not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get used to a president that's not here all the
time,'' said Michael Hanna, president of the faculty senate.
``That's a real change. We need her to be the external face of the
university, and you can't do that by staying in Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was head of the NRC from 1995 to 1999, and aspects of
the team she has formed at RPI resemble her Washington support
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Security is one example. Two veteran cops take turns setting up
protection for Jackson and prominent visitors to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Officials added that as a former high-profile Washington
official, Jackson must continue to stay on guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, a woman alone driving in Washington, D.C., Chicago or
Troy is faced with dangers you and I are not,'' said RPI spokesman
Bruce Adams. ``The fact is, she happens to be on the go an awful
lot. You don't want your president walking three blocks to get a
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Other new RPI officials help free up Jackson's schedule for
speeches and fund-raising engagements. Robin Sparks, a former
assistant to the FBI director and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
is Jackson's full-time speech writer. And Cynthia McIntyre, a
former professor of physics at George Mason University in Virginia,
serves as her chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations for Jackson also extend to the personal front.
The RPI president was recently able to bring her husband home after
six months of a long-distance relationship. Morris Washington, a
photonics expert from Lucent Technologies Labs in New Jersey,
became assistant director of RPI's Center for Integrated
Electronics and Electronics Manufacturing in January.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nine months since Jackson started her job at RPI _
perhaps too short a time to tell if RPI's investment is paying off.
But so far, so good, faculty say.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Jackson jump-started a strategic plan designed
to put RPI on the map in information technology and biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of her ``ambassadorship'' for the school extends to
the business world. Since she came to RPI, she has been invited to
sit on four corporate boards, including FedEx Corp. That alone
would be an ambitious load for a university president, but she is
also a lifetime trustee of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and sits on the Council on Competitiveness and the
Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable of the National
Academies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Charles Vest, president of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, sits on two corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   Board positions can be lucrative, but RPI officials would not

come in addition to Jackson's regular salary, which officials would
not release. Pipes, her predecessor, made $288,000 in 1998.

situation. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI (Miami) _ After Elian: Who wins, who loses in
Miami? The mayors may have won with their constituents, but lost on
a national stage. The federal government did not trust them enough
to notify them of the raid. The Miami relatives will go into the
May 11 court hearing without the advantage of actually having Elian
in their possession. So maybe the only clear winner is Fidel
Castro. By Rick Bragg.

control. By Marc Lacey.

is down 1.09 percent. Treasury prices are slightly higher, except

   MEXICO-TV (Mexico City) _ Not even his own father was sure that

giant that has loomed large over Mexican life for half a century.
When his father, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, died in April 1997, he had
not tapped his 29-year-old son to succeed him as chairman. What he
did bequeath to his son was a bloated and stumbling company, debts
estimated at $1.3 billion and a tangled estate that generated a
struggle among the heirs. Now, just three years later, the junior
Azcarraga is the undisputed leader of Televisa. And he has righted
Televisa largely by departing from the autocratic and freewheeling
ways of his father, imposing costs controls and running the company
as a ``directed democracy.'' By Julia Preston.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, April 25:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DROUGHT (Undated) _ Tornadoes, hurricanes and floods are the
stuff of television drama; they make people sit up and take notice.
Not so with drought. It is a far more subtle weather catastrophe
and consequently commands little awe or respect. But in an average
year drought is responsible for about as much economic damage as
floods and hurricanes combined. Nor is it a rare phenomenon.
Instead, it is a persistent and permanent feature of weather and
climate, severely affecting some part of the United States almost
every year. By William K. Stevens. (2200 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FERRET-BRAINS (Undated) _ Scientists at MIT have
reconfigured newborn ferret brains so that the animals' eyes are
hooked up to brain regions where hearing normally develops. The
surprising result is that the ferrets see the world with brain
tissue that was only thought capable of hearing sounds. The
findings contradict popular theories on how animal brains develop
specialized regions for seeing, hearing, sensing touch and, in
humans, generating language and emotional states. By Sandra
Blakeslee. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEDICAL-REPORTS (Undated) _ Commentary: Two recent studies
have debunked long-held assumptions about preventive medicine:
benefits of postmenopausal estrogen in preventing heart disease and
of high-fiber diets in preventing colon cancer. Now, some
scientists and other experts are warning caution in describing
medical findings, unless results are pinned down by randomized,
double-blind, long-studies that show definitive results. By Gina
Kolata. (950 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TRILOBITE-EXTINCTION (Undated) _ A quarter billion years
ago, some 90 percent of all animal species, including the
trilobites, the three-lobed predators of the sea, suddenly
disappeared in the worst of all mass extinctions. The killer's
identity has long been a mystery. But now scientists in Australia
have unearthed evidence that the culprit could have been a speeding
rock from outer space that slammed into the planet, carved out a
huge crater some 75 miles wide, and blasted millions of tons of
rock and dust into the sky, blotting out the sun. By William J.
Broad. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASEXUAL-CROPS (Undated) _ A small but growing number of
scientists are pursuing what they call the holy grail of
agriculture, which promises a ``revolution'' in world food
production. The goal is a plant that will reproduce asexually, so
that its seeds will grow into exact genetic copies, or clones, of
the parent. This process occurs naturally in hundreds of plants,
but the world's major food grains do not reproduce asexually. If
they could, some scientists say, it would greatly simplify crop
breeding: a high-yielding corn, wheat or rice plant could reproduce
itself unchanged for generations. By Andrew Pollack. (1635 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATH-PROBLEM (Undated) _ Mathematicians are competing to
prove Goldbach's conjecture, a beautiful conjecture about how
numbers fit together, a guess about the infinite. In 1742 a
little-known mathematician named Christian Goldbach wrote a letter
to Leonhard Euler in which he speculated that every even number
greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
For many mathematicians, the techniques invented and principles
illuminated by pursuing the proof of a hard problem are the real
rewards. But a $1 million prize doesn't hurt either. By Bruce
Schechter. (1170 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT2.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SPIN (Undated) _ A spinning disk has inspired a British
scientist to delve into the underlying mathematics, and now he has
devised a model to explain how the rolling speed can accelerate
even as the disc is losing energy. By Kenneth Chang. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT3.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIO-PROSPECTING (Undated) _ In a decision that could give a
boost to ``bio-prospecting'' in national parks, a federal judge has
upheld a precedent-setting agreement in which a biotechnology
company will pay Yellowstone National Park for the right to search
its geysers and hot springs for commercially valuable microbes. By
Andrew Pollack. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT4.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on new
shatterproof pods with potential to increase canola oil yields, a
report on dying trees in and near the Brazilian rain forests, and
.... By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEPRESSION-DRUGS (Undated) _ Psychiatrists and other experts
on depression have widely differing views on the value of Prozac
and other drugs used to treat depression. Critics of the drugs say
they do little more than a placebo; others insist the drugs work.
And maybe both are right: the drugs now available to treat
depression are effective, but not effective enough. By Erica Goode.
(820 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIFFICULT-PATIENTS (Undated) _ When doctors encounter
difficult patients sometimes they have few choices: generally they
can't just fire them like their bookkeeping staff. Usually only the
most egregious misbehavior: threats, violence, total noncompliance
qualify for dismissal of patients under AMA guidelines, which spill
over into the courtroom. But in some cases, it's just bad
chemistry. By Sandeep Jauhar, M.D. (1325 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NURSE-PRACTITIONERS (Undated) _ Nurse practitioners were the
focus of a study published in January in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, which found no significant
differences in the quality of care received by patients randomly
assigned to either doctors or nurse practitioners. Patients see
advantages in the nurses, who often have much more time to spend
with them and can work on prevention issues. By Tina Kelley. (1860
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HELTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: Some doctors are
getting more personal in taking medical histories, and this is a
positive sign. But still other questions need to be asked about
healthful habits like exercise, diet and stress. By Jane E. Brody.
(1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-TECH (Undated) _ A technology wave has hit exercise
equipment, and manufacturers have begun flooding the market with
gadgets for fitness buffs. Many of these exercise innovations were
unveiled at a recent sporting goods trade show. Along with the
retooled pedometer, manufacturers rolled out a talking heart
monitor; GetFit.com, a personalized, exercise Web site; iFit.com,
fitness equipment controlled digitally through a Web site; and a
Palm Pilot that keeps track of exercise programs and records to
name several. By Linda Villarosa. (1120 words)
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby ducklings and chicks can give children salmonella, the
CDC is warning consumers. (230 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT5.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who suffer from social anxiety disorder, a common
psychiatric ailment, realize that they have a problem but often
fail to seek treatment because of embarrassment or lack of
resources, a new study has found. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study shows that smaller hospitals are unclogging heart
arteries almost as well as large medical centers. Still, there
seems to be little effort to change guidelines for which centers
should perform the procedure. (325 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers at Stanford report in a study that they found
little correlation between the tears commonly found in people's
vertebral discs and the amount of pain reported. The findings were
reported at a recent meeting of the International Society for the
Study of the Lumbar Spine by Dr. Eugene Carragee. (260 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Brain research provides possible explanations for antisocial
aspects of autism: people with the condition often do not recognize
people's faces. (190 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: How are
expiration dates for medicines determined? Are expiration dates
simply inducements to repurchase? By C. Claiborne Ray. (300 words)

   LITERARY-OFFSPRING (Undated) _ Gautama Chopra freely admits that
his last name helped sell both his books. His first agent was a
friend of his father, the best-selling New Age guru Deepak Chopra.
His first publisher, Amber-Allen, was also the original publisher
of his father's blockbuster, ``The Seven Spiritual Laws of
Success.'' Gautama, 24, is not the only young writer capitalizing
on a literary lineage these days. There are Rice, Jong, Heller,
Updike, Bellow, Theroux, Styron and McPhee (make that three McPhee)
children writing, not to mention two Cheever siblings. All were
born with the most valuable asset a writer can have: access. By

   TEETH-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``White Teeth'' by the young

a nod to indie movies like ``My Beautiful Laundrette,'' a novel
that's not afraid to tackle large, unwieldy themes. Reviewed by

WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS SEIZURE AND TRANSFER OF ELIAN  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and the White House on Monday
defended the forceful tactics that the government used to seize
Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives on Saturday.
But critics continued denouncing the dawn raid in which federal
agents brandished assault rifles and filled nearby streets with
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried my level best to make sure we avoided this situation,
and if I bent over backward, so be it,'' Reno said on NBC's
``Today'' show. ``I'm satisfied with the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's television appearance signaled that while the custody
battle over the fate of Elian has ended on the streets of Miami,
the debate has only intensified in the media, where both sides have
been addressing the controversial raid that unfolded early Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she ``had no regrets whatsoever'' about ordering armed
federal agents to storm the home of Elian's relatives and to seize
the 6-year-old boy. Elian was reunited hours later with his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has taken a similar stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president is convinced that the operation that
took place Saturday morning was the right thing to do and was the
only alternative remaining to us to reunite the boy with his
father,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said at a news
conference Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father are living temporarily at Andrews Air Force
Base in Maryland and awaiting relocation by the government to an
undisclosed location. Gonzalez traveled from Cuba on April 6 to
reclaim his son, but he has said he would stay in the United States
until an Atlanta federal appellate court decides whether to make
the government grant Elian an asylum hearing. A court injunction
handed down last week also prevents the boy from leaving the
country until the judges make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The raid took place after hours of flurried negotiations between
Miami civic leaders and Reno over a plan for Gonzalez to live with
his son and the Miami relatives in a home in south Florida while
awaiting the outcome of the court case. Both sides have
acknowledged that they could not agree on where the family would
live and who would technically have custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told we would have a deal if we did certain things,
and we did it and it evaporated,'' Reno said. ``We did what we had
to, and we now need to move forward to give this little boy and his
father a chance to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron Podhurst, a friend of Reno's who acted as a spokesman
for the Miami relatives during telephone negotiations on Saturday
morning, said he had believed a deal was close at hand even as the
raid began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a deal was within minutes or an hour away,'' he said
on the ``Today'' show. ``I was shocked. I was disappointed. I
couldn't believe what I was looking at on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami family have said that they thought
negotiations were continuing up until the minute they heard
commotion outside the house. Several Republican congressmen have
appeared on television in the last two days criticizing the Clinton
administration's handling of the incident. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
called on Sunday for congressional hearings into the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, the presumed Republican
presidential candidate, also criticized the White House for its
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton's staff lashed back Monday against such
attacks, saying the Republicans had been making ``wildly
inaccurate'' statements. The White House also defended Reno's
decisions on Saturday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility _ everyone does _ to put out the
facts and try to separate the facts from the fiction,'' Lockhart
said. ``They did this having no other alternative given the
intransigent position of the Miami relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also defended Vice-President Al Gore's position on the
Elian custody battle, saying it was ``appropriate and was
limited.'' Gore recently supported a congressional bill that would
give Elian, his father and members of that family permanent
resident status in the United States during court hearings. But
Bush attacked Gore for his break from Clinton's position, saying it
was nothing more than an attempt to curry favor among Florida's
Cuban-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president believes that the vice-president has a
different point on this case,'' Lockhart said. He added that Gore's
stand ``was not anything like some of the overblown rhetoric that
we've seen from some others.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Elian's grandmothers expressed their celebratory mood
to the NBC television network in interviews Monday. The two women
traveled to the United States in January in a failed attempt to
persuade Elian's Miami relatives to hand the boy over.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did to my son, what they did to us, I'm never going
to forget it,'' Mariela Quintana told NBC through an interpreter.
``Even after I'm dead and buried, I won't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintana, who was speaking from her hometown of Cardenas, said
she was ``overwhelmed with emotion, pure happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, the other grandmother, said
they had spoken with Elian on the telephone since the reunion, and
that the boy finally sounded happy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father had been separated since November, when the
boy's mother, Elizabet Brotons, took him on an ill-fated attempt to
reach the United States on a smuggling boat. When the vessel
capsized, Brotons and 10 other Cubans drowned. But fishermen
discovered Elian clinging to an inner-tube on Nov. 25 off the
Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was given ``parole'' status by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and placed in the custody of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, in Miami. Like thousands of
Cuban-Americans who oppose President Fidel Castro's rule, Gonzalez
has been pushing for Elian to remain in the United States. He
recently defied government orders to hand over the boy, and has
asked the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to make the
INS grant the boy an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments beginning May 11.
Lazaro Gonzalez and close family members flew to Washington over
the weekend to talk with lawmakers and federal officials about
custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the streets of Miami remained relatively calm Monday
after a weekend of protests. The crowd of several thousand that had
gathered for several weeks outside Lazaro Gonzalez's Miami home had
dwindled to a lone protester by Monday morning, according to The
Associated Press. But more than 60 women dressed in black gathered
outside the federal courthouse in Miami, holding up placards with
the photo that has been widely reproduced of a federal agent
brandishing a rifle in front of a frightened Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``As mothers and children,'' said Sylvia Iriondo, a protest
organizer, ``we are here to condemn the child abuse perpetrated by
federal authorities.''

   OHIO'S SUMMER POTTERY SHOW DRAWS COLLECTORS FROM ALL OVER
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-POTTERY-TRAVEL-LIFEBEAT _ Summer gives pottery
collectors an opportunity to comb yard sales, sidewalk art
exhibitions and open-air flea markets for American art pottery. The
motherlode, however, can be found in Zanesville, Ohio, drawing
collectors from all over the country. For more than 20 years, fans
have come to this quiet river town to visit pottery-making
exhibitions, attend conventions and purchase pottery during a
week-long festival, which this year takes place from July 9 to July
16.

   CAN MARRIAGE SKILLS BE TAUGHT? SOME EDUCATORS TRY
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-LIFEBEAT _ In the United States, the divorce rate
exceeds the birth rate, the death rate, the inflation rate, the
prime rate and the unemployment rate combined. Concerned by the
fallout she saw amongst her own students, high school teacher
Charlene Kamper devised a three-week course called ``Connections:
Relationships and Marriage'' that is now used in 400 high schools
in 32 states and is just one of several such courses available. But
many experts believe that marital problems can neither be avoided
nor solved. Kamper agrees that she can't teach 18-year-olds about
marriage but adds, ``the lessons they learn here will give them a
much better chance of handling the lessons marriage has for them.''
</P>
<P>
   CAN NEWBORNS HEAR? DETECT PROBLEMS EARLY
</P>
<P>
   CHILDCARE-HEALTH-HEARING-LIFEBEAT _ Only half of babies born in
the United States have their hearing tested, yet three out of every
1,000 have serious problems. An equal number struggle with moderate
hearing loss. Unaddressed deafness can lead to learning and
socialization problems. However, babies as young as 4 weeks can be
fitted with hearing aids, and most children with hearing loss
develop normal speech and language if they get hearing aids early.
</P>
<P>
   AFTER 40, DROPPING TESTOSTERONE LEVELS MAY AFFECT HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-TESTOSTERONE-LIFEBEAT _ Testosterone levels in men often
decrease by 1 percent a year after age 40; by age 70, many men
produce only a third of what they once produced. Some research
indicates that men with higher levels of testosterone may be less
vulnerable to high blood pressure, heart attacks, frequent colds,
obesity, depression and osteoporosis. Although it isn't widely
known, testosterone-replacement therapy is available though it
isn't advisable for everyone. However, men should be aware of the
warning signs of low testosterone and head to a doctor if they
occur.

   Save antiques-mall crawls and Internet surfing for a rainy day:
Summer gives pottery collectors an opportunity to enjoy the great
outdoors as they comb yard sales, sidewalk art exhibitions and
open-air flea markets for American art pottery. The motherlode,
however, can be found in Zanesville, Ohio, drawing collectors from
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Every July, colorful glazed vases, mixing bowls, umbrella stands
and jardinieres are the attraction in this quiet river town which
has a population of 28,000. For more than 20 years, fans have
convened here to visit pottery-making exhibitions, attend
conventions and purchase pottery during a week-long festival known
locally as ``Pottery Week.'' This year, it takes place from July 9
to July 16.
</P>
<P>
   One of nature's most valuable gifts to Zanesville came in the
form of the rich deposits of high-quality Tionesta clay that
spawned southeastern Ohio's thriving pottery industry. Another was
the river access that made long-distance shipping of locally made
goods possible.
</P>
<P>
   The first pottery makers in the region were farmers who made
household necessities in tiny kiln-equipped sheds. But 22
commercial potteries already operated in Muskingum County by 1840.
When the Industrial Revolution brought coal and, later,
electric-powered potter's wheels and kilns into use, area
entrepreneurs with a taste for a little friendly or
fierce-competition wasted no time in combining the region's natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Their ingenuity enabled their factories to turn out the large
quantities of ceramic crocks, churns, mixing bowls, garden
ornaments, and ``fancy-glazed'' art pottery that would eventually
earn Zanesville the moniker ``Pottery Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, Muskingum County resident Sam Weller outfitted a log
cabin in Fultonham with a potter's wheel and a brick beehive-shaped
kiln. When business boomed, he built a new factory in Zanesville on
the banks of the Muskingum River. His factory was followed by many
more _ dozens of which went on to become household names among
collectors of 20th-century ceramics. Roseville, J.B. Owens, McCoy,
Watt, American Encaustic Tiling, Hull, Shawnee, Brush and the
still-thriving Robinson Ransbottom were among the potteries
headquartered in the county in the first half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Second World War, outmoded production
techniques, competition from inexpensive imports and the rising
popularity of unbreakable metal and plastic tableware and storage
pieces forced many of the once-booming businesses to close their
kilns for good. Utilitarian products became collectors' items.
</P>
<P>
   Large quantities of the wares remain in Muskingum County,
awaiting rediscovery by eagle-eyed ceramics lovers who know a
treasure when they spot one.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 20 years, a revived appreciation of southeastern
Ohio's pottery heritage has given rise to a new generation of local
potteries, including Hartstone, Inc. and Fioriware Art Pottery, as
well as a number of museums, galleries, and education centers
dedicated to preserving and celebrating the region's rich pottery
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Every July, as families across America gather for fun-filled
reunions and outdoor amusements, folks in Muskingum County host a
party of their own: a weeklong tribute to the natural resources and
innovative artisans and entrepreneurs that put Zanesville and its
environs on the map of pottery enthusiasts around the world.

<P>
   Only half of babies born in the United States have their hearing
tested, yet three out of every 1000 have serious problems. An equal
number struggle with moderate hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was something wrong with Jason when he was a
baby,'' says Raylette Pickett, whose son's hearing loss went
undetected for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors thought he might be autistic or have attention deficit
disorder. He fell behind in school and needed special education.''
</P>
<P>
   Very young infants typically make cooing and gurgling sounds and
turn toward a new noise. They tend to calm down when spoken to in a
gentle voice. By 6 months, they make noise to get attention and
they watch the face that's talking to them. By 12 months babies
understand their own name and simple words like ``bye-bye'' and
``up.'' They reach for things and look at others in an effort to
communicate and show what's on their mind.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing loss may not be suspected, however, until around 18
months or 2 years when other children the same age start speaking
clearly. ``Then you've passed a critical window of opportunity,''
says Dr. Nina Shapiro, a pediatric hearing specialist at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro says that children develop language skills much more
successfully if they are fitted for a hearing aid by 6 months.
``There seems to be something magic about that period,'' she says.
``It probably has to do with brain development.''
</P>
<P>
   Babies as young as 4 weeks can be fitted with hearing aids.
``With appropriate early detection and intervention, these infants
have the opportunity to develop on a par with their hearing peers
by the time they reach school age or sooner,'' says the president
of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, Dr. Jeri
Logemann.
</P>
<P>
   Research indicates that 80 percent of the children with hearing
loss develop normal speech and language if they get hearing aids
early. Unfortunately, Jason Pickett didn't get one until age 10. He
was already receiving intensive speech therapy and special
education at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other kids would sort of act like 'You can't play with me,'''
says Jason's mom. ``'You talk funny, you look funny. We can't
understand you.' So Jason got a lot of teasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Raylette Pickett believes that her son's speech would have been
much clearer if his hearing loss had been corrected from infancy.
``He wouldn't have been in special education classes or fallen
behind his grade in reading and math,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can test an infant's hearing a few days after birth by
measuring the faint sounds that the inner ear actually makes in
response to noise. A tiny flexible plug projects sound into the
baby's ear and a microphone inside the plug records the sounds that
the normal ear produces in response to the incoming sound.
</P>
<P>
   The emitted sounds are not measurable in an infant who cannot
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a clicking sound in the child's ear,'' says Shapiro,
``and electrodes and a computer pick up how it's being processed by
the baby. It measures the signal as it travels along the acoustic
nerve up to the brain stem, and it measures whether the signal is
getting through, and whether it's normal in terms of the time it
takes to get to the brain stem.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro further explains that doctors get a highly accurate
response from newborns. ``They check for the key frequencies, the
key sounds for speech and they can pick up even a mild hearing
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro advises parents to watch for startle reactions in their
baby in response to loud sounds like a dog barking near the crib or
a door slamming. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends
universal screening of newborns for hearing loss and offers the
following quiz about warning signs. Parents should consult a doctor
if questions arise over any of these signs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does the baby turn her head when she's called? Does she
respond to clapping noise, even when she's not looking at the
person making the noise?
</P>
<P>
   _ Does the baby of 6 or 7 months babble and imitate the tone of
other voices? Does he respond to the sounds around him?
</P>
<P>
   _ Has the child been less responsive since having an ear
infection? Fluid build up following middle ear infections may cause
this.
</P>
<P>
   _ Has the child gradually become hard of hearing? This may be
caused by a blockage of the ear by foreign body or wax build-up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Has the child had an injury to the ear? If so, he or she may
have a perforated ear drum.
</P>
<P>
   _ Has the child been hard of hearing since taking a recent plane
journey or a roller-coaster ride? Change in air pressure may cause
this.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does the child get severely dizzy and lose his balance? Does
he have attacks of nausea and vomiting? Does he complain of ringing
in the ears (tinnitus)? This may indicate a neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best feeling I had as a parent was when Jason first got
his hearing aids,'' says Pickett. ``The smile on his face told it
all. We put them in and he said 'Mom I can hear'. We could have
avoided all the frustration and special ed if we'd known earlier.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   You're facing 40 and wondering what changes lie ahead. One
that's likely, according to clinical studies, is a drop in
testosterone. In a process some doctors term ``andropause,''
testosterone levels in the body often decrease by one percent a
year after age 40, and by age 70, many men produce only a third of
what they once pumped out.
</P>
<P>
   Such news is bound to interest those who want to live a long
life at full tilt; some scientists now believe that inadequate
levels of the hormone can quicken traditional symptoms of aging,
such as declining muscle mass, hair loss, and diminished sex drive.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1999 studies by Pennsylvania State University
researchers, men with higher levels of testosterone may be less
vulnerable to high blood pressure, heart attacks, frequent colds,
obesity and depression.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy,
much like estrogen replacement in women, may boost bone health,
making men less vulnerable to bone-weakening osteoporosis, which
affects two million American men.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't men lined up outside drugstores waiting to fill
testosterone prescriptions? For one thing, the treatment is
definitely not for everyone, and could even be harmful to some men.
Many doctors aren't comfortable with testosterone replacement
except in the most extreme cases. Also, many men don't even know
about replacement therapy _ or the symptoms of deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Of the one million men in the United States with inadequate
levels of testosterone, only about 100,000 to 150,000 are receiving
treatment, according to the ALZA Corporation, producer of
testosterone supplement patches. But whether those one million need
therapy is unclear, says Dr. Irwin Goldstein, professor of urology
at the Boston University School of Medicine. ``There are a lot of
different normals, not a single value. Evaluation has to be done on
an individual basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, testosterone replacement therapy has been
prescribed only for men whose bodies don't make enough of the
hormone on their own; for example, those whose pituitary gland _
the body's testosterone regulator _ has been destroyed by infection
or tumors, or whose testes have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Such men may find that naturally occurring problems associated
with aging are exacerbated and begin at a much younger age.
Osteoporosis, trouble with sex drive and erections, loss of body
hair and muscle mass, breast enlargement, depression, infertility
and small testes are the main symptoms. Testosterone replacement
helps prevent at least some of these, increasing muscle mass and
bone strength, a sense of well-being and sex drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also know that testosterone levels rise before
competition,'' says Dr. Alan Booth, professor of sociology and
human development at Penn State and chief investigator of last
year's study. ``That helps competitors in terms of visual acuity
and sensitivity to demands. It helps stamina and makes men more
willing to take risks. They feel they can win.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do aging men who experience some of these symptoms know
if they need testosterone therapy? Experts agree that for now, men
need only be aware of the warning signs of low testosterone and to
head to a doctor if they occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a man suffers physically, say, from impotence, and the
doctor does appropriate blood tests, and the results are abnormal,
and other hormone tests, such as a test of the pituitary, support
that, then they should consider therapy,'' says Goldstein. ``But
not for a vague use like a desire for a better athletic
performance, or for increased sexual drive.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have a real problem, a physician may suggest
testosterone injections every two weeks, or the more recently
developed testosterone skin patches that patients wear all day.
</P>
<P>
   Patches cost about $100 for a one-month supply and account for
about 50 percent of all treatments. A cream form is also being
tested. Although pills exist, many doctors, and the FDA, warn that
they can cause liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   This increased variety of treatments points to growing awareness
of the problem of insufficient testosterone. There's no denying
that more men are beginning to think about replacement. But the
science of hormones isn't as advanced or complete for men as it is
for women, and it is dangerous to think of the new developments as
a quick, complete fix.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Stephen J. Winters, an endocrinologist at the University
of Louisville, points out, men face a much different problem than
women. ``In women the [hormonal] change is very abrupt around age
50. Within one year after menopause, they are making only 10
percent as much estrogen as they once were. They have hot flashes,
irritability, sleeplessness. But in men, testosterone loss happens
much more slowly and to nowhere near the same extent. It's not
really male menopause.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, men who raise their testosterone levels through steroids,
for instance, can experience a number of consequences, from
depression to ``risky, anti-social behavior,'' says Booth.
</P>
<P>
   A study of more than 4,000 middle-aged men found that those with
above-average levels of the hormone were more likely to report
injuries, to drink five or more drinks a day, and to smoke. Nor do
researchers yet know the impact of testosterone replacement therapy
on prostate disease or prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Given those unanswered questions, the treatment remains off the
radar screen for most men and many doctors. Only time and research
will tell whether testosterone replacement will become more widely
accepted. ``There are just no rules about testosterone replacement
therapy yet,'' says Winters. ``It's an evolving concept, and
research is still being conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Vital Signs
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone levels normally decrease by 20 percent between
morning and evening. However, one-fifth of men between the ages of
60 and 80 have lower-than-normal testosterone levels. Only 7
percent of men know that hormone replacement therapy is an option.

<P>
   Few things send the average human into a glazed stupor faster
than the sight of charts and graphs, but the graph Mrs. Kamper has
drawn on the front board has an entire classroom of high school
students transfixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Mrs. Kamper pronounces as she points to the diagram,
``is normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject at the moment in Room 443 at Redlands High School,
east of Los Angeles, is marital passion, and the graph represents
what typically happens to it over time. It looks like a stock that
probably should have been sold years ago: strong at first, then a
dip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passion levels off,'' Mrs. Kamper says. ``Lots of people
assume that if the energy lessens, something must be wrong. They
say, 'Well, the magic is gone. This isn't working: They don't
realize this is the natural pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   The room is silent as the 17- and 18-year-old juniors and
seniors try to figure out if this natural pattern could possibly
apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you base your marriage on this [here, Mrs. Kamper points to
the graph's apex, the enchanted early days, when passion flows like
cheap Bordeaux], you're going to be sadly disappointed with this.''
Here, she indicates the flattened norm, also known variously as the
unvarnished truth, the way it is, the human condition _ in a word,
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Today's lesson ranges from intimacy to commitment to love's many
guises. Empty love, romantic love, fantasy love, companion love.
Tomorrow, all 28 students in the class and every student in Mrs.
Kamper's other five psychology classes will do something high
school students should never do: Get married. Random draws will
assign them jobs, incomes, children, and, just to give the exercise
authenticity, a marriage crisis. It's all part of a three-week
program called ``Connections: Relationships and Marriage.''
Charlene Kamper designed the curriculum herself when she couldn't
find a high school approach to the subject that suited her.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three weeks I don't have any absences,'' says the
51-year-old teacher, an apparent affirmation of her contention that
kids are hungry for relationship guidance.
</P>
<P>
   That view came to Kamper piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   As an elementary school teacher she encountered an alarming
number of children with behavioral problems, their family lives
strained or fractured. When she switched to junior high, or middle
school, students opened up to her about their family and
relationship frustrations. Her recurring thought, she recalls, was,
Why can't we teach some skills in high school instead of waiting
until the marriage is on the rocks?
</P>
<P>
   That was, and is, a legitimate question in a society where the
divorce rate exceeds the birth rate, the death rate, the inflation
rate, the prime rate and the unemployment rate combined.
</P>
<P>
   Kamper moved to Redlands High in 1992 and introduced what would
soon be called ``Connections'' to her psychology classes. Word
spread, and eight years later the 15-lesson course is part of the
curriculum at more than 400 high schools in 32 states and eight
other countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Norway, Australia, South
Africa, Egypt and Russia).
</P>
<P>
   High schools have dabbled in family skills for a long time, but
``Connections'' probes relationships and marriage more deeply and
creatively than previous courses. Guided by teachers trained in the
program and a 52-page workbook, students take the Keirsey-Bates
personality assessment test and explore how well they know
themselves and how others see them.
</P>
<P>
   They look at how their families communicate, study communication
skills that foster relationships, and think about what they want _
and what they don't want _ in a partner. Through role-playing they
get at least a taste of marital stressors and learn techniques for
dealing with conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly it's a crash course in a big subject, but you have to
start somewhere. If 10 seasoned adults sat in on ``Connections,''
two would lament having had to learn this stuff the hard way, and
the other eight, if they were wise, would take notes. Kamper knows
the terrain, having been happily married herself for 31 years and
possessing a master's degree in family studies and training in
marriage and family counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of anything you guys do in life,'' she tells her students,
``marriage will be among the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing concern over divorce, which has become as much an
American institution as baseball, ``Connections'' isn't the only
relationship tutorial to find its way into high school classrooms
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the American Bar Association, Philadelphia
divorce lawyer Lynne Gold-Bikin has created ``Partners,'' a program
of 10 videotapes of a fictional couple fighting over issues spouses
frequently fight about. Sometimes the conflicts escalate and get
ugly, other times they go well and are resolved. Students learn
techniques for resolution and practice them in class with a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Another program emphasizing communication and conflict
resolution skills is ``Building Relationships,'' designed by
Minnesota family psychologist David H. Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced just last year, the curriculum already has been
adopted by high schools in 10 states. Olson's Twin Cities company,
Life Innovations, also owns PREPARE, a 195-question compatibility
test for adult couples on the brink of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are willing to be more honest on a questionnaire than
they are with their partner,'' Olson claims. But a little insight
can be dangerous. According to Olson's research, about a fourth of
those who take PREPARE test out as ``conflicted,'' a designation
that gives them an 80 percent chance of divorce. The social
scientist takes satisfaction in having spared a million couples
that fate. More than 10 percent of those who take the test break
off their engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Time columnist Amy Dickinson struck just the right
irony in noting that her local bookstore ``has a shelf of
relationship books that is longer than most relationships.''
Harville Hendrix, John Bradshaw, Maggie Scarf, Laura Schlessinger,
Joy Browne, Barbara DeAngelis, John Gray ... Multitudes have read
them all and plenty of others, attended workshops and logged pricey
hours in therapy, yet the divorce rate just hangs in there at
midfield, more reliable than the lunar cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Since all that reading and counseling seem to have no effect
other than a redistribution of wealth, and given, moreover, that
second marriages fail at a slightly higher rate than do first
marriages, perhaps we should begin to question whether partnering
can be learned _ in high school or at any age.
</P>
<P>
   Having empirically analyzed 2,000 married couples over more than
two decades, University of Washington researcher John Gottman,
author of the 1994 book ``Why Marriages Succeed Or Fail,'' has
concluded that most couples wage the same battles over and over for
the life of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pick somebody to marry, you automatically have chosen
your set of unresolvable relationship problems,'' he says. ``You'll
never solve them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a culture, we can't even seem to solve the most fundamental
and recurrent problem: selection error. No matter how fervently the
sages counsel against marrying our parents, marrying our fantasies,
marrying strangers, marrying personality disorders, we keep looking
for love in all the wrong faces. Sex drive and emotional need
override intellect and judgment _ so much for all those books _ and
by the time we come to our senses, we find ourselves in a wedlock
headlock, more inmate than soulmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could randomly pair up people and they'd have better
relationships than the ones they choose on their own,'' says Olson.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gottman's observations is that the divorce stats, as
troubling as they are, don't tell the full story, that in fact
three-quarters of all married couples have ``crummy
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture sets a very high standard for what a marriage
should be,'' says Olson, ``but then it doesn't provide any good
ways to help people develop and maintain those relationships over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is, well, unpleasant. ``Conflict in a relationship
occurs when reality collides with our expectations,'' says clinical
psychologist Peter T. Pearson, a consulting associate professor at
Stanford University and co-founder of a Menlo Park, Calif., shrink
tank called The Couples Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it starts.'' At this point, we do the logical,
sensible, obvious thing. ``Most people get into trouble because
they set goals for their partner,'' Pearson says. ``It comes under
the heading of 'nothing's impossible for the other person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Psychology author Jo Coudert tackled this theme 35 years ago in
her graceful book of wisdom, ``Advice From A Failure'': ``If you
are among the angry, with the best will in the world you located
the source of the trouble in someone else and said, 'If I can just
get him to change, then I will be able to behave as I should.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is the road more traveled, a paradox because it doesn't
lead anywhere anyone would want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Kamper's class is popular with students, but can she leaven
their expectations and alter their destiny or will three-fourths of
them end up in crummy relationships?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you can teach them,'' says David Schnarch, a
therapist and author of a book (``Passionate Marriage: Sex, Love,
and Intimacy in Emotionally Committed Relationships'') that shuns
traditional approaches, ``is that a three-week course won't help
them avoid the problems, because the problems are not to be
avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnarch says that we have it all backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggles of marriage are not caused by ignorance,'' he
explains. ``They're not caused by the absence of caring or a lack
of communication. They are part of a very difficult but natural,
inevitable process that has driven the evolution of the human race.
By going through the struggles we become capable of having a better
marriage. When you see it that way, your difficulties are much
easier to tolerate, and even in the midst of the worst of it,
you're more likely to stay resilient and stick in there and let the
thing move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   However much truth that view may contain, it could only be seen
as hopeful and alluring to someone looking at marriage from the
inside. What do we say to high school students looking at marriage
with uncertain anticipation from the outside?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can teach kids,'' Schnarch says, ``is that marriage
will teach them things that there's no way they can learn now. They
can't learn them ahead of time because marriage itself is the
lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't teach an 18-year-old about marriage,'' Kamper agrees.
``Only marriage can do that. But the lessons they learn here will
give them a much better chance of handling the lessons marriage has
for them.''

   LITERARY-OFFSPRING (Undated) _ Gautama Chopra freely admits that
his last name helped sell both his books. His first agent was a
friend of his father, the best-selling New Age guru Deepak Chopra.
His first publisher, Amber-Allen, was also the original publisher
of his father's blockbuster, ``The Seven Spiritual Laws of
Success.'' Gautama, 24, is not the only young writer capitalizing
on a literary lineage these days. There are Rice, Jong, Heller,
Updike, Bellow, Theroux, Styron and McPhee (make that three McPhee)
children writing, not to mention two Cheever siblings. All were
born with the most valuable asset a writer can have: access. By

   MIAMI-FRESCO-DISPUTE (Miami) _ In 1984, the artist David Novros
found a public space for one of his huge fresco murals in the old
federal courthouse here. But today he is trying to save his
``Frescoes in the Courtyard'' from destruction by the government in
a dispute that is pitting the artist and his supporters against

   TEETH-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``White Teeth'' by the young
British writer Zadie Smith, is not one of your typical small,
semi-autobiographical first novels. It's a big, splashy, populous
production reminiscent of books by Dickens and Salman Rushdie with
a nod to indie movies like ``My Beautiful Laundrette,'' a novel
that's not afraid to tackle large, unwieldy themes. Reviewed by

SOME ECONOMIC THEORY NEEDS A BELT AND SUSPENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 30)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Financial markets and market-based economics,'' declared the
former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin in The Economist's
millennial issue, ``have replaced  &UR; dirigiste &LR;  economics ....''
</P>
<P>
   So in a special issue predicting events in 2000, he shot down
the dirigible. (That is an arcane allusion to the midair explosion
of the airship Hindenburg, tearfully described by a reporter in one
of old-time radio's most thrilling moments. The Latin  &UR; dirigere &LR; 
means ``to direct,'' and a balloon capable of being directed by a
pilot was dubbed a  &UR; dirigible &LR;  in 1885.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What are  &UR; dirigiste &LR;  economics?'' asks Susan Neisuler of
Newton, MA. (MA is the Postal Service's arbitrary abbreviation for
Massachusetts, not Maine; my style follows the more sensible New
York Times style, which abbreviates Massachusetts as Mass. Maine is
Me. at the Postal Service and at The Times; I write out the whole
word.) ``Should I be afraid of them?'' Ms. Neisuler wonders,
construing  &UR; economics &LR;  incorrectly as plural. ``Is Robert Rubin
making it up?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Rubin was not making it up. Back in 1989 Barron's was
writing about the ``French, who left to their own devices, would
fashion Brussels into the capital of  &UR; dirigiste &LR;  economics.''
 &UR; Dirigiste &LR;  is also used with things other than economics. At the
end of January this year, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee he was encouraged by
``forces emerging in Europe which will gradually bring down a lot
of the  &UR; dirigiste &LR;  attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a capitalist, or if you have no capital but believe in
the creative force of untrammeled free enterprise, then you will be
glad that the  &UR; dirigistes &LR;  are on the run. Their philosophy calls
for ``direction and control of the economy by the state.'' The
mildly socialistic phrase that preceded it was  &UR; central planning &LR; ,
and the phrase that took it all the way to the Soviet system was
 &UR; command economy &LR; , the opposite of  &UR; market economy &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The earliest use I can find is in the Nov. 28, 1946, issue of Le
Monde, when the writer summarized the American attitude toward
France as ``Be liberal or  &UR; dirigiste &LR; . Return to a capitalist or a
socialist economy. But take the decision and show us a serious
program.'' The English translation first appeared in Political
Science Quarterly in September 1947 and soon was taken up on both
sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist in the same month denounced such control as
fascistic: ``Authoritarianism or stagnation _ that is the choice
which  &UR; dirigisme &LR;  thrusts on us.'' Nor was the word limited to
economics: In the earliest entry in the OED, from a 1951 Archivum
Linguisticum, a roundheeled lexicographer sneered at ``Linguistic
 &UR; dirigisme &LR; , standards of correctness in a constantly evolving
language.'' (Now wait a minute: Some of us think that kind of
 &UR; dirigisme &LR;  is good.)
</P>
<P>
   Another watcher of Rubinlingo, John Di Clemente of Tinley Park,
IL (that's a postocrat's idea of an abbreviation for Illinois; I
still write the old-fashioned Ill., which the postocrats think is
sick), sends in a clipping from The Wall Street Journal quoting
Rubin about restrictions on his lobbying the White House from his
new banking job: ``We'll be  &UR; belt and suspenders &LR;  with respect to
those.'' Di Clemente wants to know: ``What's the connection between
such haberdashery and ethics?''
</P>
<P>
   Earliest use I can find of this locution is in The Dallas
Morning News in 1987: ``To qualify for the Scott Burns  &UR; Belt and
Suspender &LR;  Bank List, a bank had to have primary equity capital
amounting to at least 10 percent of its assets.''
</P>
<P>
   From the context, it appears that a) this is not the first use
of the phrase and b) it refers to safety. Nor is the metaphor
limited to finance: An 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision
in 1997 described a government motion to compel testimony as ``this
 &UR; belt-and-suspenders &LR;  approach,'' using the phrase as a hyphenated
compound adjective.
</P>
<P>
   I called Rubin at Citigroup, where his trousers are now most
securely held up, to ask his definition of the metaphor. ``It
emphasizes certainty,'' he says. ``When you're wearing both, you're
doubly safe.'' And so it is with stable banks and legal rights and
ethical standards. In the lingo of newsies, my Times copy desk
colleagues inform me, it means ``overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   CARVILIFICATION
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Stickin': The Case for Loyalty,'' James Carville
seemed pleased that he had been called ``Clinton's  &UR; gunsel &LR; '' by
the columnist Richard Cohen. ``I'm sure I am one,'' the Clinton
loyalist and henchman observed in a footnote. ``I just don't know
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling those voids in vocabulary is the scholarly public
service demanded by readers of this column.
</P>
<P>
   American moviegoers first became familiar with the word when
spoken by Humphrey Bogart, playing Dashiell Hammett's hard-boiled
private detective, Sam Spade, in ``The Maltese Falcon.'' Bogie
looked contemptuously at the young bodyguard played by Elisha Cook
Jr. and told Sydney Greenstreet, ``Keep that  &UR; gunsel &LR;  away from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most readers of Black Mask magazine in 1929, where the story
first appeared, and moviegoers in the 1940s thought that  &UR; gunsel &LR; 
was a variant of ``gunman.'' It is not; in a 1965 article, the
mystery writer Erle Stanley Gardner revealed why Hammett used it.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of Black Mask, Joseph Shaw, was on guard against the
use of vulgarisms by his writers. Hammett, eager to slip one by,
had a character describe his activity as ``on the gooseberry lay,''
tramp lingo for ``stealing clothes from clotheslines,'' its
connotation larcenous but not vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaw wrote Hammett telling him that he was deleting the
`gooseberry lay' from the story,'' Gardner recalled, ``and that
Black Mask would never publish anything like that. But he left the
word  &UR; gunsel &LR;  because Hammett had used it so casually that Shaw
took it for granted that the word pertained to a hired gunman.
Actually,  &UR; gunsel &LR; , or  &UR; gonzel &LR; , is a very naughty word with no
relation whatever to a bodyguard.''
</P>
<P>
   The term in tramp slang is derived from the Yiddish  &UR; gendzl &LR; , or
``gosling''; the young goose symbolized a homosexual boy. An
earlier use was defined in a 1933 American Speech as `` &UR; Gonzel &LR; ,
Catamite'' (a corruption of the name of Jupiter's cupbearer,
Ganymede).
</P>
<P>
   ``All the writers of the hard-boiled school of realism,'' noted
Gardner, ``started talking about a  &UR; gunsel &LR;  as the equivalent of a
gunman .... The aftereffects of that joke are still seen in
American murder stories.''
</P>
<P>
   And in columns by pundits who mean no such thing. And in books
by impervious loyalists.

  (For use by LANG) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTECITO _ The well-heeled residents huddle in their estates
behind dense hedges, thick walls and iron gates in this
self-conscious community on the southern edge of Santa Barbara.
They obviously take their isolation seriously, such that when
warning rabble away, they go so far as to invoke adverbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely Private Property,'' reads a sign in front of one
sprawling property. ``Positively No Admission,'' reads another.
</P>
<P>
   There is a stridency to the admonishments. In them, you can
almost detect an audible sniff. ``Not a Through Street. No
Turnaround.'' (Gee, sorry my front wheels intruded on the first 30
inches of your driveway.) ``Private Road. Right to Pass by
Permission.'' (And who issues that, Jarvis the butler?)
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, Montecito has been favored by captains of
industry, power players of the silver screen and vacationers
desperate for solitude. It's not difficult to see why. It commands
a thickly wooded slope in the foothills of the Santa Ynez
Mountains, overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Channel Islands,
ambling down to a stretch of rugged, secluded beach. With
sunglasses, tinted windows and determination, you could go days
without ever having to speak to a soul.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few decades, however, one establishment has been
dreadfully out of step with all of this: the Miramar Hotel. It is
undoubtedly familiar to anyone who has ever wheeled north on 101
through Santa Barbara. How could you possibly miss those blue
roofs, set off dramatically by white clapboard?
</P>
<P>
   The blue paint was swabbed on in 1940, precisely to catch the
eye of people passing on the highway. The asphalt _ covering six of
the property's 13 acres _ was laid down shortly after, as America
took to the road in search of parking places. A two-story motel
structure went up, facing !ital!away from the ocean, designed
instead to maximize views of a pool and ... well, the road.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare to say goodbye to all of this, though. Hotelier Ian
Schrager, pioneer of cutting-edge lodgings in West Hollywood, New
York and Miami Beach, spent $31.5 million to acquire this somewhat
tired-looking motel two years ago. He plans to sink nearly that
much more into it in a massive renovation that is expected to
require a year and a half to complete. And the developers hope to
start breaking ground _ and breaking up asphalt _ this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion, the Miramar figures to be a high-end resort
that enjoys much more congruity with its neighborhood, joining such
properties of understated elegance as the Four Seasons Biltmore and
the San Ysidro Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concept will be returning it to the sensibility of the
seaside resort, oriented back to the ocean,'' said Tim Andreas,
design director on a project headed by Philippe Starck. ``We're
restoring the landscaping and the sensibility that you're in a
seaside garden setting rather than a motor court.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Miramar's designation as a somewhat funky highway motel
stirs any nostalgic pangs in you, this is the season to get a last
taste. Its doors will be closed when the renovations _ guttings,
primarily _ begin. When it reopens, you certainly won't find any
shoulder-season room rates of $75 for a pool/highway view.
</P>
<P>
   When Philip Dailey transferred here from one of Schrager's New
York hotels to be general manager of the Miramar, he heard story
after story of people who had fond memories of the place. They'd
learned to swim in the pool as a child. Couples had honeymooned
there. The bar had generated volumes of colorful lore. But he
encountered something else: No one had been back for 15 or 20
years. He drew a conclusion. ``The Miramar,'' Dailey said, ``is
like an old jacket you keep in your closet. You can't bring
yourself to throw it away, but you never wear it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The place was overripe for an upgrade. That much was evident
during a recent stay there. Its rooms have bargain sheets and
pillows beneath synthetic bedspreads in floral prints. The
furniture and other furnishings are 1970s Holiday Inn revival. The
drinking glasses are plastic. The TV sits on a cheap stand. No
separate towels are provided for use at the beach or pool.
</P>
<P>
   During our visit, the bathroom sink drain unleashed a four-inch
gusher of dark goo when somebody turned on a tap upstairs. After
this recurred minutes later, a maintenance man was summoned, but he
seemed at a loss, saying, ``It's happened before.'' Then he checked
to see if the shower drain had been similarly afflicted. (Yech!) &QL; 
!tag!f &QC; 
Helvetica f+b f-i s &QC; 
12 w &QC; 
12 l &QC; 
16!tag!Sweeping changes &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!All of this will be gone when the doors reopen. The blue
roofs? They're history. The Miramar is seeking to recapture a sense
of its more distant past.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s, transplanted Englishman Josiah Doulton tried to
scratch out a living here growing fruit trees and various crops for
livestock feed. When his fortunes flagged in this enterprise,
however, he found that accommodating travelers was much more
lucrative. He dotted the lush grounds with tiny guest cottages,
some of which _ dating to 1901 _ still stand.
</P>
<P>
   The new design will seek to recapture some of these
sensibilities while maximizing a 500-foot stretch of beachfront.
The refurbished cottages will be engulfed by a citrus orchard in
one part of the property, a field of lavender in another, Dailey
said recently as he strolled over seemingly endless expanses of
parking lot. The renovated motel building will feature balcony
trellises cascading with bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   The bank of rooms down by the ocean _ built literally on the
sand _ will be something really special. Two of the current rooms
will be fused into one lavish duplex. Picture a row of two-story
townhouses, each with a private deck with whirlpool tub, a
downstairs living room and kitchen, and a spiral staircase that
climbs to a spacious upstairs bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of the resort will be a boardwalk promenade
that is to stretch from the lobby to an oceanfront bar and grill.
In between will be a pool, bordered on one side by a restaurant, on
the other by a spa.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager came up with the concept of ``hotel as theater,''
creating natural gathering areas where guests and visitors can
basically congregate to watch each other. This is what is
envisioned for this area, with the occasional passenger train
passing through to provide a touch of surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   The train tracks come with the deed here. When the Southern
Pacific sought to build a north-south line through here in the
mid-1880s, Doulton asked that it be routed down there along that
useless, non-arable land along the beach rather than through his
precious barley field farther inland. (Suntans and cutback rides on
waves were not high on priority lists in that particular era.)
</P>
<P>
   An old flag-stop depot still stands on the Miramar property, and
it will be incorporated into the new design.
</P>
<P>
   Major highways, on the other hand, are much less charming, and
the 101 roars by within just a few feet of the property's inland
border. To gain an appreciation for just how many goods are
transported in 18-wheel trucks these days, sit by the Miramar pool
for an hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   Masking that rattle and hum will surely be a major challenge for
the developers. The plan is to employ a sound wall, a hedge,
sound-absorption building materials, triple-pane glass and, as a
final resort, the white noise of waterfalls and babbling brooks. &QL;

16!tag!A rival for the Biltmore &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!When the resort is finished _ the end of next year, perhaps
early 2002 _the Miramar will contend for the same high-end traveler
who currently gravitates to the Biltmore. In Montecito, there
figures to be plenty of room for both, but it shapes up to be an
intriguing contrast.
</P>
<P>
   While the Miramar will target the crowd that crackles on the
leading edge of trendiness, the Biltmore has built its considerable
reputation on Old World elegance and deference.
</P>
<P>
   It was constructed in the 1920s, Los Angeles architect Reginald
Johnson employing the design of a stately Spanish villa. Although
it underwent two major refurbishments in recent years, adding such
upgrades as air conditioning and the requisite data ports in rooms
(a spa addition is currently under construction), the Biltmore
still features wrought-iron balconies shaded by tropical shrubbery,
massive beam ceilings, bright interiors (cream-colored walls, white
plantation shutters and ceiling fans, new bedspreads and drapes),
as well as detached cottages of its own. The place feels like old
money.
</P>
<P>
   Which is appropriate, really, given its neighborhood. That, in
fact, is one of the conditions that enhances the prospects for a
reborn Miramar. Here, you don't have to worry about putting up a
lavish resort and being stuck next to a hot dog-on-a-stick stand
and a junky boat-repair yard.
</P>
<P>
   Though an unincorporated community of only 9,300 people,
Montecito is so status-conscious that it has !ital!two village
areas _ one it can look down its nose at as a tourist enclave, the
other it can treat as a locals' hangout. The former stretches out
along Coast Village Road, parallel to and virtually on top of 101.
The other, referred to as Upper Village (of course), is farther
upslope, clustered around the corner of East Valley Road and San
Ysidro Road.
</P>
<P>
   Here, few of the businesses open on Sunday, a refreshing
throwback to an era when all self-respecting establishments honored
the Sabbath. On days when they do open their doors, you'll find
impressive home furnishings and antiques at William Laman, housed
in a 100-year-old former home.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might notice the sign that pointedly forbids cell-phone
use in the breakfast room of the San Ysidro Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might survey the stylish but confounding array of
products in an establishment eccentrically called Pierre Lafond
Wendy Foster. Walk into one room here and you'll find gourmet
groceries, greeting cards, deli items and chocolates. Walk through
an adjacent door and you're among racks of women's clothing. Head
up the stairs for _ no joke _ kitchen and bath items, antique
office furniture, women's lingerie, men's shirts and garden
accouterments. (``Yes, I've made my selections. I'm getting this
black-clay dinnerware, a linen robe, this packet of radish seeds
and a bar of Pre de Provence bath soap. Sure, all in the same bag
is fine.'') &QL; 
!tag!f &QC; 
Helvetica f+b f-i s &QC; 
12 w &QC; 
12 l &QC; 
16!tag!Exclusive territory &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!It might be tempting, upon leaving the Upper Village, to
explore the neighborhood. Don't bother. You can drive through
Montecito, but you can't actually !ital!see Montecito. What you
gaze at instead are fortresslike walls, impenetrable stands of
greenery, tall fences, elaborate iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   The mansions are set well back from the road at the end of
winding drives. In a local real-estate flyer, one ocean-view
property was going for $3.6 million _ and that's just for three
acres of bare dirt. If you want something with a house on it, well,
here's a 15,000-square-foot Italian palazzo with formal gardens,
statuary and an ocean view for a priced-to-move $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Montecito's old money has been suffused of late with nouveau
riche _ movie-industry stars and executives, high-tech
entrepreneurs, etc. They are attracted by the same attributes that
appeal to weekend tourists: tranquillity, clean air, cool climate,
mesmerizing views of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Find all of these in abundance down along the beach. You can
easily walk a considerable stretch of it, from Lookout County Park
south of Montecito (take the Summerland exit off the 101) clear to
the Biltmore _ 2.5 miles in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   Check a tide table before embarking (the Santa Barbara
News-Press runs one daily) and go at low tide to avoid being
pulverized on rocks or against one of several sea walls. Also,
there are a number of spots in which streams rush briskly over
boulders, so you might want to bring along a pair of old tennis
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the water, you're likely to spot pelicans skimming along
the surface and diving for snacks, or bobbing in the swells like
great, fish-powered frigates. Off Hammonds' Point, those are not
seals in the water, they are wetsuit-clad surfers playing chicken
with the offshore rocks.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good stretch for beach walking because the lords and
ladies of the palatial manors that abut it tend to be reclusive
sorts _ and in some cases absentee owners. As a result, the foot
traffic is not particularly heavy, and it's virtually nil on
weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   You likely will encounter dogs, though. Lot of dogs. Although a
deputy at the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department said there
is a leash law on the books, it's clear that it is obstinately
ignored here. The hounds roam with such impunity that sometimes
it's difficult to match up the pets with the owners, even for
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The packs race up and down the sand, dashing into the surf,
chasing nothing in particular, slobbering on lone walkers ...
seeming to single out the beach in front of the Miramar as their
own private comfort station.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe once the townhouse suites and the beach grill go in and
that shabby throwback motel is finally transformed, they'll begin
to exhibit a bit more decorum. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Montecito lies immediately south of Santa Barbara,
about a 90-mile drive from Los Angeles via U.S. 101.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Published rates for rooms at the Four Seasons Biltmore
Resort start at $420 for a standard room. Deluxe rooms in a cottage
setting are particularly popular; they start at $465. Packages are
offered, with the greatest savings available from Sunday through
Thursday. Phone: (805) 969-2261. Reservations: (800) 332-3442. Web:
www.fourseasons.com/santabarbara. At the Miramar, rates in high
season (today through the summer) range from $139 for a poolside
room to $329 for oceanfront. Cottages range from $319 (one bedroom)
to $619 (three-bedroom). Suites with kitchenettes are available _
$839 for an oceanfront unit. Phone: (805) 969-2203. Reservations:
(800) 322-6983. Web: www.sbmiramar.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Perhaps the best dinner option in Montecito is Pane e
Vino, a trattoria in the Upper Village (1482 East Valley Road). It
offers about a dozen pasta dishes priced just under $10. The
pennette rigate alla Siciliana was inventive, featuring pasta tubes
with fresh tuna cubes, olives and capers in a tomato sauce. For the
fettuccine with mussels and clams, all the seafood was served on
the shell. Check the daily specials sheet for reasonably priced
wines _ we found a pleasant 1997 San Felice Chianti Classico for
$25. The best breakfast in town is at Tutti's, in the Lower Village
(1209 Coast Village Road). Hearty omelets and breakfast burritos
are served up with smokehouse bacon. The menu features an extensive
selection of bakery goods, including scones and muffins, and some
daring items _ cornbread French toast, for example. The Biltmore's
patio is tough to beat for a lunch setting, especially if the
marine layer has lifted. Crab cakes laced with goat cheese ($16)
were excellent.

By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTECITO _ The hotel Sunday brunch has evolved a bit since its
decadent origins in the 1970s. While the spreads are every bit as
dizzying as they were then, the selections in many cases are
broader, healthier and fresher, with chef attendants on hand to
cook many items to order.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is exemplified at the Four Seasons Biltmore in
Montecito. It has developed as a popular indulgence for travelers _
not only those on weekend getaways to Santa Barbara, but also for
day-trippers.
</P>
<P>
   The setting, to begin with, is hard to beat: views of the ocean
from two patios and the sun-washed indoor dining area, which is
topped by a massive retractable skylight.
</P>
<P>
   And the food is superb.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, there were no fewer than six chef attendants
on hand to produce made-to-order items: omelets, waffles, carved
meats, sauteed mushrooms, espresso drinks, crepes and blintzes. The
mushroom station is particularly intriguing. It featured three
different types of mushrooms _ shiitake, oyster, fist-sized
portobello _ cooked in front of you in a garlic-rich saute.
</P>
<P>
   As for diversity, the brunch included a table devoted entirely
to Asian cuisine: dim sum, sushi, won tons. Another offered a
generous array of salads and low-fat items.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a station just for kids. On a table that was
knee-high to an adult, it offered French toast wedges, peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwiches _ with the crusts trimmed off, of
course _ chicken wings and French fries. (On a brunch visit a few
years ago, I couldn't resist a harmless regression: I waited until
the coast was clear, then loaded up a plate here.)
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the brunch: smoked trout, mackerel and
salmon; an assortment of pates; an 8-foot rowboat filled with
crushed ice and topped with boiled shrimp and oysters on the half
shell; an enormous filet of roasted, seasoned salmon at the carving
table; fresh-squeezed orange juice poured freely at the table
(along with a serviceable champagne); and, at the dessert table, a
sinfully delicious bread pudding made with bananas, pecans and rum.
</P>
<P>
   During our brunch, a steel-drum musician provided a backdrop of
1950s calypso music, plunking out such tunes as ``Jamaica
Farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday brunch at the Four Seasons Biltmore in Montecito is
served from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and costs $39.95 for adults, $16
for children ages 4 to 12 (age 3 and under free). Reservations are
strongly recommended. Phone: (805) 565-8237.

&HT;     THE WAR OVER ELIAN CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The saga of little Elian Gonzalez is a
heart-rending human drama, with so many political and emotional
distractions it is easy to lose sight of the central issue.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about Fidel Castro, or communism, or President
Clinton or the degree of force involved in the armed raid on the
Miami house where Elian was held.
</P>
<P>
   This saga was not about Attorney General Janet Reno's tactics or
the Cuban-American politics that dominate south Florida and
periodically intimidate the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   We will certainly hear a great deal about those issues in the
coming months, as a Republican Congress that loves to second-guess
the administration investigates the episode.
</P>
<P>
   But what was really going on was something else. It is less
about what happened than why it happened, although Clinton's
critics would like to make this into a political blunder useful in
the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, this drama was about family values, parental
authority and respect for the rule of law. It was about reuniting a
father and son who were kept apart by distant relatives who had no
legal right to custody of the boy. It was about the right of a
father to choose where his family will live, even if it is under a
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno had patiently negotiated with the
relatives for five months, even going personally to Miami at one
point to demonstrate her sincerity. But the relatives persistently
stalled; finally, a responsible government must stop talking and
act in the face of continued defiance.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had every right to enforce the father's
legal custody. Despite the terrifying spectacle of the pre-dawn
raid, no shots were fired, no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have behaved irrationally throughout, a
reality proving that Reno was correct to give up on them. They
hinted they had weapons in the house. They exploited Elian
shamelessly, refusing to let his father speak to him on the phone
and issuing videotape on which Elian said he didn't want to go to
Cuba. Increasingly, they seemed controlled by radical anti-Castro
activists.
</P>
<P>
   After the raid, they claimed the federal agents had cursed at
them and threatened their lives, a far-fetched accusation for which
there is no evidence. They claimed the first picture of a happy
Elian reunited with his father was doctored. They claimed Elian had
been drugged. They rushed to Washington, making a public show of
appearing at the gates of Andrews Air Force base and demanding to
see Elian immediately, waving as a prop an Easter basket. Their
demands were harsh and totally inappropriate. For all their
complaints, they were able to behave that way because this is a
free country.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives gave an inflammatory press conference with New
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a conservative publicity hound running
who briefly and unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential
nomination last year on an anti-abortion platform.
</P>
<P>
   Smith accused the Justice Department of ``abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin, called the president a
liar. Miami family members indicate they will sue the government,
for something or other.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the case will drag on for some time. Elian must stay in
America until a three-judge federal appeals court panel can decide
whether as a 6-year-old Elian is mature enough to merit a political
asylum hearing with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The
INS argues that Elian is too young to seek asylum for himself and
that his father as his legal guardian must act in Elian's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The decision at the May 11 hearing, no matter which way it goes,
can be appealed to the full 12-member court or directly to the
Supreme Court. Heaven knows how long all that might take.
</P>
<P>
   The politics won't end right away, either. The raid does not
seem to be upsetting most American voters. A majority of 57 percent
told a CNN/Gallup poll that they approved of the federal agents'
actions. And 57 percent said it was in Elian's best interest to
live with his father in Cuba rather than with the relatives in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Cuban-American community it is very big. This
probably kills Vice President Al Gore's effort to give Texas Gov.
George W. Bush a real race in Florida. Gore is the big loser here;
his mealy-mouthed position has always looked like pandering and now
it seems a certifiable waste of time. He repeated his view that the
boy's case should have been handled through a family court, a
meaningless dodge. But he said nothing about his view of Elian's
reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, condemned ``the terror of middle of-the-night
raids,'' empathizing with immigrants accustomed to a history of
harsh government repression. It may not work well elsewhere, where
such terror is only imagined, but it is likely to work with the
agitated anti-Castro Cuban-American community in Miami.

<P>
   In a decision that could give a boost to ``bioprospecting'' in
national parks, a federal judge has upheld a precedent-setting
agreement in which a biotechnology company will pay Yellowstone
National Park for the right to search its geysers and hot springs
for commercially valuable microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Royce C. Lamberth of federal district court in Washington,
recently dismissed a lawsuit charging that the agreement violated
rules prohibiting the ``sale or commercial use'' of natural
resources of the national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellowstone agreement with the Diversa Corp. was announced
in 1997 as the prototype for a policy by the National Park Service
to be paid for drugs or chemicals derived from the national park
resources. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The policy reflects a change in thinking in many nations. In the
past, scientists who took samples of plants, animals or microbes
were generally free to exploit discoveries without compensating the
country that was the source of the material.
</P>
<P>
   But many nations, realizing the potential value of such genetic
resources to the biotechnology industry, are demanding pay for such
bioprospecting. And, proponents hope the compensation will help pay
for the conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against the park service was filed by some
biotechnology critics and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the suit on April 12, Lamberth agreed with the
park service's interpretation that Diversa would be profiting from
discoveries involving the microbes, not from the sale of actual
specimens, which would not become the company's property.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said the agreement was consistent with the
conservation mandate of the park service, in part because the money
from Diversa would help pay for conservation programs. He noted
that Yellowstone issues 250 to 300 research permits a year and that
the only difference in this case was that Yellowstone could share
some of the benefits arising from that research.
</P>
<P>
   Diversa, of San Diego, agreed to pay the park service about
$100,000 over five years plus royalties of 0.5 percent to 10
percent on sales of any commercial products they derived.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, the agreement remains suspended by a ruling
Lamberth made a year ago in the same lawsuit. At that time he said
that the park service's agreement with Diversa represented a
``dramatic change'' in national policy and therefore required an
environmental impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment, which will look at the policy as a whole, could
take several years to complete. But once it is complete, the
project, and perhaps others, should now be able to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   John Varley, director of Yellowstone's Center for Resources,
called the Diversa agreement ``good for science, good for parks and
good for the citizens of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beth Burrows, president of the Edmonds Institute, the lead
plaintiff, said the latest ruling would be appealed. She said the
park service had sold what belonged to the public to a private
company for ``way too little.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking profit-sharing, Yellowstone wants to avoid a repeat
of what happened in the 1960s, when a microbe discovered in a hot
spring at Yellowstone yielded a heat-resistant enzyme that is now
instrumental in the polymerase chain reaction, a technique for
replicating DNA that is widely used in science, medicine and
fingerprinting.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor won a Nobel Prize, and patents related to the
enzyme now bring in an estimated $100 million a year to
Hoffmann-LaRoche, the drug company. Yellowstone has received
nothing.

TEXAS TAXPAYERS WIN ANOTHER ROUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Since someone trying to raise shrimp in West
Texas probably needs all the help he can get, it was understandable
that Bart Reid would turn to a government loan program.
</P>
<P>
   Reid got the loan guarantee for his company, Permian Sea Shrimp
&AMP; Seafood of Imperial City. But he also got what he didn't want _
public disclosure of his business records.
</P>
<P>
   His experience prompted a court fight over privacy rights vs.
the taxpayers' right to know how their money is being spent _ or,
in the case of a loan guarantee, how it may be spent if the loan
goes bad.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an Austin judge who overlooked the Constitution, Reid
and his bank won the first round. Thanks to a second judge, the
taxpayers won the second. But the overriding conflict isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it will worsen as businesses continue to seek the
taxpayers' help and _ in this age of increasing privatization of
public services _ realize new profits from government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Raising shrimp in land-locked West Texas _ Pecos County, to be
more precise _ may not be as improbable as it seems, thanks to
aquifers with water as saline as the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But it was risky enough for the First National Bank of Monahans
to ask that the state help guarantee a $360,000 loan to Reid's
company. The guarantee was made through a Texas Department of
Agriculture program designed to encourage innovative business
ventures for whom conventional financing is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Reid provided the state with information
about his company, including financial data and names of clients.
And he also signed an agreement that the information could be made
public, which was only proper because Texas taxpayers could be
called upon to bail out the company if it defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   But when The Associated Press, acting under the state's Public
Information Act, obtained copies of Reid's loan documents from the
agricultural agency to help prepare a story on the loan guarantee
program, the businessman and his banker objected and went to court.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said he hadn't realized how much of his company's
information would be made public and said the material released to
the AP included trade secrets that could help competitors.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Margaret Cooper of Austin, ignoring clear
constitutional precedent, granted Reid and his lender a restraining
order earlier this month, temporarily prohibiting the AP from
publishing a story based on the documents that the news
organization had legally obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order amounted to an unconstitutional act of prior
restraint, and, fortunately, it was lifted eight days later by a
second Austin judge, Suzanne Covington.
</P>
<P>
   The AP then published its story by reporter Chris Williams,
which made clear the importance of requiring participants in the
agricultural loan program to share their financial data with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The program, according to a state audit that the AP also
obtained, has a $7.8 million deficit. And 22 of the 83 loans
guaranteed under the program from 1993 to 1996 had defaulted,
meaning tax dollars may eventually be required to repay them.
</P>
<P>
   No loans guaranteed after 1996 have gone bad, and Reid's loan is
current, although his company was still in the red last year, the
AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   With hard work and good fortune, Reid may be successful. Texas
taxpayers should certainly hope so, since they may lose some money
if he fails.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as taxpayers are potentially on the hook should Reid
default on his loan, they have every right to know what shape his
company was in when he got the loan guarantee. Openness helps keep
everyone accountable, including officials who approved Reid's
application.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be conflict between the confidentiality that
cloaks most business dealings and the openness that is supposed to
characterize government. And loan guarantees are only part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Open government issues also have been growing in Texas in the
rush to privatize a host of public services _ from printing
documents to running prisons. Some companies are eager to profit
from taxpayers but less willing to share information.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that dislike scrutiny should avoid the public trough.
But many won't, as long as they can find a way to restrict what the
public can learn about public-private endeavors.

<P>
   PILL DEADLINES
</P>
<P>
   Q. How are expiration dates for medicines determined? Are
expiration dates simply inducements to repurchase?
</P>
<P>
   A. Expiration dates for drugs are estimates of their shelf lives
with proper storage in sealed containers, away from harmful and
variable factors like heat and humidity. The dates are based on
data, called accelerated stability data, derived from testing by
the manufacturers, that show the product will be good for a certain
period.
</P>
<P>
   There is no incentive for manufacturers to shorten the
deadlines, said Tom McGinniss, a pharmacist who is director of
pharmaceutical affairs for the Food and Drug Administration. On the
contrary, he said, ``most manufacturers keep small inventories and
make the product fresh as the need arises, and all of the product
gets through the system in two or three years.'' A manufacturer is
not allowed to move up or to extend the date without submitting
data to support it and would have to prove that a drug was stable
past the original date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA does not recommend that medicines be kept at all past
the current course of therapy, even if they have not expired,
especially if there are children around,'' McGinniss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no data to show that a drug is still OK for a year
past the expiration date if it is unopened,'' he said. ``Scientists
don't know how much loss of potency could occur with out-of-date
drugs, or what else might be happening, like a chemical change.''

   SHATTERPROOF CROPS
</P>
<P>
   Consumers of a certain age will no doubt remember when Prell
shampoo switched from glass bottles (the kind they dropped pearls
into in those memorable TV commercials) to unbreakable plastic
squeeze tubes. Suddenly, bathrooms everywhere were safer places.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several decades later, there is an effort under way to make
some agricultural plants shatterproof as well. The goal is not to
make fields safer for farmers, of course, but to increase crop
yields.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of California at San Diego have
identified genes in a plant that are responsible for the shattering
of the seed pod, which allows seeds to disperse. The scientists,
reporting in the journal Nature, found the genes in that old
laboratory standby, arabidopsis, a weed that is a member of the
mustard family, but the findings could have implications for
related crops like canola, the source of canola oil.
</P>
<P>
   The seed pod of arabidopsis consists of two elongated
half-shells separated by a thin structure called a replum. The
genes, affect a narrow band of cells where the half-shells meet the
replum. At a late stage in development, these cells begin to
separate. Eventually the half-shells detach, and the seeds fall
out. In mutant strains of arabidopsis that lacked these genes, the
researchers discovered, seed pods did not shatter.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suspect that identical genes are found in
canola. Because oil accumulates in canola seeds relatively late in
development, farmers usually wait until the crop matures before
harvesting it. This can mean that much of the crop _ up to 50
percent in some cases _ is lost to pod shatter. So by developing
shatterproof varieties, yields of canola oil may be greatly
increased.
</P>
<P>
   AMAZON'S VANISHING TREES
</P>
<P>
   There is a divide-and-conquer chain of events being played out
in the central Amazon. Humans divide up the rain forest by
clear-cutting, and nature conquers by killing off a
disproportionately large number of big trees in the remaining
forest.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of a study of 350 square miles of rain
forest near Manaus, Brazil, by scientists with the National
Institute for Amazonian Research. The researchers, who wrote about
their work in Nature, kept track of more than 64,000 trees with
trunks more than four inches in diameter for about two decades.
Some of the trees were in plots of land within continuous areas of
rain forest, while others were in fragments of forest up to 100
acres in size.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that many more trees died near the edges
of forest fragments than within continuous forests, and that a far
higher proportion of the dead trees near edges were more than 24
inches in trunk diameter. Since trees of that size make up
something like one-quarter of the above-ground biomass in the
Amazon, the study results are a cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists suggest three reasons why large trees in
fragmented areas are dying at a faster rate. First, thick,
inflexible trunks may be more susceptible to uprooting in windy
conditions, which are worse near the edge of forests. Second, old
trees are more susceptible to infestation by lianas and other
parasitic vines, which are more prevalent near edges. And third,
taller trees get more sun and are therefore more likely to be
affected by drier edge conditions.

&HT;     YOUNG CONDUCTOR ENJOYS STELLAR DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALLAN ULRICH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Few young conductors live up to their advance
notices, but reports on Alan Gilbert proved mostly right last week,
when the young American musician made his San Francisco Symphony
debut at Davies Symphony Hall and scored high where you would least
expect it _ in the Teutonic Romantic repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Any conductor for whom Robert Schumann's Symphony No. 2 in C
Major, Op. 61, is a calling card is someone worth watching.
Gilbert's debut performance Thursday duplicated the fine reports
that came out of New York last winter when Gilbert led the work
with the Orchestra of St. Luke's. On this side of the continent, he
found the thread that connects these four movements (which in
lesser hands can sound awfully meandering and diffuse) and wove a
ravishingly lyrical tapestry. He is one to watch.
</P>
<P>
   New York-born, Curtis and Juilliard-trained, Gilbert recently
assumed a position as chief conductor and artistic adviser to the
Royal Stockholm Philharmonic in Sweden. It's impossible to believe
that his future activities won't be concentrated stateside. For the
San Francisco Symphony, he offered sane musicianship, a jittery
podium style in which almost every entry was cued and uncommon
respect for dynamics. Most listeners would not rate the C Major
Symphony the best of Schumann's four, but the case for it has
rarely been made so cogently.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's entire debut program verged on the unorthodox. He
opened with the Symphony premiere of Jay Alan Yim's ``Rough Magic''
_ you have to have a bit of razzle-dazzle _ and accompanied the
orchestra's principal cello Michael Grebanier in Shostakovich's
Cello Concerto No. 2, Op. 126.
</P>
<P>
   What impressed most in the Schumann was its proportion. Gilbert
divided his violins in the 18th-century manner, encouraged only
moderate vibrato and proposed decisive cadences. Perhaps the sound
of the orchestra missed the lustrousness to which we have become
accustomed this season, but responsiveness counts as much as
sonority.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a work the Romantic excess of which needs taming,
some of that wildness should occasionally seep through the
restraints. Gilbert launched into the opening sostenuto at such a
daringly slow tempo that the symphony's brass found themselves
seriously extended. They held on, barely. But, then the sweep
through the Allegro was robust, assertive and abundant in often
concealed detail.
</P>
<P>
   The Scherzo looks back to Mendelssohn in its busy figurations
and is as mercurial as Schumann ever gets. Here, Gilbert guided the
strings without serious mishap, abridging some of the conventional
rests in an impulsive dash to the double bar line. The Adagio
remains the composer's most heartfelt and here the conductor let it
flow, keeping the textures light and the articulation clean,
sustaining a pulse, scarcely regearing for transitions. Excellent
contributions here from the winds, notably principal clarinet David
Breeden.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was magical and the dash through the finale, its
final statement in the home key, impressed deeply. This should take
care of the Schumann Second Symphony for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The last word on the Shostakovich Concerto, however, was not
pronounced in the San Francisco Symphony performance on Thursday.
Finished in 1966 and premiered by Mstislav Rostropovich, the piece
betrays the composer's fingerprints everywhere _ in the slow,
soulful ``Largo'' and in the burlesque elements of the Allegretto.
Here, a Russian street song is transformed to the point of parody.
The final movement, with its trading of fanfares between brass and
soloist, offers episodes of innovation before a recapitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich cannot resist, at the end, the ironic jabs (from
the percussion) that, along with a certain mournfulness, mark his
final period. Yet, the piece wanders too much for its own sake,
missing the acerbic economy of the earlier concerto in E-flat.
</P>
<P>
   What the later concerto retains are the Olympian demands made
upon the soloist, who is rarely silent throughout and whose primacy
is rarely challenged by the lightly scored orchestra. Grebanier
introduced this work to the San Francisco Symphony in 1985 and he
has mastered much of it since then.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrical writing drew a tensile line from the soloist
Thursday, a bit edgy, but phrased with melancholic expansiveness.
Where Shostakovich demands a more fiery response, Grebanier
remained dutiful and merely human. Double stops were not clean,
pitch was unreliable, tone was rough, dynamics were slighted.
</P>
<P>
   If you were interested in mere sound, ``Rough Magic'' furnished
a full 16 minutes of it. Premiered in 1997 by the Chicago Symphony,
this percussive essay is basically one long chord progression. It's
also noisy, unrelenting and entirely unrelated to its
Shakespeare-derived title. Gilbert and an augmented percussion
section gave it their all.

<P>
   This term, the U.S. Supreme Court heard appeals in three cases
that involve the Fourth Amendment. Amazingly, what's left of the
Fourth Amendment came out unscathed in two out of the three court
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   This may indicate a tiny change of heart among the court's more
conservative justices. It's too little, too late _ in the past two
decades, the high court has hacked most of the essential
protections out of the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Amendment once guaranteed: ``The right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,
and the persons or things to be seized.'' However, the words
``secure,'' ``warrants,'' ``probable cause,'' and ``particularly
describing'' in the amendment's proscription against government
intrusion have been shredded into mere confetti by the court.
</P>
<P>
   The high court allows random drug testing of groups of people _
with no probable cause and no particular person as a target.
``Reasonable suspicion'' has replaced ``probable cause'' as a
criteria for many police searches and seizures. The court allows
law enforcement officials to seize and keep citizens' property
based upon so-called reasonable suspicion, even when no criminal
charges have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The best recent news for the Fourth Amendment comes from the
case, Bond vs. United States, decided April 17, in which the high
court reversed the ruling by the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bond was a passenger on a Greyhound bus traveling from
California to Arkansas. The bus stopped at a border patrol
checkpoint in Texas and a border patrol agent boarded the bus to
check the immigration status of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the agent worked his way to the
back of the bus and was satisfied that the passengers were lawfully
in the country. He began walking back to the front of the bus, but
along the way, he squeezed the soft luggage which passengers had
placed in the overhead racks.
</P>
<P>
   When he squeezed the green canvas bag belonging to Bond, he felt
a brick-like object in it and asked Bond if it was his bag. Bond
admitted that it was. The border agent asked if he could inspect
it, and Bond agreed to allow the agent to open his bag. The agent
found a brick of methamphetamine wrapped in duct tape and rolled in
a pair of pants.
</P>
<P>
   Bond was found guilty of possession and sent to prison. He
appealed on the grounds that the agent's manipulation of his canvas
bag was an illegal search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The
court of appeals upheld his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the 7-2 decision for the
Supreme Court. He asked two pivotal questions. Did Bond, by his
conduct, exhibit an actual expectation of privacy in regard to the
contents of his luggage? And was Bond's expectation of privacy
``one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable''?
</P>
<P>
   The court answered ``yes'' to both questions. The bag was opaque
and Bond had placed it directly above his seat. Passengers may
expect bus employees to move their bags but not prod them in an
exploratory manner.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the court ruled, the border agent in his ``physical
manipulation'' of Bond's bag ``violated the Fourth Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   This ruling seems to pull back from the high court's previous
decisions that allow police to sift through garbage bags on public
streets, to use aircraft to look into a fenced backyard of a home,
and to use dogs to sniff for drugs hidden inside luggage. This
clash with prior decisions caused Justices Stephen Breyer and
Antonin Scalia to dissent.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, in the case, Florida vs. J.L., a unanimous Supreme
Court ruled that an anonymous tip, which lacks any indication of
being reliable, cannot be used as the sole reason to justify a
police officer stopping and frisking a person for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   This ruling comports with previous rulings of the court but
clarifies the limits of anonymous tips. The high court also denied
the Justice Department's request for an exception to the
stop-and-frisk law when it involves firearms. Pat-downs cannot be
conducted simply on the whim of a police officer. There must be
reasonable suspicion, says the court.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, a 5-4 Supreme Court decided the case, Illinois vs.
Wardlow, in which it ruled that law enforcement officials can stop
and frisk a person who flees a high crime area when the police
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote for the majority: ``Headlong flight _ wherever
it occurs _ is the consummate act of evasion: it is not necessarily
indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such.''
And triggers the notion of ``reasonable suspicion,'' according to
the court. Therefore, the stop-and-frisk does not violate the
Fourth Amendment, wrote Rehnquist, because the ``stop is a ...
minimal intrusion, simply allowing the officer to briefly
investigate further.''
</P>
<P>
   The four dissenting justices found Rehnquist's expansive notion
of ``reasonable suspicion'' unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The very wording of the Wardlow ruling indicates just how much
has been eliminated from the protections supposedly guaranteed by
the Fourth Amendment. The court now claims that a stop-and-frisk is
merely a ``minimal intrusion.''
</P>
<P>
   I doubt whether the framers of our Constitution would have
considered it that.

 &HT;    DAVIDIANS' ATTORNEYS PREDICT REVERSAL OF GUN SENTENCES
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. With COURT-FOREMAN.
 &HT;    By TOMMY WITHERSPOON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorneys for five Branch Davidians serving lengthy
prison terms for manslaughter and weapons convictions predicted
Monday that the U.S. Supreme Court will order drastic reductions in
their clients' sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court heard about one hour of oral arguments Monday
morning from a Justice Department attorney and a lawyer for the
imprisoned sect members.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the government must allege to a jury that
the type of firearm used in a violent crime is an element of the
offense, or if the type of gun is a sentencing factor to be
determined by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   All of the justices, with the exception of Clarence Thomas,
vigorously questioned attorneys on both sides, challenging their
positions and asking how many cases nationwide might be affected if
they sided with the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven sect members were tried in 1994 on various charges,
including conspiracy to murder federal agents, stemming from a gun
battle at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. That
battle took place Feb. 28, 1993, weeks before the final federal
raid on the compound in which 76 sect members died in a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Four members were acquitted of all charges stemming from the gun
battle. Five others were convicted on the lesser manslaughter
charge, and also were convicted of carrying or using a firearm
during a crime of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian attorneys believed the firearm charge carried a
mandatory consecutive five-year prison term. However, at
sentencing, U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco found
that the Davidians had used machine guns or ``enhanced weapons''
against federal agents, and increased their prison sentences from
five to 30 years on the weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what kind of weapons the Davidians used was not
presented to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James K. Robinson argued Monday that
the type of weapons is a matter for the judge to decide at
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   But several justices questioned that notion with Chief Justice
William Rehnquist likening it to the ``tail wagging the dog.''
Later, Justice Antonin Scalia, using Rehquist's analogy, noted the
25-year difference in sentences and said, ``That's a very long
tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sharpest questioning of Robinson came from Justice
Stephen Breyer, who indicated that there are vast differences
between carrying a pistol and using a machine gun or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to see this as a sentencing issue,'' Breyer said.
``It seems Congress probably intended for juries to consider these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson responded to the questions by saying circuit courts are
split on the issue, the congressional intent of the law is
ambiguous, and the government is convinced that the types of
weapons used in violent offenses is a matter best determined by a
judge and reserved for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   After the court session, Houston attorney Steven ``Rocket''
Rosen said that ``I claim total victory'' for his Davidian client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the justices by their questioning and their animation
and their logic sense that the sentences should be five years,''
Rosen said. ``They seemed to indicate that it is unjust to say that
you have a sentence for five years for firearms and then move to
machine guns and have up to a 30-year sentence and not have a jury
decide that issue. I think that was clear by their questioning. We
are going to win. That is not even a prediction. It's a clear-cut
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen represents Kevin Whitecliff, who is serving a 40-year
prison term along with Jaime Castillo, Renos Avraam and Brad
Branch. If the Davidians prevail on appeal, their sentences would
be cut from 40 years to 15 years. They have been in custody since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The four were acquitted of murder conspiracy charges, which
carries a life prison term, but were sentenced to a consecutive
10-year term for manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian Graeme Craddock, who was sentenced to consecutive
10-year terms for possession of a grenade and using a firearm
during a crime, could get his sentence cut by five years.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials expect an opinion in the case before the court
recesses in late June.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Halbrook of Fairfax, Va., a nationally known expert
on gun laws, argued the case on behalf of the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel optimistic about the case,'' Halbrook said. ``I did so
before we went into the courtroom because this court, as it
demonstrated last term, is really doing a lot to stand up for the
right to jury trial in this country, the long tradition that goes
back many centuries to England and the Middle Ages. This is one of
the reasons that we had the American Revolution, because the right
to jury trial was being violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Halbrook said the original trial jury in San Antonio likely
would have acquitted the Davidians on the weapons charges if the
government had alleged in the indictment that they used machine
guns against agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms who had come to arrest sect leader David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't evidence that these people had machine
guns,'' Halbrook said. ``It was a trumped-up charge, it was never
asserted to the jury and something that nobody heard anything about
until sentencing came around. It was the prosecution theory: 'Let's
stick it to them' after they didn't get convictions on the murder
conspiracy charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Waco attorneys Richard Ferguson and Stanley Rentz, who represent
Branch and Craddock, respectively, said they were encouraged by the
justices' questions to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said he is ``very optimistic'' about the chances of
getting the sentences reversed and sent back to Judge Smith for
resentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was extremely positive, because several of the
justices who had been lining up on the other side were saying that
they had a problem with this case, like Breyer. So when those guys
start saying that they had a problem, it has to make you feel good.
I feel better about it, but you can never tell what they are going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rentz, too, said he likes the chances for a reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went after the government's attorney and asked him
multiple questions, and he didn't really have good answers for most
of those questions,'' Rentz said. ``I thought it was favorable for
us. All of the justices seemed to be troubled with the case as a
whole, where they could be sentenced for something that they were
not found guilty of.''
</P>
<P>
   The first question by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to both sides
was how many other defendants serving federal sentences for weapons
violations would be affected by a ruling favoring the Branch
Davidians. Both Robinson and Halbrook said not that many cases
would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson saw that as a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For her to be concerned about that, it means that she is
considering finding in our favor, but she wants to make sure that
there aren't 10,000 cases out there that would need to be
resentenced,'' Ferguson said. ``I don't think there would be that
many because normally it was done the way it should have been
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist chided Robinson for the inconsistency among in the
nation's 13th federal circuit courts on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't there any continuity authority in the Justice
Department? Isn't there a way that the department can make all of
this standard around the country?'' Rehnquist asked.

SCIENTISTS LINING UP TO EXPLAIN THE MATH OF A SIMPLE TOY

<P>
   Spin a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As the spin slows, the coin begins to topple, and the spinning
transforms into a new dynamic: the coin rolls around along its rim
in a circular motion. As the coin topples farther, it rolls around
faster and faster, emitting a whir of rising pitch. Then, with a
final shudder, the quarter lies still.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by this phenomenon, a San Diego engineer several
years ago created a toy that extends the circular rolling to
seemingly gravity-defying lengths of time. That toy, in turn,
inspired a British scientist to delve into the underlying
mathematics, and now he has devised a model to explain how the
rolling speed can accelerate even as the disc is losing energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a paradox,'' said Dr. H. Keith Moffatt, director of the
Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge,
England. ``To explain that sort of behavior with mathematics is
very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffatt, who reported his work in the current issue of the
journal Nature, said he was paging through a mail order catalog a
couple of years ago looking for toys for his grandchildren when an
item called ``Euler's disc'' caught his eye. Named after 18th
century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, the toy consists of
just two pieces: a 14-ounce chrome-plated steel disc and a
circular, slightly concave platform. ``I sent for it,'' Moffatt
said. ``It's an interesting and instructive toy.''
</P>
<P>
   The operating instructions were simple: spin disc on platform.
Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Moffatt observed that the disc itself was not rotating very
fast. What was rotating was the point of contact where the disc met
the surface. The phenomenon is similar to what happens when
baseball fans do the ``wave'' _ the pattern of rising and falling
arms circles the stadium, but the fans themselves remain
stationary. Similarly, the rim of the disc is rising and falling at
a quickening pace, but the disc is almost stationary when looked at
from above.
</P>
<P>
   In a vacuum, a perfectly rigid disc on an absolutely hard
surface would roll forever. In the real world, air resistance slows
the disc, toppling it over.
</P>
<P>
   Moffatt, who usually directs his mathematical inquiries in the
field of fluid mechanics, became intrigued at how the disc
continued its pirouette for more than a minute and a half, compared
with the few seconds of rattling around of a coin.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with an equation Euler first wrote down more than two
centuries ago to describe the motion of spinning objects, Moffatt
calculated that heavier discs rolled longer and that the rolling
speed increased as the disc approached the surface.
</P>
<P>
   In the final one one-hundredth of a second before the disc comes
to a rest, the theory fails _ the calculations suggest the disc
would reach an infinite rolling speed, which, as a practical
matter, is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What breaks down in this system is that the disc stops rolling
and begins slipping,'' Moffatt said. Still, for scientists, knowing
when a theory does not work is as important as knowing when it does
work. In this case, the calculations assume the disc is rolling
without slipping. The prediction of an infinite rolling speed
suggests this assumption does not hold in the final fraction of
second.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific attention naturally pleased the toy's inventor,
Joseph Bendik of San Diego. ``That's a very nice thing,'' Bendik
said of Moffatt's paper.
</P>
<P>
   While a material sciences engineer at Hughes Aircraft in the
mid-1980s, Bendik started playing around with some metal discs,
noticing that on hard surfaces, the discs rolled around longer.
``About 40 to 45 seconds, the brain thinks, `Wow, what's making
that thing go for such a long time?''' Bendik said.
</P>
<P>
   Through experimentation, Bendik figured out the same
relationship between rolling time and disc weight calculated by
Moffatt. With aesthetic improvements _ a holographic sticker and a
mirrored platform _ the toy found a commercial home at Tangent Toy
of San Diego in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moffatt was not the only scientist intrigued by Euler's disc.
After reading an article about the toy, Dr. David O. Harris, a
professor of chemistry at the University of California at Santa
Barbara, wrote Bendik a note pointing out that the disc's motion
resembled the dynamics of some ring-shaped molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he admired Moffatt's calculations but, as an
experimentalist, he wanted to put them to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious question is, has anyone put one of these discs in
a vacuum chamber?'' he said. ``If I can find a vacuum system big
enough, I'll do it, and then I'll write a paper and put it in
Nature that either confirms it or doesn't. That's what science is
all about, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he found a colleague down the hall with a
suitable chamber. ``It's not profound,'' Harris said of his
projected experiment, but it is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all he needed was to buy the toy.

15 RUSSIAN TROOPS KILLED IN AMBUSH BY CHECHEN REBELS

  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just days after Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the
secessionist southern region of Chechnya, was reported to have
ordered guerrilla commanders to suspend combat operations so that
peace talks might take hold, a rebel force attacked a Russian
military convoy on Sunday, Russian officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that as many as 15 Russian soldiers were
killed. A Chechen rebel spokesman, Movladi Udugov, contended that
80 Russian troops had died and an armored column of 23 tanks and
armored vehicles had been destroyed in the attack near the village
of Serzhen-Yurt, 16 miles from the bombed out regional capital,
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was organized by a Chechen guerrilla leader, Shamil
Basayev, whose forces placed 15 anti-tank mines in the convoy's
path, the rebels said. A two-hour firefight ensued, and Russian
warplanes and helicopters were summoned to rescue the unit and
evacuate the dead and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A Chechen spokesman said the Russians bombed the nearby village
of Serzhen-Yurt in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials initially said only five soldiers had
died, but Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev acknowledged Monday that
15 soldiers died and six were wounded. He said six vehicles were
destroyed, most of them fuel tankers. Russian troops said they had
killed 20 Chechen rebels and captured 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Gennady Troshev, commander of the Russian forces in
Chechnya, said at a news conference in Khankala: ``The commanders
cannot be reproached for this. The servicemen acted in full
accordance with the rules, and the fighters were properly
repulsed.'' A group of 80 to 100 rebels led by an Arab had
assaulted the convoy along its entire length and from both sides,
he said. He gave the Russian death toll as 13.
</P>
<P>
   The attack followed accusations that incompetence had led to a
rebel ambush a month ago in which 36 Russians died. And it ended a
weekend of recriminations over Maskhadov's peace initiative, which
was reported Friday in an interview published by the newspaper
Kommersant. In that interview, Maskhadov said the relative calm on
the battlefield in recent weeks ``is directly attributed to my
order to suspend the hostilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This order is an element of the peaceful resolution plan I
suggested,'' he continued. ``Moreover, I have given my consent to
unconditional liberation of all Russian prisoners. All field
commanders have been ordered to free all prisoners and hostages
they may be holding.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview raised hopes that a peace effort might be in the
formative stages and that Maskhadov might have the support of
powerful field commanders, like Baseyev, to begin serious political
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Baseyev was quoted by Chechen spokesmen as saying,
``We are observing the orders'' of Maskhadov, ``but if the
aggressors attack, we are forced to defend ourselves.'' Baseyev
also claimed that as many as 15,000 Russian troops were in the
Vedeno gorge area, attacking mountain villages and killing dozens
of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Then, later that day, Maskhadov amended his remarks. In an
interview with the U.S.-funded Radio Liberty, he said the
Kommersant correspondents who had interviewed him ``did not
understand me properly.'' He said he would only call a cease fire
if both sides agreed to stop fighting and political negotiations
began. ``So, on a unilateral cease fire, there was nothing on
that,'' Maskhadov said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said Chechen leaders are willing to submit to the peace plan
put forward by the Political Assembly of the Council of Europe,
which calls on both sides to enter a cease fire and undertake
political negotiations without preconditions while releasing all
hostages. He denied that Chechen rebels would be ready to release
prisoners of war without preconditions, as Kommersant had quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What was most apparent by the end of the weekend was that the
war was still on, with large-scale movements of Russian troops into
the gorges south of Grozny. The apparent strategy is to try to trap
rebels, who have demonstrated a capability to carry out hit-and-run
attacks in areas ostensibly under the control of Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   It was also apparent from weekend statements by Russian
officials that they do not believe Maskhadov has the political or
military strength to control rebel commanders like Baseyev and
that, in any case, the Russia president-elect, Vladimir Putin, and
his senior military advisers remain determined to achieve a
military victory over the major rebel groups still opposing them in
Chechnya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also Monday, Ruslan Aushev, the leader of Ingushetia, a region
that borders on Chechnya, estimated that 15,000 to 17,000 rebels
are still active in Chechnya _ more than acknowledged by Russian
military commanders. Aushev, in an interview with Russian
television, said he believed that Maskhadov had been serious in his
effort to initiate peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maskhadov took one more step toward beginning a dialogue,'' by
making the statements attributed to him in Kommersant, he said .
``I understand that if the federal authorities began to support
this dialogue, Maskhadov would give the order to stop combat
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``This process must be mutual.''

`REWIRED' FERRETS OVERTURN THEORIES OF BRAIN GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like inventive electricians rewiring a house, scientists at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology have reconfigured newborn
ferret brains so that the animals' eyes are hooked up to brain
regions where hearing normally develops.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising result is that the ferrets develop fully
functioning visual pathways in the auditory portions of their
brains. In other words, they see the world with brain tissue that
was only thought capable of hearing sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported by Dr. Mriganka Sur and his colleagues in
the April 20 issue of Nature magazine, contradict popular theories
on how animal brains develop specialized regions for seeing,
hearing, sensing touch and, in humans, generating language and
emotional states.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists claim that genes operating before birth create
these specialized regions or modules, arguing for example that the
visual cortex is destined to process vision and little else. But
the ferret experiments show that brain regions are not set in stone
at birth. Rather, they develop specialized functions based on the
kind of information flowing into them after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some scientists are going to have a hard time believing these
experiments,'' said Dr. Jon Kaas, a professor of psychology at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville. They demonstrate, Kaas said,
``that the cortex can develop in all sorts of directions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just waiting for signals from the environment and will
wire itself according to the input it gets,'' he said. The findings
may shed light on unusual brain patterns observed in people who are
born deaf or blind, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to create a dream experiment, this would be
it,'' said Dr. Michael Merzenich, a neuroscientist at the
University of California at San Francisco and a leading authority
on the brain's ability to change and reorganize, a process known as
plasticity. ``It's about the most compelling demonstration you
could have that experience shapes the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are all members or former members of the
department of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The rewiring experiments began more than 10 years ago, Sur said.
He chose ferrets because their brains are very immature at birth
and undergo a late form of development that the researchers can
exploit. As in humans, the ferret's optic and auditory nerves
travel through a way station called the thalamus before reaching
areas in the higher brain or cortex where vision and hearing are
perceived.
</P>
<P>
   In humans, this very basic wiring is present at birth, but in
ferrets, these important nerves grow into the thalamus after the
animal is born. Sur found that if he stopped the auditory nerve
from entering the thalamus, the optic nerve would arrive a few days
later and make a double connection. It would go on through the
thalamus and connect itself up to both seeing and hearing regions
of the cortex.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then waited to see what would happen to the
hearing region of the brain once it was getting all its signals
from the retina.
</P>
<P>
   After a ferret or human is born, cells in the brain's primary
visual area become highly specialized for analyzing the orientation
of lines found in images or shapes. Some cells fire only in
response to vertical lines. If presented with a horizontal or
slanted line, they don't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   Other cells fire exclusively when a horizontal line falls on
them and yet others fire in response to lines slanted at various
angles. These specialized cells are draped across the primary
visual area in a somewhat splotchy fashion that resembles a bunch
of pinwheels.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing region of the brain is organized very differently,
Sur said. Each cell is connected to the next in a kind of single
line. There are no pinwheel shapes.
</P>
<P>
   After the rewired ferrets matured, researchers looked at the
auditory region of their brains and found that cells were organized
pinwheel fashion. They found horizontal connections between cells
responding to similar orientations. The rewired map was less
orderly than the maps found in normal visual cortex, Sur said, but
looked as if it might be functional.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then asked, What does the rewired ferret
experience? Does it see or does it hear with its auditory cortex?
</P>
<P>
   Rewired ferrets were trained to turn their heads one way if they
heard a sound and in the other direction if they saw a flash of
light. In these experiments, one hemisphere was rewired and the
other was left normal as a control. Thus the animals could always
hear with the intact side of their brains and were deaf in the
rewired side.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, when the light was presented to the rewired
side, the animals responded correctly. But when connections to
visual areas were severed on the rewired side, the animals still
responded to the light. It meant that they were seeing lights with
their rewired auditory cortex, Sur said.
</P>
<P>
   The research reopens the question of what are the relative
contributions of genes and experience in building brain structure,
according to Kaas.
</P>
<P>
   Genes, Kaas suggests, create a basic scaffold but not much
structure. Thus, in a normal human brain, the optic nerve is an
inborn scaffold connected to the primary visual area. But it is
only after images pour into this area from the outside world that
it becomes the seeing part of the brain. All the newborn cortex
knows about the outside world is from the electrical activity of
these inputs, or images that fall on the retina, sounds that reach
the inner ear or touch sensations that press on the skin, Kaas
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the inputs arrive, the cells organize themselves into
circuits and functional regions. As these circuits grow larger and
more complex, Kaas said, they become less malleable and, probably
with the help of changes in neurochemistry, become stabilized. This
is why a mature brain is less able to recover from injury than a
very young brain.
</P>
<P>
   Young brains are astonishingly plastic, Kaas said. For example,
he said, children who suffer from a severe form of epilepsy that is
treatable only by removing one-half of their brains can learn to
walk, talk, throw balls and otherwise develop normally with only
half a brain, if operated on early in life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, scientists are also discovering that adult
brains, as well, can undergo surprising changes in response to
experience. For example, imaging experiments carried out on blind
people show that when they learn to read Braille, ``visual'' areas
of their brains light up. Touch seems to be residing in visual
areas. Similar experiments on deaf people show that they use the
auditory cortex to read sign language, whereas people who can hear
use the visual areas of the brain for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Sur said his laboratory was now searching for molecules that
help produce these kinds of changes in mature and developing
brains. If the chemistry of regrowth and reorganization can be
understood, he said, it would offer new avenues for helping people
recover from damage caused by strokes, accidents and various brain
diseases.

 &HT;    WACO TRIAL JUROR STILL FOLLOWING 1994 CASE
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. With COURT-WACO.
 &HT;    By TOMMY WITHERSPOON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been six years since the Branch Davidian
criminal trial in San Antonio, but Sarah Bain just can't seem to
get it out of her system.
</P>
<P>
   The self-styled ``skeptical patriot'' served as presiding juror
at the 1994 trial of 11 Branch Davidians charged with killing
federal agents during a shootout at Mount Carmel outside Waco on
Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bain has been openly critical of U.S. District Judge Walter S.
Smith Jr. for sentencing six of the sect members to 40-year prison
terms, even after the jury found them not guilty of murder
conspiracy charges. One defendant is not appealing his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Bain disagreed with the lengthy sentences and said it was not
the jury's intent to see the Branch Davidians in prison for so
long. She has strong feelings about the sentences, which she said
``absolutely shocked'' her, and does not hesitate to share those
thoughts with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not too surprising that Bain, now 53 and retired after
teaching high school Spanish for 17 years in New Braunfels, was in
Washington on Monday for oral arguments in the Branch Davidian
appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here hoping to see the turnaround of what I consider to
be some really unjust sentences that the court handed down in 1994
following the trial there in San Antonio,'' Bain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the jury made that really severe error on the
federal firearms charge, and when we were made aware of that
mistake and the judge told us that would have to be thrown out,
most of us thought, 'Well, good,' because we almost felt trapped
the way it was worded and having to find them guilty on that
count,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury acquitted the Davidians on murder conspiracy
charges, the judge set aside the convictions for using firearms
during a violent crime. He said that the weapons convictions were
not consistent with the murder conspiracy acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   However, government prosecutors argued that inconsistent
verdicts are valid and convinced Smith to reinstate the weapons
charges. The judge later found that the Davidians used ``enhanced''
weapons, such as machine guns and grenades, and agreed with the
government that five of the Davidians deserved 30-year terms on the
gun counts instead of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed to decide if the government should be
required to allege in indictments what type of weapons defendants
use and whether that issue must be presented to juries.
</P>
<P>
   It was not in the Branch Davidian case, and Bain said that was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am most anxious to see if there isn't some possibility that
those sentences can be taken back down to the minimum instead of
augmented to the maximum,'' she said. ``I think maybe the severity
of the sentences and the fact that the severe sentences are based
on what I consider a jury error is really keeping me involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain and a friend from San Antonio were about the only ones not
associated with a party to the litigation or the media to show up
for the Supreme Court session. There were no protests by Davidian
sympathizers, no marches by militia groups who have attended April
19 memorial services at Mount Carmel for those who died in the 1993
fire.
</P>
<P>
   As Bain spoke outside the Supreme Court building, her words were
drowned out by anti-abortion and gay rights groups. The court will
address those hot-button issues later this week, and they seemed to
take some of the spotlight from the controversial Davidian case.
</P>
<P>
   Bain, who has a Spanish and education degree from Baylor
University, said she has attended five of the seven memorial
services at Mount Carmel, hoping to bring her involvement with the
case to a close. It didn't work, she said, adding that she has been
disappointed by some of the ``fringe groups'' who have attended
recent services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be in an area where the United States flag is
flying upside down, even though I understand that all that means is
a nation in distress,'' Bain said. ``It is really not unpatriotic,
but it seems unpatriotic to me, and I am a patriot. A skeptical
patriot, but I'm a patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain said the ``intensity'' of the six-week criminal trial in
her hometown seared the case into her psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the time of trial, I had no more of an idea about the
Branch Davidians than what was on the 6 o'clock news, and I was
getting tired of that. So I was really not that involved. But
goodness gracious, that trial was so intense and we had to keep it
all bottled up. We weren't to talk to anyone about it, and I
definitely tried to abide by the court's request that we not talk
to other people. So it was all bottled up for 40 days. It was
really just the intensity of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bain, who retired in 1996, is building a new home in San
Antonio. She said after it is finished, she hopes to work as a
volunteer with disabled children and horses in equestrian therapy
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that somehow will take my mind off all of this,'' she
said with a laugh.

HEALTH ADVICE: A MATTER OF CAUSE, EFFECT AND CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (Science Times)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a popular sport to joke that scientists change their minds
from year to year about what people should do to stay healthy. One
year, we should all be taking beta carotene supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the supplements themselves seem to cause cancer.
One year, it is high iron levels in the blood that are causing
heart disease. The next year it is low levels of folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes all too tempting to recall the scene from Woody
Allen's movie ``Sleeper'' in which the hero wakes up in the future
and discovers that science has decreed that all those health foods
he had been forcing down are actually injurious to health. The
healthy foods are things like sumptuous desserts and hamburgers.
The bad foods are things like bran and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, references to ``Sleeper'' are starting again. It is
not hard to see why when, within weeks, data from large and
rigorous studies have thrown into question two long-held
assumptions about preventive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   First it was estrogen and heart disease. People knew _ or
thought they did _ that taking estrogen pills at menopause, when
estrogen levels wane, protected women with heart disease. People
knew _ or thought they did _ that high-fiber diets protected
against colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, preliminary data from a large federal study
indicate that at least initially hormone replacement therapy is not
protecting postmenopausal women from heart disease and may even be
leading to a tiny increase in heart attacks, strokes and blood
clots in the legs and lungs. The data are far from conclusive, and
few would conclude at this point that estrogen was dangerous. But
the point is that no one really knows whether it protects against
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two large and rigorous federal studies of high-fiber
diets failed to show that they protected against colon cancer. Once
again, the results emphasize that this truth about diet and cancer
is far from established.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will say they knew it all along. If these truths were
so evident, there would be no need to do large studies in which
people were randomly assigned to take estrogen or, for comparison,
to take a dummy pill. There would be no need to do similar studies
with high-fiber diets. In fact, such studies would be unethical
because they would deprive the control groups of a valuable
preventative measure.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for other questions now being investigated: does
examining the colon with sigmoidoscopy screening prevent colon
cancer deaths? Does the PSA test and a digital rectal exam for
prostate cancer save lives? Does a high-fiber diet prevent heart
disease?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problem is one of language. Scientists and the public
alike use words like ``prevents'' and ``protects against'' and
``lowers the risk of'' when they are discussing evidence that is
suggestive, and hypothesis-generating, as well as when they are
discussing evidence that is as firm as science can make it.
</P>
<P>
   As reactions to the estrogen and high-fiber diet studies show,
years of such careless use of language can make preliminary
evidence appear to be ironclad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the biggest problems in this business,'' said Dr.
Gilbert S. Omenn, a public health expert who is executive vice
president for medical affairs at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in the aftermath of the high-fiber diet studies,
researchers were speaking confidently about other measures people
could take to ``prevent'' colon cancer, like exercising and staying
thin. And they were saying that there were reasons to keep eating
fiber because it could ``reduce the risk'' of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the evidence for these statements, the
researchers confessed that it was, of course, the lower level
hypothesis-generating kind.
</P>
<P>
   Omenn came across this problem after a study he directed, and he
has some advice. Omenn's large and rigorous study asked whether
beta carotene, the ingredient in fruits and vegetables that many
thought protected against cancer and heart disease, could, in fact,
protect people. He found that not only were beta carotene
supplements ineffective but they actually increased the risk of
lung cancer in smokers. His findings, and those of others who found
the same thing, were met with shock, denial and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published in 1995 in Annals of Epidemiology, Omenn
urged scientists to be more careful about the words they used. ``We
should be fastidious in referring strictly to `associations' when
the studies have generated associations; we should reserve the
terms `effects,' `reductions,' `decreases' and `protects' to
studies that actually alter incidences of end points, preferably in
randomized, double-masked designs,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly right,'' said Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy
director of the division of cancer prevention at the National
Cancer Institute. As editor of The Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, Kramer deals directly with authors whose words convey
more certainty than their data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often have to work with them to change the wording,''
Kramer said. The ambiguous language is understandable, Kramer
added, because scientists studying preventive measures fervently
want their findings to be meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to look at your data and say, `Gee, I believe it has
strong implications for human health,''' Kramer said. ``It takes a
lot of discipline to slow down and say, `There are a lot of steps
between what I observed and what I hope is true.'''

   HAZARDS: That Cuddly Duckling Can Make You Ill
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella is most commonly associated with eating contaminated
food, but federal health officials are now noting other sources:
baby chicks and ducklings.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention warns that merely handling the young birds _ as children
sometimes do, especially around Easter _ can transmit the disease,
which causes diarrhea, vomiting and fever and can be especially
dangerous to children.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted two outbreaks last year among people who had
handled baby birds. In Michigan, 21 people were infected, three of
whom were hospitalized. In some cases, young birds were kept in
homes, and one boy kept the birds in his bedroom and even in his
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak in Missouri infected 40 people. Again, three were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is spread from animals when people touch infected
feces and then touch their mouths. Other animals, especially
reptiles, also pose a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials urged that people wash their hands carefully
after handling fowl and said the animals might not be appropriate
pets for children.
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL HEALTH: Few Seek Help for Extreme Social Fears
</P>
<P>
   People with social anxiety disorder, a common psychiatric
ailment, realize they have a problem but often fail to seek
treatment because of embarrassment or lack of resources, a study
has found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in The American Journal of Psychiatry, said more
should be done to build public awareness of the treatments and to
educate health care professionals.
</P>
<P>
   People with the disorder often fear speaking with strangers,
dealing with those in authority or being scrutinized by others in
social situations like classes. Sufferers blush, sweat, shake and
even have trouble breathing in such cases. Though numbers vary
widely, some experts say millions of Americans are affected.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on a survey done in 1996 as part of an
annual event that includes free evaluations around the country.
(The next screening is May 3; information is at
www.freedomfromfear.org.) Researchers reviewed survey data from 130
people who showed symptoms of social anxiety disorder to see why so
many had not sought treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The reason cited in 39 percent of the cases was lack of
knowledge about where to go. About 24 percent said they could not
afford care, while 20 percent said they feared what other people
would think. Only 8 percent said they did not believe they had the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Olfson of Columbia University, the lead author of the
study, acknowledged that people with mental problems often failed
to seek treatment. But he said the peculiar nature of this illness
might make it even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people with social anxiety disorder are often
ashamed of their symptoms and therefore inhibited or embarrassed to
discuss them,'' Olfson said.
</P>
<P>
   RISKS AND REMEDIES: When Small Hospitals Fix Big Blockages
</P>
<P>
   Major medical organizations often frown on smaller hospitals
that perform elective angioplasty, saying that the procedure to
unclog arteries and reduce the risk of heart attacks is so delicate
it should be done only at institutions where it is performed
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study suggests benefits to loosening that policy to
allow patients in rural areas better access to the treatment. The
guidelines are not binding, but they can influence state
regulations governing what procedures hospitals can perform.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Circulation, the American Heart Association journal,
researchers said they had studied angioplasty results in California
for 14 years and found that the mortality rates between low- and
high-volume hospitals had become much closer.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 to 1987, hospitals that performed fewer than 200
angioplasties a year had a mortality rate of 2.5 percent, almost
twice as high as the 1.3 percent rate of hospitals that performed
400 or more. But from 1993 to 1996, the mortality rate for
high-volume hospitals remained the same, while for smaller ones it
dropped to 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that the two major groups behind
the recommendations _ the American Heart Association and the
American College of Cardiology _ will ease their policies any time
soon. Instead, the groups, which now suggest that elective
angioplasties be limited to hospitals that perform at least 200 a
year, are considering raising that minimum to as many as 600.
</P>
<P>
   Even the author of the study, Dr. Vivian Ho, a health-management
professor at Washington University in St. Louis, is not pushing the
point. ``I don't think I'm at this moment ready to say they should
change the guidelines to a lower standard,'' Ho said.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Smith, a former president of the heart association,
defended the guidelines. He said the study had merit but called it
limited because of its focus on deaths instead of later heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: Of Suffering, Coping and Damaged Disks
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, as many as 30,000 back operations a year are
performed in the United States to remove damaged discs and fuse the
spine back together to reduce a patient's lower back pain.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, a new study argues, doctors would be better off
shifting their focus to their patients' state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Stanford said they found little correlation
between the tears commonly found in people's vertebral discs and
their level of pain. The findings were reported by Dr. Eugene
Carragee at a recent meeting of the International Society for the
Study of the Lumbar Spine.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors look for tears with MRI scans and a procedure called a
discograph, involving injected dye. If the dye leaks out, it can be
seen in X-rays, and it often causes pain. When the tears and leaks
are found, surgery is often performed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stanford researchers found that many people had torn
discs but suffered little or no pain. A more useful diagnostic
tool, they said, was a psychological test administered to the 96
patients studied. The people with poor coping skills (as well as
those with workers compensation claims or lawsuits related to their
back pain) were more likely to report symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Before recommending surgery, doctors should make sure they
understand their patients' mental states, the researchers said.
Psychological treatment, an exercise program or even simple
reassurance may be more appropriate, they said.
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: Exploring Antisocial Aspects of Autism
</P>
<P>
   One of the classic symptoms of autism is difficulty recognizing
people's faces, one reason, perhaps, why people with autism show so
little interest in other people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at Yale say they may have a better
understanding of the problem, as a result of brain scans.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that people with autism and Asperger's syndrome,
a related condition, perceive faces not as most people do _ as
billboards that display dozens of characteristics including age,
sex and even mood _ but as mere objects.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, people with autism and Asperger's were shown
pictures of faces while in an MRI machine. Their brains showed
little activity in the fusiform gyrus area, that part of the
cerebral cortex that processes faces. Instead, an adjacent region
that processes objects became active.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers could not say whether the brain pattern showed
the cause of autism or simply what happened to the brain after
years of poor socialization. But they said it helped make a case
for intervening early in the lives of children with Asperger's,
while their brains are still malleable.

   LONDON _ I was overlooking The City. The executive dining room
was on the top floor of one of the world's foremost investment
banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the co-head of a small Internet start-up, I had a certain
sense of accomplishment. A feeling that the playing field had been
leveled. That the small could triumph and reach the heights. And
that the view was pretty nice from up here.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, I was having lunch with a moderately interesting
banker. And I'd gotten up at 5 a.m. to catch the Eurostar from
Paris _ in second-class, of course, no exchanges. And my daughter
had a bit of a cold the night before, and I was wondering if she
had made it to school.
</P>
<P>
   I was here for the clincher in a series of deals I had been
working on. All of which I had signed. I was pretty pleased with
myself. Pleased with my reflection in the eyes of these staid
businessmen who so obviously appreciated the energy and youthful
dynamism coming through their door with my new-economy label and my
trendy, Internet shoes. (Of course, it's not hard to look
fashionable in a British bank.)
</P>
<P>
   But after a year of frenetic travel, 150 e-mails per day, not a
single penny in the bank and a still-distant prospect of any form
of relief, I had to ask myself: Why am I doing this?
</P>
<P>
   Is it really going to work? All this stock is valuable only on
paper. Even that depends on the day. Am I not a little old to spend
precious mid-career years on something that may not pan out?
</P>
<P>
   My daughter turned 3 when I signed on to be co-director of an
Internet start-up. She will shortly be 4. I have not seen much of
her fourth year. How do I calculate what I have earned? How do I
measure what I have lost?
</P>
<P>
   I have begun to admit and accept my split personality. I am too
much of a mom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I am ambitious and like to wield influence. Yes, my kids
drive me crazy if I spend more than a day with them both. Yes, I
would like to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   No, I cannot stand missing the moments when my 3-year-old
snuggles into the body she came from. Or laughing uproariously at
my son's apprenticeship with irony.
</P>
<P>
   I will not drop out completely, of course. But I will have to
accept my new self-imposed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Not Director of an Internet Start-Up, plus Chair of that
Professional Women's Network, plus that one-day-a-week commitment
to career counseling at my old business school. Plus mom of two and
wife of one (who definitely gets the short end of the stick). Plus,
plus, plus.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to grow up and learn to say that
incomprehensibly rare word: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not, like many friends, want a huge house that takes as
much time as a job in renovations, decoration and lawn supervision.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want to earn sudden millions. (Did anyone in
business school ever calculate the opportunity cost of cash?)
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want to talk about my company at every single
dinner party we go to.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want never to have dinner parties anymore because I
do not have the time or the energy.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want weekends to become a hermit existence
(interspersed with bouts of e-mail) in an effort to prepare for the
next week's high-paced onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   I want time. Time to get down on the floor and make puzzles with
my 3-year-old without thinking simultaneously of the 43 things I
should have added to my Palm Pilot's ``To Do'' List.
</P>
<P>
   Time to listen to my son's quasi-endless chatter and see in its
evolution his growing sense of himself and of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I want time to talk to my friends on the phone, to organize long
and leisurely dinners animated by conversation nourished by the
plays and films and friends we have recently seen.
</P>
<P>
   I bumped into a neighbor of mine at the market recently (the
first time I have been there this year). She asked about my
venture, as one of my most admiring fans. I told her I was slowing
down. She was consternated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to see more of my kids,'' I said. And her face broke
into a delighted smile. ``You are so smart _ and so wise,'' she
said. ``I have a photo of my son when he was 3. At that time, I was
running around like crazy, not paying attention. Then the time flew
by so fast. He's grown and gone now. Whenever I look at that photo,
I cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to school in the morning with a small hand clasped
contentedly in mine, I have to admit it is not the boardroom. It is
much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   You need time to fully grasp what you are missing. So I will
walk the talk, making decisions that resonate with my soul. And
tell my ego that life is long _ childhood short.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent years writing and reading about shareholder value.
The new-economy guys have stock options downloading into their
dreams. But last week, I picked up my 7-year-old son after school
for the first time in a year. Delight chased incredulity off his
face. And that's when I knew that my stock had finally gone up. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

TEXAS HEALTH CHIEF'S GAFFE ISN'T HIS FIRST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas' health chief apologized profusely last
week for his comments on Hispanic attitudes toward teen pregnancy,
but he has made similar statements about out-of-wedlock births of
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Health Commissioner Dr. William Reynolds ``Reyn'' Archer
III, who has enjoyed the backing of Republican presidential
candidate Gov. George W. Bush, asked two years ago why, in an era
of civil rights and desegregation, social conditions for blacks
seemed to have worsened.
</P>
<P>
   He cited statistics that 70 percent of black babies were born
out of wedlock, while in 1965 only 15 percent were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to figure out why it is when blacks were more
segregated and had less opportunity that they did better on
cultural measures than they do in that sense today,'' Archer said
at a conference for Texas schoolteachers and other educators on
March 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the meeting, Archer tried to explain his
comment to reporters. Although trained as an
obstetrician-gynecologist, he said, he thinks like an
anthropologist, and has noticed that people in a culture tend to do
what's in the group's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking of value systems within the black community, he said
that he had noticed that blacks are loyal to one another and that
he's observed cultures where loyalty is more important than
honesty.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He said that could explain why a mostly black jury thought O.J.
Simpson was innocent while most white people did not, or why blacks
might be loyal to Jesse Jackson even if they didn't agree with him.
He also said that ``Anglos'' were uninvited guests, perhaps, in
their attempts to help the black community. And he expressed the
view that blacks ``don't buy'' such cultural and legal institutions
as marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who concedes he often speaks in academic terms, said he
sometimes makes ``awkward comments'' in his efforts to build
connections among cultures. He said he believes in diversity and he
sincerely tries to reach out and understand others.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we try to build bridges to different communities, people
have to look deeper than words, and they have to look at the
intentions of the person. If individual words are not understood
contextually, we all lose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he still asks the question about conditions among blacks
in a post-segregation society, but he said he was mistaken to call
these ``cultural'' conditions. He said he ``absolutely'' did not
mean to imply that blacks are not honest.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he has no idea what he was thinking when he
made his comment about whether blacks ``buy'' marriage and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say those are just completely awkward statements,''
Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   The health chief, who is the son of retiring House Ways and
Means Chairman Bill Archer of Texas, was in the national spotlight
in recent weeks. In an interview with The New York Times about
Bush's health care policies, he said Texas has a high rate of teen
pregnancy because Hispanics do not believe that ``getting pregnant
is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to go to a Hispanic community and say, `Well, we
need to get you into family planning,' they say, `No, I want to be
pregnant,''' he told the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Following an immediate written apology about the Hispanic
comments last week, Archer issued a public one and several private
ones to black and Hispanic Texas lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made statements that created the wrong impression about the
Hispanic community,'' Archer told members of a legislative
committee Wednesday, ``and want to just deeply apologize to those
I've offended.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-Texas, and Hispanic activists in Austin
have called for Bush to ask Archer to resign, but Bush has said
that an apology is sufficient. Also, the state's two Hispanic
legislative caucuses have sent letters of concern to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign headquarters referred questions about Archer's
record to the governor's office, which issued a statement late
Friday saying teen pregnancy is a problem in all segments of
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Archer believes we need to work together to understand the
complex reasons for the rise in out-of-wedlock births in every
community,'' it said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Governor Bush hopes that parents from all backgrounds and all
walks of life will encourage their children to make responsible
decisions and choose the happiest and healthiest decision, which is
to abstain from sex until they are married to their lifelong
spouse.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some black and Hispanic state legislators say they
are willing to forgive Archer for the Hispanic remarks. But many
lawmakers who happen to be Democratic are not ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on Commissioner Archer,'' said Sen.
Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, who met with Archer on Wednesday to
discuss health care problems in Texas, as well as a comment Archer
made about blacks in a speech posted on the health department's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech to health professionals, Archer had wondered why
blacks die younger than Anglos or Hispanics, then answered:
``Culture seems to be more a driver than health care.'' Ellis
called the comments ``strange,'' and Archer apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour before their talk, Ellis had told members of the
Senate Hispanic Caucus that the health commissioner's gaffe about
Hispanics wasn't the first controversial public statement he has
made.
</P>
<P>
   The state senator was referring to articles in the Houston
Chronicle and Washington Post about controversial comments Archer
had made on women, men and family planning issues while working in
President Bush's administratio7f
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opposed to premarital sex and abortion, Archer once said that it
was a bad idea to give women birth control pills. He also had said
that as a doctor counseling pregnant women he tried to make them
``bend to my will'' or sent them on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Family planning professionals mounted an unsuccessful campaign
to derail his appointment as Texas health commissioner in 1997, a
time when Texas led the country in teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush was aware of Archer's previous comments but approved
his appointment anyway, calling him a ``compassionate man'' who
would do ``a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   One health board member said Archer's assurances had convinced
her that he ``had changed a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Another board member said he didn't think Archer was qualified
to oversee a $6.4 billion budget, 6,000 employees and nearly 100
programs affecting millions of Texans.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Houston Democrat who is vice
chairman of the House Public Health Committee, said he immediately
remembered Archer's 1998 comments about blacks when the Hispanic
comments were published.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, along with Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas chapter
of the NAACP, were asked by the Houston Chronicle in 1998 if they
had any comment on Archer's statement to the teachers' group about
blacks and his follow-up comments to the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither expressed outrage at the time. Coleman, noting that
Archer was new at his job, said he was willing to give him the
benefit of the doubt. Bledsoe said the comments ``smack of cultural
supremacy'' and seemed insensitive, but he, too, wanted to give
Archer the benefit of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle did not publish a story at the time because
editors found his remarks confusing, and the two black officials,
Coleman and Bledsoe, had not reacted strongly. Coleman said he
thought Archer's intentions were good.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Archer's comments appeared contradictory. He had also
told the teachers: ``This is about winning the hearts and minds of
all communities. It is not about forcing people to be good. I
believe that fundamentally, whether you're Hispanic, Asian, white
or black, you want the same things for your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he now finds Archer's comments more disturbing in
light of his recent remarks about Hispanics and his health policy
philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Archer describes his philosophy as a holistic approach to
medicine and public health. He said he thinks immediate health
needs should be met, along with a search for causes _ even if they
are culturally rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the budget is only so large and many immediate needs
are not met. In fact, legislators worried last year that Archer had
a plan to close some school health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, Ellis and others object to the priority they think
Archer places on the preventive side of public health, especially
when it encompasses cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Archer wants to discover whether conflicting
dynamics of love and alienation might be ``root causes'' of risky
behaviors _ smoking, excessive drinking and irresponsible sex _
that can imperil health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question arises once you've given someone the benefit of
the doubt, if they repeat those errors over and over again,
immediately you have to wonder if that's a point of view,'' Coleman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a pure policy and philosophical standpoint, this is
something that cannot be accepted by anybody. According to Reyn
Archer, it's not even accepted by him. It speaks for itself,''
Coleman said of the most recent comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's been disingenuous about wanting to
understand other cultures,'' Coleman said. ``I think where he has
made an error is in thinking that he understands those cultures
better than people who are in them. It's another form of
patronizing. I really do believe Reyn is out of step with the
people that he serves and that he's somewhat out of step with other
policy makers in state government.''
</P>
<P>
   At the governor's mansion, meanwhile, Austin-area marchers
hoisting signs with such slogans as ``Adios Archer'' said they
can't forgive racially charged rhetoric from officials Bush
appoints.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters also said that Archer seems blind to the state's
poor health care record, with its high rates of uninsured working
poor and children and high rates of tuberculosis and HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't continue to use these stereotypes as an excuse
for this state's awful health care record,'' said protest organizer
Gina Hinojosa, an attorney. ``We're not going to tolerate being
scapegoats.''

single penny in the bank and a still-distant prospect of any form
of relief, I had to ask myself: Why am I doing this?
</P>
<P>
   Is it really going to work? All this stock is valuable only on
paper. Even that depends on the day. Am I not a little old to spend
precious mid-career years on something that may not pan out?
</P>
<P>
   My daughter turned 3 when I signed on to be co-director of an
Internet start-up. She will shortly be 4. I have not seen much of
her fourth year. How do I calculate what I have earned? How do I
measure what I have lost?
</P>
<P>
   I have begun to admit and accept my split personality. I am too
much of a mom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I am ambitious and like to wield influence. Yes, my kids
drive me crazy if I spend more than a day with them both. Yes, I
would like to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   No, I cannot stand missing the moments when my 3-year-old
snuggles into the body she came from. Or laughing uproariously at
my son's apprenticeship with irony.
</P>
<P>
   I will not drop out completely, of course. But I will have to
accept my new self-imposed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Not Director of an Internet Start-Up, plus Chair of that
Professional Women's Network, plus that one-day-a-week commitment
to career counseling at my old business school. Plus mom of two and
wife of one (who definitely gets the short end of the stick). Plus,
plus, plus.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to grow up and learn to say that
incomprehensibly rare word: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not, like many friends, want a huge house that takes as
much time as a job in renovations, decoration and lawn supervision.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want to earn sudden millions. (Did anyone in
business school ever calculate the opportunity cost of cash?)
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want to talk about my company at every single
dinner party we go to.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want never to have dinner parties anymore because I
do not have the time or the energy.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not want weekends to become a hermit existence
(interspersed with bouts of e-mail) in an effort to prepare for the
next week's high-paced onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   I want time. Time to get down on the floor and make puzzles with
my 3-year-old without thinking simultaneously of the 43 things I
should have added to my Palm Pilot's ``To Do'' List.
</P>
<P>
   Time to listen to my son's quasi-endless chatter and see in its
evolution his growing sense of himself and of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I want time to talk to my friends on the phone, to organize long
and leisurely dinners animated by conversation nourished by the
plays and films and friends we have recently seen.
</P>
<P>
   I bumped into a neighbor of mine at the market recently (the
first time I have been there this year). She asked about my
venture, as one of my most admiring fans. I told her I was slowing
down. She was consternated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to see more of my kids,'' I said. And her face broke
into a delighted smile. ``You are so smart _ and so wise,'' she
said. ``I have a photo of my son when he was 3. At that time, I was
running around like crazy, not paying attention. Then the time flew
by so fast. He's grown and gone now. Whenever I look at that photo,
I cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to school in the morning with a small hand clasped
contentedly in mine, I have to admit it is not the boardroom. It is
much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   You need time to fully grasp what you are missing. So I will
walk the talk, making decisions that resonate with my soul. And
tell my ego that life is long _ childhood short.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent years writing and reading about shareholder value.
The new-economy guys have stock options downloading into their
dreams. But last week, I picked up my 7-year-old son after school
for the first time in a year. Delight chased incredulity off his
face. And that's when I knew that my stock had finally gone up. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   LONDON _ I was overlooking The City. The executive dining room
was on the top floor of one of the world's foremost investment
banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the co-head of a small Internet start-up, I had a certain
sense of accomplishment. A feeling that the playing field had been
leveled. That the small could triumph and reach the heights. And
that the view was pretty nice from up here.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, I was having lunch with a moderately interesting
banker. And I'd gotten up at 5 a.m. to catch the Eurostar from
Paris _ in second-class, of course, no exchanges. And my daughter
had a bit of a cold the night before, and I was wondering if she
had made it to school.
</P>
<P>
   I was here for the clincher in a series of deals I had been
working on. All of which I had signed. I was pretty pleased with
myself. Pleased with my reflection in the eyes of these staid
businessmen who so obviously appreciated the energy and youthful
dynamism coming through their door with my new-economy label and my
trendy, Internet shoes. (Of course, it's not hard to look
fashionable in a British bank.)
</P>
<P>
   But after a year of frenetic travel, 150 e-mails per day, not a

   (UNDATED) _ In this age of a sole and overweening superpower, a
younger generation will find it impossible to believe. But just 25
years ago the USA was on its knees, its presidency disgraced, its
allies falling prey to Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate crowds clawing to attach themselves to the final
helicopter out of Dha Trang, the last Marines humiliatingly plucked
from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as a mob prepared to
sack the building _ the images are true, but today seem like a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago, however, Vietnam was a reality that
none of us, even non-Americans, could escape.
</P>
<P>
   Few who were young at the time will forget the violence in front
of the U.S. Embassy in London's Grosvenor Square in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Today's anti-capitalist demonstrations against the World Trade
Organization and global capitalism's iniquities pale beside the
fury and the frustration catalyzed by Vietnam, a crusade against
the U.S. and all the evils of racism and imperialism, consumerism
and war in general.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Vietnam protests, fuelled to some extent by the fact
that this was the first war that everybody could watch unfold on
the television screens in their living rooms. spanned the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sight of protesters outside the White House in their
tens of thousands that helped to persuade the then-President
Richard Nixon that he had to find a solution that would extricate
the U.S. from the war with as much honor as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Students across Europe took up the anti-war, anti-imperialist
cause. There has been nothing to compare with this worldwide surge
of protest, which at the very least was a factor in changing the
policy of a world superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Communist demonstrations that swept through Eastern
Europe in 1989 came from the other side of the political spectrum. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   All of us who lived through the war have our own memories.
Vietnam brushed me twice, first personally, and then as a tiny
fragment of history.
</P>
<P>
   The first occasion was in 1970, when Alec Hottell, a West Point
graduate and Rhodes-scholar friend and contemporary at Oxford, was
killed on service there in a helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   The second was an early February day, decades later, in
Washington, when news broke about the maneuverings of a far more
famous Rhodes scholar to avoid the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal published its story in the midst of the
extraordinary campaign for the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when
candidate Bill Clinton was already struggling to cope with the
revelation of his affair with the nightclub singer Gennifer
Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   That same evening I had been invited to dinner by yet another
former Rhodes scholar, Strobe Talbott, who became a close friend of
Clinton's when they shared digs in north Oxford in the late 1960s,
and today is his deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   On the late news we watched the Governor of Arkansas trying to
explain his behavior: not least why, at the age of 22, he was
already agonizing about how to preserve his ``future political
viability'' if he failed to serve in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe was depressed, sure that this second blow would finish
Clinton's candidacy. Almost 17 years after its end, the war, it
seemed, was still a bitter enough memory to deprive American
politics of someone he believed could become a truly great
president.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott wasn't alone. Every talk-show pundit in the land
declared Clinton finished. Americans might be more relaxed about
extramarital adventures by their politicians, it was held, but they
still regarded attempts to wriggle out of military service as
deeply unpatriotic. Clinton, to borrow their charming phrase, was
``dead meat.''
</P>
<P>
   We were all wrong. One reason was Clinton's superhuman
resilience as a candidate. But there was another, more profound
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Vietnam no longer mattered. It had been a war of its
time, born, like most conflicts, from a mixture of pragmatism and
idealism, but very much a product of the global struggle with the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   It was fought in the ostensibly impeccable cause of halting
Communism, of stopping dominoes in Southeast Asia from falling, and
preserving ``freedom.'' &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was an unmitigated disaster, the only war the U.S. has
ever lost. It took the lives of 58,000 Americans and an estimated
2.5 million Vietnamese. It cost untold treasure, destroyed a
president, and fired the protest of a generation at home and around
the world as no event since.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? Vietnam fell, but the dominoes didn't. Today,
Communism survives in a few pockets such as Cuba, North Korea and
Vietnam itself, but the American way has triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's survival and ultimate victory in 1992 was a first
sign that the U.S. was getting Vietnam out of its system. In a
sense, the 2000 campaign has rounded off the process.
</P>
<P>
   With his candidacy, John McCain, a U.S. Navy pilot in the war
and a prisoner in Vietnam for five-and-a-half years, sealed the
rehabilitation of the war's last outcasts, the soldiers who had
returned, only to be shunned and forgotten by an ungrateful
country.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was in the end soundly beaten for the Republican
nomination by George Bush, Jr., whose record in Vietnam consisted
of sitting it out in the Texas National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crucial primary in South Carolina was instructive.
The state was brimming with Republican-voting war veterans, yet
McCain's compelling record as a military hero was no match for the
hostility of the religious right, whom he had grievously offended.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S.'s early baby-boomers of my own generation, who
variously accepted, manipulated or dodged the draft, many are now
only a few years short of retirement, ensconced in a prosperity
generated by the longest boom since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is history _ history in some respects more remote than
the Korean War that predated it. Handling North Korea is still a
daily torment for U.S. policymakers. But there is no ball and chain
attached to the U.S.'s collective political psyche marked ``the
Legacy of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   If such a shackle exists, it is in the Pentagon. The new
doctrine, exemplified by the war against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, has three parts: the use of overwhelming force, no body
bags and no ``mission creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Never again will the U.S. allow itself to be sucked into an
open-ended and unwinnable foreign war, in which American boys die
even when the country's national security is not directly at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The real world naturally does not respect such paradigms. You
can send cruise missiles smashing into targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan _ but ``mission creep'' is precisely what confronts the
thousands of U.S. troops stationed in Bosnia and Kosovo, and likely
to remain there for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the body-bag count stays at zero, the
post-Vietnam theory holds.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam remains a one-party Communist state, one of the 25
poorest countries in the world. An economic deal offered by the
U.S. is on ice. But Clinton presses on.
</P>
<P>
   He lifted the U.S. trade embargo in 1994 and established
diplomatic relations in 1995. Later this year he may become the
first U.S. president to set foot on Vietnamese soil since 1969,
when Richard Nixon dropped by to give the troops a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Legacy of Vietnam'' may yet end up as part of the legacy
of Bill Clinton. &QL;

AIRBUS AIMS FOR 60 PERCENT OF JET MARKET; BOEING SCOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Airbus Industrie no longer wants to be Boeing's equal.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off its first-ever pasting of Boeing in new jetliner
orders last year, the European manufacturer is aiming higher _ much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   A top executive said Airbus is gunning for 60 percent share of
the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing will probably stabilize at around 40 percent,'' John
Leahy, Airbus senior vice president for commercial operations, told
the industry magazine Flight International.
</P>
<P>
   He said Airbus would draw the line at 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you will see Airbus having 80 percent,'' Leahy
was quoted as saying. ``We don't think we need to be producing that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   His words did not go down well at Boeing, which in recent months
has taken steps to turn the rising Airbus tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his dreams,'' Boeing commercial spokesman Randy Harrison
fired back when asked about Leahy's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts agree. They believe Airbus will find it
difficult to sustain even 50 percent market share without the A3XX
super jumbo. Airbus must have the 550-seater to break the 30-year
monopoly Boeing has enjoyed with the 747, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Airbus be able to get to 60 percent and stay there? I
doubt it. They have a long ways to go,'' said Bill Fiala of Edward
Jones. ``But it is possible as long as they are willing to be
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, a consortium of four aerospace companies from France,
Germany Spain and Great Britain, has said it expects to get
supervisory board approval to begin offering the A3XX for sale in
June, which could lead to a possible launch by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Emirates Airlines is expected Monday, at an event scheduled in
Cairo, Egypt, to be the first carrier to public announce it will
buy the A3XX if Airbus builds it.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the A3XX, an Airbus spokeswoman said the consortium
is not just blowing smoke in saying it can win 60 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus has long held the goal of a sustainable 50 percent
market share,'' Mary Anne Greczyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have seen more and more customers turn to us for the
first time, and repeat orders. So it is certainly not unreasonable
to set our sights higher. Airbus would not have gotten anywhere in
the last 30 years without aiming high.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still very early, with several important campaigns still to
be won or lost, but so far this year Boeing is leading Airbus in
the order battle.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has 126 firm orders to 59 for Airbus, according to the
latest figures posted on their respective Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The gap could soon tighten. Airbus is reported to be close to
completing a deal with International Lease Finance Corp. for about
50 widebody and narrowbody jets.
</P>
<P>
   When Boeing reported first quarter earnings last week, Chairman
Phil Condit told analysts he was pleased with the rebound in
Boeing's orders this year. He said the solid order book after three
months reflected the economic recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Asian airlines are key customers for Boeing widebody jets such
as the 747 and 777, and the economic downturn in that part of the
world contributed to Boeing's somewhat lackluster order totals _
measured against what Airbus did _ in 1999, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Asia doesn't do much, advantage Airbus,'' said Joe
Campbell, chief aerospace analyst for Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that hurt Boeing last year was that it was coming
off two of its worst years ever in 1997 and 1998, when its jetliner
production system was in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing screwed up its deliveries, it screwed up its
earnings,'' said Paul Nisbet of JAS Research. ``Those things do not
help sales. Boeing is turning things around. The dip they got in
sales (in 1999) will be a temporary one. Airbus people are having
wonderful dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Airbus barely beat Boeing in 1994 orders,
though they essentially tied when cancellations are factored in. It
was such a poor sales year for both, however, that industry
analysts dismiss the results.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus had 476 firm orders to 332 for Boeing. The Airbus number
represented about 59 percent of the commercial market for jetliners
with more than 100 seats.
</P>
<P>
   (Boeing's Web site lists 391 orders in 1999, but some of those
were placed the two previous years. They were from customers who
did not want to be identified. To be consistent with Airbus, Boeing
decided late last year to list orders from unnamed customers, but
it put all those orders in its 1999 totals.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus has every reason to be proud. It was a heck of an
achievement,'' said Richard Aboulafia, senior aerospace and defense
analyst with the Teal Group.
</P>
<P>
   Can Airbus hang on to the crown of market leader that it won
last year?
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the answer is no, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus does not have the product family to command 60 percent
of the market,'' said Peter Jacobs, aerospace analyst with the
Ragen MacKenzie group in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only area where Airbus is truly competitive with Boeing is
in the narrow-body segment of the market,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   There, the Airbus A320 has more than held its own against
Boeing's next generation 737, and was responsible in large part of
the Airbus victory in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing still commands the upper end of the market with its
widebody offerings, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus will be more competitive if it goes ahead with
development of the super jumbo,'' Jacobs said. ``But Airbus would
still be at a disadvantage in the 300- to 400-passenger market.
Boeing's 777 has proven to be more successful than the Airbus A330
or A340.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report on the world jet transport market, Aboulafia
noted that even though Airbus scored a tiny victory over Boeing in
the 1994 order battle, it was ``annihilated'' in 1993 and in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... There are good reasons to believe that 1999 was not a sea
change in the Boeing-Airbus battle,'' he wrote. ``Deliveries, the
widebody battle and the overall product line balance all remain
positives for Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia, in his report, forecast that Boeing, not Airbus, will
continue to get about 60 percent of the market, in terms of value,
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change if the Airbus A3XX is launched and is
successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing has every reason to fear that Airbus will do even
better in the future,'' Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives don't like to talk about the order war with
Airbus, saying the more important measure to judge success is by
looking at deliveries _ when most of the money changes hands from
the customer to the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing delivered a record 620 planes to 297 for
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Boeing plans to deliver 490 jets. Airbus has said it
will deliver 307 jets this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus' output is heading up. Production of the A320 at
Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, is set to increase from
seven planes a month to 15. A second production site in Hamburg,
Germany, also is increasing production of the other members of the
A320 family.
</P>
<P>
   And Airbus is ramping up production of its widebody planes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 307 delivery figure for this year could go
higher, said Greczyn, the Airbus spokeswoman. The increased
production rates could see Airbus delivering as many as 450 planes
within a couple years.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boeing executives may talk publicly about how
deliveries are more important than orders, the Airbus victory last
year got the company's attention at the highest levels. Boeing
reorganized its commercial operations earlier this year to improve
customer relations. Boeing Commercial President Alan Mulally says
this will be the ``year of the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The move came after several important Boeing customers defected
to Airbus. Some airlines executives have said privately that Airbus
has done the better sales and marketing job over the last couple
years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is clearly set on making sure last's year resounding
Airbus order victory does not become a trend, said analyst Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   While Jacobs does not believe Airbus can attain the 60 percent
market share envisioned by Leahy anytime soon, Airbus does have the
potential to eventually de-throne Boeing as the dominate airplane
manufacturer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 10 to 20 years could belong to either,'' he said.
``There is plenty of time for a substantial shift in the market
place.''

   (UNDATED) _ In this age of a sole and overweening superpower, a
younger generation will find it impossible to believe. But just 25
years ago the USA was on its knees, its presidency disgraced, its
allies falling prey to Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate crowds clawing to attach themselves to the final
helicopter out of Dha Trang, the last Marines humiliatingly plucked
from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as a mob prepared to
sack the building _ the images are true, but today seem like a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago, however, Vietnam was a reality that
none of us, even non-Americans, could escape.
</P>
<P>
   Few who were young at the time will forget the violence in front
of the U.S. Embassy in London's Grosvenor Square in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Today's anti-capitalist demonstrations against the World Trade
Organization and global capitalism's iniquities pale beside the
fury and the frustration catalyzed by Vietnam, a crusade against
the U.S. and all the evils of racism and imperialism, consumerism
and war in general.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Vietnam protests, fuelled to some extent by the fact
that this was the first war that everybody could watch unfold on
the television screens in their living rooms. spanned the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sight of protesters outside the White House in their
tens of thousands that helped to persuade the then-President
Richard Nixon that he had to find a solution that would extricate
the U.S. from the war with as much honor as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Students across Europe took up the anti-war, anti-imperialist
cause. There has been nothing to compare with this worldwide surge
of protest, which at the very least was a factor in changing the
policy of a world superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Communist demonstrations that swept through Eastern
Europe in 1989 came from the other side of the political spectrum. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   All of us who lived through the war have our own memories.
Vietnam brushed me twice, first personally, and then as a tiny
fragment of history.
</P>
<P>
   The first occasion was in 1970, when Alec Hottell, a West Point
graduate and Rhodes-scholar friend and contemporary at Oxford, was
killed on service there in a helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   The second was an early February day, decades later, in
Washington, when news broke about the maneuverings of a far more
famous Rhodes scholar to avoid the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal published its story in the midst of the
extraordinary campaign for the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when
candidate Bill Clinton was already struggling to cope with the
revelation of his affair with the nightclub singer Gennifer
Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   That same evening I had been invited to dinner by yet another
former Rhodes scholar, Strobe Talbott, who became a close friend of
Clinton's when they shared digs in north Oxford in the late 1960s,
and today is his deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   On the late news we watched the Governor of Arkansas trying to
explain his behavior: not least why, at the age of 22, he was
already agonizing about how to preserve his ``future political
viability'' if he failed to serve in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe was depressed, sure that this second blow would finish
Clinton's candidacy. Almost 17 years after its end, the war, it
seemed, was still a bitter enough memory to deprive American
politics of someone he believed could become a truly great
president.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott wasn't alone. Every talk-show pundit in the land
declared Clinton finished. Americans might be more relaxed about
extramarital adventures by their politicians, it was held, but they
still regarded attempts to wriggle out of military service as
deeply unpatriotic. Clinton, to borrow their charming phrase, was
``dead meat.''
</P>
<P>
   We were all wrong. One reason was Clinton's superhuman
resilience as a candidate. But there was another, more profound
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Vietnam no longer mattered. It had been a war of its
time, born, like most conflicts, from a mixture of pragmatism and
idealism, but very much a product of the global struggle with the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   It was fought in the ostensibly impeccable cause of halting
Communism, of stopping dominoes in Southeast Asia from falling, and
preserving ``freedom.'' &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was an unmitigated disaster, the only war the U.S. has
ever lost. It took the lives of 58,000 Americans and an estimated
2.5 million Vietnamese. It cost untold treasure, destroyed a
president, and fired the protest of a generation at home and around
the world as no event since.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? Vietnam fell, but the dominoes didn't. Today,
Communism survives in a few pockets such as Cuba, North Korea and
Vietnam itself, but the American way has triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's survival and ultimate victory in 1992 was a first
sign that the U.S. was getting Vietnam out of its system. In a
sense, the 2000 campaign has rounded off the process.
</P>
<P>
   With his candidacy, John McCain, a U.S. Navy pilot in the war
and a prisoner in Vietnam for five-and-a-half years, sealed the
rehabilitation of the war's last outcasts, the soldiers who had
returned, only to be shunned and forgotten by an ungrateful
country.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was in the end soundly beaten for the Republican
nomination by George Bush, Jr., whose record in Vietnam consisted
of sitting it out in the Texas National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crucial primary in South Carolina was instructive.
The state was brimming with Republican-voting war veterans, yet
McCain's compelling record as a military hero was no match for the
hostility of the religious right, whom he had grievously offended.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S.'s early baby-boomers of my own generation, who
variously accepted, manipulated or dodged the draft, many are now
only a few years short of retirement, ensconced in a prosperity
generated by the longest boom since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is history _ history in some respects more remote than
the Korean War that predated it. Handling North Korea is still a
daily torment for U.S. policymakers. But there is no ball and chain
attached to the U.S.'s collective political psyche marked ``the
Legacy of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   If such a shackle exists, it is in the Pentagon. The new
doctrine, exemplified by the war against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, has three parts: the use of overwhelming force, no body
bags and no ``mission creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Never again will the U.S. allow itself to be sucked into an
open-ended and unwinnable foreign war, in which American boys die
even when the country's national security is not directly at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The real world naturally does not respect such paradigms. You
can send cruise missiles smashing into targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan _ but ``mission creep'' is precisely what confronts the
thousands of U.S. troops stationed in Bosnia and Kosovo, and likely
to remain there for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the body-bag count stays at zero, the
post-Vietnam theory holds.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam remains a one-party Communist state, one of the 25
poorest countries in the world. An economic deal offered by the
U.S. is on ice. But Clinton presses on.
</P>
<P>
   He lifted the U.S. trade embargo in 1994 and established
diplomatic relations in 1995. Later this year he may become the
first U.S. president to set foot on Vietnamese soil since 1969,
when Richard Nixon dropped by to give the troops a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Legacy of Vietnam'' may yet end up as part of the legacy
of Bill Clinton. &QL;

<P>
   It was the picture that went around the world, which will be
remembered long after most people have forgotten what the dispute
over Elian Gonzalez was about.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it was about the elemental question of how to
enforce the rule of law in matters as sensitive and untidy as the
custody of a six-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we would not have done it like that, most Britons
would say. The aim of reuniting Elian with his father was clearly
right, but to have used a squad of masked men (and a
Spanish-speaking woman with a blanket) to achieve it, brandishing
machine-guns within inches of the terrified child's face, that
would not happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Before we are too smug, however, we should pause. How should it
have been done?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an unarmed constable should have dismounted his bicycle,
knocked on the door and asked for the boy, sternly but politely.
Not that he could have reached the door through the hundreds of
anti-Castro Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was the prominence of the guns which was most offensive
to European sensibilities: the use of surprise, speed and minimal
force would have been needed in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the guns up front were unnecessary. But this was
America. Who was to say that not one of Elian's self-appointed
custodians would be armed, and would not, in the emotional and
ideological heat of the moment, start shooting?
</P>
<P>
   Not George W. Bush, anyway, first out of the hypocritical blocks
to criticize the action as ``defying the values of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate for the presidency opposes gun control
and is not well placed to argue that law enforcement agencies
should use only truncheons and whistles on delicate missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader scheme, the mission was successful. The U.S.
courts can now assess the claim made on Elian's behalf for refugee
status without the distraction of his being held illegally by his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The claim must stand little chance of success, however, even if
the courts allow Elian to apply for asylum against his father's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers would have to show that the boy had a well-founded fear
of persecution if he returned to Cuba, whereas the truth is that he
can only have a well-founded fear of canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro has already proclaimed the action of the U.S.
authorities to be a victory for the Cuban nation.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the longer-term significance of Saturday's snatch.
It is clear that Presidents Clinton and Castro are working
together, against the Cuban-exile political bloc in Florida, which
exerts such a disproportionate and malign influence on U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the impasse was only made possible by the
arrival in Washington earlier this month of Elian's father, by
arrangement with the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   This changed the story from one of the boy orphaned in a heroic
escape from wicked communist tyrant to another narrative equally
familiar to an American audience, that of the father-son bond.
</P>
<P>
   It also holds out the hope that the ending of this story could
be one of reconciliation on a larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, freed from the need to grub for votes among the
virulent leaders of Miami's anti-Castro Cubans, could use the Elian
affair to normalize relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And if Elian's too-eventful life could contribute to the ending
of America's counterproductive isolation of Cuba, the shock he
endured at five o'clock last Saturday morning may have heralded a
larger accomplishment. &QL;

   PORTLAND, Ore. _ On the first Earth Day in 1970, the cherry
blossoms in the nation's capital were blooming. But just 30 years
later, global warming has pushed the flowering season a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In another 30 or 40 years, according to climate models, cherry
trees in Washington, along with the rest of the Eastern forests,
could well be dying.
</P>
<P>
   Neither this simple warning sign, nor the deadly heat wave that
hit the East Coast last summer, nor the joint call for action from
the heads of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
and Britain's Meteorological Office, have moved the U.S. Senate any
closer to ratifying the Kyoto global warming treaty. The senators,
apparently, are still misled by dire warnings about damage to our
economy.
</P>
<P>
   From past battles over clean air, snail darters and spotted
owls, to the looming crisis created by greenhouse gas emissions,
``jobs versus the environment'' has been the pivotal political
issue challenging our national clean-up effort. And after a 25-year
media barrage, many Americans, including senators, share three
related _ and false _ perceptions about jobs and the environment.
They mistakenly believe that environmental protection creates
economy-wide slowdowns, boosting unemployment; that it has led to
large numbers of plant shutdowns and layoffs in the manufacturing
sector; and that it has forced many U.S. companies to flee to
developing countries with lax environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all economists who have studied the issue agree that
these three propositions are false. At the economy-wide level, in
reality, there has simply been no trade-off between jobs and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1999, for example, U.S. corporations, consumers,
and governments boosted their spending on environmental protection
from around $138 to $219 billion, or from 2.1 to 2.8 percent of the
GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period of time that environmental spending grew so
dramatically, the U.S. economy added a whopping 16 million new
jobs. Even at the local level, regulation-induced plant closings
and layoffs are very rare.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study has found that layoffs in the manufacturing
sector resulting from environmental regulation have averaged one to
three thousand jobs per year nationwide since the late 1970s. To
put these numbers in perspective, around two million people are
laid off in the U.S. every year for non-environmental reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, despite what one hears in the news media, few companies
are fleeing industrial countries like the United States to take
advantage of lax environmental regulations in poor countries. Why?
For most industries, environmental costs are on order of only 1 to
2 percent of total business costs. Moreover, much pollution control
technology is now embedded in modern plant designs; that is,
pollution control increasingly reflects fundamental process changes
rather than end-of-the-pipe filters. This means that an oil
refinery or chemical plant built by a multinational corporation in
Seattle will in fact look reasonably similar to one built in South
China.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new or controversial about this information,
which clearly needs to be more widely understood. As the stalemate
in the Senate starkly illustrates, jobs versus the environment
myths now threaten to scuttle international efforts to tackle
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's heat wave was just the tip of the bad news on the
climate change front over the last 12 months. For example,
Britain's Hadley Center, an important research organization,
predicted major forest diebacks in the mid-latitudes, including the
southern and eastern United States, beginning in a few decades;
Australian researchers concluded that global warming could
eliminate all reefs from most of the world by the year 2100, and
kill the Great Barrier Reef within 30 years. From retreating
glaciers to a worldwide wave of extreme weather measured in
unprecedented insurance claims, the grim evidence for global
warming continues to mount.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is that we can take action to stop our
disruption of the global climate, and at relatively low cost. In
the early 1970s, when the first round of environmental regulation
was introduced, we really did not know what the employment impacts
of environmental protection spending were going to be. At that
time, the jobs-versus-environment debate was legitimate. But since
then, repeated predictions of massive layoffs have simply not been
borne out.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to think that the global warming case will be
dramatically different. Consistent with past experience, greenhouse
gas control will likely lead to nationwide layoffs averaging on the
order of a few thousand per year.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive adjustment assistance for workers who do lose
their jobs is something that we can easily afford. What we can no
longer afford is to be paralyzed by the myth of a jobs-environment
trade-off. Cherry blossoms are not all we have to lose.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the picture that went around the world, which will be
remembered long after most people have forgotten what the dispute
over Elian Gonzalez was about.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it was about the elemental question of how to
enforce the rule of law in matters as sensitive and untidy as the
custody of a six-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we would not have done it like that, most Britons
would say. The aim of reuniting Elian with his father was clearly
right, but to have used a squad of masked men (and a
Spanish-speaking woman with a blanket) to achieve it, brandishing
machine-guns within inches of the terrified child's face, that
would not happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Before we are too smug, however, we should pause. How should it
have been done?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an unarmed constable should have dismounted his bicycle,
knocked on the door and asked for the boy, sternly but politely.
Not that he could have reached the door through the hundreds of
anti-Castro Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was the prominence of the guns which was most offensive
to European sensibilities: the use of surprise, speed and minimal
force would have been needed in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the guns up front were unnecessary. But this was
America. Who was to say that not one of Elian's self-appointed
custodians would be armed, and would not, in the emotional and
ideological heat of the moment, start shooting?
</P>
<P>
   Not George W. Bush, anyway, first out of the hypocritical blocks
to criticize the action as ``defying the values of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate for the presidency opposes gun control
and is not well placed to argue that law enforcement agencies
should use only truncheons and whistles on delicate missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader scheme, the mission was successful. The U.S.
courts can now assess the claim made on Elian's behalf for refugee
status without the distraction of his being held illegally by his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The claim must stand little chance of success, however, even if
the courts allow Elian to apply for asylum against his father's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers would have to show that the boy had a well-founded fear
of persecution if he returned to Cuba, whereas the truth is that he
can only have a well-founded fear of canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro has already proclaimed the action of the U.S.
authorities to be a victory for the Cuban nation.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the longer-term significance of Saturday's snatch.
It is clear that Presidents Clinton and Castro are working
together, against the Cuban-exile political bloc in Florida, which
exerts such a disproportionate and malign influence on U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the impasse was only made possible by the
arrival in Washington earlier this month of Elian's father, by
arrangement with the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   This changed the story from one of the boy orphaned in a heroic
escape from wicked communist tyrant to another narrative equally
familiar to an American audience, that of the father-son bond.
</P>
<P>
   It also holds out the hope that the ending of this story could
be one of reconciliation on a larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, freed from the need to grub for votes among the
virulent leaders of Miami's anti-Castro Cubans, could use the Elian
affair to normalize relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And if Elian's too-eventful life could contribute to the ending
of America's counterproductive isolation of Cuba, the shock he
endured at five o'clock last Saturday morning may have heralded a
larger accomplishment. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The high drama of Saturday's pre-dawn raid on the
Miami house of Lazaro Gonzalez lasted a bare three minutes: just as
long as it took to break down the door, snatch six-year-old Elian
from the arms of his fisherman-rescuer and rush him out to the
waiting cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the political and diplomatic reverberations of what happened
are likely to be felt for decades, and many lives have been
changed, probably forever.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate controversy, and the one that may be
shortest-lived, is the degree of force used to recover the child.
Earlier government pledges not to raid the house by night or use
force of arms were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney-general, Janet Reno, said that no guns were
pointed at the child and no fingers were on triggers _ a close
examination of the pictures shows this to be true _ and that
adequate precautions had to be taken because of reports that there
were guns in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the people involved in the case, Reno had the most
responsibility and the most to lose, professionally and personally.
</P>
<P>
   It was she who conducted negotiations with the Miami relatives
at crucial junctures and it was up to her to decide whether and
when to authorize the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   After the disastrous storming of the Branch Davidian compound at
Waco seven years ago, her reputation as someone able to take
decisions under extreme pressure was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   She insisted throughout that the law and morality demanded the
reunion of Elian with his father. In retrospect, the success of
Saturday's operation and the lengths to which she went to negotiate
a settlement will probably vindicate her judgment.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, however, she has lost a great deal. A
native of Miami, where she was elected state attorney four times,
Reno had hoped for a peaceful retirement in her family house there.
The wrath of the city's 800,000 Cuban emigres may make that
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Cubans poured on to the streets of their Little
Havana quarter of Miami Saturday after news of the raid spread, in
mostly peaceful protests. The Elian saga, however, has polarized
Miami, and could well have dissipated their national influence.
</P>
<P>
   The view of the majority of emigre Cubans, that the child's
right to live in American freedom superseded the parental rights of
his father, was not shared in the rest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And the anger with which they defended their view only added to
the impression of an immigrant group that placed itself above U.S.
law.
</P>
<P>
   Some Miami Cuban leaders fear that Congress, having seen Little
Havana flout U.S. law, could now move to lift the trade embargo on
Cuba despite their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the enforced return of Elian to his father will
improve the climate of U.S.-Cuban relations; but they could sour
again if the legal processes drag on too long.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Elian Gonzalez, and the manner in which he was
removed from his Miami relatives, not only split mainstream opinion
away from that of the Cuban emigres, it divided families and
destroyed friendships.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and Elian's
uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, can ever be reconciled is remote; Juan
Miguel believes Lazaro ``kidnapped'' his child and then poisoned
his mind with a constant stream of new toys and anti-Cuba
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee, George W. Bush, whose
brother Jeb is Florida governor, took the side of the anti-Castro
emigres from the start.
</P>
<P>
   In what may have been a political misjudgment, the Democratic
nominee, Vice President Al Gore, broke with President Bill Clinton
and called at one point for Elian to be given permanent residence
in the U.S. He then restricted himself to calling for the law to
take its course.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a view similar to that of George W. Bush, he prevented
the issue becoming an issue in the presidential race _ except in
his own party. Many Democratic congressmen and most American blacks
believed that Elian belonged with his father and accused Gore of
``pandering'' to Florida's Cuban voters.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for Gore is that his stand may have cost him
votes outside southern Florida and he may not be able to recoup
sufficient votes from the strongly Republican emigre Cubans to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
   In a close presidential race, Florida's electoral college votes
could swing the election. The forcible snatching of the child makes
it even less likely that Gore will win Florida, and could even cost
him the presidency. &QL;

TEXAS A&AMP;M CHIEF'S JOB CALLED SECURE DESPITE BONFIRE TRAGEDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a special commission studying the deadly collapse of the
Texas A&AMP;M Bonfire nears the end of its job, university President
Ray Bowen does not appear in jeopardy of losing his position.
</P>
<P>
   Despite comments by Bowen earlier this year in which he hinted
at a resignation, top officials say they do not expect, nor do they
want, Bowen to go.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate is the issue of responsibility for a
disaster on university grounds involving an activity almost
exclusively overseen by students. Also an issue is a close-knit,
military-style culture that at times may make those associated with
the school blind to problems. The special commission is studying
the A&AMP;M culture as part of a sweeping examination of the collapse
in a $1.67 million report scheduled for release May 2.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the commission's report, an A&AMP;M graduate has
written an account of the Bonfire disaster that blames school
officials for ignoring warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bowen should take responsibility for the Nov. 18
accident that killed 12 and injured 27, said Irwin A. Tang, author
of ``The Texas Aggie Bonfire: Tradition &AMP; Tragedy at Texas A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we can all see that he is responsible, that the
administrators below him are responsible,'' said Tang, who
graduated in 1992. ``In other countries and places in the world,
someone would have resigned on the day of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, two newspapers reported that Bowen would resign if
the commission found that the accident was caused by poor
leadership from his administration.
</P>
<P>
   But an A&AMP;M spokesman, the head of the school's Faculty Senate
and two university regents, including board Chairman Donald E.
Powell, now say Bowen's intentions were misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that Bowen has said he would step down if asked by
the board of regents. But, Powell said, there has been no
discussion of that.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed to the position in 1994, Bowen is pushing the school
into a new era in which it is trying to become one of the nation's
Top 10 state universities by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Now is not the time to force him out, most say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is no,'' said regent Robert H. Allen. ``He
certainly hasn't said that, we certainly have not said that.
Wherever the quote came from, it was a misquote or
misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang said Bowen's hesitance to assume responsibility may be for
fear of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, no one has stood up and taken responsibility
for the accident,'' the author said. ``That probably has something
to do with protecting the university from lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   No lawsuits have been filed to date, and several parents of
those who died have expressed no such intentions.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the school is sued, it will have what is expected to
be the best research into the Bonfire collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, chaired by Houston businessman Leo Linbeck Jr.,
hired five consulting firms expert in examining the aftermath of
calamities and in finding their causes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many problems being investigated is a sloping terrain
that resulted in the first of four ascending levels of the Bonfire
stack being built at an angle. In addition, the experts are trying
to determine whether a crane that hit the stack days earlier caused
it to eventually fall. Or whether cables should have been used as
they were in the past to keep the lower tiers secure. Or whether
the center pole was brittle.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to examining the design and materials used in
this and other Bonfires, the report is expected to determine
whether school policies were violated and what role that may have
played in the collapse, Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   There will not be a placing of blame but rather a detailed
analysis of the factors that caused the woodpile to collapse,
Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be an exhaustive assessment as to the contributing
and causal factors of the collapse, but nothing short of or beyond
that,'' Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that effort includes looking at the culture of Bonfire,
a tradition since 1909 when Aggies built a huge tower of wood and
burned it shortly before their annual football game with the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tang said there is plenty to investigate that could hold the
university responsible for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions to improve Bonfire safety were either ignored or
overlooked during more than a decade of warnings from school
faculty, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, details that have come out since the disaster show that
these university rules were broken:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bonfire violated the 55-foot height limit and was already
59 feet tall when it collapsed. When complete, it would have been
about 70 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alcohol, which is banned, was found in the blood of two
victims. In addition, police reports indicate that many empty beer
cans were found around the collapsed Bonfire and that officers
smelled alcohol on the breath of some workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only professional operators are allowed to handle a crane that
helps stack the logs. However, a 24-year-old student was operating
a crane when the Bonfire collapsed, though authorities do not
believe that the crane played any role in the collapse. It is
unclear, however, whether a student or professional was operating
the crane that smacked the Bonfire days before.
</P>
<P>
   Tang, however, is more critical of a bigger picture than just
broken rules.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Bonfire collapse is a result of Aggie Spirit, a
defining term of the culture at the school. While Tang's book
repeatedly lauds that esprit de corps, he says that at times it
acts as a stumbling block to recognizing or solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   And with Bonfire, one of the biggest of Aggie traditions, he
said the culture began a ``slow devolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It became more and more a student activity. That's because the
university allowed it to,'' Tang said. ``They didn't wish to
allocate the resources to monitor a tradition that was growing more
and more out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, freshmen were prohibited from the log stack above
the first level, a sign of both honor for older students and
recognition that it was dangerous work requiring special skills.
That rule, however, fell by the wayside. Many freshmen were on the
stack when it fell in November, including one who had only one
night of experience on the project before the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, a tradition once supervised by the commander
of the Corps of Cadets was left largely to students and a school
adviser, Rusty Thompson, who is not an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   With that change came alterations in the way the stack was
built, Tang said. The changes were passed down from Aggie to Aggie
with no blueprint of the massive structure.
</P>
<P>
   A log stack that leaned toward the middle like a teepee in the
1950s and 1960s had evolved into something that looked like a
wedding cake. That decreased stability, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous methods of stabilizing the stack, such as cables and
interlocking logs, were not employed in the 1999 Bonfire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Tang said that Bowen, an engineer, should have
recognized the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how embarrassing or sobering the various Bonfire
crises Bowen saw, he never ordered a thorough evaluation and
overhauling of any part of the Bonfire building process or stack
design,'' Tang wrote in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen has declined to comment until the special commission comes
back with a report.
</P>
<P>
   But in a January story by The Eagle of Bryan-College Station,
Bowen said he would take all responsibility for the Bonfire
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the buck stops here,'' he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   The story went on to say that Bowen said he would resign if it
was determined the accident was a product of poor leadership on his
administration's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do that on a variety of issues,'' Bowen said in the
Jan. 12 article. ``If, for example, there was a serious financial
situation that led back to my indifference, I would take the
responsibility. How can I say to someone, `I want you out of this
job' when I am at the top of that command? I have to set the
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, A&AMP;M's chief spokeswoman, Cindy Lawson, confirmed
that Bowen would resign if asked or if a failure of university
leadership over the Bonfire was found to have been a factor, the
Austin American-Statesman reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the ultimate leader, he feels he would be responsible,''
Lawson told the newspaper. ``And that is not out of character for
him. Honesty and integrity are paramount to him. Taking
responsibility goes with that, and doing what is right is part of
the cost of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   School spokesman Lane Stephenson said The Eagle misquoted Bowen
about any intentions to resign. Stephenson would not comment on the
remarks subsequently made by Lawson. Lawson did not return phone
calls from the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is a big enough issue for resignation to be
considered,'' said Faculty Senate Speaker Thomas Wehrly. ``That
doesn't answer whether or not he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Wehrly said Bowen is responsible for the biggest turnaround in
the school in decades. A committee that Bowen formed in 1997 to
study the school's future produced a far-reaching set of strategies
called Vision 2020. It challenges the school to become one of the
nation's top state universities by that year.
</P>
<P>
   For a school that has worked hard to grow from a regional
university into a major institution of national standing during the
past few decades, Bowen's new challenge is inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bowen seems to have the goal of moving us forward into the
next rank of universities,'' Wehrly said. ``No one is asking that
Dr. Bowen step down over Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, those close to the president say he has been greatly
affected by the tragedy and say he has expressed remorse for not
recognizing the problem before it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   And the future of Bonfire lies directly on his shoulders, where
the buck still stops. Once the commission's report is made, Bowen
is expected to decide whether Bonfire continues as is, is changed
or is halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's felt a deep sense of loss, as we all have,'' said board
Chairman Powell. ``The loss has weighed on his shoulders very
heavily.''

MORE FUEL FOR DEBATE ON PROZAC

   How good are Prozac and its relatives at treating depression?
</P>
<P>
   If the claims made by some researchers over the last few years
are given any credence, the drugs, despite their popularity, are
little better than dummy pills in driving away despair.
</P>
<P>
   The critics insist that as much as 75 percent of the improvement
shown by depressed patients taking antidepressants can be
attributed to the ``placebo effect,'' the healing power of taking a
pill, and the support patients find in clinical trials. They say
clinical trials of antidepressant drugs have been tainted by the
pro-medication bias of the investigators conducting them.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent report in The American Journal of Psychiatry offers
a different view. In it, a group of Columbia University scientists
review the critics' evidence and find it far from convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The studies cited by the critics ``fail upon closer
examination'' to support their assertions, wrote the scientists,
led by Dr. Fredric M. Quitkin, a psychiatrist at Columbia's College
of Physicians and Surgeons. And Dr. Donald F. Klein, a co-author of
the report, called claims that antidepressants were only slightly
better than a placebo ``a clear distortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is hardly academic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that these conclusions may discourage
depressed people from seeking effective treatment,'' Quitkin and
his colleagues wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that teasing out the healing effects offered by a
drug from the benefits bestowed by a dummy pill is a difficult
task, particularly when the drug in question is intended to treat
chronic illnesses like depression, arthritis or hypertension, whose
symptoms worsen at some times and improve at others.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, depression, like most psychiatric
illnesses, cannot be detected with blood tests and produces no
changes in body tissue or other measurable physiological markers.
Studies set up to test the efficacy of treatments for depression
must rely upon more subjective measures: doctors' ratings or
patients' own assessments.
</P>
<P>
   The wiggle room left by such methods offers a perfect
battleground for competing ideologies: those who believe, for
example, that drugs are overused and see psychotherapy as the
treatment of choice for depression, versus those who view
antidepressants as a lifesaving and underused resource.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics argue that even in the best studies,
antidepressants are only minimally effective, and that doctors and
patients often can tell, by the presence or absence of side
effects, who is taking a drug, and who a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 2 out of 10 people benefit,'' from taking
antidepressants, said Dr. Robert Greenberg, a psychologist at the
State University of New York Upstate Medical University at
Syracuse, who has been among the most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   In their review, however, Quitkin and his colleagues, could find
no evidence that bias explained the drug effects shown in clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trial investigators themselves are quick to concede
that the measures used to assess subjects' progress are far from
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotions are not linear, and trying to measure something as
complex as emotions on an arithmetic scale just becomes very
difficult,'' said Dr. Arif Khan, director of the Northwest Clinical
Research Center in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In a papaer appearing this month in Archives of General
Psychiatry, Khan and two colleagues analyzed drug effects in
clinical trial data from 8,731 patients participating in 45 studies
of seven antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who obtained the datas from the Food and Drug
Administration through a request under the Freedom of Information
Act found that 40.7 percent of patients in the trials who received
the drugs showed a reduction in symptoms, compared with 30.9
percent of patients who received placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies have found larger differences. In a 1999 study by
the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, for
example, involving more than 80 antidepressant studies, for
example, 50 percent of patients improved on the drugs, compared
with 32 percent on placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Khan described the effects of drugs in the studies he reviewed
as ``modest,'' but he said he had no doubt the drugs worked,
particularly for severely ill patients, normally excluded from
trials. ``When you go out in the real world and look at treated
patients and untreated patients believe me, the difference is very
large,'' Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most experts agree that while drugs for depression are
effective, they are still not effective enough, for enough
patients: that remains for the future.

   HEAT: NO MORE SPLIT DECISIONS
</P>
<P>
   Miami fully aware 1-1 starts were its undoing against Knicks
twice
</P>
<P>
   By Ethan J. Skolnick
</P>
<P>
   c. 200 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Double or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That's the proposition facing the Miami Heat as they prepare for
Tuesday's rematch against the Detroit Pistons. Each of the past two
seasons, the Heat won only one of the opening two games at home,
then dropped both series to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that (Saturday's) game doesn't mean anything if we
don't take care of business Tuesday night,'' P.J. Brown said
Sunday, before he left to boil Easter eggs for his kids. The Heat
had a relatively short practice on the holiday, and Pat Riley led a
more intense one Monday. He realizes the Heat won't repeat their
comfortable 10-point victory if they don't address shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent among those is defending harder on the perimeter.
Riley counted 48 drives to the basket by the Pistons on Saturday,
and that was with Grant Hill noticeably hobbled. ``That's high,''
Riley said. Hill and Jerry Stackhouse combined for 20 free throw
attempts. Stackhouse led the league in that category, mostly
because of his quick first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were attacking (Saturday) night, so we're very aware that
their game is attack, run, attack, run,'' Riley said. ``They were
just getting by us. We want to get up and into them. We gave them
too much room and we got soft.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Riley, if the Heat _ particularly Jamal Mashburn,
Bruce Bowen and Dan Majerle _ can challenge the Pistons' slashers
farther out on the floor, ``it gives your help a little more time
to get there.'' Alonzo Mourning provided nine blocks' worth of
assistance Saturday, but he can't be counted on to save every
defensive stand. The center said as much after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   That victory was enabled primarily by the passionate play of
Mashburn, and Riley wants him shooting 20 times per game. Saturday,
he took 17 shots, making 10, and added seven free throws. ``He
ain't going to be out there without having the ball in his hands,''
Riley said. ``There ain't going to any of these, well, 'I didn't
get it for eight minutes.' He's going to have it a lot. If they are
taking it out of Zo's hands, then we want it in Mash's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will take it out of Zo's hands, by denying him touches
through deception if not force. Each team has accused the other of
playing illegal defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anybody who has their defense leaning toward
Alonzo, it's them,'' Riley said. ``I made the point a week ago, and
they still are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning is trying to work around it. His unselfishness and
savvy decision-making Saturday foiled the Pistons' best and worst
intentions. Told that Pistons coach George Irvine accused him of
striking his own illegal defensive poses, Mourning replied:
``That's his opinion, man. Believe me, they play illegal too. I
think there's been a lack of consistency on calls the whole year,
because referees are trying to adapt to these new rules. If that's
the excuse he uses, then fine, I'm sorry. I can't do anything about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor about the past two years either. Yet Riley says the players
are aware of history. ``We've lost either the first or the second
game,'' Riley said. ``Detroit's going to forget about this (first
game), because they have one more opportunity to do what it is they
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his players ``left everything they had out there on the
floor,'' Riley didn't want all this rest for them. ``I'd rather
play (Monday) night, it's just more natural,'' Riley said Sunday.
``Having two or three days between games allows a player to become
a person. In the playoffs, you don't want your players to be
people.''
</P>
<P>
   People subject to distractions, caused by family, friends,
hobbies. ``He knows this is a long, tough journey, and we need the
edge in every department,'' said Mourning, who plans to avoid Jet
Skiing, and partying, and hanging out late during the playoffs.
However long they go. They may go longer if the Heat take Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're in dire need of a win, we've always seemed to step
up,'' Brown said. ``When things are going good, and flowing very
well, we don't seem to handle success that well. It seems to hurt
us more than help us.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are in dire need of a win, aren't they?

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quarter billion years ago, some 90 percent of all animal
species, including the trilobites, the three-lobed predators of the
sea, suddenly disappeared in the worst of all mass extinctions.
</P>
<P>
   The killer's identity has long been a mystery. But now
scientists in Australia have unearthed evidence that the culprit
could have been a speeding rock from outer space that slammed into
the planet, carved out a crater some 75 miles wide, and blasted
millions of tons of rock and dust into the sky, blotting out the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   A team of four scientists at the Geological Survey of Western
Australia and the Australian National University, led by Arthur
Mory, announced the discovery in the April 15 issue of Earth and
Planetary Science Letters, published by Elsevier. The structure, at
least 75 miles wide and hidden from sight by hundreds of feet of
dirt and rock, is in Western Australia near an arm of the Indian
Ocean known as Shark Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tantalizing,'' Michael Rampino, an earth scientist at New
York University, said of the discovery. ``It's clearly a big
crater. But the age is up for grabs, so a link to extinction
remains to be proven.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact dating of the cosmic scar is uncertain, the
discoverers said. But clues suggest its age is roughly between the
early Jurassic and early Permian periods, or 200 and 280 million
years ago. That distant era, they noted, contained two mass
extinctions _ one at the end of the Triassic some 214 million years
ago, and one at the end of the Permian 247 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That upheaval saw the disappearance of not only trilobites but
hundreds of other marine invertebrates, insects and early reptiles.
Their demise was a turning point in earth history that made way for
the rise of dinosaurs and widened the niches available for the
mammal-like reptiles, which became ancestors of the human race.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian blow probably accounts for ``one of the two major
extinctions,'' the crater discoverers wrote, ``given the likely
environmental consequences of an impact of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Named Woodleigh after a station in the Australian outback, the
new crater is the largest ever discovered on the Australian
geological plate. Globally, it is the fourth largest. The only
bigger ones are Vredefort in South Africa (about 185 miles wide),
Sudbury in Canada (about 155 miles wide) and Chicxulub in Mexico
(about 110 miles wide). In all, scientists have now found some 150
or so impact craters.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian find was inspired by the scientific detective
work that tied the Chicxulub crater (pronounced cheek-soo-LOOB) to
the most famous of all mass extinctions. That die-off, 65 million
years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, killed the
dinosaurs, the marine shellfish called ammonites and many other
groups of animals.
</P>
<P>
   The main dinosaur sleuth was Dr. Walter Alvarez, a geologist at
the University of California at Berkeley. In 1980, he and his
colleagues reported that they had found unusually large amounts of
iridium in geological strata laid down when the dinosaurs died out
and proposed that the rare metal had come from a giant asteroid
that struck the Earth. Iridium, a precious metal belonging to the
platinum group of elements, is more abundant in meteorites than in
terrestrial rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Alvarez theory won wide attention. And in 1990, after long
hunts, geologists announced that they had found a candidate crater
in Mexico, buried deep under the Yucatan Peninsula. The Chicxulub
crater was big enough to account for the dinosaur extinctions, and
its age was exactly right. Many scientists sought similar
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian team found an intriguing sample of rock from the
Woodleigh region that a company in 1981 had pulled up from a depth
of 620 feet. The quartz in this rock was fractured or ``shocked''
in a way that suggested that it had been subject to sudden extreme
heat and pressure. In March 1999, the team went back to the site
and took 25 core samples from depths ranging from 620 to more than
1,000 feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Study of the samples with light and electron microscopes
revealed multiple signatures of shocked quartz, as well as glassy
areas that implied a history of fiery melts.
</P>
<P>
   The team also obtained government gravity maps of the region,
and in March 1999 took their own gravity readings as well,
according to the Earth and Planetary Science article. The maps
revealed a buried, multiring structure some 75 miles wide _ the
bull's-eye of a cosmic scar.
</P>
<P>
   The team used an ultraviolet laser to try to date the rocks
through mineral analysis, but that effort failed. A minimum age of
200 million years was obtained from geologic deposits that filled
in the Woodleigh crater and a maximum age of 280 million from
fossils at its base. In addition, the region yielded radiochemical
signs of high heats occurring somewhere from 250 to 280 million
years ago _ about the time of the great dying at the end of the
Permian.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Boyle, a geochemist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and an editor at Earth and Planetary Science Letters, in
an interview called the Australian findings ``very interesting''
and predicted other researchers will aid the attempt to pin down
the crater's date.
</P>
<P>
   In the years prior to the Australian find, scientists who
pondered the cause of the Permian extinction had suggested a change
in the composition of the earth's atmosphere, volcanoes in Siberia
and the lowering of global sea levels. Clues have been sparse
because the events occurred so long ago. In particular, little
remains of the period's fossil record.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say a mix of factors may have contributed to the
Permian event, with the Australian object providing the killer
punch.
</P>
<P>
   Rampino at New York University noted that scientists had
identified a 25-mile-wide crater in Brazil that also seemed the
right age for the Permian extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he said, it was caused by a pair of cosmic killers, or
possibly a barrage of them.

FANCY PANTS 
GET A LEG UP ON THE LATEST ANKLE ACTION
</HEADLINE>

retransmitted by request.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Geek chic is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, fashion friends, while some of us were pressing the pleats
in our khakis, designers were embroidering daisies on capri pants.
Sewing feathers on jeans. And even strips of velvet on khaki
clamdiggers.
</P>
<P>
   The crafty craze caught us by the seat of our pants last summer
with a band or two of ribbon sewn around the edge of jeans that
brought attention to ankle bracelets and strappy sandals. By
December we were knee-deep in velvet and sari silk trims. Even
paisley and pailettes.
</P>
<P>
   And the ankle action isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the stores as we speak are spandex pants, bleached and
torn denim jeans and wool trousers sprouting flowers, glistening
with silvery studs and glittering with strips of sequins.
</P>
<P>
   Embellished pants, once the anti-fashion uniform of the hippie
era, have been interpreted by European designers like Gucci, Dolce
&AMP; Gabbana and Roberto Cavalli, elevated to high fashion and paired
with even higher heels.
</P>
<P>
   Here in L.A., local designers such as William B have put their
own spin on it with beaded fringe, feathers and flowers for
mainstream stores such as Nordstrom, while fashion-forward
boutiques including Bebe are offering jeans adorned with everything
from faux zebra fur to giant leather flowers.
</P>
<P>
   More conservative stores such as Ames, also have given
decorative pants validation. Ames' fashion consultant Toby Couser
offers her casually chic clientele dressy pants for disco divas.
Hanging next to career suits are pants with denim in front, spandex
in the back and a row of silver studs that run down the leg like a
tuxedo stripe ... which happens to be more flattering than the
ankle trim, she confides.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teen destinations such as Wet Seal are selling jeans
with ribbons around the ankle and butterfly and rose appliques on
the pockets, as well as designs with peacock feather ties at the
waist.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Gap are wool pants embroidered with roses, and at
Miller's Outpost are nylon pants with embroidered dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Dragons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget flowers. Dragons are the next big trend because it's
the year of the dragon,'' says Thousand Oaks store manager Ackley
Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   ---Decorate and look great &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed? Can't find pants that fit your personality or match
your shoes and purse?
</P>
<P>
   Be a purist and design your own. Women who don't know a bobbin
from a bobby pin are flocking to fabric stores for ribbons and
other decorative trims, reports Rosanne Sterr, manager of Joann's
Fabric and Craft store in Woodland Hills. The most-often-asked
question: How much ribbon do I need for the bottom of my pants?
</P>
<P>
   You'll need 1 1/8 yards of ribbon or trim to circle both legs,
and it can be ironed in place with a product called Stitch
Witchery. The product, which is sold like tape and placed between
the pants and the ribbon, also works for pre-embroidered appliques.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using strips of fabric to decorate your pant legs,
you'll need 1/8 of a yard (for both legs). Adding sequins? Sterr
recommends buying them by the yard and then glueing them in place
with a product called Jewel-It.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources for ribbon and trim are Michael's craft stores,
booths along the Venice Boardwalk and the downtown L.A. garment
district.

 &HT;    BREAKUP TALK PUTS PRESSURE ON MICROSOFT TO SETTLE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp., assailed by the courts and
hammered by the stock market, came under renewed pressure Monday to
try to settle its antitrust battle with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The company's renewed need to act was fueled by a spate of
reports that the Justice Department and 19 states have reversed
course and now intend to seek a remedy that would split up the
software giant along product lines.
</P>
<P>
   While denouncing the notion of a breakup, Microsoft spokesman
Jim Cullinan still held the door open to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in Microsoft's interest, we believe, to try to put this
issue behind us as quickly possible,'' Cullinan said. ``But we're
only going to do so in a way that protects our ability to continue
to innovate products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the trial record or in this case that
would justify such an extreme and radical remedy. This would be bad
for Microsoft, consumers and the entire industry,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even more urgent reason to settle the case is to stem
the sharp sell-off of its shares. On Monday, Microsoft stock, once
the darling of Wall Street investors, fell to its lowest level in
some 17 months, closing at $66.38, a drop of nearly 16 percent on
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The more than $150 billion in shareholder value that has been
wiped off Microsoft's books since January impedes the company's
ability to make acquisitions and offer attractive stock options to
prospective key employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, these (breakup) reports are not meant so
much to put pressure on Microsoft but instead to gauge reaction in
the industry,'' said Jonathan Zuck, who has followed the case
closely from a pro-Microsoft perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Added Zuck, executive director of the 6,000-member Association
for Competitive Technology: ``If it's a trial balloon, it will a
lead balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Such radical steps were never at issue earlier this year when
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and other top company officials
sought to forge a negotiated settlement to the landmark case, with
the aid of Richard Posner, a federal appeals judge based in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After those talks faltered, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who instigated them, found Microsoft guilty as charged and
gave the government until the end of April to produce a proposed
set of remedies as a means of lifting the company's monopoly hold
over the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the government may eventually decide to propose, the
law grants Jackson full freedom of action to impose whatever sort
of relief he deems appropriate, including the option of a fine that
could be in the many billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There was further uncertainty over whether the Justice
Department and the state attorneys general could agree on a unified
remedy plan. Some states, notably New York and Connecticut, were
known to be taking a hard line while others, notably Ohio and Iowa,
favored a more nuanced approach.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Joel Klein, the chief antitrust official at Justice,
was still seeking to reach a compromise on the prosecution bench in
advance of Jackson's April 28 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is an appeal of Jackson's ruling. Microsoft
could also appeal any interim and immediate steps in the way of
relief, if sought by the government and approved by the judge, that
alters the way Microsoft does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure if I were the government I would want to go down
that (interim) road,'' an official who has helped prosecute the
case cautioned privately. ``Having an unfriendly court of appeals
focusing on relief _ which is probably most controversial aspect of
anything Jackson might do _ may prove to be poor tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic changes after the final relief proposal is out on
the table,'' this official added. ``Microsoft is under pressure not
only because of the relief that Jackson might impose but also
because what the stock market has done to its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they might say: 'Let's have another go at this.' But that's
not the underlying purpose (of the breakup reports). A lot of work
has gone into this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if you wanted to take a sort of off-the-wall view,
maybe they (the government) are trying to negotiate in print. Maybe
they're leaking these really harsh remedies in the hope that
Microsoft, still at this last minute, might come up with a
settlement,'' said Greg Valliere, an economist for Schwab
Washington Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there would be something a little gentler,'' he
added. ``This is very harsh.''

FANCY PANTS 
GET A LEG UP ON THE LATEST ANKLE ACTION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Geek chic is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, fashion friends, while some of us were pressing the pleats
in our khakis, designers were embroidering daisies on capri pants.
Sewing feathers on jeans. And even strips of velvet on khaki
clamdiggers.
</P>
<P>
   The crafty craze caught us by the seat of our pants last summer
with a band or two of ribbon sewn around the edge of jeans that
brought attention to ankle bracelets and strappy sandals. By
December we were knee-deep in velvet and sari silk trims. Even
paisley and pailettes.
</P>
<P>
   And the ankle action isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the stores as we speak are spandex pants, bleached and
torn denim jeans and wool trousers sprouting flowers, glistening
with silvery studs and glittering with strips of sequins.
</P>
<P>
   Embellished pants, once the anti-fashion uniform of the hippie
era, have been interpreted by European designers like Gucci, Dolce
&AMP; Gabbana and Roberto Cavalli, elevated to high fashion and paired
with even higher heels.
</P>
<P>
   Here in L.A., local designers such as William B have put their
own spin on it with beaded fringe, feathers and flowers for
mainstream stores such as Nordstrom, while fashion-forward
boutiques including Bebe are offering jeans adorned with everything
from faux zebra fur to giant leather flowers.
</P>
<P>
   More conservative stores such as Ames, also have given
decorative pants validation. Ames' fashion consultant Toby Couser
offers her casually chic clientele dressy pants for disco divas.
Hanging next to career suits are pants with denim in front, spandex
in the back and a row of silver studs that run down the leg like a
tuxedo stripe ... which happens to be more flattering than the
ankle trim, she confides.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teen destinations such as Wet Seal are selling jeans
with ribbons around the ankle and butterfly and rose appliques on
the pockets, as well as designs with peacock feather ties at the
waist.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Gap are wool pants embroidered with roses, and at
Miller's Outpost are nylon pants with embroidered dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Dragons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget flowers. Dragons are the next big trend because it's
the year of the dragon,'' says Thousand Oaks store manager Ackley
Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   ---Decorate and look great &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed? Can't find pants that fit your personality or match
your shoes and purse?
</P>
<P>
   Be a purist and design your own. Women who don't know a bobbin
from a bobby pin are flocking to fabric stores for ribbons and
other decorative trims, reports Rosanne Sterr, manager of Joann's
Fabric and Craft store in Woodland Hills. The most-often-asked
question: How much ribbon do I need for the bottom of my pants?
</P>
<P>
   You'll need 1 1/8 yards of ribbon or trim to circle both legs,
and it can be ironed in place with a product called Stitch
Witchery. The product, which is sold like tape and placed between
the pants and the ribbon, also works for pre-embroidered appliques.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using strips of fabric to decorate your pant legs,
you'll need 1/8 of a yard (for both legs). Adding sequins? Sterr
recommends buying them by the yard and then glueing them in place
with a product called Jewel-It.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources for ribbon and trim are Michael's craft stores,
booths along the Venice Boardwalk and the downtown L.A. garment
district.

WHERE THE ART IS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Natalie Portman is at the age where her life and her acting career
can't help but intersect. She's never been part of the ``Dawson's
Creek'' pack; audiences haven't seen the 18-year-old-actress in a
teen romance or a self-referential slasher flick. That leaves
coming-of-age stories (along with the latest ``Star Wars''
trilogy), and with ``Anywhere but Here'' and her latest movie,
``Where the Heart Is,'' Portman is proving to be quite adept at
playing young women who face pivotal transition points in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels are pretty obvious,'' Portman says. ``I just
left home for college this year, and I'm deciding how to define
myself in new situations. It's exciting and scary, too. All the
ingredients of good drama, in other words.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Where the Heart Is,'' Portman plays Novalee Nation, a very
pregnant 17-year-old who must fend for herself after her no-account
musician boyfriend abandons her at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart en route to
California. Novalee takes up residence inside the Wal-Mart,
sleeping in the camping gear aisles and judiciously snacking in the
grocery section. After the baby is born, she meets a host of
eccentric locals who take her in and become the family she has
never known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `The Wizard of Oz,' really,'' Portman says of the movie,
which was adapted from Billie Lett's novel, the latest selection
from Oprah Winfrey's book club to be made into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning there's this young girl, and she's lost and
looking for home,'' Portman continues, ``and along the way toward
home, she meets all these wonderfully odd characters who become her
family and become her home.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which co-stars Ashley Judd as Novalee's surrogate big
sister and Stockard Channing as the mother figure, marks the
feature directorial debut of Matt Williams. Williams made his mark
in television, helping create ``Roseanne'' and ``Home
Improvement,'' as well as serving as a writer and producer of ``The
Cosby Show'' for three seasons. For him, ``Where the Heart Is'' is
a natural extension of those shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been celebrating the American family my whole career; I
just didn't realize it until I started directing this movie,''
Williams says. ``My own family fell apart when my parents got a
divorce. I was 15 years old and had grown up in this (Norman)
Rockwell-like environment in the Midwest, and I thought, 'Oh my
gosh, this is what life is,' only to see it torn apart. I suddenly
became the adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I didn't realize this for years, but it influenced
everything I wrote because all the families stayed together. Dan
and Roseanne stayed together for the kids. Pat and Tim stayed
together for the kids. They'd fight and argue, but ultimately they
survived. And I realized I had been patching up my family and
making it survive all these years through the TV shows and plays I
was directing. None of my families fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The family Williams gives us in the movie is an odd, diverse
bunch, related not by blood but out of need and a shared longing
for community. The villains in the film (and the book) are people
who refuse to recognize families that go beyond the traditional,
husband-wife-children construct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those people that say a family is only 'this,'''
Williams says. ``You certainly see that today with regard to gay
couples who want to adopt kids. We have to be tolerant enough and
open enough to realize that we have to redefine our concepts of
family. If a child is nurtured and loved, that's going to be a
happy child no matter who the parents are.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman, too, appreciated the film's non-judgmental tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good-natured and well-meaning without being embarrassed
about it, and you don't find that in most movies today,'' Portman
says. ``Most movies would say, 'Oh, look at this dysfunctional
family and how screwed up everyone gets because of it.' And this
movie shows how you can transcend what life hands you.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman herself had to transcend one story element that the
movie handed her _ a love scene, her first ever on film. Throughout
her career, the young actress has balked at doing anything remotely
sexual. She refused to consider her last film, ``Anywhere but
Here,'' until Wayne Wang rewrote a love scene to her
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very firm on that point,'' Wang says.
</P>
<P>
   But she caved _ a bit _ for ``Where the Heart Is'' because the
scene was so essential to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had just turned 18 and was very concerned,'' Williams
says. ``How would you feel if you were asked to take off your
clothes and simulate making love with 50 people watching and a
camera rolling? It's tough, and at 18, it's even tougher. We did it
as tastefully as we could and still suggested the tenderness of the
relationship. It wasn't a hard-core bump and grind; it was about
people connecting emotionally and spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   And Portman still hated every moment of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best possible situation. I liked Matt, and I was
really good friends with James (Frain, the actor), and we were both
completely dressed under the covers and we didn't have to do
anything explicit ... just kissing and stuff,'' Portman says. ``And
I was still so uncomfortable. I just felt so weird being told to
kiss someone that I didn't want to kiss. I almost felt whorish,
being told what to do in a sexual way.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says Portman got through it by being a pro and
surrendering to the moment and her character. Upon hearing this,
Portman says she must have had her director pretty fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't just let go,'' she says. ``I think it would be even
harder if I had a boyfriend. I was thinking, 'I hope to get married
someday, and then how would I feel?' It would probably be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Portman seems resigned to losing a battle or two while
growing up on screen. After she finishes her freshman year of
college in May, she'll be heading to Australia for the summer to
shoot the second episode in the new `Star Wars'' series. Then
she'll return to her Ivy League school for another year _ after
which she'll take a sabbatical, since she's already a year ahead in
her studies. Although she professes an interest in psychology, she
doesn't seem interested in giving up her movie career any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a pretty fun job,'' Portman says with a smile. ``I
mean, I don't get pampered as much as when I was younger. It's more
work, more of a job, because people know you and expect you can do
things. But of all the jobs you can do, it's a pretty great one,
don't you think?'' &QL;

   We flatter ourselves to think we know something about writing
tight, but we are pikers compared with these people. Granted, there
was self-interest involved. They were embroiled in a contest
sponsored by the San Luis Obispo newspaper (beginitalic)New
Times(enditalic), which invited readers to submit stories using
plot, setting and character in fewer than 55 words. First prize
included a certificate and a T-shirt. If (beginitalic)New Times
(enditalic)hasn't upped the ante since then, it doesn't deserve
readers like these. Most of the stories are long (relatively
speaking) on dialogue, humor and creative implication, and short on
everything else. It sounds easy, but try it. Here is ``The Britches
of Madison County,'' in which author Bill Crown one-ups Robert
James Waller in 37 words: ``Francesca came out on the porch and
welcomed them home, her husband, their son, and daughter. But her
skirt was hung up in the waist of her drawers. The old man got hip
and he shot her.''

   Please do not shy away from this book because its subject is
orchids and you don't know anything about them. Hansen didn't know
anything about them either, until he was hired to guide two orchid
fanatics into the wilds of Borneo in search of the holy grail of
orchids, the Latin name of which we refuse to repeat here. Hansen
hired some Borneo natives to provide sherpalike assistance on this
journey, and these simple, jungle-savvy men provide lots of laughs
as they react to the orchid zealots' reasons for sloshing up a
muddy Borneo river with a stockpile of equipment that includes a
camouflaged cardboard toilet. This trip was the author's
introduction to the world of orchids and orchid lovers, which was
far more complex, seductive, competitive and pricey than he ever
imagined. Read all about it in this captivating and often funny
book. (Hansen appeared briefly in a recent (beginitalic)60 Minutes
(enditalic)story about the orchid world. As is almost always the
case when media overlap, the book is better.)

   You can read this as a means to improve your golf game, or you
can read it for laughs. New &AMP; Notable has no golf game to speak of,
but in search of good suggestions for Father's Day, we read gamely
on, stifling our guffaws. Lee, a psychiatrist, and Warne, a golf
instructor, join forces to explain the mystery of why you play
better when no one is watching. The villain is the dreaded panic
attack syndrome. As Lee says, ``There are specific swing weaknesses
that are magnets for the chemicals of anxiety. Even the tiniest
amount of anxiety produces chemicals that will feast on certain
specific weaknesses in the swing.'' Their solutions include a
pre-shot routine that involves entering a light trance, developing
``Insight-Oriented Defenses'' to fight the nasty chemicals and
``uninstalling'' the ``Blame Game,'' or the urge to be angry over
bad shots. They take this very, very seriously, but we could not.
Disguised as psychobabble, even common sense sounds like hooey.

   The survival of Dallas pathologist Beck Weathers was just about
the only good news to come out of the storm on Mount Everest that
killed nine people in 1996. Left for dead by other climbers, he
suddenly, miraculously stood up and walked through the squall to
the nearest camp. Fellow climber Jon Krakauer ((beginitalic)Into
Thin Air(enditalic)) comes off well in this version of the day's
events. Anatoli Boukreev, the guide who climbed without oxygen and
so was unable to help his clients descend before the storm hit,
does not. Neither does George W. Bush, who would not help Weathers'
family get him home from Nepal. Less interesting sections about
Weathers' youth and relationship with his wife and family are
followed by sobering descriptions of his recuperation (he lost both
hands and his nose to frostbite). Best of all, he tells of the
daring Nepalese pilot who flew alone, perilously higher than his
helicopter was meant to go, and brought Weathers off of Mount
Everest alive.

also just plain interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It has extensive information on the planets and their moons,
from mythology to hard science. For example, the site notes that
Mercury was probably named for the messenger of the gods because it
moves quickly across the sky. Also, its eccentric orbit helped
prove Einstein's theory of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   It also notes that Neptune, the eighth planet from the sun, was
discovered after astronomers noticed a peculiarity in the orbit of
Uranus, the seventh planet. Pluto was discovered by accident, for
much the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of good photos, such as a full color shot of
Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, which has active volcanoes on its
surface.

   Bored with all the book learning? You can also vote for your
favorite planet. In an amazing turn of events, Earth seems to be
winning. What a bunch of homers. Mars rules!

   This magazine just can't win for losing. Much of this month's
issue is devoted to John McCain, whose presidential campaign flamed
about the same time they were dropping this collection of
irrelevancy in the mail. There is an essay by the White Tornado
himself, repeating much of what we heard in stump speeches all
winter. There is also a feature on Cindy McCain, who,
(beginitalic)George (enditalic)has learned, loves her children. In
all fairness, there also are pieces on the wives of George W. Bush,
Al Gore and Bill Bradley, whose campaign fell apart about the same
time as McCain's. Beyond that, there's not much to keep the covers
apart, though the Vietnam retrospective by Pulitzer Prize winner
David Halberstam is worth a look. The main feature is on stars who
give extensively to charity, and it leads with U2's Bono, who has
become involved in Third World debt relief. That, and finding that
elusive word that rhymes with Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   Reason
</P>
<P>
   The lead piece happily notes that the world hasn't come to an
end, as gloomily predicted by experts during the first Earth Day
back in 1970. There hasn't been a global famine, city dwellers
aren't wearing gas masks, and we haven't run out of oil. While the
statistics seem to bear this out, the piece is written in an
off-putting we-told-you-so style that makes it read like an
eighth-grade social studies book. In another piece, a dad defends
the ribald animated TV show (beginitalic)South Park(enditalic),
which has sent the Religious Right into a tizzy with its profane
dialogue and adult themes. Writer Barry S. Fagin taped and
previewed the show and then let his kids watch a few episodes. He
emerged believing that (beginitalic)South Park (enditalic)can
actually teach his kids something, mainly that it's fun to ridicule
celebrities, hypocrites and ``people who believe stupid things.''
Also, cartoons are not real. We had an inkling. That Yosemite Sam
just never seems to run out of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Utne reader
</P>
<P>
   The main package deals with dwindling privacy in an increasingly
computerized world. The most interesting piece involves a man who
walks 120 miles from his tiny Quaker community in southeastern Ohio
to the state capital, Columbus, to return his driver's license in
an act of defiance. We later learn that he and his wife have no
marriage certificate (no government interference, thank you),
refused immunization for their first child and never filed birth
certificates for the rest. Great idea, except he can't take them as
tax deductions. You walk away admiring the guy but at the same time
glad you're not stuck on a six-hour flight with him. Another
article examines the relative futility of the U.S. Census Bureau's
efforts to count immigrants and minorities. It has become this
silly: Census-takers in Chicago invented an ersatz superhero to
cajole Hispanics to fill out their census forms. His name: Super
Censo. Now we're cooking with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Working mother
</P>
<P>
   The magazine for moms offers advice on how to organize your day
around getting the little tykes fed, off to school and yourself to
work without losing your sanity. The real-mom model who poses for
the article is sporting an ear-to-ear grin, so apparently, it's a
real snap. There is some genuinely good advice, but I'm guessing
most moms won't quite find the time for the ``categorize your
closet'' chapter. Another story profiles the ``Mom of the Year,'' a
28-year-old mother of three who develops school programs by day and
powders bottoms by night. In her spare time, she works on cold
fusion experiments in the family basement. There's also a decent
piece on figuring out if your kids can be left at home alone. To
find out if you're ready to take the plunge, the article provides a
list of probing questions, such as ``Is your child a pyromaniac?''
OK, we made that one up.

 &HT;    WHY THE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT SOPHONIE
 &HT;    She's motherless and may soon
 &HT;    be deported to Haiti. But
 &HT;    she's received no outpouring
 &HT;    of support to stay in America
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PARK, Fla. _ She is so small, just 6, like Elian. When she
smiles, perhaps at a bowl of strawberry ice cream, you see she is
missing two front teeth. In kindergarten, at Lake Park Elementary,
she is just beginning to read. Her teachers are so proud, because
when the school year began, she couldn't speak a word in English.
She loves pink. On Sundays, she puts on a frilly dress and goes to
church.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Elian, she came from a tiny island country, a place so
riven by politics and poverty that people risk everything to flee.
Just like Elian, she had a determined mother who packed her up and
sneaked her through America's back door. And then her mother
slipped away and died, just like Elian's.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like Elian, she is here but not here. She has no legal
standing in the United States. No residency papers. No health
insurance. No plain and proper place.
</P>
<P>
   She got her picture in the paper once, after U.S. Rep. Alcee
Hastings filed a bill on her behalf, but the story did not make the
front page. That place, especially now, is reserved for Elian
Gonzalez, the little boy from Cuba, not for Sophonie Telcy, who
came from Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Ti gason, the boy _ that is what the people in Sophonie's world
call Elian, who was rescued at sea Thanksgiving Day and turned
instantly into a cause celebre, from the moment he touched land
until Saturday morning, when federal agents whisked him away. The
people in Sophonie's world hear about Elian on the TV. They hear
about Sophonie, too, but only when the radio broadcasts in Creole.
Then, yes, people talk, rat-a-tat-tat, quick Creole gossip: What
about Sophonie? What will happen to her? The little girl from
Haiti?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohhh, I do not know,'' Henry Smith said last week as he
settled into the plump white sofa in his new Lake Park home, a
place big enough for his three children, his wife, Jeanine, and now
Sophonie.
</P>
<P>
   He is not Sophonie's dad. Nobody is sure where her father is.
Smith is her caretaker, the man who said yes when her mother, Sana
Romelus, came to his door one Sunday morning a year ago holding
Sophonie's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you take Sophonie for me?'' she said. She was ill and had
to return to Haiti, where she would last just a short time, he
later learned, before dying. And so, Henry Smith said yes. He would
take Sophonie.
</P>
<P>
   Smith tells this story patiently, in the careful English he has
acquired since his arrival here from Haiti in 1994, and he will
tell it again and again to anybody who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that so much,'' he says, brow crinkling as if he
might weep. Over in the corner, on a maroon love seat, Sophonie
practices writing her name in a recipe book that is supposed to be
for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do the Cuban people have more favor than the Haiti
people?'' the man who cares for her says. ``Because people are
people. If Cuban people are allowed to stay, then Haitian people
should be, too. Every day you see Elian on the TV. I think it is
good for the little boy, because everybody likes him and wants to
help him. But I say: Here is Sophonie, a little girl from Haiti.
She is here now. And she does not have a mother, just as Elian does
not have his. I think surely somebody is going to help her now.
Don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   But he seems more worried than convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Sophonie Telcy _ motherless, adrift, in the eyes of the law an
illegal alien _ is not Elian Gonzalez, and everybody knows it.
</P>
<P>
   She is just Sophonie. She sings in the children's choir at
church. She has a blue Cookie Monster. She wants to be a doctor
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an hour-and-a-half about Sophonie last night on the
Haitian radio,'' Henry Smith says hopefully. But he knows it is not
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I get her on CNN?''
</P>
<P>
   NO RESENTMENT
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find a speck of resentment about Elian in the
Haitian neighborhoods that dot South Florida. Ti gason, the boy _
God help him, everybody says.
</P>
<P>
   But what, they ask, about Sophonie?
</P>
<P>
   Why all this attention for a Cuban boy and not a Haitian girl?
Why is it easier for Cubans to settle here? Is it fair that the
Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 grants them special status? If you are
Cuban and here in the U.S. for a year and a day, and if you have
seen the people at the immigration office, you are virtually
guaranteed permanent residency. Not so for Haitians. If you are
Haitian, you are virtually guaranteed to be sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it fair?'' This is the talk over plates of fish and rice,
over dominoes, over fence lines and cash registers at the grocery
stores.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, Congressman Hastings, D-Miramar, put the feelings
down on paper when he filed a House bill ``for the relief of
Sophonie Telcy.''
</P>
<P>
   He modeled it, precisely and purposefully, after one of the
bills filed on Elian's behalf. It is only a few paragraphs long. It
asks that Sophonie Telcy be granted permanent residency in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In the accompanying news release, Hastings spoke plainly about
the ``patently disparate treatment of refugees from different
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he zipped about, talking up Sophonie's case on every
talk show that would have him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view,'' his voice boomed from his car phone between
appearances last week, ``Sophonie Telcy is in a worse position than
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have a mother. She doesn't have a father who wants
to receive her. She doesn't have relatives here who want to care
for her. It's an incredible situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here is Elian, who has a father who wants him back in
Cuba, and relatives who want him here. So who is worse off? You
answer. It's not rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   So here is Hastings, who represents about 40,000 Haitians in his
district. And here is Sophonie, who last week in school drew a
picture of a robot with pink and orange hair, oblivious to her
symbolic role in U.S. immigration affairs. Everybody knows how
Elian got to be famous.
</P>
<P>
   But how did Sophonie get to be almost-famous?
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case in Haitian immigrant matters, the Creole
airwaves were involved. Somebody from Hastings' office spoke with
Daniella Henry, executive director of the Haitian American
Community Council in Delray Beach. She went on a Creole radio
station, WHSR-AM, to inquire for the congressman whether anybody
knew of a young Haitian child orphaned or abandoned in the U.S.
without the proper residency documents.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 seconds went by. ``Then my office filled with calls,''
Henry says. So did the congressman's. One call came from Henry
Smith, who just happened to be listening to the radio when Daniella
Henry came on with her plea to find a Haitian Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Henry and Jeanine Smith have not been in this country so long
themselves. The taste of struggle is still in their mouths. Six
years ago, they were aboard a refugee boat from Haiti that was
intercepted by the Coast Guard. They were rerouted to the U.S.
naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they told their story of
political persecution _ Henry Smith had supported ousted President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and was now in danger _ and won asylum. They
moved to South Florida, built a life, had children, found jobs.
Now, Henry works in construction, and Jeanine cleans hotel rooms.
On her days off, she tutors Sophonie and her two older daughters,
Roubnide, nearly 5, and Loudia, just 4, in their schoolwork.
Jeanine was a teacher back in Haiti _ and you do not forget your
profession just because you hold a washrag in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Smith family history, so when Henry Smith heard the
radio, he remembered Haiti and he remembered his voyage and he
remembered his promise to Sophonie's mother.
</P>
<P>
   He called Hastings' office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have Sophonie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you help her?''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman sent an aide to Lake Park. He took down the
story: How Sophonie's mom brought her young daughter illegally to
the U.S. in the late 1990s. How her mother had a terrible pain in
her stomach but no medical insurance. How she decided to return to
Haiti last spring to see a doctor, but first asked Henry, an old
friend from church in Port-au-Prince, to take care of Sophonie. How
Sana Romelus died in Haiti, and when Henry Smith heard, he sent for
her death certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Alcee Hastings heard this story, he introduced the
name Sophonie Telcy to the American public via House Resolution
4179, which was referred to the Committee on Judiciary in the 106th
Congress, 2nd Session.
</P>
<P>
   And Sophonie got her picture in the paper. She looked beautiful
with two little braids that stuck straight up.
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Park Elementary, all the teachers said, ``Oh, my, we had
no idea.'' And then they wondered: ``How many other Sophonies do we
have here?''
</P>
<P>
   'A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY'
</P>
<P>
   Some things Henry and Jeanine Smith want for Sophonie they
cannot have.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance, for instance. And a Social Security number, so
they can sign her up for the after-school program at the Bright
Futures child development center down the street. Roubnide and
Loudia go there, and some day the baby, Cyndia, might, too. But
they have Social Security numbers. They are citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have Sophonie here,'' says Wanda Doby, who
owns Bright Futures. ``It's just a matter of the papers. It seems
it always happens like this. When the Haitians come over, we have a
problem getting them here legally. And with Cubans, it's a whole
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, after Sophonie's mother dropped her at Henry
Smith's door, Sophonie seemed sad for a long time. For perhaps
three months, she cried.
</P>
<P>
   Then she made friends with Roubnide and Loudia, and she grew
attached to Henry, whom she sometimes calls Dad, and to Jeanine,
who is like a mother to her now, in the way Elian's cousin
Marisleysis became mother to him. Now, most days, she seems happy,
as she puts on her Minnie Mouse sneakers and straightens her hair
for school.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, though.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to grant her residency doesn't stand much of a chance.
Few private bills do. And up in Washington, Sophonie is not exactly
a name on everybody's lips.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Henry Smith is alight with hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say if Elian gets citizenship in this country, then
maybe my Sophonie is going to have it, too. What do you think? Will
it be all right for her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so, yes. I really do.''

A SCION CLAIMS MEXICO'S TELEVISA EMPIRE AS HIS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not even his own father was sure that Emilio
Azcarraga Jean could run Grupo Televisa SA, the world's biggest
Spanish-language broadcast conglomerate that has loomed large over
Mexican life for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When his father, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, died in April 1997, he
had not tapped his 29-year-old son to succeed him as chairman of
the empire but had instead handed that post to another young
executive. What he did bequeath to his only son was the presidency
of a bloated and stumbling enterprise, debts estimated at $1.3
billion and a tangled estate that quickly generated a struggle
among the heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just three years later, the junior Azcarraga is the
chairman, president and undisputed leader of Televisa. He survived
one internal power showdown after another, refinanced his debts and
consolidated financial control of the $9 billion corporation. He
retired nearly an entire generation of management chosen by his
father, including 46 vice presidents, and revolutionized the
operating culture by imposing cost controls and laying off 6,000 of
the company's 20,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   He also declared political independence for the network's news
shows, which under his father had been unabashedly pro-government.
That lent a new openness to the campaigns leading up to
presidential elections in July.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa, which had a virtual monopoly on TV broadcasting in
Mexico until the early 1990s, has fought insurgent competition to
rebuild its share of the viewing audience to 80 percent from a low
of 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview, Azcarraga said he decided to re-create
Televisa by running it as a ``directed democracy'' and by setting
goals that he would systematically meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to measure for myself if I was the right one to be
president of this company,'' said Azcarraga, who carefully avoided
directly discussing his father. His approach was a radical
departure from that of the elder Azcarraga, known as ``the Tiger,''
who was both freewheeling and fiercely autocratic. During the
25-year reign of his father _ who had inherited the company from
his own father _ Televisa depended largely on the acuity of its
leader's impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a strategy for gaining control,'' Azcarraga
said, recalling the uncertain days after his father's death when he
owned only 10 percent of Televicentro, the holding company that his
father had controlled and that, in turn, controls 26 percent of
Televisa. ``I had a strategy for restoring the company.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was aware of investors' doubts. ``When I went to New York
in 1997 to explain what we wanted to do,'' he added, ``70 percent
of them didn't believe a word I said.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers had recommended that he sell out. ``But this company
was made by my family and I have an important moral stake in it,''
Azcarraga said. ``Besides, it was easy for me to gamble. I had
nothing to lose. I was only 29.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevail, Azcarraga had to take on some Mexican business
titans.
</P>
<P>
   His father, just weeks before he died, had designated Guillermo
Canedo White to lead the board of directors. Canedo was a young
media executive whose father had been a close associate of the
elder Azcarraga's.
</P>
<P>
   But Canedo soon tried to dominate Azcarraga, who turned for help
to Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga, a cousin with long experience in
Televisa. Within months, Canedo was forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized very quickly that we were dealing with a complete
Azcarraga,'' said Enrique Krauze, a historian and publisher who
sits on the Televisa board. ``When his father was alive people
called him Little Emilio. But once they saw him in action that
stopped right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a second round of succession strife, Azcarraga parted
ways early last year with the Aleman family. The family had been
Televisa shareholders for decades and its patriarch, Miguel Aleman
Valdes, had been president of Mexico in the 1940s. In the battle of
wills between the families Azcarraga stood firm. In the end, the
Alemans bowed out gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga said the Alemans even recommended a solid gold
replacement. Last May their piece of Televicentro plus some other
shares were snapped up by Carlos Slim Helu, the billionaire
financier and chairman of the telecommunications giant Telefonos de
Mexico SA. In all, through his financial group, Sinca Inbursa SA,
Slim bought 23.9 percent of Televisa's holding company in a deal in
which he agreed to always vote with Azcarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to convince him,'' Azcarraga said. ``He saw a
good company with people who had a good plan, and that's what Slim
looks at.'' Slim's bet paid off: Before the recent turbulence, the
trading price of Televisa shares had more than doubled since he
bought in.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga, who has been busy accumulating shares of his own, now
holds 51 percent of Televicentro. With the decision-making power he
gained over Slim's shares, he has control of almost 75 percent of
the holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The next, and perhaps last, major succession contest is under
way, placing Azcarraga on the opposite side of the negotiating
table from Burillo, the cousin who came to his rescue in the
perilous early days. Burillo, another member of the traditional
Televisa inner circle who has said he did not feel comfortable
taking a seat behind his younger relative, left his post as
president of international affairs in October.
</P>
<P>
   Now Burillo, who has remained on the Televisa board, wants to
sell his 25.1 percent stake in Televicentro, both sides in the
negotiations confirmed. Despite friction between the cousins,
Azcarraga said, their talks ``are on good terms.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in his chairman's office, the scion who
once hesitated to speak even in closed meetings displayed the
unstudied confidence that distinguished his grandfather and father,
whose portraits fill the wall behind his desk. He sat in
shirtsleeves in an easy chair with eight remote controls lined up
before him, keeping one eye on a bank of TV screens as he talked.
</P>
<P>
   Several Televisa officials said that the most striking
difference between Azcarraga and his imperious father is that he
listens and delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to hear all kinds of opinions,'' he said. ``We have a
lot of meetings now, we talk things out. We try to reach a
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga, who is largely self-taught on financial matters, has
surrounded himself with an adept team that still has a family feel.
Among his closest advisers are Bernardo Gomez and Jose Antonio
Baston, friends from his school days, and Alfonso de Angoitia, a
vice president, who was his lawyer through the succession wars.
</P>
<P>
   The inner circle also includes Gilberto Perezalonso, an
implacable cost cutter, and Jaime Davila, the programming
executive, the only person in the top rung to have survived from
the elder Azcarraga's era.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga also engineered a shakeup in programming, moving away
from a his father's system in which lifetime loyalty was required
of stars and defectors were ruthlessly ostracized. He has also
tried to install a more modern and politically open generation of
news anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is my editorial line?'' he said. ``It's very simple _ to
inform as much as possible, as well as possible. The viewer has to
decide on his thinking and ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades Televisa news was dominated by one man: the
nighttime anchor Jacobo Zabludovsky, who was happy to place his
show at the service of Mexico's closed one-party system. Azcarraga
retired him from the nighttime broadcast and has forced other
anchors to share their decision-making with off-camera executive
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's news stars have chafed at having their personal power
reduced. Late last month, three of the network's most influential
newsmen quit in one week, including Zabludovsky, who was still
anchoring specials, and his son Abraham, also an anchorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 18 I really didn't care if there was freedom of
expression in Mexico or not,'' Azcarraga said. ``But in the last
decade, since I have been working here, I have seen incredible
changes. The system changed. It opened up to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga added that he never received the phone calls from the
Interior Ministry with ``suggestions'' for coverage that were
routine in the days of his father. Yet he has made it clear that he
will not stray far from the government's beaten path. His
admiration for President Ernesto Zedillo, a member of the ruling
PRI party, was effusive.
</P>
<P>
   One Televisa journalist, Ricardo Rocha, made his mark with bold
documentary exposes that revealed the complicity of the PRI in two
massacres of rural farmers. Last year Televisa leaders banned the
airing of another expose that was critical of the government. In
May Rocha quietly resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Wall Street analysts to increase growth, Azcarraga is
immersed in an array of projects. In Mexico, where advertising
rates are the cheapest in the hemisphere, he plans to double the
Televisa price in three years, expecting to double ad revenues by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   To give the company greater flexibility for new investments, he
is completing a complex tender offer on $970 million of Televisa's
foreign bonds, which carried heavy restrictions. Cablevision SA de
CV, the cable company Televisa owns jointly with Slim, is preparing
to go public in May, in part to raise capital to expand outside
Mexico City. Responding to demands from regulators concerned about
Slim's vast telecommunications holdings, Slim will sell down his
stake in the cable venture.

   Azcarraga is also ready to begin esmas.com, Televisa's Internet
portal. The name means ``it's more,'' but analysts had begun to
refer to it as ``it's late.'' Azcarraga said he thought that
Televisa would eventually make an Internet alliance, but for now it
would go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga is working to bury the bad old Televisa without
rejecting his father _ a delicate task.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is re-creating the company by erasing his father's
shadow,'' said Claudia Fernandez, a Mexican writer who just
published ``El Tigre,'' a biography of the elder Azcarraga. ``But
he has done it by gaining investors' respect for what he can do by
himself.''

GADGETS GALORE FOR FITNESS BUFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (The Science Times) 
 By LINDA VILLAROSA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quan Phu, the fitness manager of 24-Hour Fitness, a health club
in Huntington Beach, Calif., likes to be precise about his
workouts. For instance, he knows that his run to Sunset Beach is
five miles and 7,610 steps, thanks to the new pedometer he wears
snapped to his waistband.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the old-style pedometer: The model he uses does
more than simply measure footfalls. It also computes calories
burned and average speed, records data for the current and previous
week and contains fitness programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pedometer helps me set goals rather than playing a
guessing game,'' said Phu, 24, who added that he was aiming to get
in the best shape of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, fitness enthusiasts were the ultimate low-techies.
Real athletes did not need equipment, they just did it. But a
technology wave has hit exercise equipment, and manufacturers have
begun flooding the market with gadgets for fitness buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these exercise innovations were unveiled at the recent
Super Show, the sporting goods industry's annual trade show. Along
with the retooled pedometer, manufacturers rolled out a talking
heart monitor; GetFit.com, a personalized, exercise Web site;
iFit.com, fitness equipment controlled digitally through a Web
site; and a Palm Pilot that keeps track of exercise programs and
records, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far and away there was more technology in the equipment than
I've ever seen before,'' said Mike May, director of communications
for the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, the organization
that owns the Super Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to the computer chip has transformed what fitness
companies can put out there,'' May said. ``It is one of the biggest
selling points of new exercise products.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the sporting goods manufacturers and other organizations
have no sales figures specifically for high-tech fitness equipment,
these gadgets seem to be catching on with exercisers, many of whom
are getting in shape with specific goals in mind like training for
an event, losing weight or lowering blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fitness is best done in a goal-oriented way, and computers and
other equipment help make it more accurate and more convenient,''
said Keli Roberts, owner of Real Fitness Inc., a personal training
business in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She uses a Palm Pilot to record her clients' exercise records
and then downloads the information into her computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can track their progress accurately and look at their
progression to see if the program is working,'' she said. ``These
kinds of records are also important in terms of injury
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has given fitness a technological boost. While the
spin on the Internet used to be that it was a barrier to exercise,
keeping people chained to their computers, that attitude has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   New fitness Web sites have emerged and some people are getting
their workout regiments by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a great innovation and can be the incentive
for getting people off the couch,'' said Ken Germano, the executive
director of the American Council on Exercise, a fitness watchdog
organization in San Diego. ``It is also ideal for those who travel.
They can stay connected with a fitness professional through a
laptop.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitness sites offer a variety of features: GetFit.com
(www.getfit.com), for example, offers customized workouts based on
the user's schedule, goals, fitness level and available exercise
equipment. In one area of the site, a user can click on a specific
body part and a videotaped demonstration of the exercise will be
streamed into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Dick Norton, 55, who describes himself as
heavily into computers, bought an Internet-compatible treadmill and
hooked it up to his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   When he is ready to exercise, he logs on to iFit.com
(www.iFit.com). The Web site streams a 30-minute workout video,
which he follows on the computer screen in a kind of online
one-on-one exercise class. His treadmill receives digital cues to
vary the speed and incline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had treadmills in the past, but they're boring,'' said
Norton, a manager for the U.S. Treasury Department in Burbank,
Calif. His favorite workout takes him on a virtual hike in Hawaii,
the incline on his treadmill increasing as the terrain in the video
moves uphill.
</P>
<P>
   However, some experts question the safety of these workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people feel more comfortable over the Internet than they
do in the gym, but those kinds of beginners are the very people who
need some kind of human interface first to avoid getting injured,''
Germano said. ``The critical eye of the trainer is missing online.
And I'm very concerned about exercise equipment operated by the
computer. This is a potentially dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Norton insists that he still has control of the treadmill
and he can override the computer's adjustments in speed and
incline, Germano remains wary: ``Yes, we're moving to long-distance
learning. But what about long-distance liability?''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, the personal trainer, adds: ``I caution people about
the promise of online training in general. With fitness, it's not
only what you do but how you do it. So starting an exercise program
without some kind of monitoring and measuring of fitness,
flexibility and strength, can be dangerous, especially for someone
just beginning or someone with a medical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the innovations can be very useful and safe _
especially to some subgroups of exercisers. Pam Fernandes, a tandem
bike racer who lost her eyesight to complications of diabetes
nearly 20 years ago, uses a talking heart-rate monitor to measure
her exercise intensity. Otherwise she would have to rely on her
biking partner to read the numbers to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This device tells me what my heart rate is every 30 seconds so
I know if my workout is intense enough,'' said Fernandes, 38, who
lives in Needham, Mass., and holds a number of tandem records among
racers who are blind. ``Using it has bumped up my training
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the benefits fitness technology affords her, Fernandes
believes that it can help only so much. ``When it comes down to it,
especially in competition, it's your mind and body that win a race.
When you're exercising, that's really all there is.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Blanket consideration of blanket primaries
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Supreme Court justices vigorously questioned Monday the
legitimacy of state ``blanket primary'' systems that lets voters
cast their ballot for any candidate regardless of party
affiliation. The state of California defended the primary system,
arguing that a primary election ``belongs to the voters,'' not to
the various political parties. Lawyers for four political parties
argued that the system is ``a wholesale assault'' on the parties'
ability ``to choose a standard-bearer who best represents'' their
views. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor seemed to agree, calling the
system ``tremendously intrusive'' on the rights of political
parties. The high court's decision, expected by late June, likely
will determine the future of blanket primaries in Louisiana and
Washington state as well _ along with various open-primary systems
used in about half the states.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN CASH CHASE NEVER STOPS
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this political season, President Clinton, Al
Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton were appearing side by side at a
fund-raising party. The Democratic National Committee, which doles
out campaign cash to Democratic candidates nationwide, hopes to
raise $2 million at Monday's event in New York. Tony Bennett is the
featured entertainment, with political jokes and introductions by
comic Jon Stewart. This event, combined with one in Hollywood a
week ago, were adding an estimated $4 million to party coffers. On
Wednesday, George W. Bush is headlining a black-tie gala in
Washington for the Republican National Committee. It's expected to
bring in at least $15 million _ a record one-day haul.
</P>
<P>
   RECORDS ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign that's been making history since Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced her candidacy in New York, she and Rudy Giuliani
are on a pace to shatter the record for the most expensive U.S.
Senate race in history. California set the bar in 1994 when Sen.
Dianne Feinstein and then-Rep. Michael Huffington spent $43.3
million; New Yorkers Alfonse D'Amato and Charles Schumer spent
$40.9 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Giuliani have raked in more than $32 million so far,
federal campaign finance records show, and the election is still
seven months away. ``We were saying early on, $50 million, but I
think that's going to be low,'' said Larry Makinson, head of the
nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which studies campaigns
and their financing.
</P>
<P>
   RAISING MONEY FROM NEW YORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton has gotten a higher percentage of her
itemized Senate campaign donations from New Yorkers this year than
rival Rudy Giuliani, according to a report Monday. The Albany Times
Union analyzed campaign finance reports filed during the first
three months of this year and found Clinton received 51 percent of
her itemized donations of $200 or more from New Yorkers. Giuliani
received 31 percent of those donations from New Yorkers. Giuliani
campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum called the analysis fundamentally
flawed. He said the mayor was concentrating on direct-mail appeals
this year that tended to focus on non-New Yorkers. He noted that a
Center for Responsive Politics analysis of last year's fund-raising
found Clinton's out-of-state fund-raising outstripping Giuliani's
56 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTH COMES OF AGE
</P>
<P>
   The South has offered up favorite sons Al Gore of Tennessee and
George W. Bush of Texas to lead the rest of the country for the
next four years. It's only the second time since 1808 that both
major party presidential candidates have hailed from states that
were part of the Confederacy. The other time was only two elections
ago, in 1992, when the elder George Bush of Texas took on Bill
Clinton of Arkansas. But aspersions were cast in 1992 on the elder
Bush's Southern roots. Although he has lived in Texas since the
late 1940s, he was born in Massachusetts and grew up in
Connecticut. To have an all-Southern matchup in two of the last
three election cycles after such a long drought, experts say,
illustrates that the South is more important politically and less
isolated culturally than it used to be. Before 1992, an all-South
matchup hadn't happened since James Madison of Virginia defeated
Charles Pinckney of South Carolina in 1808. And that was well
before the North-South mindset.
</P>
<P>
   BIG ELECTION WINNERS: LOCAL TV STATIONS
</P>
<P>
   This year's South Carolina presidential primary was great news
for George W. Bush _ and it wasn't too bad for WIS-TV in Columbia,
S.C., either. The NBC affiliate earned $426,000 in political
advertising revenue during the first quarter of the year. It more
than doubled what John Cottingham, the station's general manager,
had budgeted, and easily eclipsed the $234,399 the station took in
during the same period four years earlier. This promises to be a
lucrative year for many stations across the country. The Television
Bureau of Advertising predicts politicians will spend $600 million
on TV ads during 2000, up from $400 million in 1996. The trend is
toward more ads being bought locally, instead of nationally. In the
last few presidential elections, ad dollars have shifted from the
national networks to local stations in key areas.
</P>
<P>
   INTO THE GOP VEEP MIX
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends of George W. Bush are promoting Rep. John Kasich as
the veep twin for'' George W. Bush, says U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
Kasich promoters are said to be nearing 1,000 petition signatures
backing him. Elizabeth Dole, meanwhile, has joined the board of
computer maker Gateway. Dole backers say it shows that she's
familiar with Silicon Valley and that she could be Bush's tech
link. Finally, according to U.S. News, conservatives are pushing
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, who gets kudos for his handling of the
Oklahoma City bombing tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   AH, HOW QUICKLY THEY FORGET
</P>
<P>
   Now that George W. Bush and Al Gore have wrapped up their
parties' presidential nominations, it appears voters are forgetting
what they knew about the candidates. After February's New Hampshire
primary, according to a poll by the Joan Shorestein Center on the
Press, Politics and Public Policy, 24 percent of voters knew that
Bush is opposed to mandatory gun registration. Now that percentage
has fallen to 13 percent. The number of people who knew Gore
opposes using tax dollars to help parents pay for private or
parochial schools fell from 19 percent to 12 percent. The poll has
a 3 percentage point margin or error. ``A shorter, non-interrupted
campaign would be from the public's perspective a more informative
campaign,'' said Thomas Patterson of Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School of Government, co-director of the Vanishing Voter Project.

LET'S GO OUT ON A LIMB AND MAKE YOU A `REALITY TV' STAR  
</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call me crazy, but I think our culture has reached a point where
you and I could sweet-talk a network executive into producing a TV
show in which you do nothing but ordinary stuff like floss your
teeth, sort your sock drawer and schlep down your driveway to get
your newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   We'd both get mind-numbingly rich, and you wouldn't even have to
take off your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality TV,'' as such fare is known, is the latest thing.
Every few days, the folks who run TV announce plans for yet another
show featuring real people in really dumb or really dangerous
situations.
</P>
<P>
   You may have read about ``Survivor,'' one such show that's set
to debut on CBS at the end of May. Sixteen people have been dumped
on a remote island off the coast of Borneo. They're videotaped
nonstop as they try to get along by spearing fish, nibbling on bugs
and roasting rats over an open fire.
</P>
<P>
   Every few nights, the group gathers and casts a secret ballot to
send the weakest or most obnoxious person home. The 13-week series
is supposed to result in one survivor, who will walk, or maybe
crawl, away with $1 million. (I hope there won't be any product
tie-ins for this. I'd hate to order my daughter a ``Survivor''
Happy Meal at Chez Mac's and find a toy rat-on-a-spit inside.)
</P>
<P>
   Reality-based programs are big in Europe, which is steadily
sending them our way, apparently to make up for centuries of giving
us really great art.
</P>
<P>
   One show, called ``Big Brother,'' has been a hit in several
countries. Ten people are crammed into a house outfitted with TV
cameras _ there's no privacy, hence the name _ and every week,
viewers vote out the weakest or most obnoxious. The last occupant
gets $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In another show, ``Chains,'' four guys are chained at the legs
and ankles to a woman for five days. One day at a time, she unlocks
a fellow and sends him home. On Day 5, she claims her, uh, prize _
a date with the last guy and a box of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Other Euro-hits include ``The Bus'' (people ride on one for four
months) and ``In the Money'' (people do weird stuff like sit on an
egg and squawk like a chicken).
</P>
<P>
   ``My explanation is that our everyday life has become very
boring and nondramatic,'' Jens Jessen, an editor of a German
newsweekly, tells The New York Times. ``People are missing the real
life in their lives, so they want a substitute life.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, blessedly, some standards. Mike Darnell, a U.S.
producer of such shows, was planning one a while ago that was
called ``The World's Most Embarrassing Throw-up Moments.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose not to do it, although not for the reason you might
imagine, i.e. it's disgusting. According to The New York Times, he
scrapped the idea because he didn't have actual footage. Paying
actors to pretend to spew wasn't authentic enough.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, I had the dubious honor of sitting in an
emergency room with a crowd of tired, ailing, cranky people
watching _ in blinking, open-mouthed incomprehension _ a show
created by Darnell called ``When Animals Attack.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to ignore. The volume was cranked up, apparently in
compliance with an insurance company edict that emergency-room TVs
be set at ear-piecing levels so that people won't lollygag and
drive up claims.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the show was pretty simple: Clip after clip of
people getting their limbs ripped off or otherwise mauled by wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The first few incidents were unnerving. Those of us who were
able to hold our heads up glanced around the waiting room to see if
any of our fellow sufferers had an affliction similar to what we
were watching.
</P>
<P>
   When we determined they didn't, our eyes returned guiltlessly to
the TV for more. I didn't stick around long, but I suspect that
people eventually stopped flinching altogether and started saying,
``Shush'' to the nurse when she called their names.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of reality TV, I reckon. No matter how grim
your reality may be, there's some schmuck or schmuckette on the
picture tube who's meeting an even grimmer fate _ and probably
isn't even earning royalties for it.
</P>
<P>
   So, give me a call, and we'll begin work on your very own
reality show.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, do you happen to have a cat with a really nasty
disposition? Maybe we can work that into a few action scenes.

when the school year began, she couldn't speak a word in English.
She loves pink. On Sundays, she puts on a frilly dress and goes to
church. Just like Elian, she came from a tiny island country, a

IN NOTING PORTUGAL'S DISCOVERY OF BRAZIL, SOME SEE AN UGLY SIDE TO
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ It was envisioned as a feel-good
patriotic festival like the American Bicentennial. But the
Brazilian government should have known its plans to mark the 500th
anniversary of the country's discovery by the Portuguese were
doomed when an irate Indian chief marched into Congress earlier
this month, drew his bow and arrow and threatened to kill the
Senate president.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the yearlong commemoration got off to a bumpy start
Saturday, when military police used tear gas, night sticks and
rubber bullets to disperse 2,000 Indian-led demonstrators taking
part in a ``march of the excluded'' in Porto Seguro, focal point of
the official celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 people were arrested and at least a dozen injured
in the clash. And Monday the director of the government's Indian
affairs bureau resigned in protest over the government's stance in
the whole affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today was the same thing that took place when
Pedro Alvares Cabral arrived here,'' Nailton Pataxo, a leader of
the Ha Ha Hae tribe, said Saturday. ``He came, looted everything
and used violence against indigenous peoples.'' Pataxo's tribe has
been demanding the government return traditional lands now occupied
by ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral was the leader of the flotilla that on April 22, 1500,
sighted land in what is today the northern state of Bahia. The
first landing party went ashore the next day, led by a Polish Jew
who was the expedition's interpreter and whose languages included
Arabic and Hindi. On April 26, the rest of the crew disembarked at
the site now known as Santa Cruz Cabralia to erect a cross and
offer thanks in the first Roman Catholic Mass on Brazilian soil.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Brazil's 300,000 Indians have vowed to ``resist'' the
commemorations of those and other events scheduled for coming days,
and they are not the only ones complaining. Black groups have also
been marching to protest what they say is the marginal role to
which Afro-Brazilians have been relegated. And the Movement of the
Landless, a leftist peasant group, is marking the anniversary with
a campaign to occupy 500 ranches and farms it contends are lying
idle.
</P>
<P>
   As the self-styled ``country of the future,'' bursting with
outsized dreams and ambitions, Brazil is not in the habit of
scrutinizing its past. ``Every 15 years, Brazilians forget
everything that happened in the past 15 years,'' is how a political
satirist, Ivan Lessa, once put it.
</P>
<P>
   The 500th anniversary, however, has forced a process of
self-examination, and many Brazilians do not particularly seem to
like what they see. ``I am ashamed of Brazil,'' the country's most
famous personage, the soccer player Pele, said in a newspaper
interview this month, denouncing what he called ``the diversion of
government funds, thievery and dishonest politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the country has largely bounced back from the crisis that
threatened to sink the economy last year, glaring problems remain _
such as urban violence and the concentration of income and land
ownership in relatively few hands.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an identity crisis. ``Brazil is marking 500 years
without knowing what it is,'' said a banner headline that ran in
the daily Jornal do Brasil over the weekend, echoing what many
Brazilians are saying.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, over the past year, the best-seller lists here have been
dominated by books that cast a critical look at Brazilian society
and history. Ranging from biographies of Emperor Pedro II and other
leading historical figures to trenchant analyses of social
inequalities, such works have been snatched up in record numbers by
a public that in the past has not shown much of a commitment to
buying books.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Brazilians want to know why things have not turned out
well, why Brazil hasn't worked,'' said Eduardo Bueno, the author of
three recent books on early Brazilian history that have sold more
than 500,000 copies. ``Life is complicated, money is scarce, a
feeling of citizenship is lacking, and people sense that the answer
lies in history, that perhaps things went wrong from the very
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not the tone that the minister of tourism and
sports, Rafael Greca de Macedo, sought to impart when he wrested
control of the celebration away from the more intellectual types at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year. His goal, he has said,
was a series of events that would be ``attractive, cheap and have
popular appeal,'' thereby helping the country's 170 million people
build a positive self-image.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't view history with a perspective of remorse,'' Greca
said recently at a news conference here for foreign reporters about
the anniversary celebration. He described Brazil as ``a land of
ethnic peace,'' praising its remarkable cultural and racial
diversity and arguing that Indians have cause to be grateful for
``their inclusion in Brazilian society.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been complaints that the $20 million Greca has
spent, some of it on concerts and the construction of a soccer
museum, should have gone elsewhere. ``Brazil would be much better
off if the president had applied the money consumed in this insipid
commemoration to building 500 schools and 500 hospitals,'' Artur
Xexeo wrote in his column in Jornal do Brasil on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mother country on the other side of the Atlantic, a
similar divide has emerged. Although President Jorge Sampaio of
Portugal, who is here for this week's commemorations, has dismissed
complaints about the colonial period by arguing that ``we are
responsible only for our own time,'' Portuguese intellectuals have
taken a more negative view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery was not a dialogue of cultures, nor an encounter
of peoples,'' Jose Saramago, the novelist who won the Nobel Prize
for Literature in 1998, wrote recently. ``It was violence,
depredation and conquest.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from such declarations, the Roman Catholic Church
here is about to issue an unprecedented mea culpa. At a weeklong
conference scheduled to begin Wednesday, the country's more than
300 bishops are to sign a statement asking forgiveness of Indians
and blacks for sins the church committed against them during the
colonial period.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times the church's envoys were more allies of the
conquistadors than the Gospel,'' Msgr. Marcelo Carvalheira, head of
the committee that is drawing up the statement, said in explaining
the need for the document. ``The philosophy was conquer first and
then catechize.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the national mood so somber and contentious, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso has shown signs of increasing
exasperation. ``The 500th Anniversary festivities shouldn't be an
invitation to a wake,'' he said last week. In the face of the
protests, however, the president's itinerary in Bahia has been
reduced, and he is no longer scheduled to attend Wednesday's
commemorative Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who want to be millionaires but shudder to contemplate
facing a smirking Regis Philbin as he asks, ``Is that your final
answer?'' the publishers of ``Uncle Petros and Goldbach's
Conjecture,'' a novel by Apostolos Doxiadis offer a challenging
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The first person to submit a correct proof of Goldbach's
conjecture _ a well-known mathematical poser that has resisted
solution for more than 250 years _ before March 15, 2002, will
receive a check for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the money is the least of it. As the mathematician G.H.
Hardy wrote in ``A Mathematician's Apology,'' his unnecessary but
eloquent justification of a life devoted to pure mathematics,
``Mathematical fame, if you have the cash to pay for it, is one of
the soundest and steadiest of investments.'' Whoever manages to
prove Goldbach's conjecture within two years will have earned the
glory and the cash to pay for it too.
</P>
<P>
   Goldbach's conjecture is the type of thing that moved Hardy to
write his apology, for it is a problem (at least before the prize
was established) of no practical use whatsoever. It is simply a
beautiful conjecture about how numbers fit together, a guess about
the infinite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1742, a little-known mathematician named Christian Goldbach
wrote a letter to Leonhard Euler in which he speculated that every
even number greater than two could be expressed as the sum of two
prime numbers. Primes, of course, are whole numbers that are evenly
divisible by only one and themselves _ numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
and 13.
</P>
<P>
   The number 26 is not a prime because it is divisible by both 2
and 13. Goldbach's conjecture is easy to verify for small numbers:
24(equal)19(plus)5 and 72(equal)19(plus)53. Using computers and
clever algorithms, mathematicians have verified Goldbach's
conjecture to about 400 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   No reasonable mathematician seriously doubts the validity of
Goldbach's conjecture. But mathematical proof is not a matter of
what seems reasonable, but a product of pure reason. And so far,
Goldbach's little observation has resisted the reasoning power of
the greatest minds in mathematics. In the novel, Uncle Petros is
driven to despair and ultimately madness by his failure to prove
Goldbach's conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher Faber &AMP; Faber's offer of a prize for solving
Goldbach's conjecture is both a clever publicity stunt and in the
finest traditions of mathematics. When a problem bothered Dr. Paul
Erdos, the eccentric, itinerant mathematician, who died in 1996, he
often ``put a price on its head,'' offering a cash prize roughly
calibrated to its assumed difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos, who never had a permanent home or job was not a rich man,
so the prizes he offered were usually small, ranging from less than
a dollar to $10,000 for one problem he was convinced would never be
solved, and that still never has been. Even if someone had managed
to solve it, Erdos joked that it would probably take so long that
the solver would have been working for far less than minimum wage.
Mathematicians did not seem to care. Most of the checks Erdos wrote
for solved problems have been framed, not cashed.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians have often been wildly wrong in their evaluation
of the difficulty of problems. Knowing this, Erdos limited himself
to offering prizes that he could somehow pay in the event of an
unforeseen brainstorm. Before offering their prize, Faber &AMP; Faber
and Bloomsbury Books, the British and American publishers of
``Uncle Petros,'' secured insurance from Lloyd's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurers had to take a punt,'' said Tony Faber, managing
director of Faber &AMP; Faber. ``Although the chance of someone solving
it is low, we don't think it is zero.'' He would not reveal the
premium Lloyd's demanded, but would only say it was ``in the five
figures.''
</P>
<P>
   With insurance in hand, Faber would be thrilled if someone found
the proof, though his happiness would have little to do with the
advancement of mathematics. ``I'd love it,'' Faber said. ``It would
be great publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the mathematical puzzle that had the biggest
price on its head was one that was scribbled around 1637 by the
French mathematician Pierre Fermat in the margins of one of his
math books.

 UNDATED: math books.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition
which this margin is too narrow to contain,'' Fermat wrote, a
sentence that has driven and inspired generations of
mathematicians. For hundreds of years nobody had been able to find
a proof of Fermat's conjecture and had begun to suspect that he was
either mistaken or mischievous.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, a German industrialist and amateur mathematician named
Paul Wolfskehl established a prize of 10,000 marks _ roughly $1
million _ for a proof of Fermat's last theorem. Unfortunately, by
the time the Princeton mathematician Andrew Wiles had collected the
prize in 1997, inflation had eroded Wolfskehl's prize to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wiles had worked on the problem in secrecy, much as, in the
book, Doxiadis' Petros had worked on Goldbach's conjecture, for
more than seven years. He said he would wake up with Fermat's
theorem first thing in the morning and think about it all day.
``And,'' Wiles added, ``I would be thinking about it when I went to
sleep.'' In other words, true to Erdos' estimate, Wiles earned less
than minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Wiles was not trying to become a millionaire by
pursuing Fermat's theorem. Neither was the fictional Uncle Petros,
who as a youth was drawn to a seemingly simple problem that has
proven to be far more difficult to solve than Fermat's conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Petros' despair was due not only to his having wasted his
creative years _ for a mathematician, this means until about the
age of 30 _ on a proof, but also to the possibility that indeed no
proof of Goldbach's theorem was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians once believed that the truth or falsity of any
mathematical proposition could be decided by applying the rules of
mathematical logic. A proof may be very difficult, like that of
Fermat's theorem, but in principle, given enough genius and
dedication, it could be found.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1931 Dr. Kurt Godel proved that this belief was nothing
more than wishful thinking. Some propositions, Godel showed, can be
neither proved nor disproved within the confines of mathematical
logic. Uncle Petros, after devoting his life to Goldbach's
conjecture, finally lost hope when he believed that Goldbach's
conjecture might be undecidable. Perhaps he gave up too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Working mathematicians generally ignore the possibility that
proofs they are pursuing are impossible. For them, the techniques
invented and principles illuminated by pursuing the proof of a hard
problem are the real rewards. Fame is nice too. And $1 million
always comes in handy.

 &HT;    Patients demanding doctors' help for nontraditional treatments
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Felecia Dawson the problem was simultaneously
familiar and brand new.
</P>
<P>
   The fine-boned 40-year-old was experiencing the early symptoms
of menopause and contemplating the questions that the midlife
milestone presents to most women:
</P>
<P>
   Should she take hormone replacement therapy?
</P>
<P>
   Would herbs and nutritional supplements be an adequate
replacement?
</P>
<P>
   Could a plant-based diet cushion the stress ahead?
</P>
<P>
   The questions had more resonance than usual, because Dawson has
heard them asked so frequently. She is a doctor, an
obstetrician-gynecologist on the medical staff of Crawford Long
Hospital. Each week, patients ask for her help in exploring their
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting a lot more patients who are well-read, who don't
want to take estrogen, who want to know what their alternatives
are,'' said Dawson, who wears her long hair swept up in a regal
head wrap. ``Most doctors are hearing that these days, because our
patients are asking for it. But only some of us embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's parallel experiences, as a patient and as a doctor, sum
up a profound recent shift in health care. Consumer interest in
untraditional medicine is not a new phenomenon; what is new is
consumers' unwillingness to continue the exploration on their own.
Instead, they are insisting that doctors become knowledgeable about
alternatives too, so that they can offer advice and guidance when
patients need it.
</P>
<P>
   To a surprising degree, the medical establishment is responding.
The response springs from a mix of moral and market imperatives:
Consumers have proven they will do this with or without their
doctors, and physicians would prefer to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we must do this,'' said Dr. R. Paul Crank, Jr.,
director of medical affairs for DeKalb Medical Center, which has
opened a program combining conventional medicine and alternatives.
``It is not an optional thing. Our community is out there
experimenting with anything they can find. ''
</P>
<P>
   It has been seven years since a national survey by Harvard
Medical School researchers, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, first disclosed that up to one in three adults used
alternative therapies. The trend has only increased since.
</P>
<P>
   In an update, released recently in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, the same researchers have found that 42
percent of U.S. adults now make use of unconventional practices
that are largely not taught in medical schools, such as
acupuncture, herbs, chiropractic and meditation. In 1997, the
researchers found, American adults made 60 percent more visits to
alternative medicine providers than they did to doctors. The total
amount that health-care consumers spent that year on alternative
care, without hope of reimbursement, was $27 billion _ the same
amount that consumers spent, in the same year, to see their
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show Americans' eagerness for health care that is
more holistic, individual and self-directed. But they also point to
some troubling trends: Two-thirds of those who use alternative
therapies are still not talking to their doctors about it, the
Harvard researchers found. And as a result, 15 million adults are
believed to be taking both prescription drugs and natural remedies
without medical supervision, unwittingly risking dangerous
cross-reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The patients who do disclose their use of alternatives are
forcing a new kind of collaboration into their encounters with
doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My patients would come in and say, `I am trying this herb,
what do you think about it?''' Dawson said. ``And I wouldn't be
able to say I knew very much about it. But I was open to learning
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to both patients' demands and doctors' need to
anticipate them, an industry has sprung up. Several peer-reviewed
journals devoted to alternative medicine have begun publishing, as
well as at least two newsletters focused on its business aspects.
Companies that market medical databases and patient-education
booklets have created companion products that supply information on
unconventional practices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, continuing-education courses that acquaint health
professionals with the basics of alternative medicine are offered
during most months of the year in most parts of the country. One of
the most respected such courses, a weeklong symposium hosted by
Harvard Medical School each March, this year drew more than 500
participants, more than 200 of them physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson was one of the attendees. So were a plastic surgeon from
Duluth, Ga., an internist from Decatur,Ga., an insurance executive
from Atlanta and the chief executive officers of DeKalb and
Gwinnett Medical Centers.
</P>
<P>
   The range of specialties suggests how complementary medicine is
becoming woven into mainstream health care. For Dawson, a
willingness to combine traditional and alternative methods has
produced a holistically oriented practice where nurses wear purple,
a fountain bubbles next to her computer, and patients seeking
advice for fibroid tumors are as likely to hear about exercise and
soy products as surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of tailor things to the patient,'' she said. ``There
are patients who are very much into drugs and surgery and not
really open to alternatives, and then there are people who don't
want traditional anything. I have patients who want any way to
avoid the knife _ and then I have 55-year-old ladies who come in
with a long list of the drugs they are taking, and that is the only
thing they know.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Zwiren, co-owner of Duluth's Prima Center for
Plastic Surgery, began educating himself on alternatives 10 years
ago when he realized how many of his patients had begun to take
them. His interest quickened last fall, after the American Society
of Anesthesiologists published a warning that common herbs
including kava, gingko, garlic and St. John's wort were interacting
negatively with sedatives or increasing blood loss in surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Now he counsels clients intensively on nutrition, and recommends
pineapple extract and homeopathic arnica to reduce bruising after
surgery. But he also won't operate unless patients have avoided
certain herbal products for at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When patients see I am interested, they tell me a lot of the
things they are doing,'' Zwiren said. ``Most of them are amazed I
would ask.''
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb Medical Center hopes that soon each of its doctors will
ask patients about alternatives _ and that all of its patients will
feel comfortable enough to volunteer their experiences. The Decatur
institution has made a wholesale commitment to what it dubs
``integrative medicine.'' It has sent medical personnel and
adminstrators for training, created its own in-house continuing
medical education courses, held open meetings for the community,
and hired new staff with expertise in herbs, bodywork and
relaxation therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is based in the medical facility's 15-year-old
Wellness Center, which now houses the new program in integrative
medicine. There is also an Integrative Medicine Advisory Committee,
headed by Dr. Eldred Taylor, and a proposal on the books to
consider making integrative medicine a full-fledged hospital
department, analogous to cardiology or pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to go out on a limb,'' said Taylor, an
ob/gyn. ``We're actually trying to be very conservative, paying
attention to what the National Institutes of Health says can be
substantiated. But when you have places like Sloan-Kettering and
Stanford and Harvard leading the way, it is not that hard to follow
along.''
</P>
<P>
   To enter the DeKalb program, modeled on one created by
alternative-medical celebrity Andrew Weil at the University of
Arizona, patients fill out a lengthy questionnaire. A team of
staff, headed by Taylor, reviews the information and suggests a
program of treatment. It is presented to the patient at a second
conference; to ensure collaboration, the patient can accept or
reject any recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the program has been welcomed by patients, it may prove
not to be a major money-maker, said Jack Gerlach, DeKalb's CEO.
Insurance companies reimburse for alternative treatments only under
certain conditions, and DeKalb shares the cash that patients pay
for services with its practitioners in a 60-40 split.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the suspicion that because hospitals can't collect on
hospital bills anymore, we have found a whole new revenue source,''
he said. ``That is not the reason we are doing this. Frankly, I'm
not sure the revenue is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital has cast the new effort as a means of tying
together its Wellness Center and its medical staff, and of ensuring
that its health-care providers are alert to the whole range of
things that patients might be doing. Some of the doctors have been
dubious, Gerlach admitted, but the response from patients has
compensated for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep hearing from the community that they are glad a
hospital has gotten into this business,'' said Holly Wolfe, a nurse
who directs the Wellness Center. ``They didn't know where to go or
how to choose. But they trust that, in a hospital-based program, we
will have made sure this is safe and we will deliver it with high
standards.''

<P>
   Tornadoes, hurricanes and floods are the stuff of television
drama; they make people sit up and take notice. Not so with
drought. It is a far more subtle weather catastrophe that ``sneaks
up on you'' and consequently commands little awe or respect, says
Dr. Donald A. Wilhite, a Nebraska climatologist who is an expert on
the subject. He calls it the Rodney Dangerfield of natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might not stir the emotions, in an average year
drought is responsible for about as much economic damage as floods
and hurricanes combined. Nor is it a rare phenomenon, as many
people erroneously believe. Instead, it is a persistent and
permanent feature of weather and climate, severely affecting some
part of the United States almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that in 2000, much of the country's midsection and a
broad swath of its southern tier from Arizona to Florida _ a third
to half the territory of the contiguous 48 states in all _ is
already experiencing a moderate to severe drought with the peak
months for drought still ahead. If long-range forecasts of
below-normal rainfall and above-normal temperatures are accurate,
conditions may well get worse.
</P>
<P>
   As a new growing season begins in the Iowa-Nebraska-Illinois
breadbasket, severe deficiencies of soil moisture are creating a
potential new threat to farmers' chronically sagging fortunes.
Around the Great Lakes, the water level in streams and rivers is
approaching all-time lows, as are the lakes themselves; not since
1965 have Lakes Michigan and Huron been so low. The prospect looms
of huge financial losses in agriculture and recreation. And as
always, drought raises the risk of wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   So experts are plumbing the past and investigating today's
changing climate as part of an effort to understand drought better
and to gauge whether longer and more severe droughts may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, could another Dust Bowl or an even worse drought
lie in the nation's future? Based on scientists' analyses of tree
rings, ancient soils and other evidence, the answer is almost
certainly yes. Many experts believe that with the world's climate
warming as it is, droughts will become more frequent and severe.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from that, and regardless of whether humans are
responsible for global warming, there is plenty of evidence that
big, damaging droughts are inevitable. The only question is when
they will come.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 federal study found that droughts as widespread and
severe as that of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, when 65 percent of
the country was affected at the drought's peak in 1934, have
occurred once or twice a century over the last 300 to 400 years. A
decade-long drought, the study found, occurs about once every 500
years.
</P>
<P>
   More recent analyses of tree-ring data have identified a
16th-century megadrought that affected much of the continent for
years, far outstripping any drought of the 20th century in
persistence and severity. It was during this drought that the first
English colony in America, at Roanoke Island in North Carolina,
disappeared, and experts now believe the drought is what killed it
off.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Dr. David W. Stahle, a tree-ring analyst at the
University of Arkansas, Dr. Edward R. Cook, an analyst of ancient
climates at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University, and six colleagues, appeared in the March 21 issue of
Eos, a scientific publication of the American Geophysical Union.
</P>
<P>
   Megadroughts lasting a century or two are known to have occurred
in what is now California over the last 3,500 years. Droughts of
similar severity have also been implicated in the downfall of the
empire of the Maya in Central America a millennium ago; the
Akkadian empire (the world's first) in Mesopotamia 4,200 years ago
(that drought lasted 300 years) and several pre-Inca cultures in
South America.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not take a megadrought to bring disaster, and the
emerging record of past dry spells contains several smaller ones
that would surely devastate much of the United States if they
materialized again. In the 20th century, major droughts in the
1950s and in 1988 were second only to the Dust Bowl. The tree-ring
studies showed that comparable droughts materialized in the 1750s,
1820s, 1850s and 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   The worst drought in recent years came in the summer of 1988,
when a combination of intense heat and widespread moisture
deficiency baked more than a third of the country for weeks. It
destroyed at least half the crops on the Great Plains, lowered
water levels in the Mississippi River so much that barges ran
aground and created the conditions for a summer-long run of forest
fires in the West. The most famous engulfed great swatches of
Yellowstone National Park in that area's biggest conflagration in
at least 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes it abundantly clear that drought is a standard
feature of climate, not an exception to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   But disaster planners often do not see it that way, and
consequently pay more attention to other threats like floods, says
Wilhite, who directs the National Drought Mitigation Center, a
research and planning organization at the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, one reason may be that drought is rarely a cause
of death or destruction of buildings, although drought-associated
heat waves often send mortality temporarily skyrocketing. (Summer
heat makes drought worse by speeding evaporation of moisture; and
when there is no more moisture to evaporate, the sun's energy goes
entirely into heating the land, which in turn makes the air above
it even hotter.)
</P>
<P>
   Another possible reason for a relative lack of urgency about
drought is that it is a creeping phenomenon. ``It's hard to know
when you're in a drought,'' Wilhite said. ``When do you ring the
bell?'' As things stand now, he said, people ``essentially don't
become aware of drought and the dimensions of its impact until
they're in the middle of it; at that point, there's not a lot you
can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by Wilhite's organization, drought
costs the nation $6 billion to $8 billion a year on average,
compared with $2.4 billion for floods and $1.2 billion to $4.8
billion for hurricanes. The worst droughts easily outstrip the
worst floods and hurricanes; for instance, the 1988 drought exacted
a toll of about $40 billion, while the Mississippi Valley floods of
1993, the worst of the century, cost $28 billion at most, and
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the most expensive on record, caused $25
billion to $33 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Damages might be reduced by better planning, Wilhite said. For
example, farmers might switch to drought-resistant crops, and water
conservation measures could be planned before a drought occurred
instead of in a crisis.

 &HT;    O debut shows power of Oprah
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never underestimate the power of Oprah. The million-copy
launching of TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey's new magazine, O
($2.95), is a resounding success. It debuted Wednesday and was sold
out at a number of metro Atlanta outlets by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 200 copies for all of our stores,'' says Chapter 11's
Brian Lapidus, ``and they're all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The story was the same at Joe Muggs on Peachtree Road, where
customers snapped up 250 copies in four hours Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were buying them four and five at a time,'' says
manager Awet Gebrehiwot. ``It was amazing.'' In comparison, she
adds, the only other magazine that sold nearly as well recently was
George magazine after John F. Kennedy Jr. died.
</P>
<P>
   Gebrehiwot admits she was skeptical about the content of O, the
Oprah Magazine, when it arrived. ``But when I had time to read it,
I was really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A tale of two covers: As expected, Time ($3.50) and Newsweek
($3.50) offer saturation coverage of the Elian Gonzalez raid in
Miami and the Cuban boy's reunion with his father. What's
interesting is the choice of pictures for the covers. Time has a
smiling photo of Elian reunited with his father, with a smaller
inset of the menacing looking armed federal agent confronting Elian
and Donato Dalrymple, his fisherman-rescuer, as they hide in a
closet at Lazaro Gonzalez's home. Newsweek opted for a cover photo
of a female agent carrying the terrified child out the door. An
unfortunate red-eye effect from the flash creates a demonic
appearance. A much smaller picture of a smiling Elian with his
father is inset.
</P>
<P>
   In both magazines, child psychology experts agree that Elian
needs to spend some time with his father _ without disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Date destinations: Tired of the same old dinner-and-a-movie
dates? Check out the May issue of Atlanta ($3.50) for 40
suggestions for romantic outings. Recommendations range from climbs
up Stone Mountain and Amicalola Falls to relatively inexpensive
meals by chefs-in-training at the Art Institute of Atlanta's School
of Culinary Arts. Other articles of interest include Candice Dyer's
outing with a pack of bloodhounds and Scott Freeman's tribute to
Andruw Jones' athletic artistry in center field.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coming attractions: Summer's just around the corner, and
Hollywood is hoping it'll be a hot one at the box office.
Entertainment Weekly ($3.50) previews 135 of the new movies coming
soon to a theater near you and predicts that the winners will
include ``Battlefield Earth'' with John Travolta, ``X-Men'' with
Patrick Stewart and Halle Berry, ``Gladiator'' with Russell Crowe,
``Mission: Impossible 2'' starring Tom Cruise and ``The Perfect
Storm'' with George Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vietnam revisited: People ($2.99) examines the fallout from
the Vietnam War 25 years after the fall of Saigon and updates what
happened to some of the people involved. Sen. John McCain talks
about his experience as a prisoner of war and notes that, although
he has made his peace with Vietnam, ``There are Vietnamese whom I
will never be able to forgive for their cruelty to me.'' Meanwhile,
Georgia native Chuck Searcy has devoted his life to helping
disabled Vietnamese children through his Vietnam Veterans of
America Foundation. ``I needed to mend not a physical injury but a
psychological wound _ the pain over what we had done in Vietnam,''
Searcy says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Author Philip Caputo ventures into Kenya's Tsavo
National Park for a safari on foot to photograph lions and write
about his experiences for National Geographic Adventure ($3.95) .
Tsavo means ``place of slaughter,'' Caputo notes, and the name is
fitting: A century ago, two lions killed and ate 140 people in the
area. Working as a team, the animals sneaked into camps at night
and snatched the men from their tents. ... After destroying most of
its competition, Maxim ($3.99) is fatter than ever, with 216 pages
of glossy ads and glossy photo spreads of glossy women. One
interesting feature is a guide to fantasy camps where you can shoot
hoops with Michael Jordan or go hunting with Ted Nugent.

 UNDATED: a crisis.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soil management and tillage practices have improved since the
Dust Bowl days, when vast expanses of topsoil simply dried up and
blew away, and to some extent the improvements might ease the
impact of a comparable drought today, he said. But ``some things
you can't do anything about,'' he said, including depletion of
aquifers and the dropping of water levels in reservoirs, lakes,
rivers and streams.
</P>
<P>
   What does the future hold?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 25 years, the earth's average surface temperature
has risen at a rate equal to about 3.5 degrees per century.
Mainstream scientists believe it will continue to rise at that rate
in the 21st century if emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial
gases like carbon dioxide are not reduced.
</P>
<P>
   A warming atmosphere has two effects related to precipitation,
experts say: it causes more moisture to evaporate from the oceans
and fresh waters, thus producing heavier rains. Scientists at the
National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., have detected a
clear trend in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   But when it does not rain for a long time, a warmer atmosphere
also intensifies drought by making more moisture evaporate from the
land, faster. No trend toward increased drought has been detected
over the last century, said Dr. David R. Easterling, a researcher
at the Climatic Data Center. But he said that eventually, in the
interior of the continent, drought could win out over increasing
precipitation if the atmosphere warmed enough.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming could also affect the size and frequency of
forest fires. A recent study of charcoal layers in Yellowstone,
reflecting the last 17,000 years of fire history there, found that
the number of fires peaked before 7,000 years ago, a time when
summers were warmer than now.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that while fires would become more frequent
in a warmer climate, they would also become smaller because less
fuel, in the form of dead trees and forest litter, would have a
chance to build up, said Dr. Cathy Whitlock, a geographer at the
University of Oregon who was a co-author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The other authors, also at Oregon, were Dr. Sarah H. Millspaugh
and Dr. Patrick J. Bartlein. The paper appeared in March in the
journal Geology.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime expert on wildfire in the West, Dr. William Romme of
Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., said the study suggested that
``if the warming trend over the last century continues, as it
appears it will, we can expect some really dramatic changes in fire
behavior.'' It is likely, he said, that more frequent fires will
allow less fuel to build up, in time making big conflagrations like
that of 1988 less probable.
</P>
<P>
   As for drought itself, some scientists believe, the frequency
and severity of future dry spells could increase as a result of
natural, periodic oscillations in Pacific Ocean surface
temperatures on a scale of decades. The Stahle-Cook paper in Eos
suggests that the 16th-century megadrought could have been caused
by a prolonged cooling phase in some areas of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Back-and-forth oscillations in the Pacific temperatures alter
atmospheric circulation patterns that deliver moisture to North
America. One phase, which favors development of the phenomenon
known as La Nina, is associated with drought in much of the United
States. That phase has prevailed for the last two years _ La Nina
years _ and some scientists predict that it will predominate in the
decades just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, Easterling said, the big drought of 1988 was
``pretty well tied'' to La Nina. So was last summer's severe
drought in the Middle Atlantic region and Northeast, many
scientists believe. And so is this year's developing drought across
the southern tier and midsection.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the drought of 2000 has been most clearly manifest in
the Great Lakes region. A combination of lower precipitation and
high temperatures over the last three years, coupled with
relatively little snow, has reduced stream flows in the region to
well below normal.
</P>
<P>
   In the lakes themselves, there has been ``an unprecedented
drop'' in water levels over the last two to three years, said Dr.
Frank H. Quinn, senior research hydrologist for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Great Lakes Environmental
Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. Lakes Huron and Michigan,
which are really one body of water, have dropped about three feet,
the biggest such drop in 140 years of record keeping, ending a
30-year run of above-average levels.
</P>
<P>
   This has some benefits: ``We will have the best beaches in 35
years and considerably less erosion,'' Quinn said. But in a region
whose economy is in so many ways tied to the lakes, he said, there
will also be large negative effects: the region's billion-dollar
water recreation industry is likely to be hit hard, as many marinas
no longer have enough water to hold boats. Lake freighters will not
be able to load to full capacity. Less forceful water flows will
reduce hydropower production downstream of the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The drought has not yet really pinched the mid-continent
agricultural regions, since the growing season has not begun,
Wilhite said. Nor have the high evaporation levels of late spring
and summer set in, not to mention the normal summertime increase in
demand for water. The squeeze is likely to come, Wilhite said, if
and when long-range forecasts of abnormal warmth and dryness
materialize in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent observations show that much of the southern tier
from Arizona to Florida is also in a severe drought, but the latest
forecasts call for normal rainfall in most of that swath over the
next three months.
</P>
<P>
   But the forecasts can and do change from month to month. So for
those in the dry regions, it is a time to prepare, watch and wait.

OFF THE WALL: CONCRETE TROUBLES IMPERIL ABSTRACT MURAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla., N.Y., Texas)  By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In 1984, artist David Novros found a public space for
one of his huge fresco murals in the old federal courthouse here.
With a $52,000 commission from the General Services Administration,
he spent five months painting about 6,300 square feet of walls and
arched ceilings in the two stories around an interior patio.
</P>
<P>
   It is by far the largest of Novros' works, one in which he tried
to depict in abstract shapes and light-to-dark colors the balancing
required in dispensing justice. But today he is trying to save his
``Frescoes in the Courtyard'' from destruction by the GSA in a
dispute that pits the artist and his supporters against historic
preservationists who want to restore the old courthouse to its
original condition.
</P>
<P>
   Novros, 58, an abstract painter in New York whose career started
in the late 1960s, got the government commission in Miami under
General Services' Art in Architecture program, which allocates 1
percent of a building's budget to art. GSA officials now say that
someone at the agency erred in commissioning the mural _ and in
allowing Novros to retouch it in 1987 _ without first subjecting it
to review under the National Historic Preservation Act. The old
courthouse building at the David W. Dyer Federal Building and U.S.
Courthouse complex in downtown Miami is on the National Register of
Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Both the deteriorating building and the mural are in need of
restoration. But Robert A. Peck, commissioner of the public
buildings service for the agency, said that preservation advisers
had told him that the mural would not pass the historical review
required in order to have it restored.
</P>
<P>
   So officials plan to restore the building and destroy the mural
sometime this year, either by removing the plaster or painting over
the mural.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Novros and his supporters, Carolyn A. Dortch, a
GSA regional administrator, said that restoring the mural ``would
involve further alterations to the character-defining features and
spaces of the building'' that would be strongly opposed by historic
preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Peck said in a telephone interview: ``This is not about somebody
that doesn't like David Novros' work; that's not it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Rudy Giuliani taking offense,'' he said, referring to
a dispute last year between New York City's mayor and the Brooklyn
Museum of Art over a painting in its ``Sensation'' show. ``I happen
to like his work.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone likes the mural, and the artist, who has
created many works using a fresco technique that dates back to the
early Renaissance, contends that the decision has more to do with
political pressure than with historic preservation. As he enlists
support from art institutions, his opponents, among them local
lawyers and judges, argue that ``Frescoes in the Courtyard'' is at
odds with the architecture of the courthouse, which was built in
1933 in the Mediterranean revival style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frescoes in the Courtyard'' was controversial from the start.
In an October 1984 article, which Novros keeps, The National
Enquirer wrote about it under the headline ``Painting, Painting on
the Wall _ Ugliest Tax Waste of Them All!'' It quoted courthouse
employees who complained that the modern work clashed with its
historical setting.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mural's foes include U.S. District Judge Lenore C.
Nesbitt, who is overseeing the courthouse restoration. In a
telephone interview, Nesbitt said the mural's ``foreboding'' colors
clashed with the serenity of the courtyard and that the piece
itself was not in keeping with the building's ``original style and
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other critics want to replace Novros' reds, blues and
blacks with what they say is a more historically accurate color:
solid cocoa beige.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not on a vendetta,'' she said. ``We're on a program to
restore the courtyard, and the frescoes are inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Novros calls the planned destruction ``governmental
vandalism'' and a breach of his First Amendment rights. He has
declined a GSA offer for a new commission in another courthouse
building in the same complex. Agency officials have in turn
rejected the artist's suggestion that the frescoes be coated with a
varnishlike membrane to protect them before they are painted over.
The paint could later be removed with a solvent without damage to
the mural.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Novros said he would far prefer to have the painting
restored and ``respected.'' ``If they're not going to do that, I'd
like them to say publicly why they're doing this,'' he said. ``The
dispute is really between the government and the general public. We
can't get a public hearing on the issue. They want it destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Novros has drawn support from a variety of institutions. Peter
Boswell, senior curator at the Miami Art Museum, called the artwork
``a very good match with the building'' and worth saving. ``It's a
good piece,'' Boswell said. ``He was very faithful to the tradition
of building ornament as it goes back to the Renaissance and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art
in New York, has offered to help rally support to save the mural.
Chief Federal Judge Charles P. Sifton &UR;  &LR; of the Eastern district of
New York wrote to the GSA calling the mural's ``magnificent.''
Sifton asked that the decision be reconsidered, saying that it
could have a ``devastating impact'' on the art program for
courthouses around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spring, director of the Miami-Dade County Department of
Cultural Affairs, is trying to mediate. He said that while some
wanted the building restored to its original condition, others were
concerned ``about what that says about the community _ removing an
artwork from a public place by a well-respected artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Court officials have so far ignored his proposal to hold a
public meeting on the issue and provide, at the county's expense, a
fine arts conservator who would help find a way to save the fresco.
Spring said he was now looking for a film crew to ``at least ensure
some record of what David's work in that courtyard was.''

</P>
<P>
   Novros' murals can be seen in other parts of the country,
including one in Houston, which remains at the Museum of Fine Arts.
He recently had a solo show of abstractions made of large sheets of
copper at the Earl McGrath gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Novros, who lives in SoHo with his wife, Joanna Pousette-Dart,
also a painter, and their 15-year-old son, Jason, describes wall
painting as an important alternative for artists. It ``doesn't

   Peck, the GSA commissioner, said that there were advocates of
the mural even within his agency. But, while difficult, his
decision is final, he said.
</P>

about what to do with the courtyard,'' he said. ``The mural is a
modernist mural, and in both style and color it's not compatible
with the courtyard.''

LOOKING FOR CROPS THAT CLONE THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif.)  (The Science Times) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Dr. Wayne W. Hanna has been searching for it for nearly 20
years. Every year or two, he breeds new millet plants and combs the
fields for one with the required characteristics. ``We've searched
thousands of plants to find the one we want,'' said Hanna, a
research geneticist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
Tifton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has not found it. Nor has anyone else found what a
small but growing number of pursuers describe as the holy grail of
agriculture. But when they do find it, Hanna says, it will promise
a ``revolution'' in world food production.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is a plant that will reproduce asexually, so that its
seeds will grow into exact genetic copies, or clones, of the
parent.
</P>
<P>
   This process, called apomixis, occurs naturally in hundreds of
plants, including dandelions, crab apples, citrus, blackberries and
the grass used on many lawns.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, farmers can achieve asexual reproduction by
grafting, as is done with grape vines, or by vegetative
propagation, as when a piece of potato is planted and grows into a
new plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's major food grains do not reproduce asexually. If
they could, some scientists say, it would greatly simplify crop
breeding. A high-yielding corn, wheat or rice plant could reproduce
itself unchanged for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this occurs, the ramifications could well dwarf the green
revolution in terms of its impact,'' said Dr. David M. Stelly, a
professor of soil and crop sciences at Texas A&AMP;M University, who
has dubbed this the ``asexual revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But apomixis could also represent a threat to the seed
companies, changing the balance of power between the companies and
farmers. It is thus being swept up in the worldwide controversy
over agricultural biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Right now high yields are obtained by the use of hybrids, which
are crosses between two different varieties. But hybrids, which
display a somewhat mysterious ``hybrid vigor,'' take years of
painstaking, costly breeding to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because crops reproduce sexually, the children of
hybrids vary in their characteristics and generally do not retain
the high yield of the parent. So farmers cannot save the seed from
one year's crop to plant the next, but must buy new seeds every
year, providing seed companies with continuing income.
</P>
<P>
   Apomixis would greatly simplify development of hybrids, putting
them within reach of developing countries, which most need the
higher food output but which now generally cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
   With apomictic hybrids, seed could be saved and planted the next
year without loss of yield. And a farmer obtaining a few such seeds
could reproduce and multiply them, just as it is possible to make
numerous perfect copies of a software program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way for local farmers to take control of their
seeds,'' said Dr. Michael Freeling, a professor of genetics at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``It puts the seed companies
out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, apomixis is being championed by some in the developing
world as the antidote to the controversial ``terminator''
technology, an experimental method of making plants infertile so
that farmers have to buy new seeds every year. ``It's the
challenger to the terminator technology,'' said Dr. Stephen L.
Goldman, a professor of biology at the University of Toledo, who is
working to create apomictic corn. ``It has enormous political
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, worried that a big seed company could patent apomixis
technology and deny access to the rest of the world, apomixis
researchers meeting in Bellagio, Italy, in 1998 issued a
declaration calling for ``broad and equitable access to plant
biotechnologies, especially apomixis technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tony Cavalieri, director of research for Pioneer Hi-Bred
International, the United States' largest seed company, played down
the threat to seed companies. ``Most of the people who buy our
seeds are interested in the newest hybrids,'' he said. ``They're
not interested in planting the same hybrids for 20 years.'' Indeed,
he and others said, apomixis could help seed companies by speeding
up plant breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry that apomixis technology could lead to more
uniformity in crops, which would make them more susceptible to
being wiped out by a disease or pest. But others counter that
because of the ease of creating hybrids with apomixis, crop
variability could actually be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, seed companies viewed apomixis as a distant and
uncertain prospect, but now they are starting to take notice, in
part because sophisticated gene-hunting technologies might finally
allow scientists to understand how the process works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it looks more approachable,'' said Cavalieri of Pioneer.
While not doing apomixis research on its own, his company is
providing money and technology for Hanna's work in Georgia and for
a project in Mexico that is trying to develop apomictic corn.
</P>
<P>
   The program in Mexico, which is based at the International Maize
and Wheat Improvement Center, is also sponsored by Novartis, the
Swiss drug and seed company; the French government; and Groupe
Limagrain, a French seed company.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are different forms of apomixis and the same plant can
exhibit both sexual and asexual reproduction. In sexual
reproduction, the female egg and the male sperm cell each contain
half a set of chromosomes, so when they combine, the embryo has a
full set, half from the father and half from the mother.
</P>
<P>
   With apomictic plants, the embryo, which is inside the seed,
contains a full set of chromosomes from the mother.
</P>
<P>
   So far, scientists have tried to make apomictic crops mainly
through conventional breeding. Hanna crossed pearl millet, a crop
used mostly for cattle in the United States but grown for human
food in Africa and India, with a wild relative that is naturally
apomictic. (Although the wild relative does not need a partner to
reproduce, its pollen can be used to fertilize a sexually
reproducing plant.)
</P>
<P>
   The plants formed by such a cross were half millet and half wild
relative, and some of them were apomictic. Hanna chose the
apomictic ones, crossed them again with pearl millet, and again
selected the apomictic ones. With each repeat of this process, the
offspring become more like the crop and less like the wild relative
_ except that they remain apomictic.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, was the theory. But after eight generations,
Hanna has found that the offspring so far do not produce enough
seeds to make them suitable as a commercial crop.
</P>
<P>
   Similar slow progress has occurred at the project in Mexico,
where scientists started by crossing corn with tripsacum, a wild
relative that was naturally apomictic. But after several
generations, the offspring still had too many of the
characteristics of the wild relative to make a viable crop.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-breeding approach is based on the assumption that
apomixis is controlled by a single gene or a group of genes that
are inherited together. Dr. Yves Savidan, the director of the
international maize and wheat center project, and Dr. Peggy
Ozias-Akins, the gene scientist working with Hanna, say that
inheritance patterns and gene mapping show this to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   But some other scientists believe apomixis is controlled by many
genes on different chromosomes, which could explain why the cross
breeding approach has not worked yet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John G. Carman, a professor of plant genetics at Utah State
University, is trying to achieve apomixis by crossing two plant
varieties, neither of which is apomictic by itself. One of the
plants develops its egg earlier in the process of flower bud
development than the other.
</P>
<P>
   Carman hopes that the offspring of such a mating will get
confusing signals about when to develop the egg, with the result
that the plant will skip egg formation and produce an embryo with a
full set of maternal chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed this was how apomicts evolved during the ice
age, when great movements of ice and earth brought together plants
from different latitudes with different development times.
</P>
<P>
   Carman, who has had some limited success with this approach, has
formed a company, F1 Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists say the best chance for success now lies in
the use of modern gene-sequencing and gene-mapping techniques to
find the gene or genes responsible for apomixis, and then
transferring them to crops.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Australia and Switzerland and at Berkeley are
using chemicals or radiation to induce mutations in arabidopsis, a
model plant used in research.
</P>
<P>
   If a mutation causes the sexually producing plant to turn
apomictic, the gene can be fished out since arabidopsis is having
its genome sequenced. Dr. Robert L. Fischer, a professor of plant
and microbial biology at Berkeley, has already found one gene that
imparts a trait associated with apomixis.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists interviewed said it would take at least five
years to produce apomictic crops and some said it could be more
than 10.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hope springs eternal, like the millet in Hanna's field.
``It's been a lifelong quest,'' said Hanna, who next year will
plant 10,000 to 15,000 new plants, the ninth generation of his back
crosses. He will search again for specimens that are apomictic but
otherwise enough like millet to become a commercial crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be next year,'' he said. ``It could be a plant in
there.''

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California's free-for-all primary election system
that allows voters to choose candidates without regard to party
affiliation came under fire Monday at the U.S. Supreme Court, where
justices questioned the law's constitutionality and its impact on
fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called the California system
``tremendously intrusive'' on the rights of political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very essence of the party's right is to define its own
message and decide its own candidates,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The California system allows any primary election voter _
whether registered as a Democrat, a Republican, a third-party
member or an independent _ to vote for the nomination of any
candidate from any party for any race.Justice Antonin Scalia
complained that the California system allows ``people with little
or no association with a party'' to decide that party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to see why a state should take away a party's
right to elect whom it wants to elect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the court strikes down the law, California _ along with
Washington state, Alaska and Louisiana which have similar systems _
could be forced to change the way they conduct their primaries. The
court's decision is expected by late June.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 198, giving the
state a so-called ``blanket'' primary, which allows voters to cast
ballots in a primary to select any candidate, regardless of the
voters' political registration.California adopted the
single-ballot, blanket form of primary to give the state's 1.6
million independent voters their first opportunity to vote in what
had been a ``closed'' primary limited to party members.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has used the blanket primary since 1935. Alaska
has had it in most elections since 1947. Louisiana has a variation.
The blanket primary gives voters more choices than the ``open''
primary used in 20 states. In an open primary, a voter can request
a party's primary election ballot at the polls without previously
registering in that party. The voter then is limited to voting only
in the primary that the voter selected. Thirteen states use closed
primaries where only registered party members can obtain their
party's ballot. Primaries in 13 other states are ``semi-closed,''
limiting participation to a party's members and to independents.The
state's Democratic, Republican, Libertarian and Peace &AMP; Freedom
parties challenged the California blanket primary system. They
argued that the system violates their First Amendment right of
``freedom of association.'' The national Democratic and Republican
parties filed briefs supporting that contention. In 1997, a federal
district court ruled that the blanket primary was constitutional.
U.S. District Judge David Levi said that while the system was an
``intrusion on a party's traditional right to select its own
candidates,'' the burden on the parties was not enough of a
``significant burden'' to justify striking down the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, thinking
so highly of Levi's ruling that is simply adopted his opinion ``as
the opinion of our court.''
</P>
<P>
   In his arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, George Waters, a
Sacramento, Calif., lawyer representing the four political parties,
said California's system is ``a wholesale assault'' on the parties'
ability ``to choose a standard bearer who best represents their
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people affiliated with a party to choose their
own candidates,'' he told the court.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Gede, special assistant attorney general for
California, defended the state's primary system, arguing that a
primary election ``belongs to the voters,'' not to the various
political parties. He also noted that the blanket system is what
``the voters want,'' referring to the fact that the system was
imposed by a voter referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Among the supporters of the blanket primary system are Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, both
of whom broke with their parties in filing friend-of-the-court
briefs defending Proposition 198. They argued that the blanket
primary helps mavericks and moderates win nominations against
hard-core partisans by attracting ``crossover'' and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who relied heavily on Democrats and independents in his
unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination this
year, finished third in California's presidential primary behind
Democratic candidate Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.Gede
told the high court that polls showed the blanket system had
``re-energized voters.'' He said voter turnout for last month's
presidential primary in California was 52 percent, the highest in a
presidential year since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the blanket primary infringes ``to a
degree'' on a party's right to association, Cede argued that the
state has an ``over-riding interest'' to enhance the ``democratic
nature of the election process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gede scarcely finished his opening statement before being hit by
a barrage of critical questions and comments from the justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it up to the voters to tell the parties who they should
elect?'' asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter chipped in: ``Under your system, the
unaffiliated voters will change the message of a party they don't
belong to.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the ranks of the
skeptical justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say your system helps elect candidates that hold views
closer to the majority of voters,'' he said. ``But what if a party
believes that the majority is wrong and that over time, their
party's unpopular message will finally be accepted? You want to get
rid of these types of parties.''

 UNDATED: doctor's office?  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently helped care for a young woman in the hospital who had
been troubled for years with abdominal pain and a psychologically
abusive boyfriend. She had been in and out of hospitals, undergoing
X-rays, ultrasounds, CAT scans and so forth, all of which revealed
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   She was angry and afraid, and frequently came to the emergency
room demanding hospitalization and painkillers. Doctors who cared
for her in various hospitals had grown weary of her constant
complaints and started giving her morphine. Then she became
addicted, and no one cared about her enough to ensure that she got
the psychiatric help she sorely needed _ including, in retrospect,
me. It was easier to abdicate responsibility than to deal with her.
</P>
<P>
   She was the quintessentially difficult patient. After a while,
hers was a room we avoided. Her needs were bottomless, her pain
unremitting. In the constant buzz that is ward life for a resident,
time seemed better spent on other patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seemed to be physically wrong with her, at least not
anything to explain the severity of her pain. Yet she relentlessly
demanded morphine. Try as we did, it was hard setting limits. A
tough approach alienated her. A conciliatory approach simply got
her more drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But one person, her internist, knew how to handle her. Though
the internist had been her doctor for only a few months, she had
developed an effective style with this patient. She was not afraid
to be strict: If the patient yelled, sometimes she yelled back _ or
she was kind, as the moment required. Though unconventional, she
grasped her patient's psychology like no one else, and she truly
cared for her. She eventually managed to discharge the patient
without morphine.
</P>
<P>
   I asked the internist about her approach to difficult patients.
She had several in her practice, she said. Like any doctor, she did
not seek them out, she said. But, she added, they are not hard to
treat, once you figure out what is bothering them.
</P>
<P>
   She understands this intuitively, and that is part of the reason
she is so effective. Some doctors know that patients do not always
come right out and say what is troubling them. Sometimes they hedge
or obfuscate, and often the key to treating them is to look a
little deeper. But exactly why one doctor can relate to a difficult
patient, and another can alienate her, is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Another reminder, perhaps, that medicine is a field of
specialties. Some doctors are better at treating certain diseases;
some at treating certain patients.

PERSONAL HEALTH: MEMORIES OF THINGS THAT NEVER WERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young woman in psychotherapy recovered the memory that at age
13 she was raped by her teacher, became pregnant and underwent an
abortion. No corroborating evidence for this event existed. In
fact, the woman had not reached menarche until 15, so the pregnancy
was medically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she filed criminal charges against the teacher, who had
to spend his life savings to defend himself against the false
accusation. Eventually, the court ruled that recovery of a
repressed memory lacked sufficient scientific foundation to be
admissible evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the memory of traumatic events can
sometimes become repressed, a condition known as psychogenic
amnesia. For example, an otherwise law-abiding man who in a fit of
rage committed a heinous crime might report it to police as if
someone else had done it and make no attempt to escape or to defend
himself when he is accused of the crime. Or a woman who was
violently raped may afterward be unable to explain her bruises or
shock until perhaps she returns to the crime scene. Or a child who
witnessed the violent death of a parent may develop a variety of
behavioral disturbances but be unable to recall what started it
all.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also no question that many so-called recovered
memories, particularly those involving allegations of childhood
sexual abuse by a parent or other close relative, teacher or
friend, are often fictions induced by the concerted efforts of a
therapist who fosters a belief that becomes so deeply held it seems
like a real memory.
</P>
<P>
   This ``false memory syndrome'' has resulted in many family
tragedies: alienation of children from their parents, loss of jobs,
ostracism and divorces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what percent of these recovered memories are
real and what percent are pseudomemories,'' said Dr. Harold Lief, a
psychiatrist from Philadelphia who was one of the first to question
these induced memories. ``But we do know there are hundreds, maybe
thousands of cases of pseudomemories and that many families have
been destroyed by them. We also know that many therapists who track
down these memories and focus on them fail to deal with the
patient's real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many adults who had in treatment recovered a memory of
childhood sexual abuse and accused the supposed perpetrator later
retracted the claim.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gail Macdonald, who lives in Ontario and is the
author of ``Making of an Illness,'' had seen a social worker who
used hypnosis and guided imagery to convince her that prior sexual
abuse by her father was the cause of her current emotional
problems. The therapist said she had multiple personality disorder,
a diagnosis he inflicted, she said, on ``120 people in my little
community.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the false memory, Macdonald said she divorced
herself from her family, suffered horrible nightmares, wrote
compulsively in journals about the abuses her father had supposedly
committed and lost so much weight she was described as corpse-like
until she sought the help of a psychiatrist who said she had
developed ``post-traumatic stress disorder as a direct result of
therapy'' and helped her realize that her recovered memory was
false.
</P>
<P>
   How can someone tell if a recovered memory is false? Serious
questions should be raised when corroborating evidence is lacking,
when the so-called memory occurs before a child is able to remember
and when details of the memory are preposterous (like a rape by
aliens), said Dr. Paul McHugh, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins
University who addressed a recent conference on False Memory
Syndrome sponsored by New York Medical College. McHugh also
questioned the reliability of methods typically used to elicit
these ``memories.'' Among the most common are hypnosis and guided
imagery, during which a therapist may introduce the notion that
sexual abuse had occurred and ask the patient to try to remember
the circumstances and who the perpetrator might have been.
Sometimes patients participate in a recovered memory group where
other members pressure the newcomer to recall prior sexual abuse
and even suggest how it may have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, professor of psychology at the University
of Washington, cited numerous studies that demonstrated how easy it
was to implant a false memory. By asking a series of leading
questions and by having a supposed ``witness'' talk about the
made-up experience, it is often possible to convince someone that
the event actually happened. In one study, researchers easily
convinced half the adult participants that they had been
hospitalized in severe pain as children or that they had been lost
in a shopping mall at age 5. Several people with these false
memories provided detailed embellishments.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for young children. In a study conducted
by Dr. Stephen Ceci, a psychologist at the New York State College
of Human Ecology at Cornell University, preschool children were
asked weekly about whether a fictitious event had ever happened to
them. By the 10th week, more than half reported that it had
happened and provided cogent details about it.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, interviewers told the children: ``Think real
hard. Did you get your hand caught in a mousetrap and go to the
hospital to get it off?''
</P>
<P>
   Ceci reported: ``So compelling did the children's narrative
appear that we suspected that some of the children had come to
truly believe they had experienced the fictitious events. Neither
parents nor researchers were able to convince 27 percent of the
children that the events never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his research, Ceci concluded, ``It is exceedingly,
devilishly difficult for professionals to tell fact from fiction
when a child has been repeatedly suggestively interviewed over a
long period of time. They look and act the way children do when
they are trying to be accurate and honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults with emotional problems like depression, dissociative
disorder or hysteria also tend to be highly susceptible to the
suggestion that an imagined event had actually occurred.
Professional psychiatric organizations have warned against the use
of ``memory recovery techniques'' to unearth tales of sexual abuse.
According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, for example,
techniques like hypnotherapy, regression therapy and drug-mediated
interviews are unproved and not acceptable in psychiatric practice.
In guidelines issued three years ago, the college stated that
psychiatrists should never use forceful or persuasive interviewing
to elicit memories.

they insist are untrue can seek help from the False Memory Syndrome

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I've been with this company for about a
year, and I enjoy most of the work. My problem is that the people I
work with talk about work and nothing else. Some humor or casual
conversation would be nice, but it doesn't happen. This place is no
fun, and I am wondering if that is enough reason to leave. T.M.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: For employees who are consumed by work, your company is
actually one fun place. There are endless conversations about
projections, plans, and products, and this probably falls into your
colleagues' definition of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is that you enjoy a work environment that
includes humor, a balance between work and personal life, and some
off-beat activities and discussions. Unfortunately, although these
elements are of value to you, they are not valued in the culture of
your company. While you enjoy the job's technical components, you
are experiencing dissatisfaction because several aspects of your
social needs are not being met.
</P>
<P>
   With people spending so many hours at work, it is important for
the job to be interesting, challenging, uplifting and energizing.
In this sense, it should be fun. Your present job is fun for some
people, but not for you. It is up to you to decide if this is
sufficient reason to leave, but remember that it is not much fun to
look back at one's career and think of what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a recent college grad and I have been working for a
start-up company for substantially less money than I would have
been paid if I had accepted a more conventional job, mainly because
there are stock incentives here. Things are not working out, and I
am going to leave. My question is whether my low salary is going to
hold down my starting salary level in my next job. P.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: In applying for your next job, your relatively low salary
should be accompanied by an asterisk. It should indicate that you
joined a start-up venture at a less- than market rate for your
skills, experience and education because of a combination of
opportunity and stock incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that if your value in the marketplace were merely
your present salary, you would have not been provided with stock
incentives. It is apparent that you are worth more, and the
start-up company recognized that through the incentive program,
whether you actually profited from the package or not.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should think about a salary range that is
acceptable to you. Consider not only your education, skills,
experience and current market price for people with your
background, but also look at yourself in terms of the value that
you will be able to add to a company. Think also about the
incentives that you would like in your next package, as this type
of planning can help lead to a work situation in which you
ultimately have less incentive to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager made a commitment to phone me at a specific time
on a specific day, and then called two hours later and started the
conversation as if there were no delay at all. I told him that I
had to move a bunch of work around as a result of the delay, and he
didn't even respond. Your thoughts? R.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: This power play by your manager demonstrates that he has a
little problem with the ``C'' word. In fact, he has a little
problem with several ``C'' words, including commitment,
communication and care.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, he made a commitment to call you at a
specific time, and if he could not do so, there are a number of
steps he could have taken. The first is to call you ahead to
indicate that the scheduled call would be late, and then he should
have rescheduled the second call. A broken commitment not only
calls for an apology, but it also calls for a change in one's
behavior to prevent this from happening again. Your manager went 0
for 4 on this one.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of communication, one of the most important aspects is
listening. You told your manager that you had to make several
adjustments in your work to accommodate his call, and his response
was a big nothing. For him, communication appears to be a one-way
process, and, as such, is destined to fail.
</P>
<P>
   This entire incident points to a lack of care on his part. He
had no concern for the value of your time, the inconvenience he
caused you, or your thoughts on any of these matters. Speaking of
``C'' words, your manager's behavior is ultimately going to cause
one of the most problematic ``C'' words of all: conflict.

PRACTITIONERS OFFER EXTRA ATTENTION FOR PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eileen Cafasso's conversation with her patient was
expansive, touching on his taste for turnip paste, his number of
daily bananas, his self-diagnosed addiction to cheese. There was
time for him to ask about a particular blood pressure drug he had
read about, and for her to ask how he had spent his holidays.
</P>
<P>
   There was no watching of wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   Godel, 79, who works in the mail room at Chase Manhattan Bank,
started seeing Cafasso, a nurse practitioner, a year and a half
ago, when he grew dissatisfied with the care he was getting from
his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other one was giving me the bum's rush,'' said Godel, who
lives in Brooklyn. ``He was a heart specialist with too large a
work load. There was no way in the world they could they take care
of their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurse practitioners are able to prescribe medicine and, in some
states, admit patients to the hospital. They pride themselves on
their ability to spend more time with patients, focusing on illness
prevention. For example, Cafasso, 34, spends about an hour with her
patients on their first visit to the Columbia Advanced Practice
Nurse Associates in Manhattan, which includes two other nurse
practitioners. Their practice has 500 patients, and Cafasso usually
sees 8 to 10 a day. By comparison, some doctors see 20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses' practice was the focus of a study published in
January in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The
study found no significant differences in the quality of care
received by patients randomly assigned either to doctors or nurse
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who used emergency rooms for their health care and had
no regular doctors were offered care for a year from doctors or
nurses affiliated with Columbia University. The researchers
measured the patients' satisfaction with their care, their health,
(using physiologic test results for those with diabetes and asthma)
and their use of emergency rooms and other medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quality of care was essentially the same, there
were three statistically significant differences between the
groups. Hypertensive patients treated by nurse practitioners saw
greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure than patients in the
doctor group. People treated by nurses were more likely to stick
with their provider's care than those treated by doctors; those
treated by doctors were more satisfied with their technical skill,
personal manner and, notably, time spent with the patient. But
while these differences were measurable, none were considered
likely to affect a patient's health.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary O. Mundinger, dean of the Columbia nursing school and
the study's lead author, said the research had profound
implications. ``For those looking to get primary care from a nurse
practitioner, they can feel increasingly safe and confident in
doing so, as a result of this study,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The position of nurse practitioner was created in the mid-1960s
by a physician and nurse at the University of Colorado, working to
improve public health nursing. A nurse practitioner is now
generally required to have a master's degree in nursing, which
usually is a two-year program. Practitioners receive training in
topics like those taught to medical residents in primary care,
including taking medical histories and doing physical exams.
</P>
<P>
   At first they worked mostly with poor and rural patients, but
their skills were easily transferred to primary care, and they are
now increasingly seen in hospitals and in independent practices.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Cafasso treated people who welcomed the
time she was able to spend with them, talking about what ailed them
and how they could get and stay healthier. Kerry Hillard, 24, of
Manhattan, an editor with Baby Talk magazine, had a nasty cold in
the midst of her deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting, we don't realize the impact stress has on
our health,'' Cafasso told her. ``We don't really sleep or eat as
well, and we're more susceptible to colds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillard has referred people to the practice. ``Here it seems
they are much more concerned with other aspects of your life: work,
nutrition, exercise and prevention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cafasso, an assistant professor at the Columbia School of
Nursing, where she received a master's of science, likes such
encounters because she can make more accurate diagnoses when she
understands what is going on in a patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, someone comes in and says she is going through
a divorce, Cafasso says she tries to find out more. ``I'll ask how
are they coping with it, what kind of support system do they
have,'' she said. ``Clinically, it can tell you a lot.'' By
learning about a patient's coping mechanisms, she can assess how
rigidly the person may comply with particular health regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Cafasso, married with an infant daughter, followed her mother
into nursing. After 10 years, she got the extra training to be a
nurse practitioner, saying she wanted more decision-making power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could really give more to my patients by going on for
my advanced degree,'' she said. Her patients get, on average, 15
minutes longer with her than they would with a physician, based on
the American Medical Association's measures of average lengths of
doctor visits. ``We try to work with the patient individually to
get them to have a healthier life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are those in medicine who are suspicious of the
finding that nurse practitioners can be as effective as physicians.
In an editorial accompanying the results of the Columbia study, Dr.
Harold C. Sox of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover,
N.H., criticized it for being too short and for working primarily
with Hispanic women in their 40's, a group not representative of
the population. (Women in their 40s are, on average, healthier than
the general population, and Hispanic women tend to have less
trouble with their pregnancies than others, though far higher rates
of diabetes and asthma.)
</P>
<P>
   Sox speculated that nurse practitioners might not fare as well
with more complicated cases, when they had to admit patients to a
hospital, care for them while there, and make appropriate choices
about drugs, which physicians spend many years learning, under
heavy supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we have a study that really tests independent nurse
practitioners' ability to do some of these things for which they
haven't had as much training as physicians,'' Sox said in a phone
interview, ``we shouldn't make the claim that they're
interchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   But in defending her research, Mundinger pointed out that it
would be difficult to conduct a careful, randomized study on the
general population, because few people are willing to be randomly
assigned to a doctor or nurse. ``Those of us who are lucky enough
to have commercial insurance for health care have a strong
preference to choose our own provider,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, comes down to dollars, and how the
study will be used by insurers, hospitals and private practices
hoping to cut costs. In his editorial about the study, Sox
cautioned, ``Its evidence that nurse practitioners and primary care
physicians could be interchangeable is far from convincing, but the
marketplace is not given to fine judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nurse practitioners appear to be cost effective, earning
about half to two-thirds of what primary care physicians earn.
Nurse practitioners in New York City are usually paid $80,000 to
$100,000 a year; statewide they receive, on average, $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sox noted that the primary care nurse practitioner work force is
projected to increase from 55,000 to 106,500, between 1995 and
2005, while the number of primary care physicians is expected to
increase by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Columbia study, taken in the context of cost control and
the growth of the nurse practitioner work force, is likely to mean
more competition for general internists and family physicians,''
Sox wrote. That, he added, is good for the patient, but bad for
doctors who invested a great deal of energy in their training but
could not keep ``busy enough to sustain their skills and earn a
reasonable living.''
</P>
<P>
   Mundinger said she hoped the study would provoke debate on how
public finances are allocated to medical education. Most money, she
said, now goes to train doctors. And Cafasso noted that some
physicians who had worked closely with nurse practitioners saw how
patients benefited from the additional emphasis on health promotion
and disease prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, nurse practitioners must work well with doctors,
consulting them when patients' problems are beyond nurses'
expertise. For example, when Cafasso was concerned about Godel's
health, she referred him to a new cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Recently she discussed the results of his stress test with him
and told him that his cardiologist believed he might benefit from
an angiogram. When Godel cringed, she tried to reassure him. ``I
would never order you to do something you don't want,'' she
recalled telling him, then reminding him of the tightness he had
felt in his neck, a possible indication of risk for a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Cafasso said her meeting with Godel illustrated what she
enjoyed most about her job. ``I think the ability to spend that
extra time with patients,'' she said, ``somehow gets across to
patients that you understand their concerns.''

   MONTECITO _ The well-heeled residents huddle in their estates
behind dense hedges, thick walls and iron gates in this
self-conscious community on the southern edge of Santa Barbara.
They obviously take their isolation seriously, such that when
warning rabble away, they go so far as to invoke adverbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely Private Property,'' reads a sign in front of one
sprawling property. ``Positively No Admission,'' reads another.
</P>
<P>
   There is a stridency to the admonishments. In them, you can
almost detect an audible sniff. ``Not a Through Street. No
Turnaround.'' (Gee, sorry my front wheels intruded on the first 30
inches of your driveway.) ``Private Road. Right to Pass by
Permission.'' (And who issues that, Jarvis the butler?)
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, Montecito has been favored by captains of
industry, power players of the silver screen and vacationers
desperate for solitude. It's not difficult to see why. It commands
a thickly wooded slope in the foothills of the Santa Ynez
Mountains, overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Channel Islands,
ambling down to a stretch of rugged, secluded beach. With
sunglasses, tinted windows and determination, you could go days
without ever having to speak to a soul.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few decades, however, one establishment has been
dreadfully out of step with all of this: the Miramar Hotel. It is
undoubtedly familiar to anyone who has ever wheeled north on 101
through Santa Barbara. How could you possibly miss those blue
roofs, set off dramatically by white clapboard?
</P>
<P>
   The blue paint was swabbed on in 1940, precisely to catch the
eye of people passing on the highway. The asphalt _ covering six of
the property's 13 acres _ was laid down shortly after, as America
took to the road in search of parking places. A two-story motel
structure went up, facing !ital!away from the ocean, designed
instead to maximize views of a pool and ... well, the road.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare to say goodbye to all of this, though. Hotelier Ian
Schrager, pioneer of cutting-edge lodgings in West Hollywood, New
York and Miami Beach, spent $31.5 million to acquire this somewhat
tired-looking motel two years ago. He plans to sink nearly that
much more into it in a massive renovation that is expected to
require a year and a half to complete. And the developers hope to
start breaking ground _ and breaking up asphalt _ this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion, the Miramar figures to be a high-end resort
that enjoys much more congruity with its neighborhood, joining such
properties of understated elegance as the Four Seasons Biltmore and
the San Ysidro Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concept will be returning it to the sensibility of the
seaside resort, oriented back to the ocean,'' said Tim Andreas,
design director on a project headed by Philippe Starck. ``We're
restoring the landscaping and the sensibility that you're in a
seaside garden setting rather than a motor court.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Miramar's designation as a somewhat funky highway motel
stirs any nostalgic pangs in you, this is the season to get a last
taste. Its doors will be closed when the renovations _ guttings,
primarily _ begin. When it reopens, you certainly won't find any
shoulder-season room rates of $75 for a pool/highway view.
</P>
<P>
   When Philip Dailey transferred here from one of Schrager's New
York hotels to be general manager of the Miramar, he heard story
after story of people who had fond memories of the place. They'd
learned to swim in the pool as a child. Couples had honeymooned
there. The bar had generated volumes of colorful lore. But he
encountered something else: No one had been back for 15 or 20
years. He drew a conclusion. ``The Miramar,'' Dailey said, ``is
like an old jacket you keep in your closet. You can't bring
yourself to throw it away, but you never wear it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The place was overripe for an upgrade. That much was evident
during a recent stay there. Its rooms have bargain sheets and
pillows beneath synthetic bedspreads in floral prints. The
furniture and other furnishings are 1970s Holiday Inn revival. The
drinking glasses are plastic. The TV sits on a cheap stand. No
separate towels are provided for use at the beach or pool.
</P>
<P>
   During our visit, the bathroom sink drain unleashed a four-inch
gusher of dark goo when somebody turned on a tap upstairs. After
this recurred minutes later, a maintenance man was summoned, but he
seemed at a loss, saying, ``It's happened before.'' Then he checked
to see if the shower drain had been similarly afflicted. (Yech!) &QL;

16!tag!Sweeping changes &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!All of this will be gone when the doors reopen. The blue
roofs? They're history. The Miramar is seeking to recapture a sense
of its more distant past.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s, transplanted Englishman Josiah Doulton tried to
scratch out a living here growing fruit trees and various crops for
livestock feed. When his fortunes flagged in this enterprise,
however, he found that accommodating travelers was much more
lucrative. He dotted the lush grounds with tiny guest cottages,
some of which _ dating to 1901 _ still stand.
</P>
<P>
   The new design will seek to recapture some of these
sensibilities while maximizing a 500-foot stretch of beachfront.
The refurbished cottages will be engulfed by a citrus orchard in
one part of the property, a field of lavender in another, Dailey
said recently as he strolled over seemingly endless expanses of
parking lot. The renovated motel building will feature balcony
trellises cascading with bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   The bank of rooms down by the ocean _ built literally on the
sand _ will be something really special. Two of the current rooms
will be fused into one lavish duplex. Picture a row of two-story
townhouses, each with a private deck with whirlpool tub, a
downstairs living room and kitchen, and a spiral staircase that
climbs to a spacious upstairs bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of the resort will be a boardwalk promenade
that is to stretch from the lobby to an oceanfront bar and grill.
In between will be a pool, bordered on one side by a restaurant, on
the other by a spa.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager came up with the concept of ``hotel as theater,''
creating natural gathering areas where guests and visitors can
basically congregate to watch each other. This is what is
envisioned for this area, with the occasional passenger train
passing through to provide a touch of surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   The train tracks come with the deed here. When the Southern
Pacific sought to build a north-south line through here in the
mid-1880s, Doulton asked that it be routed down there along that
useless, non-arable land along the beach rather than through his
precious barley field farther inland. (Suntans and cutback rides on
waves were not high on priority lists in that particular era.)
</P>
<P>
   An old flag-stop depot still stands on the Miramar property, and
it will be incorporated into the new design.
</P>
<P>
   Major highways, on the other hand, are much less charming, and
the 101 roars by within just a few feet of the property's inland
border. To gain an appreciation for just how many goods are
transported in 18-wheel trucks these days, sit by the Miramar pool
for an hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   Masking that rattle and hum will surely be a major challenge for
the developers. The plan is to employ a sound wall, a hedge,
sound-absorption building materials, triple-pane glass and, as a
final resort, the white noise of waterfalls and babbling brooks. &QL;

16!tag!A rival for the Biltmore &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!When the resort is finished _ the end of next year, perhaps
early 2002 _the Miramar will contend for the same high-end traveler
who currently gravitates to the Biltmore. In Montecito, there
figures to be plenty of room for both, but it shapes up to be an
intriguing contrast.
</P>
<P>
   While the Miramar will target the crowd that crackles on the
leading edge of trendiness, the Biltmore has built its considerable
reputation on Old World elegance and deference.
</P>
<P>
   It was constructed in the 1920s, Los Angeles architect Reginald
Johnson employing the design of a stately Spanish villa. Although
it underwent two major refurbishments in recent years, adding such
upgrades as air conditioning and the requisite data ports in rooms
(a spa addition is currently under construction), the Biltmore
still features wrought-iron balconies shaded by tropical shrubbery,
massive beam ceilings, bright interiors (cream-colored walls, white
plantation shutters and ceiling fans, new bedspreads and drapes),
as well as detached cottages of its own. The place feels like old
money.
</P>
<P>
   Which is appropriate, really, given its neighborhood. That, in
fact, is one of the conditions that enhances the prospects for a
reborn Miramar. Here, you don't have to worry about putting up a
lavish resort and being stuck next to a hot dog-on-a-stick stand
and a junky boat-repair yard.
</P>
<P>
   Though an unincorporated community of only 9,300 people,
Montecito is so status-conscious that it has !ital!two village
areas _ one it can look down its nose at as a tourist enclave, the
other it can treat as a locals' hangout. The former stretches out
along Coast Village Road, parallel to and virtually on top of 101.
The other, referred to as Upper Village (of course), is farther
upslope, clustered around the corner of East Valley Road and San
Ysidro Road.
</P>
<P>
   Here, few of the businesses open on Sunday, a refreshing
throwback to an era when all self-respecting establishments honored
the Sabbath. On days when they do open their doors, you'll find
impressive home furnishings and antiques at William Laman, housed
in a 100-year-old former home.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might notice the sign that pointedly forbids cell-phone
use in the breakfast room of the San Ysidro Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might survey the stylish but confounding array of
products in an establishment eccentrically called Pierre Lafond
Wendy Foster. Walk into one room here and you'll find gourmet
groceries, greeting cards, deli items and chocolates. Walk through
an adjacent door and you're among racks of women's clothing. Head
up the stairs for _ no joke _ kitchen and bath items, antique
office furniture, women's lingerie, men's shirts and garden
accouterments. (``Yes, I've made my selections. I'm getting this
black-clay dinnerware, a linen robe, this packet of radish seeds
and a bar of Pre de Provence bath soap. Sure, all in the same bag
is fine.'') &QL; 
!tag!f &QC;

16!tag!Exclusive territory &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!It might be tempting, upon leaving the Upper Village, to
explore the neighborhood. Don't bother. You can drive through
Montecito, but you can't actually !ital!see Montecito. What you
gaze at instead are fortresslike walls, impenetrable stands of
greenery, tall fences, elaborate iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   The mansions are set well back from the road at the end of
winding drives. In a local real-estate flyer, one ocean-view
property was going for $3.6 million _ and that's just for three
acres of bare dirt. If you want something with a house on it, well,
here's a 15,000-square-foot Italian palazzo with formal gardens,
statuary and an ocean view for a priced-to-move $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Montecito's old money has been suffused of late with nouveau
riche _ movie-industry stars and executives, high-tech
entrepreneurs, etc. They are attracted by the same attributes that
appeal to weekend tourists: tranquillity, clean air, cool climate,
mesmerizing views of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Find all of these in abundance down along the beach. You can
easily walk a considerable stretch of it, from Lookout County Park
south of Montecito (take the Summerland exit off the 101) clear to
the Biltmore _ 2.5 miles in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   Check a tide table before embarking (the Santa Barbara
News-Press runs one daily) and go at low tide to avoid being
pulverized on rocks or against one of several sea walls. Also,
there are a number of spots in which streams rush briskly over
boulders, so you might want to bring along a pair of old tennis
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the water, you're likely to spot pelicans skimming along
the surface and diving for snacks, or bobbing in the swells like
great, fish-powered frigates. Off Hammonds' Point, those are not
seals in the water, they are wetsuit-clad surfers playing chicken
with the offshore rocks.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good stretch for beach walking because the lords and
ladies of the palatial manors that abut it tend to be reclusive
sorts _ and in some cases absentee owners. As a result, the foot
traffic is not particularly heavy, and it's virtually nil on
weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   You likely will encounter dogs, though. Lot of dogs. Although a
deputy at the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department said there
is a leash law on the books, it's clear that it is obstinately
ignored here. The hounds roam with such impunity that sometimes
it's difficult to match up the pets with the owners, even for
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The packs race up and down the sand, dashing into the surf,
chasing nothing in particular, slobbering on lone walkers ...
seeming to single out the beach in front of the Miramar as their
own private comfort station.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe once the townhouse suites and the beach grill go in and
that shabby throwback motel is finally transformed, they'll begin
to exhibit a bit more decorum. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Montecito lies immediately south of Santa Barbara,
about a 90-mile drive from Los Angeles via U.S. 101.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Published rates for rooms at the Four Seasons Biltmore
Resort start at $420 for a standard room. Deluxe rooms in a cottage
setting are particularly popular; they start at $465. Packages are
offered, with the greatest savings available from Sunday through
Thursday. Phone: (805) 969-2261. Reservations: (800) 332-3442. Web:
www.fourseasons.com/santabarbara. At the Miramar, rates in high
season (today through the summer) range from $139 for a poolside
room to $329 for oceanfront. Cottages range from $319 (one bedroom)
to $619 (three-bedroom). Suites with kitchenettes are available _
$839 for an oceanfront unit. Phone: (805) 969-2203. Reservations:
(800) 322-6983. Web: www.sbmiramar.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Perhaps the best dinner option in Montecito is Pane e
Vino, a trattoria in the Upper Village (1482 East Valley Road). It
offers about a dozen pasta dishes priced just under $10. The
pennette rigate alla Siciliana was inventive, featuring pasta tubes
with fresh tuna cubes, olives and capers in a tomato sauce. For the
fettuccine with mussels and clams, all the seafood was served on
the shell. Check the daily specials sheet for reasonably priced
wines _ we found a pleasant 1997 San Felice Chianti Classico for
$25. The best breakfast in town is at Tutti's, in the Lower Village
(1209 Coast Village Road). Hearty omelets and breakfast burritos
are served up with smokehouse bacon. The menu features an extensive
selection of bakery goods, including scones and muffins, and some
daring items _ cornbread French toast, for example. The Biltmore's
patio is tough to beat for a lunch setting, especially if the
marine layer has lifted. Crab cakes laced with goat cheese ($16)
were excellent.

   MICROSOFT-SUIT (Washington) _ The Justice Department intends to
ask a federal judge this week to break the Microsoft Corp. into two
separate and competitive companies as a means to restore
competition in the software industry, according to officials who
are familiar with the government's deliberations. One company would
hold the Windows operating-system business, and the other would
have the Office suite of software programs and other businesses. It
is not at all clear that the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson,
a Reagan appointee, would accept this breakup idea. He ultimately
assigns the remedy. And because the breakup proposal will almost
certainly be stayed pending appealed, the government plans to ask
for several temporary remedies that would modify Microsoft's
behavior during the interim. By Joel Brinkley.

Although he has exercised enormous influence over Gore, shaping his
interventionist views and stiffening his spine against world
dictators, the one-time career foreign service officer labors
largely in the shadows, preferring to remain, as he once said,
``nameless, faceless, odorless.'' But as Gore increasingly
contrasts his foreign policy experience with that of George W.
Bush, Fuerth may be drawn into the limelight, an uncomfortable
position for a man who never developed an ear for politics. By

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Still working to shore up its financial credibility
on Wall Street, Lucent Technologies named Deborah Hopkins, a senior
executive with the Boeing Co., as its chief financial officer
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, 45, had been Boeing's chief financial officer since she
joined the aerospace giant in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debby is a dynamic leader with a proven track record of
success,'' Richard McGinn, Lucent's chairman, said in a statement.
``Her experience, ability and enthusiasm will make her an immediate
and significant asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, North America's No. 1 maker of communications equipment,
suffered its first serious stumble in January, when the company
announced that its quarterly financial results would fail to meet
analysts' expectations. After splitting from AT&AMP;T in 1996, Lucent
had enjoyed a charmed financial existence, with its shares soaring
seemingly without end.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying the strength of the stock were some weaknesses.
Perhaps most important, Lucent had underestimated demand for new
optical communications systems, which transmit digital information
using pulses of light.
</P>
<P>
   That miscalculation allowed Nortel Networks of Canada, Lucent's
rival for decades, to assume some of Lucent's cachet. Based on the
companies' price-to-earning ratios, investors appear to believe
that Nortel is poised to grow significantly faster than Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Donald K. Peterson, a former Nortel executive, had been Lucent's
chief financial officer since the company first offered shares to
the public in 1996. In March, less than two months after Lucent's
earnings warning, the company said that Peterson would step down to
run the company's weakest division. That unit, which makes
communications systems for corporate offices, is set to be spun
off.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Peterson, McGinn selected Hopkins, who joined Boeing
when that company was suffering in 1998. Two weeks after Hopkins
moved to Boeing from General Motors, Boeing said its forthcoming
financial results would fail to meet expectations and that it would
cut 48,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts blamed antiquated internal financial systems for
Boeing's woes, and Hopkins' reputation flourished as she modernized
Boeing's financial operation.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins replaced just about every senior executive in Boeing's
finance department and established more rigorous financial controls
for Boeing's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her legacy at Boeing, having been there only a little
more than a year, is the implementation of a disciplined set of
financial goals and objectives that all managers can operate
toward,'' said Byron K. Callan, who follows Boeing for Merrill
Lynch. ``If this move had happened six months ago, I would have
been a lot more concerned about it. But a lot of the infrastructure
is in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins' relationship with the financial community while at
Boeing was mixed, but in the end she appeared to emerge with
widespread respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts all loved her at first because it was a change and
was refreshing,'' one Wall Street analyst said on the condition of
anonymity. ``And then people got irked at what they saw as her
highhandedness. Now, the world's come around again and people
realize that some of that change was hard, but she was an effective
catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the long run Boeing's stock did not appear to
respond. Trading at $42.125 just before her appointment at Boeing,
the company's shares closed Monday at $37.875, down $2.1875. One
analyst said the slide in Boeing's shares Monday could be
attributed to dismay over Hopkins' departure. Lucent's shares
closed at $60.625 Monday, down $2.375.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Hopkins said that one issue she intended
to address quickly was the potentially adverse effect of Lucent's
multibillion-dollar lending program for customers, some of whom
lack cash to buy Lucent's products. Some analysts have expressed
concern about the lending's effects on Lucent's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   She added that investors should have no fear that she will leave
Lucent after less than 18 months, as she did Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a daughter that is just entering high school,'' said
Hopkins, who will move from Washington State, near Boeing's
headquarters, to New Jersey, near Lucent's. ``And I have made a
sworn promise that she is able to go to the same high school for
four years in a row.'' &QL;

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California's free-for-all primary election system
that allows voters to choose candidates without regard to party
affiliation came under fire Monday at the U.S. Supreme Court, where
justices questioned the law's constitutionality and its impact on
fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called the California system
``tremendously intrusive'' on the rights of political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very essence of the party's right is to define its own
message and decide its own candidates,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The California system allows any primary election voter _
whether registered as a Democrat, a Republican, a third-party
member or an independent _ to vote for the nomination of any
candidate from any party for any race.Justice Antonin Scalia
complained that the California system allows ``people with little
or no association with a party'' to decide that party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to see why a state should take away a party's
right to elect whom it wants to elect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the court strikes down the law, California _ along with
Washington state, Alaska and Louisiana which have similar systems _
could be forced to change the way they conduct their primaries. The
court's decision is expected by late June.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 198, giving the
state a so-called ``blanket'' primary, which allows voters to cast
ballots in a primary to select any candidate, regardless of the
voters' political registration.California adopted the
single-ballot, blanket form of primary to give the state's 1.6
million independent voters their first opportunity to vote in what
had been a ``closed'' primary limited to party members.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has used the blanket primary since 1935. Alaska
has had it in most elections since 1947. Louisiana has a variation.
The blanket primary gives voters more choices than the ``open''
primary used in 20 states. In an open primary, a voter can request
a party's primary election ballot at the polls without previously
registering in that party. The voter then is limited to voting only
in the primary that the voter selected. Thirteen states use closed
primaries where only registered party members can obtain their
party's ballot. Primaries in 13 other states are ``semi-closed,''
limiting participation to a party's members and to independents.The
state's Democratic, Republican, Libertarian and Peace &AMP; Freedom
parties challenged the California blanket primary system. They
argued that the system violates their First Amendment right of
``freedom of association.'' The national Democratic and Republican
parties filed briefs supporting that contention. In 1997, a federal
district court ruled that the blanket primary was constitutional.
U.S. District Judge David Levi said that while the system was an
``intrusion on a party's traditional right to select its own
candidates,'' the burden on the parties was not enough of a
``significant burden'' to justify striking down the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, thinking
so highly of Levi's ruling that is simply adopted his opinion ``as
the opinion of our court.''
</P>
<P>
   In his arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, George Waters, a
Sacramento, Calif., lawyer representing the four political parties,
said California's system is ``a wholesale assault'' on the parties'
ability ``to choose a standard bearer who best represents their
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want people affiliated with a party to choose their
own candidates,'' he told the court.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Gede, special assistant attorney general for
California, defended the state's primary system, arguing that a
primary election ``belongs to the voters,'' not to the various
political parties. He also noted that the blanket system is what
``the voters want,'' referring to the fact that the system was
imposed by a voter referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Among the supporters of the blanket primary system are Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, both
of whom broke with their parties in filing friend-of-the-court
briefs defending Proposition 198. They argued that the blanket
primary helps mavericks and moderates win nominations against
hard-core partisans by attracting ``crossover'' and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who relied heavily on Democrats and independents in his
unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination this
year, finished third in California's presidential primary behind
Democratic candidate Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.Gede
told the high court that polls showed the blanket system had
``re-energized voters.'' He said voter turnout for last month's
presidential primary in California was 52 percent, the highest in a
presidential year since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the blanket primary infringes ``to a
degree'' on a party's right to association, Cede argued that the
state has an ``over-riding interest'' to enhance the ``democratic
nature of the election process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gede scarcely finished his opening statement before being hit by
a barrage of critical questions and comments from the justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it up to the voters to tell the parties who they should
elect?'' asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter chipped in: ``Under your system, the
unaffiliated voters will change the message of a party they don't
belong to.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the ranks of the
skeptical justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say your system helps elect candidates that hold views
closer to the majority of voters,'' he said. ``But what if a party
believes that the majority is wrong and that over time, their
party's unpopular message will finally be accepted? You want to get
rid of these types of parties.''

   Government officials said Monday that Blair met recently with
Jacques A. Nasser, the Ford chief executive, and that he and other
officials were in contact with Ford over an internal review of its
European operations, expected to be concluded in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   James Vella, a Ford spokesman, said: ``The review is continuing,
and no decision has been made'' about closing entirely the plant at
Dagenham, which employs some 4,500 workers producing the Ford
Fiesta compact. Ford announced in February that one shift would be
discontinued, eliminating 1,500 jobs, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But auto industry executives have been saying for over a month
that Dagenham is likely to be closed when the review is finished.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of another auto industry cutback carries huge
political freight after the government was apparently surprised by
the decision of BMW AG last month to sell its loss-making Rover
Group British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   BMW of Germany agreed to sell Rover's profitable Land Rover
sport utility vehicle division to Ford. It provoked an uproar with
a separate move to sell Rover's sprawling Longbridge car plant near
Birmingham to Alchemy Partners, a British venture-capital firm that
wants to produce only limited numbers of rebranded MG niche models
and cut thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a consortium led by John Towers, a former
Rover chief executive, approached BMW with a $1.3 billion
counterbid intended to maintain mass car production with fewer job
losses among Longbridge's 9,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, which said it had no prior knowledge of
BMW's plans to sell Rover, supported the counterbid. But in a
further setback for the government, executives close to the
negotiations said Monday that the Towers-led consortium was
scrambling to meet a BMW deadline to guarantee financing.
</P>
<P>
   The government's discomfort over the Rover sale has deepened
with the debate over the possible closing of the Dagenham plant,
one of three major Ford plants in Britain. The opposition
Conservatives have already criticized the government for failing to
secure jobs or keep track of developments in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Blair denied that his meeting with Nasser had
been inspired specifically by the prospect of Dagenham's closing.
But she acknowledged that both the prime minister and the
Department of Trade Industry were ``in dialogue'' with Ford over
its review of European operations.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers reported that Blair had also telephoned Nick
Scheele, the chairman of Ford's European division, who met last
week with labor union officials representing Ford's British work
force.
</P>
<P>
   The labor unions have threatened to call strikes at other Ford
plants in Britain if Dagenham is closed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford has made steady inroads into the British auto industry in
recent years, buying such prestige marques as Jaguar and Aston
Martin before it acquired the Land Rover division from BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ford ranks as the top carmaker in Britain, with 12
percent of the market, but its sales fell 3.7 percent last year to
just under 390,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, moreover, it has been losing market share
steadily. Subcompact rivals like the Volkswagen Polo and Peugeot
206 have outshone the Fiesta, while Ford also failed to anticipate
the shift of the region's market toward more diesel engines and
toward very small minivans like the Renault Scenic.
</P>
<P>
   That has left it with surplus production capacity. A study by
PricewaterhouseCoopers said Ford's European assembly plants run at
72 percent of capacity, compared with 83 percent for General
Motors. In Europe, Ford operates nine major assembly plants
including modernized sites at Cologne, Germany, and at Valencia,
Spain. But the Dagenham plant has had longstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already announced that one of the two shifts at
Dagenham will be eliminated as production of the Ford Focus is
moved to a factory in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has singled out Dagenham for three reasons. The strength of
the pound against the single European currency, the euro, Ford
executives say, has made it much more expensive to produce cars in
Britain for export to the rest of Europe _ a reason also cited by
BMW as a cause of its huge losses at Rover, and by the French
carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen as a threat to its plant in the
British Midlands.
</P>
<P>
   The union at Dagenham, moreover, has resisted labor-saving
production changes that other European unions have been willing to
accept, industry executives say, so the factory has very low
productivity. And the mostly white, unionized workers at Dagenham
have fiercely resisted the hiring of Asian and black workers, in a
dispute that Ford fears could be deeply embarrassing and damaging
to its global reputation.

doesn't deserve readers like these. Most of the stories are long
(relatively speaking) on dialogue, humor and creative implication,

``The Britches of Madison County,'' in which author Bill Crown

orchids, the Latin name of which we refuse to repea here. Hansen
hired some Borneo natives to provide sherpalike assistance on this
journey, and these simple, jungle-savvy men provide lots of laughs
as they react to the orchid zealots' reasons for sloshing up a
muddy Borneo river with a stockpile of equipment that includes a
camouflaged cardboard toilet. This trip was the author's
introduction to the world of orchids and orchid lovers, which was
far more complex, seductive, competitive and pricey than he ever
imagined. Read all about it in this captivating and often funny

 &HT;    Bush promises more free trade during bridge dedication in Mexico
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Tamaulipas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush spent a
couple hours out of the country Monday, hopping into Mexico to cut
the ribbon on a new international bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee whose foreign policy
credentials have been questioned during his campaign, was in
friendly territory as he and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
dedicated the World Trade Bridge connecting Laredo and Nuevo
Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, which carries only commercial traffic, opened April
15. It is the fourth bridge connecting the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before hundreds of cheering Mexicans under a loading
dock canopy, Bush used the event to promise to push free trade if
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Since the North American Free Trade Agreement passed in 1994,
trade between the United States and Mexico has reached $200 billion
dollars a year, and half of all exports to Mexico passed through
Texas, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we must build on the successes of NAFTA,'' Bush said. ``As
president, I will work to create a entire hemisphere of free
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Bush said, he would ask Congress for fast-track
authority to negotiate new trade agreements, and he promised the
crowd he would not treat Mexico and Latin America as afterthoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past there have been walls and divides between Mexico
and the United States,'' he said. ``Today one more barrier has
fallen away, one more divide has been bridged.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brief foray into Mexico on Monday marked his first trip
out of the country since clinching the GOP presidential nomination.
Earlier in the campaign, Bush talked about the possibility of
making major foreign trips, perhaps throughout South and Central
America as well as overseas.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, however, Bush campaign officials have said no
such trips are planned, though they are still a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Zedillo met privately for about 30 minutes after the
dedication. Neither was available for comment after their session.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, Zedillo praised Bush, who has been popular
in Mexico for his ``deep appreciation for Mexico and our culture.''
He said the new bridge will help create jobs and speed up commerce
in the traffic-choked sister cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican president, a lame duck whose six-year term ends at
the end of this year, also urged both governments to continue
working to combat violence and smuggling on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a border without drug traffickers and people
traffickers, `` Zedillo said. ``(The border) can be much better.''
</P>
<P>
   For residents of both cities, the new bridge over the Rio Grande
already has relieved the infamous miles-long lines that used to
pile up at the two bridges connecting the downtowns.
</P>
<P>
   All commercial traffic now crosses at the World Trade Bridge or
the Solidarity bridge, both located miles upriver from the city
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful,'' said Laredo Mayor Betty Flores. ``I
have gotten so many calls from people thanking me because they got
their two (downtown) bridges back.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 18 wheelers no longer clogging downtown, Flores said
the city plans to accelerate its downtown revitalization effort.

<P>
   Gautama Chopra freely admits that his last name helped sell his
novel. His first agent was a friend of his father, the best-selling
New Age guru Deepak Chopra. His publisher, Amber-Allen, was the
publisher of his father's blockbuster ``The Seven Spiritual Laws of
Success.''
</P>
<P>
   His father even wrote the foreword to the novel, ``Child of the
Dawn,'' about a teen-ager's spiritual awakening. The book generated
reams of publicity; booksellers and curious fans of his father
snapped it up.
</P>
<P>
   Gautama Chopra, 24, is not the only young writer capitalizing on
a literary lineage. There are Jong, Heller, Updike, Bellow,
Theroux, Styron, Rice and McPhee (make that three McPhee) children
writing, not to mention two Cheever offspring. All were born with
the most valuable asset a writer can have: access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a marketplace that's very interested in new voices and
that acknowledges pedigree,'' said Suzanne Gluck, an agent at
International Creative Management. ``When you talk to editors about
a first book by a Katie Roiphe or a Susan Merrell,'' Gluck added,
referring to the daughters of the novelist Anne Roiphe and the
best-selling author on relationships, Maggie Scarf, ``there's
greater interest because they do feel the talent is handed down.''
</P>
<P>
   The children of baby-boomer writers are coming of age. Just as
the music and film industries are seeing a burst of activity from
stars' progeny, books are being written by young people with
familiar names and, in some cases, derivative styles. They have
been emboldened by their parents' successes, and they can expect
more lucrative rewards than ever before from such sources as film
rights and foreign and electronic editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days advances are higher, and there tends to be a lot
more money in publishing, particularly if you hit it big, if you
turn out to be the next David Guterson,'' said Ted Solotaroff, a
prominent editor for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   As consolidation in the industry puts extra pressure on the
bottom line, editors are looking for a sure thing. A last name
associated with best-sellerdom creates a powerful brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agents know they have a better chance of selling a mediocre
book by a person with a recognizable name than selling a very good
book by a person who's unknown,'' said Adam Bellow, 42, the son of
Saul, who is writing a book about nepotism for Doubleday that is
scheduled for publication next year. ``Publishers themselves know
an established name translates into sales. Frank McCourt published
a best seller. Then Malachy McCourt published a best seller. His
book wouldn't have been a best seller if Frank's hadn't been. He
probably wouldn't even have gotten it published.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good name used to mean that you had breeding and education.
A good name in our society means you can sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand effect particularly comes into play when the writer's
relative adopts the same genre _ in the case of the McCourts, the
memoir; with the Chopras, spirituality. Carol Higgins Clark,
daughter of suspense diva Mary, writes mysteries; in fact, Carol
just brought the Higgins Clark brand under one roof with an
estimated $2 million contract with her mother's publisher, Simon &AMP;
Schuster. Eliza Minot, sister of Susan, writes family-oriented
novels for Knopf, too. And brother George Minot is working on his
first novel for Knopf, also about family.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sales success, books by writers' relatives cover the
gamut. ``A Monk Swimming'' by Malachy McCourt (Hyperion, 1998) has
sold 330,000 copies, a small fraction of the 10 million copies of
Frank's ``Angela's Ashes'' in print, but not bad considering the
lukewarm reviews ``Monk'' received. All four of Carol Higgins
Clark's books have hit the New York Times best-seller list. Brian
Herbert jointly wrote a prequel to the sci-fi classic ``Dune'' by
his late father, Frank, titled ``Dune: House Atreides''
(Spectra/Bantam, which rocketed onto best-seller lists last fall
and has 200,000 copies in print. (Sales figures were unavailable
from the publisher.)
</P>
<P>
   Others have garnered respectable if not stellar sales. Gautama
Chopra's novel has sold 35,000 copies since 1998. In a strong
showing for a first novel, Eliza Minot's ``Tiny One'' (Knopf) is
nearing sales of 20,000 copies since its publication in November.
``Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1998)
by Kiran Desai, daughter of the writer Anita Desai, has also done
well, selling 27,000 copies. ``My Father, Dancing'' (Knopf, August
1999), short stories by Bliss Broyard, daughter of Anatole Broyard,
a book critic for The New York Times and an editor at The Times
Book Review who died in 1990, has sold more than 20,000 copies.
This probably figured into Little, Brown's decision to pay a
six-figure advance for her forthcoming memoir, ``Mixed Blood.'' But
a first novel published at the same time, ``A Stranger in the
Earth'' (Harcourt Brace by Marcel Theroux, son of Paul, has sold
only 8,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more sons and daughters of literati writing
now, and I'm sick to death of it,'' said Ivan Solotaroff, 43, who
is writing a book about executioners for HarperCollins, where his
father, Ted, worked 10 years ago when it was Harper &AMP; Row. ``I
think people should go get a life instead of dining out on their
heritage. My first impression is, `How original _ you wrote a
book.' That's what people are thinking of me, and it puts a lot
more pressure on what I write.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon may be especially appropriate in an era in which
everything is defined by its relationship to something else. ``A
Density of Souls,'' the first novel of Christopher Rice, 21, son of
Anne, is described by his editor at Talk Miramax Books, Jonathan
Burnham, ``as `Dawson's Creek' crossed with Donna Tartt,'' the
novelist. ``Normal Girl,'' the first novel of Molly Jong-Fast, 21,
due out in June, is described as ``a `Less Than Zero' from the
female point of view,'' by her editor, Pamela Cannon, at Villard
Books.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Rice would end up at a synergy factory
like Talk Miramax, which is printing 75,000 copies of his book for
its August release, sending him on a 20-city tour and conducting a
national advertising campaign for the book. It is extraordinary
support for a first novel, and a flag to booksellers that they had
better stock up on it. Even if his book flops, Rice will have
another chance because he has a two-book contract with Talk
Miramax, which is also not the norm for a novice.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Publishers do not overtly use parentage to promote books (except
for mentioning it in catalogs) because that would undermine the
idea that a work stands on its own. But a priceless last name still
sounds all the right chords of recognition in advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gautama Chopra, most children of writers mine their
connections on the path to publication. Rice presented his
manuscript to his mother. ``I told her, `Mom, I think I've written
a book,' and she said, `Oh, my God.' Then she said, `I have to send
it to everybody I know.''' Everybody included her agent, Lynn
Nesbit, who is now Christopher's agent too.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually some second-generation writers find that their family
background can be as troublesome as it is advantageous. ``You get a
lot of publicity, but most of it's bad,'' said Jong-Fast, the
daughter of Erica Jong. Reviewers compare their work to that of
their parents, usually unfavorably. The children struggle to
establish a literary identity, a subject Martin Amis, son of
Kingsley, touches on in his forthcoming memoir from Talk Miramax.
And they inherit their parents' enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be people gunning for her just because she's my
daughter,'' Erica Jong said. ``The access is there, but the
criticism is unduly harsh.'' Paul Solotaroff, another of Ted's
sons, is working on his first novel, a sex comedy. ``My father was
a tough editor and a tough critic,'' said Paul, 44, ``and there are
a number of people out there who have long memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychological hurdles are myriad. The relentless comparison
faced by Andre Dubus III, 40, namesake of his father, Andre Dubus,
the short-story writer who died last year, often made him feel like
``Elvis Jr.,'' said the author of ``House of Sand and Fog'' (W.W.
Norton, 1999). ``People would see a story by Andre Dubus _ it
probably got my manuscript to the top editor before it got
rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   All three of the younger Dubus' books, including ``House of Sand
and Fog,'' a National Book Award nominee that has sold 120,000
copies, made the rounds for more than a year before finding
publishers. ``I got nothing but no's for 10 years,'' said Dubus,
who still depends on carpentry for half his income.
</P>
<P>
   The going has not been so smooth for David Updike, either. The
son of John Updike, he had a short-story collection, ``Out on the
Marsh,'' published by David R. Godine 10 years ago, but it sold
only about 3,000 copies. He has also written six children's books
and collaborated with his father on a seventh. For several years,
his agent has been shopping around three more books. ``It's a
little distracting if you're struggling at something to be related
to someone who's so successful,'' said David, 43. ``But the
alternative of not doing it would be untrue to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That struggle causes many children of authors to fight the urge
to write as long as possible. Determined not to follow in his
father's footsteps, Dubus recalled: ``I said I was going to be a
pipe fitter like Pappy, my grandfather. But I felt a calling. I
felt this weird, wispy pull.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing also seems the surest way into their parents' hearts.
Katie Roiphe, 31, is working on her first novel for Dial Books. It
is a 19th-century romance tentatively titled ``Still She Haunts
Me.'' ``Sometimes I think my work could be reduced to one of those
pictures you give to your parents to paste on the refrigerator as a
kid,'' said Roiphe.
</P>
<P>
   In Adam Bellow's book, tentatively titled ``In Praise of
Nepotism,'' he asks: ``Am I an opportunist trading on my father's
name, or am I a chip off the old block who is emulating his father
and thereby seeking his approval? The answer is both.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former editorial director of the Free Press, Adam built his
literary reputation around nonfiction. He spent his 20's writing
short stories, but turned down offers of publication to escape the
inevitable comparisons to his father, a Nobel laureate. But his
father will always be the most important editor in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the first 50 pages to read,'' Adam said, referring
to his book. ``After he read them, I threw them away. They were
awful. He was very nice about it. He said, `You're a very good
writer and your ideas are very interesting, and I just have one
reservation.' I knew there was a problem, and he put his finger on
it.''

&HT;     CONGRESSMAN URGES AID FOR IRAQI CIVILIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressman who recently toured hospitals, health
clinics and schools in Iraq on Monday urged the United Nations to
ease sanctions so that more food and medicine can flow into the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, said the United Nations should do
everything it can ``to alleviate the suffering of the innocent
people who are not the intended targets of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of malnourished children'' in Iraq, he said.
``I've seen malnourished children in many lands and I know what I'm
looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 Gulf War, the United Nations has maintained
sanctions against Iraq as a way to compel President Saddam Hussein
to comply with post-war agreements to destroy weapons of mass
destruction. Since 1996, however, the United Nations has
periodically allowed Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy
food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Hall told a news conference that the sanctions have created
problems with the Iraqi economy and population that did not exist
in the 1970s and 1980s. He said the national unemployment rate
stands somewhere between 50 and 65 percent, and illnesses such as
polio and cholera pose major threats to public health.
</P>
<P>
   He said at least a quarter of Iraq's children under age seven
are malnourished and that infant mortality rates are among the
highest in the world. He charged that Iraqi children are not
getting help in part because of holdups of supply deliveries that
result from the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio congressman, who also has undertaken independent
humanitarian missions to North Korea and Ethiopia, traveled to Iraq
April 16-20 to determine whether reports of Iraqi hardship were
correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is ample evidence to show that Iraq is facing serious
humanitarian problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said items such refrigerators are needed in Iraq to store
vaccines for polio. However, the United States and allies like
Britain are reluctant to send these items into Iraq, fearing they
may be used to bolster the nation's military operations rather than
help civilians.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin told a news conference
Monday that the United States had been working to lift ``any
unnecessary holds'' on humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as allowing dual purpose goods in, we've tended to err
on the cautious side given Saddam Hussein's track record of using
dual-purpose goods to produce chemical weapons,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Iraq should be prevented from developing chemical and
biological weapons, but added that loosened regulations are needed
to help civilians.
</P>
<P>
   He also faulted the Iraqi government for refusing to allow
humanitarian workers from other nations into the country, and he
accused Hussein's regime of being uncooperative with the United
Nations.

A CHILD ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's wisdom in returning Elian Gonzalez
to his father was confirmed over the weekend by the decision of his
Miami relatives and their Republican allies to further politicize
what ought to be a straightforward child-custody case. Elian is
finally getting time to reconnect with his father in a quiet,
neutral setting where he is no longer a metaphor for the war
between the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles from his temporary home at Andrews Air Force Base,
Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Representative Tom DeLay of
Texas, both Republicans, and the relatives were treating the raid
to return Elian as though it were a Nazi SS operation. Yet federal
agents had a warrant, were enforcing US law, and entered the house
with the proper force to ensure minimal resistance and injury. It
was a model of efficient law enforcement, guided by due process.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was necessary because the Gonzalez relatives in Miami,
refusing to return the boy, made him into a symbol of resistance to
Fidel Castro. Elian printed his name on an application for asylum
and was put in front of a video camera to say that he did not want
to go back to Cuba. The relatives treated the boy like a political
prop.
</P>
<P>
   As did Castro, a master manipulator of public opinion in Cuba.
Had the relatives allowed Elian to return to Cuba, they would have
denied the dictator an opportunity to reenergize support for his
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez apparently is a Castro supporter, but that
should not disqualify him from being reunited with his child. Ever
since he first learned that Elian was in Florida last November, he
has been persistent in seeking the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has developed great affection for the Miami relatives. It
would be ideal if they could have returned him to his father yet
stayed in contact while their appeal was pending in court.
Negotiations failed, however, because they insisted on taking the
place of the father, rather than being treated as concerned, yet
distant, relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Juan and Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States pending
the appeal. The father can remain here, but he can also return to
Cuba if he wishes. Like any other 6-year-old in the care of a
loving parent, Elian should go wherever that parent wants.

A DECEPTIVE ABORTION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nebraska abortion law being argued before the US Supreme
Court Tuesday _ the first abortion case to reach the court since
1992 _ may at first appear to restrict late-term abortions. In
fact, Nebraska's so-called ``partial-birth abortion'' ban would
outlaw a selected abortion procedure at any stage of pregnancy,
even a few weeks after conception and even if a doctor concluded
that the method was the safest choice for the patient.
</P>
<P>
   In these two important ways _ not making an exception for the
health of the mother and outlawing abortions even very early in
pregnancy _ the Nebraska law aims straight at the heart of Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Roe established a careful balance of rights between the pregnant
woman and the fetus, saying that after the second trimester a woman
can have an abortion only if her health or life is threatened. The
Nebraska law upends this balance by placing fetal rights above a
woman's health. And it inserts a pernicious redefinition of
abortion rights based not on gestation but on the location of the
fetus. Once a fetus is partially removed from the woman's uterus _
at any stage of its development _ the Nebraska law could make any
abortion a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states have passed such laws using almost identically
vague language. In the 21 states where they have been challenged,
18 have been blocked or declared unconstitutional by lower courts.
This actually includes the Nebraska law, but other decisions in
Wisconsin and Illinois have created a split between circuits,
bringing the issue before the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's case is called Stenberg v. Carhart, named for
Nebraska's attorney general and Dr. Leroy Carhart, an abortion
provider who has been moved to activism by threats, harassment, and
arson that destroyed his home in 1991, killing the family pets and
17 horses. In a statement released when the court announced it
would hear the case, Carhart said, ``No doctor should accept being
forced to provide less than the best medical care.'' We hope the
justices will share Carhart's courage to depoliticize medicine and
keep abortion safe and legal.

A SCION CLAIMS MEXICO'S TELEVISA EMPIRE AS HIS OWN

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not even his own father was sure that Emilio
Azcarraga Jean could run Grupo Televisa SA, the world's biggest
Spanish-language broadcast conglomerate that has loomed large over
Mexican life for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When his father, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, died in April 1997, he
had not tapped his 29-year-old son to succeed him as chairman of
the empire but had instead handed that post to another young
executive. What he did bequeath to his only son was the presidency
of a bloated and stumbling enterprise, debts estimated at $1.3
billion and a tangled estate that quickly generated a struggle
among the heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just three years later, the junior Azcarraga is the
chairman, president and undisputed leader of Televisa. He survived
one internal power showdown after another, refinanced his debts and
consolidated financial control of the $9 billion corporation. He
retired nearly an entire generation of management chosen by his
father, including 46 vice presidents, and revolutionized the
operating culture by imposing cost controls and laying off 6,000 of
the company's 20,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   He also declared political independence for the network's news
shows, which under his father had been unabashedly pro-government.
That lent a new openness to the campaigns leading up to
presidential elections in July.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa, which had a virtual monopoly on TV broadcasting in
Mexico until the early 1990s, has fought insurgent competition to
rebuild its share of the viewing audience to 80 percent from a low
of 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview, Azcarraga said he decided to re-create
Televisa by running it as a ``directed democracy'' and by setting
goals that he would systematically meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to measure for myself if I was the right one to be
president of this company,'' said Azcarraga, who carefully avoided
directly discussing his father. His approach was a radical
departure from that of the elder Azcarraga, known as ``the Tiger,''
who was both freewheeling and fiercely autocratic. During the
25-year reign of his father _ who had inherited the company from
his own father _ Televisa depended largely on the acuity of its
leader's impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a strategy for gaining control,'' Azcarraga
said, recalling the uncertain days after his father's death when he
owned only 10 percent of Televicentro, the holding company that his
father had controlled and that, in turn, controls 26 percent of
Televisa. ``I had a strategy for restoring the company.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was aware of investors' doubts. ``When I went to New York
in 1997 to explain what we wanted to do,'' he added, ``70 percent
of them didn't believe a word I said.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers had recommended that he sell out. ``But this company
was made by my family and I have an important moral stake in it,''
Azcarraga said. ``Besides, it was easy for me to gamble. I had
nothing to lose. I was only 29.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevail, Azcarraga had to take on some Mexican business
titans.
</P>
<P>
   His father, just weeks before he died, had designated Guillermo
Canedo White to lead the board of directors. Canedo was a young
media executive whose father had been a close associate of the
elder Azcarraga's.
</P>
<P>
   But Canedo soon tried to dominate Azcarraga, who turned for help
to Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga, a cousin with long experience in
Televisa. Within months, Canedo was forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized very quickly that we were dealing with a complete
Azcarraga,'' said Enrique Krauze, a historian and publisher who
sits on the Televisa board. ``When his father was alive people
called him Little Emilio. But once they saw him in action that
stopped right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a second round of succession strife, Azcarraga parted
ways early last year with the Aleman family. The family had been
Televisa shareholders for decades and its patriarch, Miguel Aleman
Valdes, had been president of Mexico in the 1940s. In the battle of
wills between the families Azcarraga stood firm. In the end, the
Alemans bowed out gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga said the Alemans even recommended a solid gold
replacement. Last May their piece of Televicentro plus some other
shares were snapped up by Carlos Slim Helu, the billionaire
financier and chairman of the telecommunications giant Telefonos de
Mexico SA. In all, through his financial group, Sinca Inbursa SA,
Slim bought 23.9 percent of Televisa's holding company in a deal in
which he agreed to always vote with Azcarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to convince him,'' Azcarraga said. ``He saw a
good company with people who had a good plan, and that's what Slim
looks at.'' Slim's bet paid off: Before the recent turbulence, the
trading price of Televisa shares had more than doubled since he
bought in.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga, who has been busy accumulating shares of his own, now
holds 51 percent of Televicentro. With the decision-making power he
gained over Slim's shares, he has control of almost 75 percent of
the holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The next, and perhaps last, major succession contest is under
way, placing Azcarraga on the opposite side of the negotiating
table from Burillo, the cousin who came to his rescue in the
perilous early days. Burillo, another member of the traditional
Televisa inner circle who has said he did not feel comfortable
taking a seat behind his younger relative, left his post as
president of international affairs in October.
</P>
<P>
   Now Burillo, who has remained on the Televisa board, wants to
sell his 25.1 percent stake in Televicentro, both sides in the
negotiations confirmed. Despite friction between the cousins,
Azcarraga said, their talks ``are on good terms.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in his chairman's office, the scion who
once hesitated to speak even in closed meetings displayed the
unstudied confidence that distinguished his grandfather and father,
whose portraits fill the wall behind his desk. He sat in
shirtsleeves in an easy chair with eight remote controls lined up
before him, keeping one eye on a bank of TV screens as he talked.
</P>
<P>
   Several Televisa officials said that the most striking
difference between Azcarraga and his imperious father is that he
listens and delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to hear all kinds of opinions,'' he said. ``We have a
lot of meetings now, we talk things out. We try to reach a
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga, who is largely self-taught on financial matters, has
surrounded himself with an adept team that still has a family feel.
Among his closest advisers are Bernardo Gomez and Jose Antonio
Baston, friends from his school days, and Alfonso de Angoitia, a
vice president, who was his lawyer through the succession wars.
</P>
<P>
   The inner circle also includes Gilberto Perezalonso, an
implacable cost cutter, and Jaime Davila, the programming
executive, the only person in the top rung to have survived from
the elder Azcarraga's era.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga also engineered a shakeup in programming, moving away
from a his father's system in which lifetime loyalty was required
of stars and defectors were ruthlessly ostracized. He has also
tried to install a more modern and politically open generation of
news anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is my editorial line?'' he said. ``It's very simple _ to
inform as much as possible, as well as possible. The viewer has to
decide on his thinking and ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades Televisa news was dominated by one man: the
nighttime anchor Jacobo Zabludovsky, who was happy to place his
show at the service of Mexico's closed one-party system. Azcarraga
retired him from the nighttime broadcast and has forced other
anchors to share their decision-making with off-camera executive
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's news stars have chafed at having their personal power
reduced. Late last month, three of the network's most influential
newsmen quit in one week, including Zabludovsky, who was still
anchoring specials, and his son Abraham, also an anchorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 18 I really didn't care if there was freedom of
expression in Mexico or not,'' Azcarraga said. ``But in the last
decade, since I have been working here, I have seen incredible
changes. The system changed. It opened up to democracy.''

   Azcarraga added that he never received the phone calls from the
Interior Ministry with ``suggestions'' for coverage that were
routine in the days of his father. Yet he has made it clear that he
will not stray far from the government's beaten path. His
admiration for President Ernesto Zedillo, a member of the ruling
PRI party, was effusive.
</P>
<P>
   One Televisa journalist, Ricardo Rocha, made his mark with bold
documentary exposes that revealed the complicity of the PRI in two
massacres of rural farmers. Last year Televisa leaders banned the
airing of another expose that was critical of the government. In
May Rocha quietly resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Wall Street analysts to increase growth, Azcarraga is
immersed in an array of projects. In Mexico, where advertising
rates are the cheapest in the hemisphere, he plans to double the
Televisa price in three years, expecting to double ad revenues by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   To give the company greater flexibility for new investments, he
is completing a complex tender offer on $970 million of Televisa's
foreign bonds, which carried heavy restrictions. Cablevision SA de
CV, the cable company Televisa owns jointly with Slim, is preparing
to go public in May, in part to raise capital to expand outside
Mexico City. Responding to demands from regulators concerned about
Slim's vast telecommunications holdings, Slim will sell down his
stake in the cable venture.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga is also ready to begin esmas.com, Televisa's Internet
portal. The name means ``it's more,'' but analysts had begun to
refer to it as ``it's late.'' Azcarraga said he thought that
Televisa would eventually make an Internet alliance, but for now it
would go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Azcarraga is working to bury the bad old Televisa without
rejecting his father _ a delicate task.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is re-creating the company by erasing his father's
shadow,'' said Claudia Fernandez, a Mexican writer who just
published ``El Tigre,'' a biography of the elder Azcarraga. ``But
he has done it by gaining investors' respect for what he can do by
himself.''

 &HT;    AS ACCUSATIONS FLY, CONGRESS PREPARES FOR HEARINGS ON ELIAN RAID
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert joined a growing
chorus of Republican criticism Monday over the use of force in last
weekend's pre-dawn raid on the home of Elian Gonzalez's Miami
relatives, calling on a House panel to hold hearings on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Clinton administration
officials, meanwhile, went on the offensive, blaming the Miami
relatives for forcing the confrontation and suggesting that a
congressional probe would be a political ploy aimed at diverting
attention from more pressing national issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we had to do,'' Reno said on NBC's Today Show. ``I
have no regrets whatsoever. I tried my level best to make sure that
we avoided this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton was
``convinced that the operation ... was the right thing to do and
was the only alternative remaining to us to reunite the boy with
his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, and about a dozen senators who have criticized the
raid, in a Capitol room normally used for national security
briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to politicize this,'' said Lott spokesman John
Czwartacki. ``We don't want to have a three-ring circus on the
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said no decision had been made whether the Senate
also would convene hearings on the raid, but Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he was considering it.
Czwartacki also said no decision had been made on whether to
consider bills that would confer either U.S. citizenship or
permanent residency status on the boy.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said as
per Hastert's request, a ``preliminary inquiry'' would begin soon
and ``will focus on whether the use of such force was necessary or
appropriate under all of the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row, the Miami relatives were turned away
at the gate of Andrews Air Force Base. Elian and his father,
step-mother and half-brother have been living on the base since
Saturday, but there were continuing reports that they might
relocate to the Wye River Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore _
the site of the Middle East peace talks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-American leaders called for a strike Tuesday to
demonstrate opposition to the raid. About 60 women dressed in black
held a protest outside the federal courthouse displaying copies of
the picture taken Saturday morning of an armed federal agent
confronting Elian in the arms of one of the fishermen who rescued
him last Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   On the legal front, the U.S. Justice Department attempted to
file its arguments with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, which has scheduled a hearing for the week of May 11 on
the issue of who can speak for the boy on the question of political
asylum. The legal brief was too long, so the government asked for
more time to file its arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled in January that
only the boy's father can speak for him on such issues. Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has promised to remain in the United
States until the appeals process is completed, but has repeatedly
said he wants to return with the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian lived with his Miami relatives from late November _ after
he was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean following the death of
his mother and nine others whose boat sank fleeing Cuba _ until
federal agents raided the home shortly after 5 a.m. (EST) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Controversy continued Monday over not only the conduct of the
raid but whether it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Podhurst, a friend of Reno's for 30 years who was
negotiating a transfer of Elian on the telephone with her when the
raid began, reiterated his claim that an agreement was imminent
that would have prevented the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a deal was within minutes or an hour away,''
Podhurst said on NBC's Today Show. When the raid began, ``I was
shocked, I was disappointed, I couldn't believe what I was looking
at it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Podhurst called Reno ``a extraordinarily strong
woman'' who made a different decision than the one he would have
made.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who said she trusted Podhurst ``with my life,'' said the
negotiations collapsed over the family's repeated insistence that
they meet with Juan Miguel in South Florida _ after previously
promising to meet with him anywhere _ and their refusal to agree to
release Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept getting mixed signals ... from a family that had
given us hope and then pulled it back, said they would comply with
the law and then said on several occasions that we would have to
take the child by force,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, asked about Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham's claim
that Clinton had promised him the raid would not be conducted at
night, said Clinton had merely been expressing his hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president said to Sen. Graham ... was that we didn't
want to do this, we thought there was a better way,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also disputed Graham's claim that Gregory Craig, the
attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had veto power over attempts to
negotiate an agreement on custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continued to criticize the use of force , however.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in calling for the Judiciary Committee hearings, said
he was ``appalled by the Clinton-Gore administration's decision to
use force in Miami to wrest Elian Gonzalez from his American
relatives. In doing so, our government has invaded the home of
American citizens who deserve the protection of our laws and a
certain respect for their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the third-ranking GOP House member,
said ``it's hard to imagine how (the administration) made this
child's safety a top priority when the Clinton-Gore administration
orders armed strangers wearing masks and guns to break into his
Miami house and whisk him away in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Reno, Rep. Bill McCollum, chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on crime, asked for answers within 24 hours
to a series of questions regarding the reasons for the raid and its
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one overriding concern each of us has expressed throughout
this case is that the psychological well-being of Elian Gonzalez be
paramount,'' McCollum said. ``How can you possibly reconcile that
goal with the reality of the boy waking up to an armed invader in
his home pointing assault weapons and screaming obscenities at him
and his loved ones?''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the public ``should not be surprised that the
first reaction from Capitol Hill is ... personal attacks on the
attorney general, personal attacks on the president, and then an
announcement of extensive investigative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make the choice that this is what they want to
dominate the next weeks and months, and not issues like
prescription drugs and minimum wage and patients' bill of rights,
that's the choice they make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton was briefed on the general details of the
raid before it began and he concurred in its execution. Lockhart
blamed the Miami relatives for the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this could have been avoided; none of this had to happen.
This happened because the family did not respect the legal
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to several tearful news conferences by the Miami
relatives' since the raid, Lockhart said ``no matter how loudly
they yell, no matter how impassioned their arguments are, when it
came down to the very simple issue of would the Miami relatives
respect the decision that the father had custody of the boy, the
answer was always 'no.'''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials defended the extent of force
used in conducting the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Cooper, INS general counsel, said ``there is a big difference
between a show of force and a use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that there had been reports that some demonstrators
outside the house might have weapons _ and uncertainty whether
anyone inside the house was armed _ Cooper said ``you can't bet in
a situation like this. You have to be ready for any eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy display of force and the timing of the raid before
dawn _ when there were relatively few protestors outside the house
_ were planned to minimize the risk of serious injuries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the Miami raid would add another probe to a series
of congressional inquiries of the Clinton administration.
Currently, the House Judiciary Committee is investigating the
Justice Department's handling of the Branch Davidian case in Waco,
Texas in 1993, allegations of campaign finance violations by the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and the transfer of nuclear secrets
to the Chinese government in the late 1990s. These investigations
follow the Clinton impeachment hearings and effort to remove him
from office in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Charles Cook said Republicans could be in
danger of looking like they are obsessed with politically motivated
investigations that have little resonance with the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Texas Gov. George W.) Bush is handling it right and
(House Majority Leader Tom) DeLay is handling it wrong,'' Cook
said, noting that DeLay has been outspoken in demanding an
investigation while Bush has been only mildly critical of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing the Republicans could do is have this
investigation,'' Cook said, noting that voters most opposed to the
raid are Cuban-Americans and conservatives and neither group are
swing voters. ``They're going down the road they went with
impeachment. They're so consumed with placating their base, they
forget that is not what swing voters are interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center
for Government Studies, said that if Republicans continue focusing
on the raid for too long ``the really silent majority that favored
the action might become aroused. If this is still going on in a
week or two, I'd say they're making their typical political
miscalculations.''

PRACTITIONERS OFFER EXTRA ATTENTION FOR PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Restores Mr. for patient named Mr. Godel, beginning in 3rd
graf; no first name.) 
(The Science Times)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eileen Cafasso's conversation with her patient was
expansive, touching on his taste for turnip paste, his number of
daily bananas, his self-diagnosed addiction to cheese. There was
time for him to ask about a particular blood pressure drug he had
read about, and for her to ask how he had spent his holidays.
</P>
<P>
   There was no watching of wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Godel, 79, who works in the mail room at Chase Manhattan
Bank, started seeing Cafasso, a nurse practitioner, a year and a
half ago, when he grew dissatisfied with the care he was getting
from his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other one was giving me the bum's rush,'' said Mr. Godel,
who lives in Brooklyn. ``He was a heart specialist with too large a
work load. There was no way in the world they could they take care
of their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurse practitioners are able to prescribe medicine and, in some
states, admit patients to the hospital. They pride themselves on
their ability to spend more time with patients, focusing on illness
prevention. For example, Cafasso, 34, spends about an hour with her
patients on their first visit to the Columbia Advanced Practice
Nurse Associates in Manhattan, which includes two other nurse
practitioners. Their practice has 500 patients, and Cafasso usually
sees 8 to 10 a day. By comparison, some doctors see 20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses' practice was the focus of a study published in
January in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The
study found no significant differences in the quality of care
received by patients randomly assigned either to doctors or nurse
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who used emergency rooms for their health care and had
no regular doctors were offered care for a year from doctors or
nurses affiliated with Columbia University. The researchers
measured the patients' satisfaction with their care, their health,
(using physiologic test results for those with diabetes and asthma)
and their use of emergency rooms and other medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quality of care was essentially the same, there
were three statistically significant differences between the
groups. Hypertensive patients treated by nurse practitioners saw
greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure than patients in the
doctor group. People treated by nurses were more likely to stick
with their provider's care than those treated by doctors; those
treated by doctors were more satisfied with their technical skill,
personal manner and, notably, time spent with the patient. But
while these differences were measurable, none were considered
likely to affect a patient's health.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary O. Mundinger, dean of the Columbia nursing school and
the study's lead author, said the research had profound
implications. ``For those looking to get primary care from a nurse
practitioner, they can feel increasingly safe and confident in
doing so, as a result of this study,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The position of nurse practitioner was created in the mid-1960s
by a physician and nurse at the University of Colorado, working to
improve public health nursing. A nurse practitioner is now
generally required to have a master's degree in nursing, which
usually is a two-year program. Practitioners receive training in
topics like those taught to medical residents in primary care,
including taking medical histories and doing physical exams.
</P>
<P>
   At first they worked mostly with poor and rural patients, but
their skills were easily transferred to primary care, and they are
now increasingly seen in hospitals and in independent practices.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Cafasso treated people who welcomed the
time she was able to spend with them, talking about what ailed them
and how they could get and stay healthier. Kerry Hillard, 24, of
Manhattan, an editor with Baby Talk magazine, had a nasty cold in
the midst of her deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting, we don't realize the impact stress has on
our health,'' Cafasso told her. ``We don't really sleep or eat as
well, and we're more susceptible to colds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillard has referred people to the practice. ``Here it seems
they are much more concerned with other aspects of your life: work,
nutrition, exercise and prevention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cafasso, an assistant professor at the Columbia School of
Nursing, where she received a master's of science, likes such
encounters because she can make more accurate diagnoses when she
understands what is going on in a patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, someone comes in and says she is going through
a divorce, Cafasso says she tries to find out more. ``I'll ask how
are they coping with it, what kind of support system do they
have,'' she said. ``Clinically, it can tell you a lot.'' By
learning about a patient's coping mechanisms, she can assess how
rigidly the person may comply with particular health regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Cafasso, married with an infant daughter, followed her mother
into nursing. After 10 years, she got the extra training to be a
nurse practitioner, saying she wanted more decision-making power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could really give more to my patients by going on for
my advanced degree,'' she said. Her patients get, on average, 15
minutes longer with her than they would with a physician, based on
the American Medical Association's measures of average lengths of
doctor visits. ``We try to work with the patient individually to
get them to have a healthier life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are those in medicine who are suspicious of the
finding that nurse practitioners can be as effective as physicians.
In an editorial accompanying the results of the Columbia study, Dr.
Harold C. Sox of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover,
N.H., criticized it for being too short and for working primarily
with Hispanic women in their 40's, a group not representative of
the population. (Women in their 40s are, on average, healthier than
the general population, and Hispanic women tend to have less
trouble with their pregnancies than others, though far higher rates
of diabetes and asthma.)
</P>
<P>
   Sox speculated that nurse practitioners might not fare as well
with more complicated cases, when they had to admit patients to a
hospital, care for them while there, and make appropriate choices
about drugs, which physicians spend many years learning, under
heavy supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we have a study that really tests independent nurse
practitioners' ability to do some of these things for which they
haven't had as much training as physicians,'' Sox said in a phone
interview, ``we shouldn't make the claim that they're
interchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   But in defending her research, Mundinger pointed out that it
would be difficult to conduct a careful, randomized study on the
general population, because few people are willing to be randomly
assigned to a doctor or nurse. ``Those of us who are lucky enough
to have commercial insurance for health care have a strong
preference to choose our own provider,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, comes down to dollars, and how the
study will be used by insurers, hospitals and private practices
hoping to cut costs. In his editorial about the study, Sox
cautioned, ``Its evidence that nurse practitioners and primary care
physicians could be interchangeable is far from convincing, but the
marketplace is not given to fine judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nurse practitioners appear to be cost effective, earning
about half to two-thirds of what primary care physicians earn.
Nurse practitioners in New York City are usually paid $80,000 to
$100,000 a year; statewide they receive, on average, $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sox noted that the primary care nurse practitioner work force is
projected to increase from 55,000 to 106,500, between 1995 and
2005, while the number of primary care physicians is expected to
increase by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Columbia study, taken in the context of cost control and
the growth of the nurse practitioner work force, is likely to mean
more competition for general internists and family physicians,''
Sox wrote. That, he added, is good for the patient, but bad for
doctors who invested a great deal of energy in their training but
could not keep ``busy enough to sustain their skills and earn a
reasonable living.''
</P>
<P>
   Mundinger said she hoped the study would provoke debate on how
public finances are allocated to medical education. Most money, she
said, now goes to train doctors. And Cafasso noted that some
physicians who had worked closely with nurse practitioners saw how
patients benefited from the additional emphasis on health promotion
and disease prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, nurse practitioners must work well with doctors,
consulting them when patients' problems are beyond nurses'
expertise. For example, when Cafasso was concerned about Mr.
Godel's health, she referred him to a new cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Recently she discussed the results of his stress test with him
and told him that his cardiologist believed he might benefit from
an angiogram. When Mr. Godel cringed, she tried to reassure him.
``I would never order you to do something you don't want,'' she
recalled telling him, then reminding him of the tightness he had
felt in his neck, a possible indication of risk for a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Cafasso said her meeting with Mr. Godel illustrated what
she enjoyed most about her job. ``I think the ability to spend that
extra time with patients,'' she said, ``somehow gets across to
patients that you understand their concerns.''

 &HT;    AS ACCUSATIONS FLY, CONGRESS PREPARES FOR HEARINGS ON ELIAN RAID
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert joined a growing
chorus of Republican criticism Monday over the use of force in last
weekend's pre-dawn raid on the home of Elian Gonzalez's Miami
relatives, calling on a House panel to hold hearings on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Clinton administration
officials, meanwhile, went on the offensive, blaming the Miami
relatives for forcing the confrontation and suggesting that a
congressional probe would be a political ploy aimed at diverting
attention from more pressing national issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we had to do,'' Reno said on NBC's Today Show. ``I
have no regrets whatsoever. I tried my level best to make sure that
we avoided this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton was
``convinced that the operation ... was the right thing to do and
was the only alternative remaining to us to reunite the boy with
his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, and about a dozen senators who have criticized the
raid, in a Capitol room normally used for national security
briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to politicize this,'' said Lott spokesman John
Czwartacki. ``We don't want to have a three-ring circus on the
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said no decision had been made whether the Senate
also would convene hearings on the raid, but Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he was considering it.
Czwartacki also said no decision had been made on whether to
consider bills that would confer either U.S. citizenship or
permanent residency status on the boy.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said as
per Hastert's request, a ``preliminary inquiry'' would begin soon
and ``will focus on whether the use of such force was necessary or
appropriate under all of the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row, the Miami relatives were turned away
at the gate of Andrews Air Force Base. Elian and his father,
step-mother and half-brother have been living on the base since
Saturday, but there were continuing reports that they might
relocate to the Wye River Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore _
the site of the Middle East peace talks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-American leaders called for a strike Tuesday to
demonstrate opposition to the raid. About 60 women dressed in black
held a protest outside the federal courthouse displaying copies of
the picture taken Saturday morning of an armed federal agent
confronting Elian in the arms of one of the fishermen who rescued
him last Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   On the legal front, the U.S. Justice Department attempted to
file its arguments with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, which has scheduled a hearing for the week of May 11 on
the issue of who can speak for the boy on the question of political
asylum. The legal brief was too long, so the government asked for
more time to file its arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled in January that
only the boy's father can speak for him on such issues. Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has promised to remain in the United
States until the appeals process is completed, but has repeatedly
said he wants to return with the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian lived with his Miami relatives from late November _ after
he was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean following the death of
his mother and nine others whose boat sank fleeing Cuba _ until
federal agents raided the home shortly after 5 a.m. (EST) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Controversy continued Monday over not only the conduct of the
raid but whether it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Podhurst, a friend of Reno's for 30 years who was
negotiating a transfer of Elian on the telephone with her when the
raid began, reiterated his claim that an agreement was imminent
that would have prevented the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a deal was within minutes or an hour away,''
Podhurst said on NBC's Today Show. When the raid began, ``I was
shocked, I was disappointed, I couldn't believe what I was looking
at it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Podhurst called Reno ``a extraordinarily strong
woman'' who made a different decision than the one he would have
made.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who said she trusted Podhurst ``with my life,'' said the
negotiations collapsed over the family's repeated insistence that
they meet with Juan Miguel in South Florida _ after previously
promising to meet with him anywhere _ and their refusal to agree to
release Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept getting mixed signals ... from a family that had
given us hope and then pulled it back, said they would comply with
the law and then said on several occasions that we would have to
take the child by force,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, asked about Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham's claim
that Clinton had promised him the raid would not be conducted at
night, said Clinton had merely been expressing his hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president said to Sen. Graham ... was that we didn't
want to do this, we thought there was a better way,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also disputed Graham's claim that Gregory Craig, the
attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had veto power over attempts to
negotiate an agreement on custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continued to criticize the use of force , however.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in calling for the Judiciary Committee hearings, said
he was ``appalled by the Clinton-Gore administration's decision to
use force in Miami to wrest Elian Gonzalez from his American
relatives. In doing so, our government has invaded the home of
American citizens who deserve the protection of our laws and a
certain respect for their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the third-ranking GOP House member,
said ``it's hard to imagine how (the administration) made this
child's safety a top priority when the Clinton-Gore administration
orders armed strangers wearing masks and guns to break into his
Miami house and whisk him away in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Reno, Rep. Bill McCollum, chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on crime, asked for answers within 24 hours
to a series of questions regarding the reasons for the raid and its
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one overriding concern each of us has expressed throughout
this case is that the psychological well-being of Elian Gonzalez be
paramount,'' McCollum said. ``How can you possibly reconcile that
goal with the reality of the boy waking up to an armed invader in
his home pointing assault weapons and screaming obscenities at him
and his loved ones?''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the public ``should not be surprised that the
first reaction from Capitol Hill is ... personal attacks on the
attorney general, personal attacks on the president, and then an
announcement of extensive investigative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make the choice that this is what they want to
dominate the next weeks and months, and not issues like
prescription drugs and minimum wage and patients' bill of rights,
that's the choice they make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton was briefed on the general details of the
raid before it began and he concurred in its execution. Lockhart
blamed the Miami relatives for the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this could have been avoided; none of this had to happen.
This happened because the family did not respect the legal
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to several tearful news conferences by the Miami
relatives' since the raid, Lockhart said ``no matter how loudly
they yell, no matter how impassioned their arguments are, when it
came down to the very simple issue of would the Miami relatives
respect the decision that the father had custody of the boy, the
answer was always 'no.'''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials defended the extent of force
used in conducting the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Cooper, INS general counsel, said ``there is a big difference
between a show of force and a use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that there had been reports that some demonstrators
outside the house might have weapons _ and uncertainty whether
anyone inside the house was armed _ Cooper said ``you can't bet in
a situation like this. You have to be ready for any eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy display of force and the timing of the raid before
dawn _ when there were relatively few protestors outside the house
_ were planned to minimize the risk of serious injuries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the Miami raid would add another probe to a series
of congressional inquiries of the Clinton administration.
Currently, the House Judiciary Committee is investigating the
Justice Department's handling of the Branch Davidian case in Waco,
Texas in 1993, allegations of campaign finance violations by the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and the transfer of nuclear secrets
to the Chinese government in the late 1990s. These investigations
follow the Clinton impeachment hearings and effort to remove him
from office in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Charles Cook said Republicans could be in
danger of looking like they are obsessed with politically motivated
investigations that have little resonance with the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Texas Gov. George W.) Bush is handling it right and
(House Majority Leader Tom) DeLay is handling it wrong,'' Cook
said, noting that DeLay has been outspoken in demanding an
investigation while Bush has been only mildly critical of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing the Republicans could do is have this
investigation,'' Cook said, noting that voters most opposed to the
raid are Cuban-Americans and conservatives and neither group are
swing voters. ``They're going down the road they went with
impeachment. They're so consumed with placating their base, they
forget that is not what swing voters are interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center
for Government Studies, said that if Republicans continue focusing
on the raid for too long ``the really silent majority that favored
the action might become aroused. If this is still going on in a
week or two, I'd say they're making their typical political
miscalculations.''

&HT;     MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES GEAR UP FOR DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Although it is not exactly an American style
democratic face-off, aspirants to the Mexican presidency will meet
in a live television debate Tuesday night for the second time in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter, the first one since 1994, could make or break two
of the main contenders in a close presidential campaign that,
analysts say, is the first time an opponent could unseat the
candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. The
party, known as the PRI, has been in power for 71 years, making it
the longest-ruling political party in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate will give us a chance to see the real level of the
campaign,'' said Erick Fernandez, a political analyst at the
Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. ``Even though the format
will not allow an exchange of ideas like they do in democratic
societies, there will be a solidifying of political positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute exchange begins in the evening rush hour, when
most Mexicans are not home or are just leaving work. There will be
no questions from the media, and the occasion will only provide
revolving opportunities for each candidate to speak for a total of
14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A second debate with only the three top contenders for the July
2 election is scheduled for late May.
</P>
<P>
   The race is a tight one between veteran Francisco Labastida, an
economist who has served in important cabinet posts of several PRI
administrations, and Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive and
ex-governor of the state of Guanajuato state with the center-right
National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the first elected mayor of Mexico City and
a three-time presidential candidate, has been running a distant
third in the polls. But a good showing in the debate could bring
Cardenas' numbers up at a time when even some important backers of
his leftist-center Democratic Revolutionary Party have urged him to
drop from the race.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll in the Mexico City daily Reforma published Monday
gave Labastida 47 percentage points, compared with 39 percent for
Fox and 12 percent for Cardenas. The numbers have remained steady
since January, although internal polls by Fox's party has him ahead
by up to 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has been marred by personal insults on both sides.
Fox, who stands well over six feet tall, once joked that Labastida
was a ``shrimp'' because he reportedly needs a stool for the debate
podium.
</P>
<P>
   With a deep voice and trademark cowboy boots, Fox, 57, has
lately not even been addressed Labastida by name, referring to him
instead as ``more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida was last in a debate in November, when he faced
competitors in a PRI primary where he stood his ground against
strong opponents, who saw him as the party favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's strategy during the debate will be to attack the 71 years
of PRI rule and to emphasize Labastida stands for ``more of the
same,'' meaning PRI corruption and fraud in a country of 100
million that remains mired in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will present the precise and failed results of 70 years of
PRI rule,'' Fox said in a radio interview Monday. ``There will be
zero personal attacks and I will focus on my proposals for
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, also 57, said he would spotlight his vast political
experience and policy plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I will be playing a tennis game,'' Labastida,
who last headed the powerful Secretary of the Interior, said in a
morning radio show Monday. ``I will concentrate on . . . the
economy, society, how to generate more jobs, raise salaries.''

IRAN REFORMISTS SUFFER ANOTHER SETBACK AS 12 NEWSPAPERS ARE
BANNED 
</HEADLINE>

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Two months after their triumph in parliamentary
elections, reformers are caught up in a war of nerves with Iran's
conservatives. The hard-liners have closed newspapers, jailed
writers and annulled some election results, making the most
concentrated crackdown on dissent since the 1979 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tehran courts delivered the latest blow late Sunday,
ordering eight dailies and four weeklies to stop publishing
immediately, reform leaders appealed for calm. ``We ask the Iranian
nation to keep calm and to be patient and careful about any action
that could lead to any kind of violence in society,'' pleaded one
of the few surviving reformist newspapers, Sobh-e-Emrouz, in its
Monday morning edition.
</P>
<P>
   All the banned newspapers have supported President Mohammad
Khatami, whose calls for reform of the judiciary and for open
political debate have won him vast public support but also fierce
enemies in the clerical establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the reform movement began shortly after elections
on Feb. 18, when pro-Khatami candidates won nearly 70 percent of
parliamentary seats. The reformers appeared poised to solidify
their victory, and control of the parliament, in a second round of
voting that was expected to take place last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative Council of Guardians, an untouchable group
that has final say over all legislation and many other matters, has
methodically undercut the first-round results.
</P>
<P>
   The council voided the results in 10 provincial constituencies,
saying some victors had not campaigned fairly, and announced that
it will re-examine the ballots in Tehran. Most of the voided races
had been won by Khatami supporters.
</P>
<P>
   No date has yet been set for new elections, raising fears that
the hard-liners will not release their grip on power, by
disregarding the vote entirely. The new parliament is supposed to
take office on May 28.
</P>
<P>
   After the first round, many of the reformers who are now being
hounded were exuberant about their triumph and were predicting the
start of an era of more openness and social freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But the more cautious among them also warned that conservative
forces would not passively relinquish their power over the daily
lives of Iranians and over government institutions like the courts.
</P>
<P>
   They now say they are not surprised at the moves to harass the
reformers through their newspapers. Many conservatives blame their
poor showing at the polls on the feisty press that has blossomed
since Khatami's election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this was predictable,'' said Abdollah Ramezanzadeh, a
close associate of Khatami and governor of Kurdistan Province.
``And we're expecting things to get a little worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Many reformers said they are afraid that Khatami's opponents
will try to set off a backlash that would provide an excuse for
greater repression.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They point to events in Tehran last summer, when university
students who protested the closing of a liberal newspaper were
attacked by vigilantes, sparking riots that Khatami was able to
check only with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's circumstances, the reformers will be the ones to
suffer from any chaos in society,'' said Emadeddin Baghi, an editor
of one of the 12 banned newspapers, Fath. ``So it's important for
us to step back for the moment and stay calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Baghi, 39, will soon face his own test of nerves. He has been
summoned to appear in a Tehran court next Monday to answer charges
that he insulted Islamic values in articles he wrote. He said he
expects to be convicted and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a few days,'' he said of his trial, ``but the
result is already clear in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Baghi would join two other Fath editors,
Akbar Ganji and Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, in prison, as well as the
publisher of Neshat newspaper, Latif Safari. The three were jailed
in the past few weeks after being accused of defaming Islam or the
Iranian Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Khatami's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, has been summoned
to court on charges of violating press guidelines at the newspaper
he helps run.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first blow struck at the reformers after the elections came
when Saeed Hajjarian, a strategist for the movement and close ally
of Khatami, was gunned down in a Tehran street. He survived, and
the assassination attempt was widely blamed on extremist groups
within the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations apparently angered Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who immediately denounced as un-Islamic
those who would besmirch the name of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks set off an escalating series of assaults, verbal and
judicial, on the reformers. The parliament, now dominated by
hard-liners, recently approved a restrictive press law, as well as
legislation that removes institutions like the judiciary and
military from parliamentary monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 140 members signed a petition that called a group of
reform activists traitors for attending a conference in Berlin.
Many of those people who attended the conference have been summoned
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More strident attacks have come from other quarters. Hard-line
clerics have publicly called for the killing of some reformers and
accused the reform press of destroying the values of the
revolution. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a militia that
does not answer to the president, threatened to unleash what it
called ``Islamic violence'' against reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, who controls the militias, courts and state media,
stepped in to cool matters, cautioning against ``illegal action''
to silence the reform movement. But he, too, has accused the
movement of fomenting unrest by trying to link the security
agencies to the killings of dissidents in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the attacks have clearly shaken the reformers,
Khatami's confidantes said they see some positive aspects to the
crackdown. And they said the public's hunger for change cannot be
ignored or discounted for long.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, they said the order to close the newspapers was
ostensibly based on Iranian law, although through a rarely used
1957 statute that permits the government to arrest people or
suspend an activity in order to prevent a possible crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Mr. Khatami's election in 1997, they would just go to
an editor and say, close,'' said Ramezanzadeh, a confidant of the
president's. ``This time they closed the papers according to the
law, even though the law is questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Council of Guardians has even issued explanations _
vague, but still explanations _ for voiding some of the recent
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a Third World country , yet our opponents have
dealt with us very calmly compared to what happens in the countries
around us,'' he added. ``The reform movement has actually forced
the opposition to play by the same rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the operative attitude is one of restraint. Journalists
and lawyers associated with the reformers said they would not react
to the ban on their newspapers in the same way they once did, by
simply reopening a few days later with the same staff but a
different name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't do that,'' said Ali Hekmat, the only one of Fath's
editors to have so far escaped prosecution. ``This time our
opponents are more agitated and more angry. We only have one more
month before the new parliament should start work. Any kind of
action that would provoke our opponents would not be good.''

<P>
   A small group of university students, however, held a rally
Monday to protest the newspaper closures and said it will hold
another protest outside the offices of Fath on Tuesday, despite
entreaties from journalists not to provoke the police.
</P>
<P>
   At Tehran University, where last summer's demonstrations
dissolved into clashes with hard-line vigilantes, the mood was more
restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have come to the same conclusion that it's better
to have peace and calm,'' said Rahim Bahrami, an art student.
``Everything is happening because of the new parliament, and the
extremists are trying to prevent as many reformers as possible from
taking office.''
</P>
<P>
   At a newsstand on Vanak Square, one of the busiest intersections
of Tehran, crowds milled in front of the slim choice of newspapers
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those papers all reported the reality of what's happening
here,'' said a woman in a black chador, or cloak, who gave her name
as Khavar. ``I don't believe much is really hidden in our country.
Even without the media, we can see. But I am worried. This is the
future of our country, and whatever happens, they are punishing us,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Another disappointed newspaper buyer, who also would give only
his first name, Mehrade, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what will happen,'' he said. ``There's a crisis
and it could be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not expect Khatami to do much to overturn the
newspaper closings or the trials of his supporters. ``He can't
perform magic,'' Mehrade said. ``You have to be able to move your
hands to perform. He can move, but very slowly.''

 &HT;    AS ACCUSATIONS FLY, CONGRESS PREPARES FOR HEARINGS ON ELIAN RAID
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADDS)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert joined a growing
chorus of Republican criticism Monday over the use of force in last
weekend's pre-dawn raid on the home of Elian Gonzalez's Miami
relatives, calling on a House panel to hold hearings on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Clinton administration
officials, meanwhile, went on the offensive, blaming the Miami
relatives for forcing the confrontation and suggesting that a
congressional probe would be a political ploy aimed at diverting
attention from more pressing national issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we had to do,'' Reno said on NBC's Today Show. ``I
have no regrets whatsoever. I tried my level best to make sure that
we avoided this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton was
``convinced that the operation ... was the right thing to do and
was the only alternative remaining to us to reunite the boy with
his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, and about a dozen senators who have criticized the
raid, in a Capitol room normally used for national security
briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to politicize this,'' said Lott spokesman John
Czwartacki. ``We don't want to have a three-ring circus on the
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said no decision had been made whether the Senate
also would convene hearings on the raid, but Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he was considering it.
He also asked Reno in a letter to provide his panel with ``all
documents'' related to the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki also said no decision had been made on whether to
consider bills that would confer either U.S. citizenship or
permanent residency status on the boy.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said as
per Hastert's request, a ``preliminary inquiry'' would begin soon
and ``will focus on whether the use of such force was necessary or
appropriate under all of the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row, the Miami relatives were turned away
at the gate of Andrews Air Force Base. Elian and his father,
step-mother and half-brother have been living on the base since
Saturday, but there were continuing reports that they might
relocate to the Wye River Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore _
the site of the Middle East peace talks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-American leaders called for a strike Tuesday to
demonstrate opposition to the raid. About 60 women dressed in black
held a protest outside the federal courthouse displaying copies of
the picture taken Saturday morning of an armed federal agent
confronting Elian in the arms of one of the fishermen who rescued
him last Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   On the legal front, the U.S. Justice Department attempted to
file its arguments with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, which has scheduled a hearing for the week of May 11 on
the issue of who can speak for the boy on the question of political
asylum. The legal brief was too long, so the government asked for
more time to file its arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled in January that
only the boy's father can speak for him on such issues. Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has promised to remain in the United
States until the appeals process is completed, but has repeatedly
said he wants to return with the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian lived with his Miami relatives from late November _ after
he was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean following the death of
his mother and nine others whose boat sank fleeing Cuba _ until
federal agents raided the home shortly after 5 a.m. (EST) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Controversy continued Monday over not only the conduct of the
raid but whether it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Podhurst, a friend of Reno's for 30 years who was
negotiating a transfer of Elian on the telephone with her when the
raid began, reiterated his claim that an agreement was imminent
that would have prevented the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a deal was within minutes or an hour away,''
Podhurst said on NBC's Today Show. When the raid began, ``I was
shocked, I was disappointed, I couldn't believe what I was looking
at it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Podhurst called Reno ``a extraordinarily strong
woman'' who made a different decision than the one he would have
made.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who said she trusted Podhurst ``with my life,'' said the
negotiations collapsed over the family's repeated insistence that
they meet with Juan Miguel in South Florida _ after previously
promising to meet with him anywhere _ and their refusal to agree to
release Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept getting mixed signals ... from a family that had
given us hope and then pulled it back, said they would comply with
the law and then said on several occasions that we would have to
take the child by force,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, asked about Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham's claim
that Clinton had promised him the raid would not be conducted at
night, said Clinton had merely been expressing his hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president said to Sen. Graham ... was that we didn't
want to do this, we thought there was a better way,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also disputed Graham's claim that Gregory Craig, the
attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had veto power over attempts to
negotiate an agreement on custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continued to criticize the use of force , however.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in calling for the Judiciary Committee hearings, said
he was ``appalled by the Clinton-Gore administration's decision to
use force in Miami to wrest Elian Gonzalez from his American
relatives. In doing so, our government has invaded the home of
American citizens who deserve the protection of our laws and a
certain respect for their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the third-ranking GOP House member,
said ``it's hard to imagine how (the administration) made this
child's safety a top priority when the Clinton-Gore administration
orders armed strangers wearing masks and guns to break into his
Miami house and whisk him away in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Reno, Rep. Bill McCollum, chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on crime, asked for answers within 24 hours
to a series of questions regarding the reasons for the raid and its
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one overriding concern each of us has expressed throughout
this case is that the psychological well-being of Elian Gonzalez be
paramount,'' McCollum said. ``How can you possibly reconcile that
goal with the reality of the boy waking up to an armed invader in
his home pointing assault weapons and screaming obscenities at him
and his loved ones?''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the public ``should not be surprised that the
first reaction from Capitol Hill is ... personal attacks on the
attorney general, personal attacks on the president, and then an
announcement of extensive investigative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make the choice that this is what they want to
dominate the next weeks and months, and not issues like
prescription drugs and minimum wage and patients' bill of rights,
that's the choice they make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton was briefed on the general details of the
raid before it began and he concurred in its execution. Lockhart
blamed the Miami relatives for the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this could have been avoided; none of this had to happen.
This happened because the family did not respect the legal
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to several tearful news conferences by the Miami
relatives' since the raid, Lockhart said ``no matter how loudly
they yell, no matter how impassioned their arguments are, when it
came down to the very simple issue of would the Miami relatives
respect the decision that the father had custody of the boy, the
answer was always 'no.'''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials defended the extent of force
used in conducting the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Cooper, INS general counsel, said ``there is a big difference
between a show of force and a use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that there had been reports that some demonstrators
outside the house might have weapons _ and uncertainty whether
anyone inside the house was armed _ Cooper said ``you can't bet in
a situation like this. You have to be ready for any eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy display of force and the timing of the raid before
dawn _ when there were relatively few protestors outside the house
_ were planned to minimize the risk of serious injuries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the Miami raid would add another probe to a series
of congressional inquiries of the Clinton administration.
Currently, the House Judiciary Committee is investigating the
Justice Department's handling of the Branch Davidian case in Waco,
Texas in 1993, allegations of campaign finance violations by the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and the transfer of nuclear secrets
to the Chinese government in the late 1990s. These investigations
follow the Clinton impeachment hearings and effort to remove him
from office in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Charles Cook said Republicans could be in
danger of looking like they are obsessed with politically motivated
investigations that have little resonance with the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Texas Gov. George W.) Bush is handling it right and
(House Majority Leader Tom) DeLay is handling it wrong,'' Cook
said, noting that DeLay has been outspoken in demanding an
investigation while Bush has been only mildly critical of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing the Republicans could do is have this
investigation,'' Cook said, noting that voters most opposed to the
raid are Cuban-Americans and conservatives and neither group are
swing voters. ``They're going down the road they went with
impeachment. They're so consumed with placating their base, they
forget that is not what swing voters are interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center
for Government Studies, said that if Republicans continue focusing
on the raid for too long ``the really silent majority that favored
the action might become aroused. If this is still going on in a
week or two, I'd say they're making their typical political
miscalculations.''

   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled in January that
only the boy's father can speak for him on such issues. Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has promised to remain in the United
States until the appeals process is completed, but has repeatedly
said he wants to return with the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian lived with his Miami relatives from late November _ after
he was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean following the death of
his mother and nine others whose boat sank fleeing Cuba _ until
federal agents raided the home shortly after 5 a.m. (EST) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Controversy continued Monday over not only the conduct of the
raid but whether it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Podhurst, a friend of Reno's for 30 years who was
negotiating a transfer of Elian on the telephone with her when the
raid began, reiterated his claim that an agreement was imminent
that would have prevented the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a deal was within minutes or an hour away,''
Podhurst said on NBC's Today Show. When the raid began, ``I was
shocked, I was disappointed, I couldn't believe what I was looking
at it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Podhurst called Reno ``a extraordinarily strong
woman'' who made a different decision than the one he would have
made.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who said she trusted Podhurst ``with my life,'' said the
negotiations collapsed over the family's repeated insistence that
they meet with Juan Miguel in South Florida _ after previously
promising to meet with him anywhere _ and their refusal to agree to
release Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept getting mixed signals ... from a family that had
given us hope and then pulled it back, said they would comply with
the law and then said on several occasions that we would have to
take the child by force,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, asked about Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham's claim
that Clinton had promised him the raid would not be conducted at
night, said Clinton had merely been expressing his hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president said to Sen. Graham ... was that we didn't
want to do this, we thought there was a better way,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also disputed Graham's claim that Gregory Craig, the
attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had veto power over attempts to
negotiate an agreement on custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continued to criticize the use of force , however.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in calling for the Judiciary Committee hearings, said
he was ``appalled by the Clinton-Gore administration's decision to
use force in Miami to wrest Elian Gonzalez from his American
relatives. In doing so, our government has invaded the home of
American citizens who deserve the protection of our laws and a
certain respect for their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the third-ranking GOP House member,
said ``it's hard to imagine how (the administration) made this
child's safety a top priority when the Clinton-Gore administration
orders armed strangers wearing masks and guns to break into his
Miami house and whisk him away in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Reno, Rep. Bill McCollum, chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on crime, asked for answers within 24 hours
to a series of questions regarding the reasons for the raid and its
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one overriding concern each of us has expressed throughout
this case is that the psychological well-being of Elian Gonzalez be
paramount,'' McCollum said. ``How can you possibly reconcile that
goal with the reality of the boy waking up to an armed invader in
his home pointing assault weapons and screaming obscenities at him
and his loved ones?''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the public ``should not be surprised that the
first reaction from Capitol Hill is ... personal attacks on the
attorney general, personal attacks on the president, and then an
announcement of extensive investigative hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make the choice that this is what they want to
dominate the next weeks and months, and not issues like
prescription drugs and minimum wage and patients' bill of rights,
that's the choice they make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton was briefed on the general details of the
raid before it began and he concurred in its execution. Lockhart
blamed the Miami relatives for the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this could have been avoided; none of this had to happen.
This happened because the family did not respect the legal
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to several tearful news conferences by the Miami
relatives' since the raid, Lockhart said ``no matter how loudly
they yell, no matter how impassioned their arguments are, when it
came down to the very simple issue of would the Miami relatives
respect the decision that the father had custody of the boy, the
answer was always 'no.'''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials defended the extent of force
used in conducting the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Cooper, INS general counsel, said ``there is a big difference
between a show of force and a use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that there had been reports that some demonstrators
outside the house might have weapons _ and uncertainty whether
anyone inside the house was armed _ Cooper said ``you can't bet in
a situation like this. You have to be ready for any eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy display of force and the timing of the raid before
dawn _ when there were relatively few protestors outside the house
_ were planned to minimize the risk of serious injuries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the Miami raid would add another probe to a series
of congressional inquiries of the Clinton administration.
Currently, the House Judiciary Committee is investigating the
Justice Department's handling of the Branch Davidian case in Waco,
Texas in 1993, allegations of campaign finance violations by the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and the transfer of nuclear secrets
to the Chinese government in the late 1990s. These investigations
follow the Clinton impeachment hearings and effort to remove him
from office in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Charles Cook said Republicans could be in
danger of looking like they are obsessed with politically motivated
investigations that have little resonance with the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Texas Gov. George W.) Bush is handling it right and
(House Majority Leader Tom) DeLay is handling it wrong,'' Cook
said, noting that DeLay has been outspoken in demanding an
investigation while Bush has been only mildly critical of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing the Republicans could do is have this
investigation,'' Cook said, noting that voters most opposed to the
raid are Cuban-Americans and conservatives and neither group are
swing voters. ``They're going down the road they went with
impeachment. They're so consumed with placating their base, they
forget that is not what swing voters are interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center
for Government Studies, said that if Republicans continue focusing
on the raid for too long ``the really silent majority that favored
the action might become aroused. If this is still going on in a
week or two, I'd say they're making their typical political
miscalculations.''

MICROSOFT REPORT PUTS MARKET IN DOWN MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technology bear market growled again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite index sank 161.50 points, or
4.4 percent, in reaction to twin blows to Microsoft Corp., the
world's largest software maker and a major component of the index.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported late Thursday _ after the markets had
closed for the Easter weekend _ that its sales last quarter rose
less than expected, as sales of personal computers have slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Several news organizations also reported Monday that the US
Justice Department has proposed that Microsoft spin off some of its
software operations to comply with court rulings that the company
violated federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   While New Economy stocks slumped, the Dow Jones industrial
average, a proxy for the Old Economy, rose, though by only 62.05
points, to a closing level of 10,906.10.
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust case against Microsoft has driven the
stock price of the world's biggest software company down 45 percent
from its high last December. Microsoft lost $12.3125 a share
Monday, falling to $66.625 in its its biggest one-day drop ever.
</P>
<P>
   But, a dramatic slide in Microsoft's stock in the midst of its
dispute with the US government may cause more damage to small
technology stocks in the Nasdaq index than it does to Microsoft
itself, which analysts said is big and resilient and would probably
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index, which hit a high of 5048.62 on March 10, is
closing in on the 3000 mark, ``and that would still be a lofty
valuation,'' said Mark Lapman, chief executive for Independence
Investment Associates in Boston. ``We have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Lapman added, if Nasdaq does fall to the lows he predicts,
``Microsoft itself is probably close to a bottom here.''
</P>
<P>
   A resumption Monday of the slump in technology stocks, after a
respite last week, brought the index's closing level to 3482.48.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day, Monday's losses looked far worse. A round
of buying late in the afternoon pared what had been an 8 percent
Nasdaq decline at its worst point in midafternoon, though not
before Microsoft's drop spread to other big computer companies,
including Cisco Systems Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., and Dell
Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that sales of PCs slowed at the beginning of this year
added to the downward pressure on stocks of personal computer and
related hardware companies. Cisco, the top maker of
computer-networking equipment, fell $1.7985 to close at $63.4375.
Dell, the biggest US seller of personal computers, lost $2.1875 to
$47.75. And Sun, which makes computers that power Internet sites,
dipped by 12.5 cents to $87.625.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is such a big provider to the PC industry, if
they're indicating there's some kind of slowing in demand for PCs,
it's got to'' hurt other software makers and semiconductor
companies, said Ned Riley of State Street Global Advisors, a
division of State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A plan reportedly being proposed by the Justice Department would
require Microsoft to separate its Windows operating system and some
software applications from the rest of its business. Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co. cut its Microsoft rating to ``market outperform'' from
``recommended list,'' and a Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst reduced
his 12-month price target on the stock to 85 from 130.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage to small, startup tech companies may be far more
enduring, notably for Internet companies with disappointing news
that coincided with revelations about Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, for example, fell $9.25 to $113.875 after Barron's
reported the top Web-navigation company could see advertising
revenue diminish if Internet startups lose their venture capital
streams. A small company that manages Internet Web sites, Exodus
Communications Inc., plunged $25.1985 to $82.50, in response to its
disclosure late Thursday that it had lost 32 cents a share in the
first quarter, 7 cents more than analysts expected. (The stock
market was closed on Friday for the Easter holiday.)
</P>
<P>
   While Nasdaq sagged, many Dow stocks picked up, despite a slump
in Microsoft, which is one of the biggest stocks in a 30-stock Dow
index.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, Merck, McDonald's Corp., DuPont Co., Dow
Chemical Co., General Dynamics, Home Depot, Sunoco Inc., and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson _ all these companies and others posted gains
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are value buyers coming back into the market and picking
up bargains,'' Lapman said. For these buyers, he said, the ``big
old ugly stocks'' have ``attractive valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has declined 5 percent since January, and Nasdaq has
tumbled 14 percent this year in what is shaping up _ at least in
the early months _ as the worst time for stock market investors in
a decade.

REZULIN SUITS PILING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawsuits against the maker of Rezulin, the diabetes drug
withdrawn from the market after it was blamed for at least 63
deaths, are piling up as both individuals and groups seek
compensation for a wide range of alleged health complications.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients died or needed life-saving liver transplants after
taking Rezulin, including a Franklin, Mass. man who urgently needs
a donor organ. Many more say they require long-term monitoring to
watch for potential side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are multiplying in the wake of the decision by
Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J., last month to pull
Rezulin off the market under pressure from the US Food and Drug
Administration _ more than two years after sales of the drug were
halted in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the FDA disagreed over the drug's risks _ with some
arguing that the benefits to diabetics outweighed the risks _
delaying agency actuion until March.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is such a tragedy for the Americans who suffered
from the drug, and a tragedy for faith in the FDA,'' said Michael
Hackard, a California lawyer who is representing 26 Rezulin
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Hackard said people who suffered severe liver damage, as well as
the families of those that died, should get multimillion-dollar
settlements, based on previous suits in which patients needing
transplants received $4 million to $6 million settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Because those suits will be so expensive to prosecute _ as much
as $100,000 each _ however, a Medford, Mass. firm has filed a
broader class-action suit to obtain compensation for people who did
not have as severe a reaction to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is the only hope for some of the lesser-damaged
people,'' said Robert J. Bonsignore, of Bonsignore and Brewer. The
suit, said Bonsignore, aims to ``force the company to set money to
reimburse people who fell victim to their drug, for the cost of
medical monitoring and maybe associated health costs.''
</P>
<P>
   A second class action suit was filed earlier this month in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert issued a brief statement in response to the
lawsuits. It said the company's conduct ``was guided by strict
adherence to FDA regulations.'' While acknowledging that ``some
patients have experienced adverse events'' while taking the drug,
the company gave adequate warning about health risks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some doctors continue to defend Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Abrahamson, chief of adult diabetes at the Joslin
Diabetes Center in Boston, said he welcomed Rezulin as ``a major
advance'' in controlling blood sugar, a major issue for diabietics.
He defended the FDA's course of action, saying that if patients
were monitored properly, there was only a 1 in 100,000 chance of a
``serious liver event.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Rezulin's withdrawal from the market, patients who were
taking Rezulin have been switched to one of two drugs of the same
type as Rezulin which appear to have fewer adverse effects, said
Abrahamson.
</P>
<P>
   Hackard, the California laywer, said Monday his clients from
across the country include six people who already have had or will
need liver transplants, and others ``who are too old or too sick to
have liver transplants, and will die'' as a result of damage
allegedly caused by Rezulin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts patient he represents, David ``Chris'' Ashe,
53, of Franklin, suffered such severe liver damage that he urgently
needs a transplant to survive, said Hackard.
</P>
<P>
   While Hackard blames the FDA in part, Hackard says the company
``apparently suppressed information'' about deaths that occurred in
early clinical testing so that the FDA was unaware of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin, one of a class of new drugs that helps diabetics use
their limited amount of natural insulin more efficiently, was
touted as a great advance in diabetes treatment when it was
introduced in early 1997. A growing number of deaths linked to the
drug forced Warner-Lambert to strengthen warnings about possible
toxicity of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Hackard said the FDA allowed Warner-Lambert to push the drug
through approval in about six months, compared to the normal
three-year approval process. By not withdrawing the drug when it
was pulled from the market in Britain, the company ``brought in an
additional $1.5 billion in revenue while lots of people died.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackard estimates that up to 600 deaths may have occurred due to
Rezulin, 10 times the reported number.
</P>
<P>
   David Geiger, a Boston attorney who defends product liability
lawsuits, said Warner-Lambert would likely rely on its regulation
by the FDA as a defense against its actions, and that plaintiffs
would have to convince a jury that the Warner-Lambert was negligent
in its warnings to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger, of Foley, Hoag and Eliot, said that FDA staff will not
testify in such cases, but he added, ``you may see former FDA
employees coming in on both sides of the case.''

`DWARF': DISASTROUS COMEDY, INSIPID WRITING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review; Micheal is cq.) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first uh-oh in ``Taller Than a Dwarf,'' a
disastrous new comedy by Elaine May, comes in Matthew Broderick's
very first speech. Popping up from beneath the rumpled bedclothes
in an untidy brownstone apartment, cute with sleep, he addresses
the audience in his high-pitched, winningly earnest manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Howard Miller,'' he says. ``I'm an urban, Jewish, almost
generic white male from Queens. I graduated from City College. I
have no special talents. I'm not really happy. I'm very much like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The last line is the laugh, not a great line but not a bad one,
establishing a we're-in-this-together bond with the audience as
well as the discomforting sourpuss humor that May is known for. But
then after a pause comes the unnecessary, unwanted,
just-in-case-you-didn't-get-it addendum: ``Unless, of course,
you're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Given the comic credentials of the people involved here _ the
play, which opened Monday night at the Longacre Theater on
Broadway, was directed by Alan Arkin _ it is a stunningly tin-eared
moment. And it is, alas, no anomaly, but a harbinger of gag-based
scenes, dialogue that seems to have been written with a laugh track
to be inserted later and characters whose motivations for saying
and doing anything are either trivial, contrived or entirely
obscure until it's too late to care.
</P>
<P>
   The play tells the story of the day Howard's midlife crisis
comes home to roost, but that it is an ensemble farce isn't evident
until it is half over. In an extended slapstick sequence that
doesn't build so much as erupt, Howard's wife, Selma (Parker
Posey), ends up gnawing on the leg of the building superintendent
(Micheal McShane) as Howard's boss (Sam Groom) looks on in horror
and his mother (Joyce Van Patten) and father (Jerry Adler) help
dump the poor man into the bathtub, whereupon he plunges through
the floor. It could have been riotously juicy. But as it is it
comes so out of nowhere that it feels like intermission.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened up to that point is that Howard has gotten up
late for work and has been faced with the irritating home delays
that have been bedeviling sitcom characters for decades. Selma
turns on the kitchen sink so the shower turns suddenly scalding;
the shower nozzle comes off in his hand so he can't turn it off.
There's some snippiness over their dwindling finances. He finally
goes out but has forgotten his lunch. The boy from down the hall
comes by for Howard to help him cross Queens Boulevard. And the
landlady drops in for a warning that their leaking shower is
eroding the ceiling of the apartment below. Foreshadowing!
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when Howard manages to leave the house again, he drops
his lunch on the sidewalk and is accosted by a policeman who
attempts to elicit a bribe rather than fine him for littering.
Howard, absurdly, doesn't get it _ it's a painfully unfunny scene _
but the episode is nonetheless his breaking point and he retreats
into the house and takes to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   This is his I'm-not-going-to-take-it-anymore mode, and when
everyone he knows arrives to see him _ they're worried except for
his boss, who has some paperwork for him to complete, and the
super, who is angry because Howard has insulted his wife _ he
refuses all ministrations and quits his job.
</P>
<P>
   And so the apple cart of everydayness is upset. Chaos ensues and
when the bodies are untangled, Howard's feckless rebellion is
construed by everyone else as backbone, sending his wife, in
particular, into sensual ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so thrilling to be married to someone you don't really
know,'' she says, far and away the play's most pungent line and
really the first clear evidence that these characters are tethered
to a narrative design.
</P>
<P>
   May's intention here seems to be to suggest that midlife angst,
the sense that the rest of one's life will be an endless procession
of the same old stuff, is itself an age-old story. She's
sympathizing with Howard but mocking him, too. The ordinary chaos
in the Miller home _ not to mention their outer borough brand of
low-income frustrations _ suggests no one so much as Ralph and
Alice Kramden. And lest we tend to view Howard as special, the
super and his wife (Cynthia Darlow), Howard's mother-in-law (Marcia
Jean Kurtz) and the policeman (Greg Stuhr) all get the chance to
address the audience on behalf of their own unfulfilled ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this play isn't about us,'' the super says. ``But I
just want you to understand. We had dreams, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the playwright has made an attempt to locate
her everypeople in today's world. The boy down the hall is black
(played, at the performance I saw, by a very cute and composed
child named Dajon Matthews), which allows for some asides delivered
in homeboy lingo and rap verse but which is otherwise a pointless
role. The radio blares occasional news bulletins about trivial
lawsuits and Internet millionaires, which are meant to lay
groundwork for the anything-goes-as-long-as-I-get-mine morality
that the play ends up, more halfheartedly than it means to, taking
a poke at. And it's hard to miss the reference to Amadou Diallo
when the cop asks Howard for his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   So the mundaneness of it all might be purposeful, but the
flatness couldn't be, could it? The script escorts the action in
the most perplexingly toneless dialogue to be heard on Broadway in
some time:
</P>
<P>
   SELMA: Oh, great.
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD: What is it?
</P>
<P>
   SELMA: You didn't pay the Visa bill.
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD: Are you joking?
</P>
<P>
   SELMA: I gave you that bill three weeks ago and you swore you'd
pay it.
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD: I did pay it. I know I did. Besides, you never gave me
any bill.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of such a passage, quite aside from the lameness of
the joke, is that it leaves the audience without a clue as to what
distinguishes the people involved. The lines, and they are
representative, are illustrative of the pasted-together gag
sensibility that cripples the play's opening scenes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's a little hard to fathom from a writer whose comedy skits
with Mike Nichols and whose screenplays for films like ``The
Heartbreak Kid'' were so rooted in the neurotically misshapen
psyches of her characters, but May doesn't seem to know Howard and
Selma (or any of the others) very well. Not, at least, until she
proves them all crazy by having them behave so. As a result, she
has left her longtime colleague Arkin flailing for ideas and some
very fine actors digging pretty deeply into their well-worn bags of
tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Without the stage experience of her colleagues, Posey, the star
of many independent films, is the biggest casualty. Selma, as
written, is an opaque character, but Posey, by turns coy,
exasperated and shrill, seems lost almost to the point of panic in
her search for a thorough idea.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick soldiers through the opening scenes with bravely
controlled energy and finally gets his laughs in mid-breakdown; he
does a lovely, ridiculous turn with a singing hand puppet and when
he returns to sanity, he does convey an amusing sense of being
legitimately appalled at what he has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   Van Patten is so over the top in her version of the Jewish
mother from hell _ watch her try to wrestle Howard's arm into his
bathrobe _ that you can't help admiring her wholehearted service to
a play that doesn't pay her back. Adler, as the befuddled dad and
husband, employs his great rubbery face in expressions of
helplessness that have been funny forever.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a daunting set by Tony Walton, which seems both
overly staunch and overly soaring but does suggest from the start,
by virtue of its skewed interior planes and a framework for the
building that is broken away as if in ruins, that the world of the
Millers is dangerously close to collapse. If only these walls could
talk.

AT BRIDGE DEDICATION IN MEXICO, BUSH PROMISES MORE FREE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ Eager to remind voters that he is not a
foreign policy novice, Gov. George W. Bush went campaigning in
Mexico Monday. Foreign soil may be an unusual place to win votes,
but Bush seemed more in search of respect.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short trip, about 400 yards across the Rio Grande into
the Mexican scrub desert just west of this border city, and Bush
did not stay long, about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But he managed to dedicate the eight-lane, $128 million World
Trade Bridge and share a stage, and compliments, with President
Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past there have been walls of divide between Mexico and
the United States,'' Bush said to a crowd of a few thousand people,
mostly Mexicans. ``We must, we must be committed to raise the
bridges of trade and friendship and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the international stage, even one within eyesight of
Texas, offered a chance to burnish his foreign policy credential
after some stumbles during the Republican primaries. For months,
Bush has boasted about his experience in dealing with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at a ceremony following a ribbon cutting on the bridge,
Zedillo credited Bush with understanding Mexican culture and
working as Texas governor to improve relations between Mexico and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great friend of Mexico,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The growing closeness between officials in Mexico and Texas is
largely attributable to the North American Free Trade Agreement,
which has made Los Dos Laredos _ as the border cities of Laredo and
Nuevo Laredo call themselves _ a choke point for 1.3 million truck
crossings last year. The World Trade Bridge is the fourth
international bridge in the Laredo area. In promising to
aggressively push for free trade in this hemisphere, Bush, who has
assiduously courted Hispanic voters, said he would tear down trade
barriers from Alaska to ``the tip of Cape Horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all trade flowing across the Rio Grande is legal, and Bush
did not mention the huge volume of drugs and illegal immigrants
crossing daily.Nor did he mention the pollution from both sides of
the river that has prompted environmentalists to rank the Rio
Grande as one of the 10 most endangered rivers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the theme was international friendship, and the Bush
campaign sent along a film crew to capture the governor and Zedillo
standing side-by-side.
</P>
<P>
   In arranging this international photo opportunity, Bush nearly
got mired in some tricky local politics. The bridge actually opened
on April 15, in a ceremony hosted by Mayor Betty Flores of Laredo,
a Democrat and friend of President Clinton. Citing a scheduling
conflict, Bush declined to attend that gathering, as did Zedillo
after originally indicating that he would. Flores said she was
``disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   How disappointed was she? The Bush campaign learned last week
when the mayor initially declined to allow the governor's motorcade
to cross the new bridge for the ceremony in Mexico. Flores said the
international permit for the bridge specifically allowed commercial
traffic only except for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested the governor's entourage use one of the other
bridges or simply walk across. Or, she said, maybe he could just
drive a truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could ride in a big rig,'' she said in a telephone
interview on Friday. ``Think about it. The Teamsters will love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But a weekend of telephone calls, including calls from Texas
officials to the State Department, broke the impasse, and on
Monday, the governor's car drove across the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who said she had not initially been invited to speak,
did so, and made certain to thank the politician that Bush hopes to
replace, President Clinton.

`WHITE TEETH': QUIRKY, SASSY AND WISE IN A LONDON OF EXILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``White Teeth,'' by the young British writer Zadie Smith, is not
one of your typical small, semiautobiographical first novels. It's
a big, splashy, populous production reminiscent of books by Dickens
and Salman Rushdie with a nod to indie movies like ``My Beautiful
Laundrette,'' a novel that's not afraid to tackle large, unwieldy
themes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a novel that announces the debut of a preternaturally
gifted new writer _ a writer who at the age of 24 demonstrates both
an instinctive storytelling talent and a fully fashioned voice
that's street-smart and learned, sassy and philosophical all at the
same time. This, ``White Teeth'' announces, is someone who can do
comedy, drama and satire, and do them all with exceptional
confidence and brio.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, ``White Teeth'' recounts the misadventures of
two World War II veterans _ Archie Jones, an unassuming Englishman,
and his best friend, Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim _ and the
stories of their extended and very dysfunctional families. Beneath
its antic surface, however, ``White Teeth'' opens out to become a
meditation on the varieties of historical experience and the impact
that cultural and familial history can have on the shape of an
individual's life. It is about immigration and exile and the legacy
of British colonialism; it is about roots and rootlessness and the
contradictory yearnings for freedom and connection.
</P>
<P>
   Smith _ who began working on this novel during her final year at
King's College, Cambridge _ sets her story in London, not the
London of imperial monuments and long-running West End shows, but a
cacophonous, Martin Amis-ish London of curry shops and pool halls
and cheap hair salons. Here, frustrated waiters dream of making
their mark on history, street people like Mad Mary and Mr. Toupee
flaunt their eccentricities, and ``Becks, B-boys, Indie kids,
wide-boys, ravers, rudeboys, Acidheads, Sharons, Tracies, Kevs,
Nation Brothers, Raggas and Pakis'' swagger and limp their way,
like Yeats' ``rough millennial beast,'' toward their own
purgatories and heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Archie, who is married to a young Jamaican woman named Clara,
deals with the change and chaos he sees around him with
good-natured, if dim, good humor. He wonders why people can't
``just get on with things, just live together, you know, in peace
or harmony or something.'' His pal, Samad, in contrast, rages
against the decadence of contemporary culture and the corrupting
effect he sees it having on his twin teen-age sons.
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, Archie and Samad are representatives of two
worldviews: one practical-minded and pragmatic, the other
ideological and absolutist; one accepting of randomness as a
byproduct of freedom, the other determined to try to stage-manage
fate. Archie, who works for a direct mail company, designing folds
for their folders, accepts the fact that he was ``a man whose
significance in the Greater Scheme of Things could be figured along
familiar ratios'' of pebble to beach, raindrop to ocean, needle to
haystack; he is happy to go with the flow. Samad, on his part,
remains obsessed with the role his great-grandfather played in the
Indian mutiny; he craves glory and distinction and rages against
his own lowly job as a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Samad is also intent on leading an impeccable life as a devout
Muslim, and when he succumbs to an adulterous affair with a pretty
young Englishwoman, he vows to turn his sons into defenders of the
family's honor. He decides to send Magid, the smarter and more
accommodating of the twins, back home to Bangladesh to receive a
proper Muslim education. That way, he figures, at least one of his
boys will grow up proud of his familial and cultural roots.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Samad's blueprint for his sons' future does not
exactly work out as planned. Magid returns home from Bangladesh an
ardent Anglophile, a would-be lawyer who wears white suits and
talks like David Niven. His brother, Millat, meanwhile joins a
radical Islamic group named Kevin (``Keepers of the Eternal and
Victorious Islamic Nation'') that preaches revolution and
renunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Both twins also become involved with a former schoolmate's
father _ a scientist named Marcus Chalfen who is working on a
controversial plan to create a genetically engineered mouse. Like
Samad, Marcus wants to eliminate chance and accident in the world,
and his ``FutureMouse'' project will draw the wrath of a varied
assortment of religious and political groups _ groups that just
happen to count among their members Millat Iqbal; Archie's
mother-in-law, Hortense; and Marcus' own son, Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   Though Smith grows a bit long-winded in discussing these groups'
millennial schemes, her gift for sympathetic characterization
enables her to satirize her people's vanities and self-delusions
without ever seeming patronizing or judgmental. In recounting the
story of Archie and Samad's families, she shows not only how one
generation often revolts against another _ sons against fathers,
daughters against mothers _ but also how they repeat their
predecessors' mistakes, retrace their ancestors' dreams, and in the
case of those who are immigrants, commute nervously between the
poles of assimilation and nationalism, the embrace of the Other and
a repudiation of its temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Samad's son, Millat, may dismiss his father as a ``faulty,
broken, stupid, one-handed waiter'' who has failed to make his mark
on the world, and yet one of the very reasons he joins Kevin is
that he has inherited his dad's fantasy of writing his name in
history books. As for Archie and Clara's daughter, Irie, she
vacillates between wanting to be English and laying claim to her
mother's Jamaican roots. She will eventually embrace the confusions
and complexities of doubleness and exile as a blessing, even as she
adopts her practical father's attitude toward a career:
disappointed in her dreams of becoming a scientist, she will
settle, not unhappily, for becoming a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   These characters are all players in Smith's riotous
multicultural drama, living out their stories on her chessboard of
postcolonial dreams and frustrations, and yet at the same time,
they've been limned with such energy and bemused affection that
they possess the quirks and vulnerabilities of friends and
neighbors we've known all our lives. In what will surely rank as
one of her generation's most precocious debuts, Smith announces
herself as a writer of remarkable powers, a writer whose talents
prove commensurate with her ambitions.

GE TO OFFER ONLINE BANKING ON ITS FINANCIAL WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Electric, which has been aggressively expanding the list
of products and services that it sells on the World Wide Web, plans
to announce Tuesday that it will offer online banking on its
consumer-oriented financial Web site.
</P>
<P>
   GE will team up with the online bank CompuBank to offer the
service on the GE Financial Network at www.gefn.com. It will be the
first financial service not home grown that GE will offer on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that partnering with people is the best way to get
speed to market with a full range of products and services,'' said
William C. Goings, senior vice president for e-business at GE
Financial Assurance, the company's consumer financial services arm.
</P>
<P>
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., began the banking service without
fanfare earlier this month, and consumers who stumbled across it on
the Web site have been able to open accounts, although Goings would
not say how many had done so.
</P>
<P>
   Goings said GE would announce another partnership soon, with
Netstock.com, to let consumers buy stock online in small lots. That
site, which will be called Netstockdirect, is not yet operational,
but GE has flagged its imminent arrival on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The new banking service will allow consumers to set up checking,
savings and money market accounts on the Web and to pay their bills
through electronic transfers. But they will also be able to write
regular checks against those accounts and gain access to them
through automated teller machines. And they will be able to earn
frequent flier miles for opening new accounts and handling banking
transactions online.
</P>
<P>
   GE Financial Network already offers insurance, mutual funds,
credit cards, home mortgages and other financial services.
CompuBank, which has been operating for about 18 months, offers
banking services to both consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   CompuBank will retain any fees involved in the banking
transactions and will control the assets in the consumer accounts.
GE Financial Assurance has also made a small equity investment in
CompuBank. But Frank S. Goldberg, CompuBank's chairman, sounded
most excited about what the partnership could do for his fledgling
company's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being chosen as GE's partner is like getting the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval,'' he said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A decade after the collapse of communism appeared to
make superpower arms controls routine, the old disputes over
missile defenses have suddenly returned to the forefront of
U.S.-Russian relations. And though experts think new rules of the
nuclear game are technically feasible, the issue has been caught up
in U.S. election politics and Russian suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the fundamental principles that Washington and
Moscow have accepted for almost three decades, that the only way to
encourage reductions in strategic arms is to restrict ways to
counter them _ an understanding codified in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But a new-found U.S. interest in developing a missile defense,
which proponents say would defend against rogue states like North
Korea and Iran, has called the treaty into question.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russia has strongly opposed any changes in the treaty.
And in recent weeks, President-elect Vladimir Putin has
strengthened his hand in the dispute by getting his Parliament to
ratify the long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty known as
START II and conditioning the accord on continued U.S. adherence to
the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans in the U.S. Senate equally adamant about
developing anti-missile defenses, resolving the dispute during
President Clinton's visit to Moscow in early June will be difficult
at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very sensitive period,'' said Anatoly Diakov, the
director of the Moscow-based Center for Arms Control and the
Environment. ``Both sides have to decide whether to support the
arms control regime or destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly heated debate is something of a surprise
because arms control had ceased to be a bitter bone of contention
in recent years. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
expectation was that the hard bargaining over warheads, missiles
and bombers was over. The two sides were no longer adversaries. And
while U.S.-Russian arms control talks often lagged, that seemed
little more than a matter of benign neglect.
</P>
<P>
   But the demise of the Soviet Union also left the United States
without a consensus on the threats that confront the nation and on
how best to reduce the risk of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers in Washington have cast the heart of old
nuclear arms controls, the ABM accord, as an anachronism, which
needs to be radically modified or abandoned altogether so the
United States can build an anti-missile shield against ``rogue''
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sought to blunt the political assault
from the right by proposing a limited defense, which would require
amending the ABM treaty, but not jettisoning it.
</P>
<P>
   Its proposal would protect all 50 states from an attack by
several dozen warheads carried by North Korean missiles or half a
dozen warheads mounted on Iranian rockets. The plan, which would be
carried out by 2005, would involve the construction of a radar in
Alaska, the deployment of 100 interceptors there and upgrades to
five existing radars.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton plan is both too little for many Republicans and
too much for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials doubt the United States would go through all
the cost and trouble of developing a national missile defense just
to counter tiny North Korea. And while the 6,000 warheads in
Russia's arsenals are more than enough to overwhelm a limited
defense, Russian officials worry that the Clinton plan would
unleash a new race to deploy anti-missile defense, which the
cash-poor Russian military is doomed to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American plan of a national missile defense is not
perceived in Russia as something that is justified by the North
Korean or Iranian nuclear programs,'' said Sergei Rogov, the
director of the United States and Canada Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's plan is an even greater worry for
the Chinese, who have only about a dozen land-based missiles that
are capable of striking the United States. Beijing has already
vowed to respond by expanding its nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have been telling Moscow they
should cut a deal now and agree to amend the ABM treaty, because
the terms they would be offered by a future Republican president _
if George W. Bush is elected _ would be far less favorable.
</P>
<P>
   The most logical trade-off, specialists say _ and one that U.S.
officials hint Clinton may in fact propose _ would grant the United
States the right to build a limited missile defense to counter
possible Third World missile threats.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Washington would agree to the Russian demand that
both sides make especially deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms as
part of a START III nuclear accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who are pressed for cash, have urged that both
sides slash their nuclear arsenals to 1,500 warheads. The Pentagon
has previously argued that the United States needs about 2,500
warheads to meet its military requirements, but Washington could
try to mollify the Russians by agreeing to a limit below 2,000
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   A small but influential group of specialists in Russia argues
that the trade-off could be in Russia's interest. Rogov, for
example, argued that a small-scale U.S. defense would not
dramatically alter the strategic balance if the limitations were
carefully defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may belong to a minority, but I believe this is not going to
fundamentally change the mutual nuclear deterrence model,'' he said
in an interview. ``It will create some problems, but manageable
problems if we get what we want in START III.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, however, the Kremlin insists that it is not
interested. It has warned that it will not agree to revise the
treaty and that a U.S. decision to withdraw from the accord would
unravel the entire framework of arms agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Russia would not only stop reducing its arsenal of strategic
arms, Putin has warned, but it might also deploy new multiwarhead
missiles, abandon the agreement banning medium-range missiles and
even withdraw from the accord limiting conventional arms in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Russians have offered only to cooperate on defenses
against shorter-range nonstrategic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Having staked out such a tough opening position, Putin may find
it difficult to reach a compromise with Clinton. Nor does it help
that Clinton is nearing the end of his term and has not always been
able to prevail in the arms-control debate at home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian specialists fear that if a deal were stuck at the
June summit meeting Clinton would find it difficult to persuade the
Republican-dominated Senate to support it. They note that the
Clinton administration suffered a stinging setback last year when
the Senate rejected the treaty banning nuclear tests. If a deal is
to be made, they say, it should be cut with a leader who can make
it stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major arms-control decisions should be postponed until
after the U.S. presidential elections, when they are no longer
being influenced by the American electoral campaign,'' said
Alexander Pikayev, an arms-control specialist at the Moscow Center
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Russia reached an agreement with Clinton, there would
be no guarantee that the next American administration would not
come to Russia 18 months after that for another round of talks on
modifying the ABM treaty and perhaps yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to cut off the tail of a cat, you should do it
once and not three times,'' he said.

ISTANBUL INAUGURATES A NEW PORTAL TO THE GATEWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, April 30)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A glittering new international terminal has
opened at Ataturk International Airport, finally giving visitors a
modern gateway to this many-splendored city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul's old international terminal was intimate, and those
who used it regularly appreciated the speed with which they could
sometimes negotiate their way past the various control points. For
most passengers, however, it was a highly unsuitable point of entry
to Turkey. It was dark, crowded and often plagued by long lines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new terminal, built in 22 months at a cost of $306 million,
could not be more different. It is four times the size of the old
one, bright and airy with tall ceilings and broad corridors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a few cramped booths selling duty-free items, there
are dozens of shops, ranging from a toy store to a gallery that
specializes in reproductions of old maps and prints. Among the many
places to eat is one with stir-fried Chinese dishes to order. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passengers used to have to take a shuttle bus between the
terminal and the parking area, but no longer. A covered garage
adjoining the terminal has space for more than 7,000 cars. The
garage is said to be the biggest of its kind in Europe, and the
terminal is the third biggest building in Turkey.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although President Suleyman Demirel officially opened the
terminal in January, it is not complete. Workers are still drilling
and patching in several places. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With an annual capacity of 14 million passengers, the terminal
is to be expanded to 20 million within a few years. It has been
built with modern techniques designed to make it resistant to
earthquakes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 160 check-in desks, 64 belong to Turkish Airlines, which
has become a comfortable and generally efficient carrier,
especially on international routes. Baggage conveyers can handle
10,000 pieces of luggage an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until the new terminal opened, most arriving planes were forced
to park on the tarmac, and passengers were bused to passport
control or transit lounges. Now fewer people are experiencing that
inconvenience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 64 passport control booths and 34 X-ray machines, the
terminal should be able to offer no-wait service to most
passengers. But these posts are sometimes unmanned, so lines
persist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are other quirks, some of which may be resolved as
administrators recognize them. Signs in the main concourse are
inadequate, and some check-in counters are difficult to find. At
the information desk, multilingual receptionists are cheerful and
eager to help, but even they do not yet know where to direct some
passengers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main departure concourse is more than half a mile long and
is served by a single moving sidewalk. Since the sidewalk moves in
only one direction, passengers who want to go the ``wrong'' way
must walk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the airport managers declined to answer
questions about this apparent design flaw. It may be difficult to
correct, but other start-up problems should be easier to resolve.
Shops in the departure area offer a rich selection of modern and
historic postcards, for example, but there is no place to buy
stamps. Public telephones along the departure concourse accept only
prepaid cards, but no cards are for sale. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several passengers have also complained about surly treatment
from security agents who run the X-ray machines, which can put an
unpleasant end to a vacation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, however, Istanbul has taken a giant step toward
accommodating international air passengers. The old terminal was
something of an embarrassment, certainly inadequate to serve as the
main gateway to a country that is now among the world's top 20
tourist destinations. The new one is an apt symbol of Turkey's
campaign to reach European levels of efficiency. &QL;

JUSTICES QUESTION FIREARMS SENTENCES IN DAVIDIAN CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several skeptical Supreme Court justices grilled a
federal prosecutor Monday on whether a Waco judge improperly
extended the prison sentences of four men convicted of killing four
lawmen during a 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The justices appeared more sympathetic toward a defense lawyer
who argued that U.S. District Judge Walter Smith of Waco was wrong
to apply a firearms law to beef up the killers' prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Smith tacked 30 years onto the Davidians' 10-year sentences
after concluding that the four men had used automatic weapons to
slay four Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents at the
sect's compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The botched raid led to a 51-day standoff that ended with a fire
in which Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and about 80 followers
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians' lawyer, Stephen Halbrook of Fairfax, Va., argued
that the enhanced sentences were inappropriate because the kind of
weapons used by the defendants had not been determined by the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows a judge to add up to 30 years to a killer's
sentence if an automatic weapon or bomb is used in a slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James Robinson argued that Congress
wanted judges to have the authority to determine what type of
weapon was used when deciding punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1994, Renos Avraam, Brad Branch, Jaime Castillo and
Kevin Whitecliff were convicted of voluntary manslaughter and
firearms possession in the shooting deaths of BATF agents Conway
LeBleu, Todd McKeehan, Robert Williams and Steven Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth defendant, Graeme Craddock, was convicted of possessing
a destructive device and sentenced to 10 years. Smith added 10
years to Craddock's sentence after concluding that he had possessed
an automatic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had asked the jury to consider charges of murder and
conspiracy to commit murder against the Davidians. The panel was
not asked to decide what kind of weapons were used, and some jurors
later said they were troubled when Smith tacked on the firearms
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were absolutely shocked at the severity of the judge's
augmentation of what we thought was going to be a slap on the wrist
of the defendants,'' said jury forewoman Sarah Bain, a San Antonio
resident who attended Monday's Supreme Court arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia,
who generally side with prosecutors, pressed Robinson, the
government lawyer, on the increased prison terms and his argument
that juries do not have to be consulted on the question of weapons
used in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said allowing a judge to decide what kind of weapons
were used after the jury had determined guilt was akin to the tail
wagging the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, picking up the canine metaphor, said a judge would have
to have ``a long tail'' to resolve a factual dispute that is best
left to a jury and could add 30 years to a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (result) doesn't seem strange to you?'' Scalia asked
Robinson, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Robinson said that federal judges have historically
had the authority to increase sentences based on their own
conclusion as to the ``dangerousness'' of the weapon used.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer was unconvinced. He said the type of
firearm used appears to be an element of the crime and must be
answered by the jury, leaving it to the judge to then impose
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to see ... why this (issue of gun type)
suddenly becomes a sentencing factor'' only for the judge to
determine, Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the justices did not appear to challenge Halbrook's
claim that juries _ not judges _ must determine what type of gun
was used, they questioned why he was not arguing that Smith's
decision was unconstitutional because it amounts to an unfair
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it a strange argument you're making,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   If the high court rules in the killers' favor, their prison
terms would be reduced to 15 years, based on the initial 10-year
sentence and five-year enhancement judges are permitted to impose
if any type of firearm was used. Craddock's sentenced would be
reduced to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render a decision by early July.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an independent inquiry is underway into what role, if
any, the Federal Bureau of Investigation played in starting the
fire that engulfed the warren of buildings at the Davidian compound
on April 19, 1993. The fire broke out as the FBI flooded the
compound with tear gas in an effort to end the siege.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Davidians who survived the fire and the relatives
of those who were killed have sued the federal government, alleging
that officials should be held liable for the deaths.

CUBAN EXILES PROMISE WORK STOPPAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This seaside city of 2.2 million people was full of life
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, if the Cuban-American exile community has its way,
Miami will look all but dead, stricken by a massive, one-day work
stoppage to protest the US government's armed seizure of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez from the home of his relatives in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it Dead Tuesday,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, the
leader of a Cuban-American exile group, the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The title could prove apt, in a city with 800,000 Cuban
Americans who for decades have demonstrated extraordinary unity in
their contempt for any US action they view as favorable to Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Half the city's work force is Cuban-American. A massive strike,
even for a day, could cause multimillion-dollar havoc in the
tourist-oriented economy here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a strong message that we want an investigation
of the outrageous act of violence committed by federal
authorities,'' said Sanchez, his head still wrapped in bandages
from injuries he received while trying to block Immigration and
Naturalization agents who stormed the Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   City and county officials, whose political fortunes largely
hinge on support from the Cuban-American community, did not oppose
the proposed stoppage other than to appeal for police, fire and
medical workers to report for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider the other options, it's probably the best of
all ideas,'' said Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas of the planned
stoppage. ``A lot of people in our community feel indignant and
betrayed by what happened, and they want to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of businesses, including the 25-store Sedona supermarket
chain, announced Monday they would not open Tuesdaday. Solidarity
with the shutdown was overwhelming in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is in peril,'' said Maria Versace, who manages a
car dealership in the community. ``We have to show our support.''
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses may have no choice, depending both on the
willingness of workers to show up and their ability to do so if
protesters block streets. A number of major thoroughfares have been
blocked during the Elian saga, including access roads to Miami
International Airport, one of the nation's busiest.
</P>
<P>
   Police were on full alert and appealed for calm. They arrested
more than 350 protesters in the first 24 hours after Elian was
seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already been enough of an international incident,'' said
Miami Police Lieutenant William Schwartz. ``Let's not make it
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related protest, more than 60 members of Mothers Against
Repression marched silently outside the federal courthouse in Miami
Monday. Dressed in black, they showed copies of the picture of a
federal marshal pointing a submachine gun toward Elian during the
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two prominent anti-Castro radio hosts in Miami were
organizing a caravan to drive to Washington this week to protest
Elian's removal from his Miami relatives.

US WILL OK NUCLEAR TEST BAN PACT, ALBRIGHT TELLS UN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ America's European allies, praising Russia for
its recent nuclear disarmament moves, Monday criticized the United
States for failing to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty and for
continuing to develop an anti-missile defence system that UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan warned could lead to a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, speaking on the
opening day of the UN's month-long Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
review conference, rejected criticism of the missile defence system
and predicted that the United States would ratify the test ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's UN Ambassador Antonio Monteiro, speaking for the
European Union, welcomed Russia's ratification last Friday of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and called on the United States to do
likewise ``so as to stimulate others to follow the same path.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We deeply regret, in this connection, the upset to the
ratification process in the US,'' Monteiro said. ``The EU strongly
supports the early entry into force of the CTBT through
ratification without delay and without conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration suffered an embarassing defeat last
year when the Senate voted down ratification of the test ban.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, while predicting that the United States would
eventually ratify the treaty, told reporters later she did not
expect another Senate vote before a new Congress and a new
administration were elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Clinton has appointed General John Shalikashvili,
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to advise the
administration on ``how best to respond to senators' concerns about
the CTBT so we can build support for its eventual ratification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile,'' Albright said, ``we have made it clear that the
United States will not resume testing _ and are urging other
nations to do the same and to sign and ratify the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans also voiced opposition to US proposals to modify
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, a move that would allow the
Pentagon to deploy the anti-missile defense system on US soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reaffirm the importance of the ABM treaty as one of the
pillars of strategic stability,'' Monteiro said. ``The EU wishes to
see that treaty preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to agree to a modification of the ABM treaty
to allow the anti-missile system, but specialists say Moscow may be
amenable to a deal if the United States agrees to a lower threshold
of nuclear weapons stocks in planned Start III talks.
</P>
<P>
   Annan warned, however, that the ``growing pressure to deploy
national missile defenses is jeopardizing the ABM Treaty and could
well lead to a new arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albright strongly defended the administration's intentions.
``If the Clinton administration were bent on sabotaging the ABM
Treaty and strategic arms control, we have surely gone about it in
a strange way,'' she said. ``In the open, with care, and in
consultation not only with Congress, but after extensive
discussions with our allies and other countries, Russia and China
emphatically included.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed dramatically in the almost three decades
since the ABM Treaty was signed,'' Albright said. ``That treaty has
been amended before, and there is no good reason it cannot be
amended again to reflect new threats from third countries outside
the strategic deterrence regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright told reporters the missile defense system is intended
for future threats from North Korea and Iran. ``We are talking
about a system capable of defending against at most a few tens of
incoming missiles. It is not intended to degrade Russia's
deterrent. Nor will it have that result,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't need to be a confrontation'' on this issue with
Russia, she said, which simply doesn't ``agree on the nature of the
threat'' posed to American soil.

<P>
   MONTECITO, Calif. _ The well-heeled residents huddle in their
estates behind dense hedges, thick walls and iron gates in this
self-conscious community on the southern edge of Santa Barbara.
They obviously take their isolation seriously, such that when
warning rabble away, they go so far as to invoke adverbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely Private Property,'' reads a sign in front of one
sprawling property. ``Positively No Admission,'' reads another.
</P>
<P>
   There is a stridency to the admonishments. In them, you can
almost detect an audible sniff. ``Not a Through Street. No
Turnaround.'' (Gee, sorry my front wheels intruded on the first 30
inches of your driveway.) ``Private Road. Right to Pass by
Permission.'' (And who issues that, Jarvis the butler?)
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, Montecito has been favored by captains of
industry, power players of the silver screen and vacationers
desperate for solitude. It's not difficult to see why. It commands
a thickly wooded slope in the foothills of the Santa Ynez
Mountains, overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Channel Islands,
ambling down to a stretch of rugged, secluded beach. With
sunglasses, tinted windows and determination, you could go days
without ever having to speak to a soul.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few decades, however, one establishment has been
dreadfully out of step with all of this: the Miramar Hotel. It is
undoubtedly familiar to anyone who has ever wheeled north on 101
through Santa Barbara. How could you possibly miss those blue
roofs, set off dramatically by white clapboard?
</P>
<P>
   The blue paint was swabbed on in 1940, precisely to catch the
eye of people passing on the highway. The asphalt _ covering six of
the property's 13 acres _ was laid down shortly after, as America
took to the road in search of parking places. A two-story motel
structure went up, facing !ital!away from the ocean, designed
instead to maximize views of a pool and ... well, the road.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare to say goodbye to all of this, though. Hotelier Ian
Schrager, pioneer of cutting-edge lodgings in West Hollywood, New
York and Miami Beach, spent $31.5 million to acquire this somewhat
tired-looking motel two years ago. He plans to sink nearly that
much more into it in a massive renovation that is expected to
require a year and a half to complete. And the developers hope to
start breaking ground _ and breaking up asphalt _ this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion, the Miramar figures to be a high-end resort
that enjoys much more congruity with its neighborhood, joining such
properties of understated elegance as the Four Seasons Biltmore and
the San Ysidro Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concept will be returning it to the sensibility of the
seaside resort, oriented back to the ocean,'' said Tim Andreas,
design director on a project headed by Philippe Starck. ``We're
restoring the landscaping and the sensibility that you're in a
seaside garden setting rather than a motor court.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Miramar's designation as a somewhat funky highway motel
stirs any nostalgic pangs in you, this is the season to get a last
taste. Its doors will be closed when the renovations _ guttings,
primarily _ begin. When it reopens, you certainly won't find any
shoulder-season room rates of $75 for a pool/highway view.
</P>
<P>
   When Philip Dailey transferred here from one of Schrager's New
York hotels to be general manager of the Miramar, he heard story
after story of people who had fond memories of the place. They'd
learned to swim in the pool as a child. Couples had honeymooned
there. The bar had generated volumes of colorful lore. But he
encountered something else: No one had been back for 15 or 20
years. He drew a conclusion. ``The Miramar,'' Dailey said, ``is
like an old jacket you keep in your closet. You can't bring
yourself to throw it away, but you never wear it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The place was overripe for an upgrade. That much was evident
during a recent stay there. Its rooms have bargain sheets and
pillows beneath synthetic bedspreads in floral prints. The
furniture and other furnishings are 1970s Holiday Inn revival. The
drinking glasses are plastic. The TV sits on a cheap stand. No
separate towels are provided for use at the beach or pool.
</P>
<P>
   During our visit, the bathroom sink drain unleashed a four-inch
gusher of dark goo when somebody turned on a tap upstairs. After
this recurred minutes later, a maintenance man was summoned, but he
seemed at a loss, saying, ``It's happened before.'' Then he checked
to see if the shower drain had been similarly afflicted. (Yech!) &QL;

16!tag!Sweeping changes &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!All of this will be gone when the doors reopen. The blue
roofs? They're history. The Miramar is seeking to recapture a sense
of its more distant past.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s, transplanted Englishman Josiah Doulton tried to
scratch out a living here growing fruit trees and various crops for
livestock feed. When his fortunes flagged in this enterprise,
however, he found that accommodating travelers was much more
lucrative. He dotted the lush grounds with tiny guest cottages,
some of which _ dating to 1901 _ still stand.
</P>
<P>
   The new design will seek to recapture some of these
sensibilities while maximizing a 500-foot stretch of beachfront.
The refurbished cottages will be engulfed by a citrus orchard in
one part of the property, a field of lavender in another, Dailey
said recently as he strolled over seemingly endless expanses of
parking lot. The renovated motel building will feature balcony
trellises cascading with bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   The bank of rooms down by the ocean _ built literally on the
sand _ will be something really special. Two of the current rooms
will be fused into one lavish duplex. Picture a row of two-story
townhouses, each with a private deck with whirlpool tub, a
downstairs living room and kitchen, and a spiral staircase that
climbs to a spacious upstairs bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of the resort will be a boardwalk promenade
that is to stretch from the lobby to an oceanfront bar and grill.
In between will be a pool, bordered on one side by a restaurant, on
the other by a spa.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager came up with the concept of ``hotel as theater,''
creating natural gathering areas where guests and visitors can
basically congregate to watch each other. This is what is
envisioned for this area, with the occasional passenger train
passing through to provide a touch of surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   The train tracks come with the deed here. When the Southern
Pacific sought to build a north-south line through here in the
mid-1880s, Doulton asked that it be routed down there along that
useless, non-arable land along the beach rather than through his
precious barley field farther inland. (Suntans and cutback rides on
waves were not high on priority lists in that particular era.)
</P>
<P>
   An old flag-stop depot still stands on the Miramar property, and
it will be incorporated into the new design.
</P>
<P>
   Major highways, on the other hand, are much less charming, and
the 101 roars by within just a few feet of the property's inland
border. To gain an appreciation for just how many goods are
transported in 18-wheel trucks these days, sit by the Miramar pool
for an hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   Masking that rattle and hum will surely be a major challenge for
the developers. The plan is to employ a sound wall, a hedge,
sound-absorption building materials, triple-pane glass and, as a
final resort, the white noise of waterfalls and babbling brooks. &QL;

14!tag!When the resort is finished _ the end of next year, perhaps
early 2002 _the Miramar will contend for the same high-end traveler
who currently gravitates to the Biltmore. In Montecito, there
figures to be plenty of room for both, but it shapes up to be an
intriguing contrast.
</P>
<P>
   While the Miramar will target the crowd that crackles on the
leading edge of trendiness, the Biltmore has built its considerable
reputation on Old World elegance and deference.
</P>
<P>
   It was constructed in the 1920s, Los Angeles architect Reginald
Johnson employing the design of a stately Spanish villa. Although
it underwent two major refurbishments in recent years, adding such
upgrades as air conditioning and the requisite data ports in rooms
(a spa addition is currently under construction), the Biltmore
still features wrought-iron balconies shaded by tropical shrubbery,
massive beam ceilings, bright interiors (cream-colored walls, white
plantation shutters and ceiling fans, new bedspreads and drapes),
as well as detached cottages of its own. The place feels like old
money.
</P>
<P>
   Which is appropriate, really, given its neighborhood. That, in
fact, is one of the conditions that enhances the prospects for a
reborn Miramar. Here, you don't have to worry about putting up a
lavish resort and being stuck next to a hot dog-on-a-stick stand
and a junky boat-repair yard.
</P>
<P>
   Though an unincorporated community of only 9,300 people,
Montecito is so status-conscious that it has !ital!two village
areas _ one it can look down its nose at as a tourist enclave, the
other it can treat as a locals' hangout. The former stretches out
along Coast Village Road, parallel to and virtually on top of 101.
The other, referred to as Upper Village (of course), is farther
upslope, clustered around the corner of East Valley Road and San
Ysidro Road.
</P>
<P>
   Here, few of the businesses open on Sunday, a refreshing
throwback to an era when all self-respecting establishments honored
the Sabbath. On days when they do open their doors, you'll find
impressive home furnishings and antiques at William Laman, housed
in a 100-year-old former home.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might notice the sign that pointedly forbids cell-phone
use in the breakfast room of the San Ysidro Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might survey the stylish but confounding array of
products in an establishment eccentrically called Pierre Lafond
Wendy Foster. Walk into one room here and you'll find gourmet
groceries, greeting cards, deli items and chocolates. Walk through
an adjacent door and you're among racks of women's clothing. Head
up the stairs for _ no joke _ kitchen and bath items, antique
office furniture, women's lingerie, men's shirts and garden
accouterments. (``Yes, I've made my selections. I'm getting this
black-clay dinnerware, a linen robe, this packet of radish seeds
and a bar of Pre de Provence bath soap. Sure, all in the same bag
is fine.'') &QL; 
!tag!f &QC;

16!tag!Exclusive territory &QL; 
!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!It might be tempting, upon leaving the Upper Village, to
explore the neighborhood. Don't bother. You can drive through
Montecito, but you can't actually !ital!see Montecito. What you
gaze at instead are fortresslike walls, impenetrable stands of
greenery, tall fences, elaborate iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   The mansions are set well back from the road at the end of
winding drives. In a local real-estate flyer, one ocean-view
property was going for $3.6 million _ and that's just for three
acres of bare dirt. If you want something with a house on it, well,
here's a 15,000-square-foot Italian palazzo with formal gardens,
statuary and an ocean view for a priced-to-move $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Montecito's old money has been suffused of late with nouveau
riche _ movie-industry stars and executives, high-tech
entrepreneurs, etc. They are attracted by the same attributes that
appeal to weekend tourists: tranquillity, clean air, cool climate,
mesmerizing views of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Find all of these in abundance down along the beach. You can
easily walk a considerable stretch of it, from Lookout County Park
south of Montecito (take the Summerland exit off the 101) clear to
the Biltmore _ 2.5 miles in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   Check a tide table before embarking (the Santa Barbara
News-Press runs one daily) and go at low tide to avoid being
pulverized on rocks or against one of several sea walls. Also,
there are a number of spots in which streams rush briskly over
boulders, so you might want to bring along a pair of old tennis
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the water, you're likely to spot pelicans skimming along
the surface and diving for snacks, or bobbing in the swells like
great, fish-powered frigates. Off Hammonds' Point, those are not
seals in the water, they are wetsuit-clad surfers playing chicken
with the offshore rocks.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good stretch for beach walking because the lords and
ladies of the palatial manors that abut it tend to be reclusive
sorts _ and in some cases absentee owners. As a result, the foot
traffic is not particularly heavy, and it's virtually nil on
weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   You likely will encounter dogs, though. Lot of dogs. Although a
deputy at the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department said there
is a leash law on the books, it's clear that it is obstinately
ignored here. The hounds roam with such impunity that sometimes
it's difficult to match up the pets with the owners, even for
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The packs race up and down the sand, dashing into the surf,
chasing nothing in particular, slobbering on lone walkers ...
seeming to single out the beach in front of the Miramar as their
own private comfort station.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe once the townhouse suites and the beach grill go in and
that shabby throwback motel is finally transformed, they'll begin
to exhibit a bit more decorum. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Montecito lies immediately south of Santa Barbara,
about a 90-mile drive from Los Angeles via U.S. 101.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Published rates for rooms at the Four Seasons Biltmore
Resort start at $420 for a standard room. Deluxe rooms in a cottage
setting are particularly popular; they start at $465. Packages are
offered, with the greatest savings available from Sunday through
Thursday. Phone: (805) 969-2261. Reservations: (800) 332-3442. Web:
www.fourseasons.com/santabarbara. At the Miramar, rates in high
season (today through the summer) range from $139 for a poolside
room to $329 for oceanfront. Cottages range from $319 (one bedroom)
to $619 (three-bedroom). Suites with kitchenettes are available _
$839 for an oceanfront unit. Phone: (805) 969-2203. Reservations:
(800) 322-6983. Web: www.sbmiramar.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Perhaps the best dinner option in Montecito is Pane e
Vino, a trattoria in the Upper Village (1482 East Valley Road). It
offers about a dozen pasta dishes priced just under $10. The
pennette rigate alla Siciliana was inventive, featuring pasta tubes
with fresh tuna cubes, olives and capers in a tomato sauce. For the
fettuccine with mussels and clams, all the seafood was served on
the shell. Check the daily specials sheet for reasonably priced
wines _ we found a pleasant 1997 San Felice Chianti Classico for
$25. The best breakfast in town is at Tutti's, in the Lower Village
(1209 Coast Village Road). Hearty omelets and breakfast burritos
are served up with smokehouse bacon. The menu features an extensive
selection of bakery goods, including scones and muffins, and some
daring items _ cornbread French toast, for example. The Biltmore's
patio is tough to beat for a lunch setting, especially if the
marine layer has lifted. Crab cakes laced with goat cheese ($16)
were excellent.

NEW CONTROVERSY OVER OCCUPANT OF ANCIENT TOMB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is buried in King Philip's tomb?
</P>
<P>
   That's not a trick question, at least not to archaeologists
studying a royal burial site in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the tomb near the town of Vergina was opened 23
years ago, scholars have argued about whose bones lay within: was
he King Philip II of Macedonia _ the father of Alexander the Great
_ or King Philip III Arrhidaeus, Alexander's half-brother, who
assumed the throne after Alexander's death? The tomb's occupant
could not be Alexander, who was buried in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by a Greek historian, the bones themselves
provide the answer: Arrhidaeus, the half-brother. Dr. Antonis
Bartsiokas, director of the Anaximandrian Institute of Human
Evolution in Voula, Greece, and an assistant professor of history
and ethnology at the Democritus University of Thrace, reported his
findings in the current issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a confirmation using the bones as evidence,'' Dr. Eugene
Borza, professor emeritus of ancient history at Pennsylvania State
University, said of the Science paper.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rulers of Macedonia, an ancient kingdom in northern
Greece, died young and violently. Philip II was stabbed to death in
336 B.C. during a celebration just before he was to set off to
conquer Persia. Philip III Arrhidaeus was also killed, in 317 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 examination of the bones in King Philip's tomb, a team
of British researchers had contended that a bump above the skull's
right eye socket was the healed-over wound from an arrow that
sliced into King Philip II's head in 354 B.C. Philip II survived
and ruled for another 18 years before he was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Examining life-size photographs of the bones, Bartsiokas has
concluded that the alleged wound is merely the ``supraorbital
notch,'' a normal feature of the eye socket where a bundle of
nerves and blood vessels pass through. Most people can feel the
notch beneath their eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   A crack below the eye socket, which the British researchers had
interpreted as a healed bone scar, probably formed during
cremation, according to Bartsiokas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw there was no evidence of an eye injury,'' Bartsiokas
said.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly good condition of the bones _ almost the whole
skeleton remained after the cremation _ offers further clues to
their identity, Bartsiokas said. Usually, the burning heat of
cremation shrinks the collagen protein at the center of bones,
causing them to warp and fracture.
</P>
<P>
   According to historical records, however, six months passed
between Arrhidaeus' death and his cremation. During that six-month
gap, Bartsiokas argues, the collagen began to break down,
minimizing the amount of warping and fracturing that would occur
during cremation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only skeleton that we know of a Macedonian king who
was not cremated immediately after his death,'' Bartsiokas said.
``The historical, the anthropological and the archaeological
evidence in this case all coincide.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have come to the same conclusion from other
evidence, arguing that some of the pottery found in the tomb comes
from a generation after Philip II.
</P>
<P>
   If true, some of the artifacts within the tomb, including a
helmet and a ceremonial shield, could be those of Alexander the
Great, who conquered most of the Mediterranean region during his
13-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   The British researchers, however, remain certain the bones are
those of Alexander's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bartsiokas has been selective in the use of
evidence,'' said Dr. Jonathan H. Musgrave, senior lecturer in
anatomy at the University of Bristol in England and one of the
authors of the 1984 paper identifying the remains as Philip II.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave conceded that evidence for the supposed eye wound was
``fairly weak,'' but said that was only part of the Philip II
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the face remains twisted, as if it had sustained a
major wound. ``I personally believe you can see major signs of
asymmetry away from the area that he is talking about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave also cited signs of hasty construction of the tomb's
main chamber, which would be expected in the turmoil after Philip
II's assassination. The six-month gap between death and burial of
Philip III Arrhidaeus would have provided plenty of time for the
building of the tomb, he said.

   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox calls Francisco Labastida ``Mr.
More-of-the-Same.'' Labastida refers to Fox as a vulgar rancher.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Mexico's two leading presidential candidates have
been tossing barbs at each other through newspaper stories, radio

confront each other in person when they share the stage in a
nationally broadcast debate.

   All six of Mexico's presidential hopefuls will take part in the
90-minute debate, the first among this year's candidates and only
the second in Mexican history, but voters and analysts will likely
be looking closest at the two front-runners, who are locked in a
virtual tie in most major opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 57, a former Coca-Cola executive and governor of Guanajuato
state, has become the opposition's best hope of knocking out the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party after 71 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate of a coalition between the conservative National
Action Party and the environmentalist Ecology Party, the boot-shod
Fox has appealed to many residents with a tart-tongued style that
evokes shades of Jessie Ventura, Ross Perot and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He has pegged Labastida, the ruling party candidate, as a
continuation of the government's technocratic policies that have
simultaneously brought economic growth and more poverty. But Fox's
routine seems to distract voters as much as it attracts them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire his ability to stand up and speak frankly about the
way things are in Mexico,'' said Antonio Mendez Gallardo, a
33-year-old Mexico City accountant who considers himself an
undecided voter. ``But he has to balance that image with a more
refined approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is a longtime PRI insider who has served as governor
of Sinaloa state and, more recently, as President Ernesto Zedillo's
agriculture secretary and interior minister. In contrast to Fox,
Labastida has been more bland, except for the times he has tried to
take on Fox's jibes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 57-year-old economist has offered broad proposals
to improve Mexico's stagnant education system, to fight crime, and
to reform its inefficient farming sector.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing far behind Fox and Labastida in distant third is former
Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. The son of a former
president from the 1930s whom many consider to be a Mexican hero
for nationalizing the country's oil industry, Cardenas, who is
making his third presidential bid representing a left-leaning
coalition, has been shadowed in recent weeks by rumors that he
might withdraw from the race to help Fox's opposition candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Cardenas recently told a group of American
journalists. ``We have opposite proposals and it would be illogical
for us to make an alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers don't know what to expect from the debate. The
rules, which were negotiated by each campaign, are so rigid that
direct exchange between candidates is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is dismissing the possibility of a repeat of 1994,
when, in Mexico's only other presidential debate, Diego Fernandez
de Cevallos, the PAN candidate, broadsided Zedillo and Cardenas
with an array of direct confrontations and impassioned speeches.
Fernandez's performance momentarily boosted his campaign into first
place, only to lose the election to Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's debate format is the result of what happened in
1994,'' said Sergio Aguayo Quesada, a political professor at the
Colegio de Mexico. ``(Fernandez) took advantage of a flexible
format. It might happen this year, but it'll be harder to pull
off.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the debate goes, Aguayo and others agree that Fox has
the most to win and that Labastida probably has the most to lose.
Analysts say the winner could gain as much as 3 to 4 points among
undecided voters. Another debate _ among only the top three
contenders _ will be held before the July 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign has been perhaps the most democratic in
terms of press coverage. A survey released last month by the
independent Federal Elections Institute found that opposition
candidates received the greatest amount of coverage from the
country's two main television networks. The study also found,
however, that opposition parties also received a greater proportion
of negative coverage compared to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexicans everywhere, it seems, argue that it's time for
a change in governing party, they still seem to be worried about
the economic and political uncertainty it could create.
</P>
<P>
   A national poll published Monday by the Mexico City daily
Reforma showed that 50 percent of those interviewed think that a
PRI loss could cause economic instability, while 58 percent think
it could cause political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he thought Mexican voters were ready to end
the PRI's monopoly on the presidency, 24-year-old Miguel Antonio
Rivas shook his head and waved his hand dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say they want something different,'' said Rivas,
a part-time college student and musician. ``But deep down I think
they're scared of something new. This is a country of traditions,
not of experiments.''

MARKET PLACE: INVESTORS BEMOAN MICROSOFT'S DOWNWARD DRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-SUIT and MARKET) 
 By ALEX BERENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since it first sold shares to the public 14 years
ago, Microsoft has become more than a software company.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned in steady increases in profit and revenues quarter
after quarter, year after year, Microsoft convinced an entire
generation of investors that no price was too rich to pay for a
leading technology company. Sure, Microsoft's stock price always
seemed expensive relative to its current earnings. But a year or
two later, those earnings were much higher, and so was Microsoft's
stock.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in more than a decade, investors have had to
confront the reality that even Microsoft sometimes misses its mark.
And they are not happy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares fell more than 15 percent Monday after
investors digested the company's earnings report for the quarter
ended in March and realized that operating profit was short of
analysts' estimates, although net income was slightly ahead of
expectations thanks to gains on its investments. In addition,
Microsoft encouraged analysts to cut their earnings and revenue
estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in June, as
well as all of fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing news on earnings was compounded by reports
Monday that the Department of Justice may try to to resolve its
antitrust case against the software maker by splitting Microsoft
into two or more companies. With many technology stocks in a
month-long swoon, jittery investors shed Microsoft shares with
extreme prejudice. By day's end, Microsoft had fallen $12.3125 to
$66.625 in heavy trading, with more than 155 million shares
changing hands. The decline shaved close to $70 billion off the
company's market valuation, a drop larger than the total market
capitalization of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's fall triggered a rout in many technology stocks,
with the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index closing Monday at
3,482.38, down 161.50. That puts the index at its lowest level
since a 9.7 percent plunge 10 days ago left it at 3321.29.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the plunge, Microsoft's problems are not necessarily bad
news for the rest of the technology sector. Worldwide technology
spending remains strong and other big technology companies,
including Intel, have reported first-quarter earnings well ahead of
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost across the board, technology spending appears to be
extremely robust and healthy,'' said Michael Manns, senior
portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management, which
invests $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. companies are spending less money on desktop computers
and more money on high-end servers that they can use for crunching
numbers in data bases and running business-to-business Internet
sites. Sun Microsystems, a maker of servers, benefits from this
shift at Microsoft's expense, said Chris Mortenson, a managing
director of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last year we've been moving to a more server-centric
environment,'' Mortenson said. ``That is taking away from spending
on the desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Wall Street analysts, Mortenson said most of
Microsoft's slide Monday came because of fears that its growth has
slowed _ not because of the Justice Department's antitrust case.
Mortenson said he did not think a Microsoft breakup would be good
for the company's investors, but he noted that the lawsuit will
take years to resolve and that no one knows the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Applegate, a longtime bull on technology stocks and chief
investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, agreed that the antitrust
case is less important to Microsoft's future than the shift in
technology spending away from personal computers. ``I've viewed the
legal stuff, the antitrust issue, as more of a sideshow, and to me
the real issue is can these guys migrate their business from a
PC-centric to an Internet-centric world,'' Applegate said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's earnings report last week offered cause for concern
on that score. The company said that its sales in the three months
ended March 31 were $5.66 billion, up 23 percent from their 1999
level. But most analysts were predicting a much stronger increase,
to $5.9 billion. Most of the shortfall came from
lighter-than-expected sales of the company's Windows operating
system software, with sales to business customers especially poor,
analysts said. That crimped Microsoft's operating margins, which
were down slightly compared to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's profits rose 23 percent compared to the 1999
quarter, to $2.4 billion, or 43 cents per share, much of that
increase came from unexpectedly large gains in Microsoft's
investments in other companies. Microsoft's operating profits were
actually two cents short of analysts' expectations, the first time
Microsoft has disappointed Wall Street since March 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft told analysts that its revenue and profit
growth would stay slow throughout this year and into 2001. While
the company regularly talks down its future prospects, analysts
said that this guidance was more conservative than usual,
especially since it came after a soft quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors would be wise to keep Microsoft's troubles in
perspective. Most companies would be thrilled to have operating
margins near 50 percent and a cash and investment hoard that tops
$40 billion. And Applegate noted that since the rally in technology
began in early 1993, there have been seven previous periods when
technology stocks significantly underperformed the market, he said.
Each time, they have eventually regained their lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this has never happened,'' Applegate said.
``It's typically a poster child which stumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's success has made it more than just another
technology company. Its gains have coincided with a decade-long
economic renaissance in the United States, and an enormous bull
market in technology stocks. Microsoft's growth taught many
investors that technology could be enormously profitable. Then the
even speedier ascent of Cisco Systems, the leading manufacturer of
networking equipment, turned advocates of GARP, or growth at a
reasonable price, into fans of GAAP _ growth at any price.
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft's earnings shortfall has thrown the downside of
paying high prices for growth companies into high relief. It offers
proof, as if any were needed, that no company can compound its
earnings to infinity and that even the best-managed business
sometimes falls victim to forces beyond its control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much sympathy for people who pay 100, 110 times
earnings for companies like Cisco and Sun Microsystems,'' said
Scott Black, president of Boston-based Delphi Management and a
longtime value investor. ``These are very fine companies. But trees
don't grow to the sky.''

JUSTICES ENTER DEBATE ON BLANKET PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash., Alaska, La.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court wrestled Monday with a civics
question of constitutional dimension and major practical
implications: Do the political parties or the electorate as a whole
control the nominating process?
</P>
<P>
   At issue was California's so-called blanket primary, in which
voters of all party affiliations receive the same ballot on which
they can make any set of choices, without regard to party. A voter
can select a favorite Democratic candidate for the gubernatorial
nomination, for example, while choosing among Republicans for a
state assembly nomination and among Libertarian Party options for a
local race.
</P>
<P>
   The system was adopted as a voter initiative, Proposition 198,
in 1996 over the official opposition of the political parties in
California but with support at the polls from a majority of
Democratic, Republican, and independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and Peace and Freedom
parties tried unsuccessfully in the lower federal courts to block
Proposition 198, which the parties' lawyer described to the
justices on Monday as ``a wholesale assault on a political party's
First Amendment right to choose the standard-bearer who best
represents the party's ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional question is whether the parties have a right
under the First Amendment protection for freedom of association to
exclude nonmembers from their nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the initiative's supporters was to produce more
centrist candidates by diluting the ability of party regulars to
control the nomination. George Waters, the parties' lawyer, argued
that the state could not constitutionally pursue that goal by
``commandeering the political parties as a vehicle to blend the
political ideologies together.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for California, defending the blanket primary,
described Proposition 198 as a great success, increasing voter
turnout by giving all voters, regardless of party registration, an
incentive to participate in the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just civics,'' Thomas F. Gede, a special assistant state
attorney general, told the justices. ``The more people you have
voting, the more representative the candidates will be.'' He said
the parties should welcome, rather than fight, the opportunity for
enhanced success by appealing to a broader range of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The justices challenged many of Gede's assertions and, by their
questions, appeared sympathetic to the parties' position. But as
Gede stressed at the end of his argument, a decision striking the
blanket primary on the ground that it interfered with the parties'
autonomy would inevitably cast constitutional doubt on the much
more common open primary that is used in about half the states.
</P>
<P>
   Under that system, voters can request a party's primary ballot,
even if they are not enrolled in that party; their choices are then
limited to the contestants for that party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   To accept the principle of ``total party autonomy'' would be to
jeopardize that system, Gede said, as well as a system in some
states that permits same-day registration as entry for voting in a
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Under the court's precedents, states can insist that parties use
primaries to nominate candidates. But states do not necessarily
have the last word. In a 1986 decision, Tashjian vs. Republican
Party of Connecticut, the court ruled that Connecticut could not
enforce its closed primary law against the state's Republican
Party, which wanted to open its primary to independents as a way of
broadening its base.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable discussion over how to apply the
Connecticut decision for the case Monday, California Democratic
Party vs. Jones, No. 99-401. Waters, the parties' lawyer, said the
1986 decision stood for the principle of ``party sovereignty,''
under which ``parties have the right to structure their own
rules.'' While the Connecticut Republicans chose openness, he said,
the California parties had an equally valid right to oppose the
blanket primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gede, arguing for California, said the Connecticut decision was
not directly relevant; rather than the Legislature imposing a rule
on the parties, he said, Proposition 198 was a direct reflection of
the will of California's voters. ``The voters acted in their own
First Amendment interest,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the only member of the court to
have held elective office _ she was majority leader of the Arizona
state Senate before becoming a judge _ was openly skeptical of the
state's arguments. When Gede began describing broad participation
in primary elections as the ``first cut'' in the electoral process,
she interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is precisely the point at which the associational
interest is at its zenith,'' O'Connor said. She demanded of Gede
whether he recognized that the parties had ``any associational
right.'' When he said he did, O'Connor persisted: ``What would
remain after your so-called balancing test of a party's right at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia was hostile to the state's position,
characterizing it as ``tyranny of the majority'' and ``democracy
carried to extremes.'' A small, ideology-based party might have no
interest in the mainstream, he said, and yet risked having its
nomination process taken over by voters who did not share its
views.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, the parties' lawyer, said the state's brief experience
under Proposition 198 demonstrated the risk to small parties. In
three primary races in 1998, he said, candidates running as
Libertarians attracted more than twice as many votes as there were
registered Libertarians in the districts.
</P>
<P>
   The weakest part of Waters' argument was his effort to reassure
the justices that they could strike down the blanket primary
without casting a constitutional cloud over the more common open
primaries. Only Washington and Alaska share California's blanket
primary, with Louisiana using some features of it, while 23 states
have open primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said that in an open primary, voters engage in an ``act
of affiliation,'' however brief, by requesting a particular party's
ballot. But Justice David H. Souter objected that such an
affiliation was a ``pretty empty formality,'' rather than a
constitutional distinction.

FEDERAL HEARINGS TO CONSIDER HEALTH LABELS ON WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM TESCONI   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Federal hearings, which start Tuesday in
Washington, are rekindling the debate over the health benefits of
wine while addressing whether health labels of any kind should be
allowed on bottles of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents want to ban the health labels, claiming they are
misleading and have the potential to cause alcohol abuse. The wine
industry says it wants to preserve the labels because they direct
consumers to valuable information that could help them live longer,
healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
   George Hacker of the Center for Science in the Public Interest
said the health labels, approved in 1999 after three years of study
by a federal agency, are subtle promotional messages that may lead
consumers to believe that the government endorses drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health claims for alcoholic beverages on labels or in
advertising should simply not be allowed, no matter how well
supported those claims may be,'' said Hacker, director of alcohol
policies at the Washington, D.C.-based consumer information group.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that there may be some benefits from moderate
alcohol consumption for some people but said that does not mean
that people should be advised to drink for their health.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker is among more than 20 speakers on both sides of the issue
who will testify at hearings being held by the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to determine if the ``negative consequences of
alcohol consumption or abuse'' disqualify wine, beer and spirits
from carrying any health-related statements.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings are Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington and May 23
and 24 in San Francisco. Hearings scheduled for Atlanta, Chicago
and Dallas were canceled because so few signed up to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 800 wineries in California, only 17 use the
labels. Most wineries don't bother with the labels for several
reasons, including the cost, lack of space on the bottle and the
bureaucratic hassle of getting the labels approved by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry insists that the labels under review make no
specific health claims. Instead, industry leaders say, the labels
are educational messages directing consumers to seek sound
scientific knowledge on alcohol consumption, including the
government's own dietary guidelines.

RADAR TROUBLES IN BOSTON RIPPLE THROUGH AIRLINE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As FAA technicians worked to install, test and operate a
replacement radar antenna for Logan International Airport, airline
operations centers struggled to keep problems in Boston from
swamping the schedule throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule began to return to normal with the replacement
antenna of the airport surveillance radar operating by late Monday.
But for two-and-a-half days passengers endured monumental delays
and saw flights to and from Boston canceled by the dozen to keep
the ripple effect of delayed in Boston from becoming delayed
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Without the cancellations _ more than 200 flights were lost on
each of Saturday and Sunday and at least 174 were wiped off the
schedule _ delays would have stretched to as much as 11 hours,
airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to keep the skies over Boston from resembling
an expressway at rush hour, the FAA's Air Traffic Control System
Command Center, located in a Virginia suburb of Washington D.C.,
acted as the national traffic cop throughout the radar outage.
</P>
<P>
   By instituting what they call a ``Traffic Management Program''
and airline passengers call a major pain _ because of the delays
they cause around the country as Boston-bound planes sit on tarmacs
_ the FAA kept planes coming to Boston at a number that would not
overload the system. But the average ground hold on flights into
Boston was 110 minutes and the maximum ground hold was 279 minutes,
the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Airline schedules are incredibly complicated, and one plane
often has several different cities and crews in one day. A flight
from Chicago to Boston may then depart to Miami or Europe, rather
than head back to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that complexity, the collapse of the approach radar
early Saturday morning ``had far-reaching effects thoughout the
National Airspace System,'' said John White, deputy manager of the
FAA's command center.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel in airline operations centers worked to maintain
schedules by rapidly adjusting crew and aicraft destinations.
</P>
<P>
   At United Air Lines, one person was assigned to rewriting
schedules so aircraft and crews stayed together, which limited some
disruptions, said Mark Hussey, station manager in Boston for
United.
</P>
<P>
   And airlines relied heavily on airports in Providence, R.I. and
Manchester, N.H. to keep the system functioning.
</P>
<P>
   United, for example, chartered four buses that ran between Logan
and Manchester when it diverted about one third of its short haul
narrow body flights to Chicago and Washington's Dulles
International Airport. ``Because of the heavy loads into Manchester
we sent employees _ mechancis, ground support, customer service _
up there to meet our greater flight schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines chartered buses to take passengers to
Providence. Reservations agents also called passengers to alert
them of the change in rescheduling its Boston-Orlando schedule with
six flights out of Providence, said Rick Danner, Delta's regional
director for airport customer service.
</P>
<P>
   On other routes, Delta used larger aircraft. For example, on the
Boston-Atlanta route, Delta canceled a flight, but used an L-1011
rather than a Boeing 767 on another flight to pick up an additional
80 seats. And Boeing 737s were replaced with Boeing 767s.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines canceled eight of its 14 regularly scheduled
flights to Boston from Chicago's O'Hare Airport and several more
from its hub in Dallas. A spokeswoman said that enabled the airline
to move aircraft to other cities to contain damage to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways canceled a dozen flights and moved some flights to
Manchester, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   White said the FAA's traffic management program, which is
computerized, does not differentiate between aircraft types, only
the number of operations.
</P>
<P>
   And the FAA gives airlines the opporunity to decide which
aircraft should use the departure times it is given in the traffic
management program. For example, if an airline is given a departure
time of 2 p.m. under the program, it could cancel a 12 p.m. flight
and combine the canceled flight with a later one and still use the
2 p.m. slot.
</P>
<P>
   In good weather, Boston can handle about 60 incoming flights an
hour. The command center pulled that back to 18 an hour, because
the back-up radar (a combination of coverage from three distant
radars) required approaching planes to be spaced farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   And when the radar was repaired, ground holds on flights to
Boston from all domestic cities expect Denver and the West Coast
were still in place because a northwest wind restricted the number
of runways aviailable. The FAA estimated the average ground hold
was 59 minutes and the maximum ground hold was 270 minutes.

EXPERTS PUZZLED BY FAILURE OF CRITICAL LOGAN RADAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A permanent new radar antenna was up and running Monday
at Logan International Airport, but officials remained confounded
why the one it replaced toppled suddenly on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The failure plunged the nation's ninth-busiest airport into
three days of delays and scrubbed flights that held up air traffic
across the nation. More than 140 flights were cancelled Monday
alone before the new radar unit was operating.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which operates Logan's
radar facility on Governors Island, said it is not certain that
Saturday's moderate winds caused the freak problem and was
investigating other possibilities, including a technical
malfunction and metal fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-foot-wide, 17-foot-high orange antenna, which swivels to
plot the location of aircraft, fell over in winds of 46 mph, less
than half of the 85-knot or 98 mph winds it waS proven to withstand
in tests, according to FAA officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was also lasted less than half of its projected 20-year
lifespan.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Salac, chief spokesperson for the FAA's New England
regional office, said that of 143 identical radars around the
nation _ all of which are 10 years old or younger _ Logan's was the
only one to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good, reliable piece of equipment, and we've never
had this problem before, so we have no reason to believe that it's
a systemic problem,'' she said. ``We're treating it as an
anomaly.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at an FAA logistics center in Oklahoma began their
investigation into why the radar antenna, which is called an ASR-9,
toppled.
</P>
<P>
   ASR-9 stands for the ninth version of Airport Surveillance
Radar. It employs moving-target-detector technology developed at
the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and was developed by the Westinghouse
Electric Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   An identical antenna, flown to Boston from the FAA facility in
Oklahoma on Sunday, was installed, tested and put into operation,
immediately boosting the number of flights per hour from 26 to 38
and later to about 44 flights per hour, according to a Massport
official.
</P>
<P>
   The disabled, disc-shaped antenna, which dangled down the side
of the 20-foot-tall tower that supports it, was flown back to
Oklahoma for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Salac, the FAA spokesperson, said the agency was looking into
the possibility that the failure was caused by a ``microburst,'' a
short, very intense windstorm, which can be as small as one or two
miles in radius and can contain hurricane-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have reports of microburst activity in the region
Saturday, but we simply don't know if that was the cause,'' she
said. ``This post-mortem will be thorough and could take several
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Massport spokesman Phil Orlandella said that the radar failure
was not an implication of the entire, $8 million surveillance
system, which can track weather conditions and airplanes within an
8-mile radius of Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Massport owns the land on Governors Island where it
sits, the FAA owns and operates the radar equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Orlandella also said there is no problem using an identical
model to replace the broken equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the antenna, the thing that goes around, and it's
just one part of the facility,'' said Orlandella. ``They're not
changing anything else, like the computers or software.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlandella also said that there was no reason to doubt the
reliability of the new ASR-9 unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good, they work and they've proven effective, so we
are confident about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit was operational at 2:03 p.m., and the flight
arrival rate was increased at 2:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the switchover,'' Robert Bartanowicz, regional
administator for FAA New England, said at a news conference at
Logan. ``It was totally seemless, no interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials initially thought that it would take three to
five days to replace the radar and restore normal service at the
airport, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this in approximately 58 hours, so this certainly puts
us ahead of our most aggressive estimate of 72 hours. So we came in
well ahead of schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Salac said that the FAA would not begin automatic inspections of
other ASR-9 units at airports nationwide, unless the examination of
the damaged Logan unit raises broader concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ASR-9 is considered 99.6 percent reliable,'' she said.
``This is that .4 percent.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIQUICA, East Timor _ In his heart, says Joaquin da Luz, no
matter how many people he hurt, no matter how many homes he burned,
he was always one of the good guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to join the militia,'' said da Luz, a tough man
of 43 with a black stubble of beard. ``If we'd had a choice, who
would have wanted to be in the militia? But if I'd refused they
would have killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   His words could just as well have been printed on a little card.
All around newly independent East Timor, this is what former
members of the violent anti-independence militias are saying.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extraordinary moment here: hundreds of the men who
brutalized their country last September are trickling back from
their refuge in Indonesian West Timor to beg forgiveness from the
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   They may be astonished to see how successful they were in their
work. Directed by elements of the Indonesian military in a campaign
of revenge against a vote for independence last August, the rag-tag
militias ravaged the homes and lives of virtually all of the
800,000 people who lived here.
</P>
<P>
   ``House after house after house was looted and burned in the
most amazing logistical exercise the TNI has ever accomplished, or
maybe any other military for that matter,'' a U.N. official said,
using the initials for the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The men who return find that there is not even a jailhouse left
standing to hold more than a few dozen of them. Most of the rest
end up on a sort of parole among their former neighbors and
victims, hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 are living here in Liquica, a 45-minute drive from the
capital, Dili. Another 100 or so are in the neighboring town of
Maubara, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no matter what crimes they committed, most of the
returnees so far are underlings who have a realistic hope of
forgiveness. Some of their leaders are still active in small groups
along the border, terrorizing other evacuees and threatening
further harm.
</P>
<P>
   With no formal court system in place, the returnees face a
slapdash form of justice that varies from place to place, from
moment to moment. None can be sure if he will be met with a tearful
embrace of reconciliation or _ like one man here in Liquica
recently _ be beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   A crude processing procedure has taken form in East Timor in
which returnees are first placed under the protection of unarmed
U.N. police officers or the local vigilantes who have become the de
facto gendarmes of many towns.
</P>
<P>
   Residents then offer their evidence or opinions on what the
returnees have done and whether they can now be accepted back into
the community _ perhaps after a good beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a saint wouldn't be angry,'' said Amadio Dias Albino dos
Santos, 45, a local leader who is a longtime friend and ideological
opponent of da Luz.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up to them,'' he said, ``and say: `Hey, you
destroyed my house. You said you would kill my husband and rape me.
Well, go ahead! Rape me now. You used to think you were so
powerful. You could do whatever you wanted to us. And now you can't
do anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the militia members, ``They never apologize,'' he said.
``They just say: `We had no choice. We were just following
orders.'''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of East Timor's independence leaders, a
remarkable mood of reconciliation has softened the welcome for many
members of the militia like da Luz.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was rough,'' he said. ``People were angry and said
a lot of things. But now they don't pay attention to me any more.''
</P>
<P>
   He is glad of that, he said, but distressed that his neighbors
misunderstand him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just doing what we were told,'' he insisted, sitting
in the sparely furnished little house he has been given to live in.
``If they told us, do this bad thing, we had no choice, we had to
do it. But no matter what they made us do, in our hearts we were
pro-independence.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A former government clerk, he has lost his job along with almost
everybody else in this devastated country, and he now works as a
fisherman. Somebody has spray painted ``CNRT'' on the wall of his
home _ the initials of the victorious pro-independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos, who is the leader of the movement in Liquica, once
worked with da Luz in the local government office and _ when dos
Santos was not in prison for his underground activities _ they
debated the future of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Both men had strong pro-independence credentials. They fled into
the hills when Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in
1975 and for about four years fought as guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the way, da Luz lost his commitment to the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was a thing called money,'' dos Santos said.
``There was a lot of money coming in from Indonesia and it was up
to each person to decide: Do you want to keep the money and prosper
or suffer and fight for what you believe? It goes back to your
humanity. Some people hold on to their principles and some are
happy if you just give them some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Da Luz had a lot to do with money, his friend said. He was the
local paymaster for the militia.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, no one is accusing him of taking part in the
worst of the atrocities here in Liquica, a massacre of more than 50
people in April 1999 at the local church.
</P>
<P>
   That was when dos Santos fled into the hills along with other
pro-independence activists.
</P>
<P>
   Another local official, Grigorio Madeira, 42, recounted what was
known of da Luz during the worst days of destruction last
September, when the sky turned dark across East Timor from the
smoke of burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was with the Red and White Iron militia group, and he was
always heading off to Dili and other places with the other
members,'' Madeira said. ``Those were bad times. Nobody knows what
he was up to.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since he survived the dangerous moment of his return without
being beaten to death, da Luz may never face trial or punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations is in the process of setting up East
Timor's first court in Dili, and the first trials of militia
members are expected in June. Young prosecutors and defenders are
gathering evidence in the cases of a few of the toughest returnees,
even as they receive training in the workings of a court system.
</P>
<P>
   With extraordinary faith in this new process, many people in
East Timor say they are waiting for the courts to produce the
closure they crave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must trust the courts to bring us justice,'' dos Santos
said. ``These people must stand up in court and tell the truth
about what they have done, and we must believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if _ once the process is complete _ members of the
militia are acquitted and freed?
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is something we cannot accept.''

   NEW YORK _ Stocks had another rocky session Monday, as
aftershocks from a violently negative reaction among investors to
Microsoft's most recent earnings report reverberated through the
Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which reported results from its third fiscal quarter
after the market closed on Thursday, was battered, falling 12 5/16,
or 15.6 percent, to 66 5/8. It was the biggest loss in the software
giant's share price since Oct. 26, 1987, a week after the stock
market crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The slide was a huge contributor to the 161.40-point, or 4.4
percent, decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which closed at
3,482.48. A late rally in many Nasdaq shares pulled the index off
its lows for the session. Still, Microsoft was responsible for more
than 41 points of the Nasdaq's drop.
</P>
<P>
   Investors moved into other sectors of the market as they exited
Microsoft and other technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average managed to rise, even though
Microsoft is a component of the blue chip index. The Dow closed at
10,906.10, up 62.05 points, or 0.6 percent. Gains in financial
stocks like American Express, which reported strong earnings,
General Electric and J.P. Morgan outweighed weakness in Microsoft
and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Rising prices for drug, chemical and consumer stocks helped to
limit losses in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which closed
at 1,429.86, down 4.68 points, or 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was battered.
The Russell, which has been dominated by the performance of a
relatively small group of technology and biotechnology stocks, fell
13.30 points Monday, or 2.8 percent, to 468.54.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the midst of the decline in technology over the last
six weeks or so, I don't think investors have reconciled the fact
they were overweight technology at the expense of everything
else,'' said Jonathan Oleksy, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``We are seeing genuine interest in sectors
like drugs, chemicals, banks and utilities. Technology will still
ultimately command a large weighting of a person's portfolio. But
by the time you wring out this excess ownership more of this
rotational activity will have gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Nasdaq market now down 31 percent from its peak on
March 10 and 14.4 percent for the year, some analysts said they
were beginning to look for signs that technology stocks are forming
a bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq market is now just about as oversold relative to
its two-month moving average as it was back in 1987,'' said Laszlo
Birinyi, who heads his own stock market research firm in Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting close to a level where I may actually do a
little buying myself, in Microsoft and in technology in general,''
said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
``If you are underweight technology, I would put some cash to work
if the Nasdaq composite got to 3,250.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Microsoft's stock has been harshly
treated: So far this year, the stock is down 43 percent. Among
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies, the decline has dropped Microsoft
into fourth place in terms of market capitalization. It now trails
General Electric, Cisco Systems and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   And it has put a major crimp in the carrying value of Bill
Gates' holdings. Based on the most recent data on Microsoft
shareholders, the decline in the stock since the start of the year
has wiped out nearly $40 billion in paper assets from Gates'
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was far and away the most actively traded issue
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 157 million Microsoft shares changed hands, the
third-highest ever for a U.S. stock. Trading in Microsoft was about
three times as heavy as in the next most active issue Monday, Cisco
Systems. Cisco fell 1 5/8, to 63 1/2. The stock traded as low as 59
1/4.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, however, traders said business was fairly quiet.
European markets were closed in observance of Easter Monday. Among
Dow stocks, American Express rose 7, to 150, after it reported
first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, which also reported solid earnings, gained 2 3/16, to 71
15/16. And McDonald's rose 3 3/16, to 39.
</P>
<P>
   Big chemical companies like DuPont and Dow Chemical gained.
DuPont rose 1 3/4, to 56. And Dow Chemical was up 3 5/8, to 109.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Microsoft, Exodus Communications was the biggest
loser on the Nasdaq market. Late Thursday the manager of Internet
sites reported a loss that was wider than expected. On Monday the
stock was hammered, falling 25 3/16, to 82 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't see this terrific rotation that is going on, I
would be much more worried,'' said David Williams, manager of the
$1.2 billion Excelsior Value and Restructuring fund at U.S. Trust
Co. ``As long as the rotation continues, the market can probably
move higher.''

COMMENTARY: ABC HITS (MELTING) ICEBERG 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time has come to put in a good word for Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial White House interview between the star of
``Titanic'' and President Clinton finally aired last weekend, as
part of an ABC Earth Day special. ``Just by changing the lighting
in this building we lowered our electric bills by $100,000 a
year,'' the Leader of the World's Only Surviving Superpower said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' replied the Most Famous Actor on the Planet.
</P>
<P>
   Later DiCaprio managed to elicit the revelation that
environmental concerns were just as important to the president as
education or health care. Those were pretty much the high points.
More than 17 minutes of the 20-minute interview wound up on the
cutting-room floor, allegedly because ABC felt it was too
amateurish. Politics has not always been kind to DiCaprio, the
movie star John McCain always enjoyed referring to as ``that
androgynous wimp.''
</P>
<P>
   As an interviewer, DiCaprio is no Tim Russert, or even the guy
who used to ask taste testers whether they prefer Coke to Pepsi.
However, the network could have made a worse decision than
assigning a 25-year-old actor to talk global warming with the
president. For instance, it could have given the job to any of the
people responsible for the rest of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin with a brief recap of ``Planet Earth 2000,'' since
the ratings suggest that you did not get a chance to watch it
yourself. In fact, the odds were better that you spent the holiday
weekend being abducted by a UFO.
</P>
<P>
   The high point probably came when the ABC correspondent,
Christopher Cuomo, delivered a paean to the ancient hunting
traditions of the local Eskimos while his subjects buzzed around on
snowmobiles, waving high-powered rifles. The actual topic of the
segment was thinning ice near the North Pole. But if you waited for
Cuomo to point out that melting of the polar ice cap had a
potential effect on anything but the Eskimos' ability to keep their
recreational vehicles from falling into the water, you'd still be
on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   The program's resistance to providing context, or making any
sort of compelling point, was actually sort of fascinating. A
segment on Julia Butterfly Hill, the woman who spent two years
living in a tree to save it from the loggers, managed to tell her
whole story without once giving any inkling of why cutting down
redwoods is undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were targeting a younger audience,'' said Phyllis McGraddy,
an ABC vice president. ``The point of that woman was to bring them
to asking: `Well, why was she in that tree?'''
</P>
<P>
   The point of never giving them the answer was somewhat more
oblique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that nobody seems to be giving us credit for
even trying,'' McGraddy added. ``Whether we failed miserably, well,
that's a different debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting kids in global warming is such a fine goal that you
could overlook DiCaprio, not to mention the E.R.-like camera work,
the MTV-type soundtrack and the Foxian way that everything wound up
being illustrated by another picture of a hurricane. But out of
fear of offending or boring its target audience, ABC also made
global warming apolitical, devoid of villains. Even the lumber
company that wanted to cut down Hill's tree seemed nice.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, possibly hoping to drive ABC nuts, has released
a transcript of the 20 minutes of actor-president conversation that
got cut, and it turns out that there was one person involved in the
project who had a more, ah, global vision of global warming.
DiCaprio wanted to know how the United States could get developing
countries to cut pollution when ``we're responsible for a quarter
of the greenhouse gases that go into the atmosphere.'' He also
asked about requiring automobile manufacturers to make cars
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The president's answers were, to use the metaphors of the
moment, rather windy and unelectrifying. Even worse, from the
producers' point of view, they were delivered from a chair. The
network had counted on a walking tour of the energy-efficient White
House, and the producers apparently lost interest in DiCaprio's
scoop when they found out the president wanted the interview to be
stationary. ``It was supposed to be an hour of everything moving,
not sitting down,'' said McGraddy.

NIKE CHAIRMAN CANCELS $30 MILLION GIFT OVER SWEATSHOP PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairman of Nike, Phil Knight, will not make a planned $30
million contribution to help his alma mater, the University of
Oregon, renovate its athletic stadium because of the university's
decision to join an anti-sweatshop group, a senior Nike official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a billionaire who heads the world's largest footwear
company, has given about $30 million to the university over the
last decade, but company officials said he was disturbed that the
university joined the Workers Rights Consortium, a student-backed
monitoring group.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, which has faced criticism over working conditions in its
overseas factories, has often faulted the consortium for being
unfriendly to apparel and footwear manufacturers. Nike is an
enthusiastic member of another monitoring group, the Fair Labor
Association, a White House-backed organization that, unlike the
consortium, has apparel companies on its board.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Nike said, ``The University of Oregon, despite
its unique relationship with Nike and Phil, is free to align itself
with the Workers Rights Consortium. However, it does not mean that
we are required to support those efforts with which we have
fundamental disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Oregon, based in Eugene, has been developing
plans to renovate and expand Autzen Stadium, a project that is
expected to cost $80 million. University officials said they still
hoped to talk with Knight to see whether he might reconsider his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Newnham, a senior at the university and the co-coordinator
of the Survival Center, which describes itself as an organization
backing social justice and human rights, criticized Knight's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of amusing, considering that he's upset that we
joined some labor-monitoring body,'' Newnham said. ``He keeps
claiming that his company is socially responsible and they don't
use sweatshop labor. If that's the case, why is he so upset that we
joined this monitoring group? It kind of implies that something
isn't quite up to par.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six months, student groups at dozens of campuses
have held sit-ins and demonstrations to pressure their universities
to join the consortium, instead of the Fair Labor Association. The
consortium, set up by students with the backing of several labor
unions, now has 47 universities as members. It monitors overseas
factories that make hats, T-shirts and other apparel that are made
under license and carry a university's logo.
</P>
<P>
   The students assert that the Fair Labor Association is dominated
by corporations and will not be vigorous in its monitoring. Its
members include several consumer groups, human rights groups and
130 colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Nike officials are critical of the makeup of the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We object to the Workers Rights Consortium because it does not
provide a seat on the table for companies,'' said Vada Manager, a
Nike spokesman. ``Another issue is it has a `gotcha' monitoring
system, which in our minds is not a serious way to achieve the
common goal that we all want to achieve, which is to eradicate
sweatshop conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   To step up pressure on Nike, United Students Against Sweatshops,
the umbrella group backing the consortium, the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees and other groups
issued a report Monday that criticized Nike for using overseas
sweatshops. The report faults Nike for doing much of its production
in China, where unions are prohibited and where, the report said,
workers are paid at most $1.50 for a pair of shoes that sells for
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Nike officials assert that the company has made great strides in
improving its factories, that they do more monitoring than most
companies and that their overseas factories usually pay more than
other factories in the regions where they are located.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nike said it was terminating its agreement to supply
Brown University's hockey teams after Brown joined the consortium.
Brown officials said Nike's move resulted from miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Reville, a Brown junior active in United Students
Against Sweatshops, said that with their moves against Brown and
the University of Oregon, Nike and Knight were seeking to send a
warning that universities should not join the consortium.

MOTOROLA HOPES MYA WILL LINK THE REAL WORLD WITH THE VIRTUAL ONE
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As the symbol of the new 24-hour talking Internet,
Motorola nominates a virtual woman named Mya, a long-legged blonde,
clad in a shimmering silver business suit and sporting punky hair
and a ubiquitous telephone headset.
</P>
<P>
   Her animated figure is showcased in a new 60-second television
spot created for Motorola Inc., the cellular telephone and
semiconductor giant that is now trying to sell software and
Internet services and jazz up its image.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the service will not be available to consumers until
summer, Motorola rushed the spot out for the Academy Awards, hoping
the hippest of hip would associate Motorola with an Internet
service that will allow people to call into a voice-activated
``cyberassistant'' who will read e-mail messages, stock quotes,
sports scores and weather forecasts directly from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications experts say the Motorola offering _
which would be sold to consumers through cellular phone carriers
and other intermediaries _ is among the first of many
voice-activated Internet operations to come, and that technology
companies are increasingly going to turn to virtual humans to sell
those products.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there is an online question and answer service called
Ask Jeeves. In London, a company has created Ananova, a
green-haired cyberanchor billed as the world's first virtual
newscaster, that began broadcasting from the Web site
www.ananova.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online companies are trying to personalize a service that is
inherently impersonal,'' said Joseph Laszlo, a wireless data
analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``In the consumers' mind, if
they think of this person who's trying to help them, this kind of
marketing may help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mya is a computer-generated being who companies hope will link
the real world to the virtual one, and marketers hope will be
attractive enough to catch the attention of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a Web browser, this is someone who can speak to
you,'' said Geoffrey Frost, the vice president for consumer
communications at Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, however, will have to wait until at least June to
subscribe to the service, which gets its news from Reuters and its
weather from Accuweather, two companies that use Motorola's
technology to convert data to voice and voice to data.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola plans to spend more than $10 million to start the
service and recast its traditionally stodgy image with provocative
advertising from its agency, McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising,
part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic
Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola really wanted to put a stake in the ground in the
post-PC world,'' said Jonathan Cranin, a creative director at
McCann-Erickson. ``And the talking Internet seemed to be the
coolest thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola did not invent the idea of a 24-hour talking Internet
service, but it is an early developer, and the first company to
start a major marketing push in the United States. Motorola's
telecommunications partners in the venture have not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   In the spot that appeared during the Academy Awards ceremony,
Mya is portrayed as the sexy celebrity everyone is talking about:
Her portrait is on the cover of USA Today, Wired and InStyle
magazine. She has a guest appearance on a late-night talk show.
Hugh Hefner, lounging in a limo with two women, asks Mya to read
his e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the segment, a cyberlimo arrives at what looks
like the Academy Awards. Mya steps out and with bulbs flashing,
confesses, ``Yes, I read the Web to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola and McCann-Erickson came up with the idea of creating
an animated character to symbolize the new Internet service, which
is called myosphere.
</P>
<P>
   To create the character, McCann hired Digital Domain, the
animation studio in Venice, Calif., that was founded by James
Cameron, the director of ``Titanic,'' and the producers of
``Terminator.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Raimondi, the visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain,
said the company began by casting a real-life actress as Mya and
then photographed and filmed her body in painstaking detail. A
three-dimensional image of the actress was created and then scanned
into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first shot we showed them, she looked too real,''
Raimondi said. ``We had to pull her back. That's why her clothes
are shiny.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mya's angelic voice, the company hired Gabrielle Carteris,
the former ``Beverly Hills 90210'' actress.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Domain may spawn other cyberassistants, male and female,
perhaps even giving consumers the option of finding a voice that
suits their fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may give you your choice of personalities,'' Frost at
Motorola said.

HIM AL

 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is only one member of Vice President Gore's
staff close enough to call him Al.
</P>
<P>
   It is Leon Sigmund Fuerth, Gore's longest-serving aide, who has
acted as his elder adviser on national security matters for two
decades. The two men know each other so well that, like an old
married couple, they can communicate through a grimace or a glance.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship goes back to 1980, when Fuerth, a staff member
on Capitol Hill, tutored the young congressman from Tennessee nine
years his junior several hours a week for more than a year on the
arcana of arms control. Since then Fuerth has exercised influence
over Gore, whose worldview blends a belief in a strong defense, the
elevation of issues like illness and the environment to the top of
the national security agenda and a moralistic impulse to punish
dictators.
</P>
<P>
   Fuerth has often stiffened his boss' spine, including pressing
early to use strikes to constrain Serbian forces from ethnic
cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo and taking an uncompromising line
against Iraq, Iran and North Korea, which Fuerth has referred to
privately as ``giant zits on various parts of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his his influence, including membership in the
cabinet-level Principals' Committee that advises the president on
foreign policy, the onetime foreign service officer labors largely
in the shadows. He rarely gives speeches or interviews. He has
written no great tomes. He likes to work alone. At one point he
announced at a press briefing that his goal was to remain
``nameless, faceless and odorless''; at another he told aides that
his ideas ``belong to the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore praises that approach as positively quaint and has hinted
that he may name Fuerth as national security adviser in a Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a keen intellect, a strong character, absolute
integrity and excellent instincts,'' Gore said in a telephone
interview. ``There is a certain quaintness to his insistence on
taking as little credit for anything he can possibly push off to
others, quaintness in the sense not that it is odd. In fact, I wish
it were more common. In today's world that quality is all too
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Time magazine's prediction last year that Fuerth was
``a cinch'' to be national security adviser in a Gore
administration, Gore at first stuck to his rule not to discuss
potential advisers. But then he added, ``If I were to break that
rule for anybody, it would be for Leon.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly quaintness is not a word that springs to mind in
describing former national security advisers Henry A. Kissinger or
Zbigniew Brzezinski. And when asked what Fuerth would be like in
the job he once held, Kissinger replied, ``I'm afraid I don't know
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush have already begun to criticize
the vice president and his top national security aide by
criticizing the performance of the Clinton administration. ``A
hallmark of the Clinton-Gore foreign policy has been ad hockery and
case-by-case actions lacking in strategy,'' said Robert Zoellick,
an undersecretary of state in the Bush administration. So despite
Fuerth's passion for anonymity, he inevitably will be drawn into
the spotlight in a presidential campaign in which Gore is
increasingly contrasting his foreign policy experience with that of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And that could be uncomfortable for Fuerth, 61, who has spent
his entire career inside government and who has never had to
develop an ear for politics. By contrast, Sandy Berger, President
Clinton's national security adviser, knows how to shape foreign
policy to fit politics.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie H. Gelb, the president of the Council on Foreign
Relations who has known Berger and Fuerth for years, said that
Berger ``came to the job as a political pro and had to master the
foreign policy part of it.'' ``Leon,'' he added, ``came to the
White House as a foreign policy expert and he now has to master the
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in their relationship, Gore created a division of labor
that he and Fuerth insist suits them fine. He told Fuerth to
provide the best advice on what was good for the country and to
``leave the politics to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But that division means that Fuerth can sometimes be out of the
political loop. In an interview on March 30, for example, Fuerth
was asked how his boss would resolve the case of Elian Gonzalez.
``The administration's position and the vice president's position
consistently are to navigate where the boy's best interests are,''
Fuerth said. ``And in our system, the courts are the best place to
get this task done.''
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, Gore was proposing a legislative
solution that could have allowed the boy to remain in the United
States. By Fuerth's own admission, he was unaware that Gore had
decided to change course that day.
</P>
<P>
   And there can be a downside to avoiding politics. It was Fuerth
who told Gore that the now celebrated fund-raising luncheon at a
Buddhist temple in 1996 posed no problem from a foreign policy
standpoint, instead of looking at it from a larger legal and
ethical perspective. (The National Security Council, by contrast,
warned that Gore should proceed with ``great, great caution.'')
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Fuerth was blamed for the politically embarrassing
incident during vice president's trip to China in 1997 in which he
inadvertently shared a Champagne toast with Prime Minister Li Peng,
who had orchestrated the Tiananmen massacre. Fuerth said that the
toast was never supposed to happen, but that the Chinese broke
their promises.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Gore at times has devised idealistic solutions for solving
global problems, Fuerth tends to takes a darker view, a view that
stems from a deeply rooted belief that the world is a dangerous
place. As a young man, Fuerth said he was so terrified by the 1960
classic ``On Thermonuclear War'' by Herman Kahn that he was
reluctant to start a family.
</P>
<P>
   Fuerth's vacuum-cleaner mind and his tenacity when he is
convinced he is right can make him a formidable opponent in making
decisions. ``Contrarian'' is often used to describe him.
</P>
<P>
   But he can also sound downright eloquent when discussing issues
about which he and Gore feel passionately, like the AIDS epidemic
in sub-Sahara Africa. ``If you get something which can burn out the
heart of a generation, what is the difference if they're dying of
disease or war?'' he said. ``They're dying! And people will not
flourish, people will not live out their lives or make their full
contributions. Societies will be destabilized. A generation of
orphans will be created. So if you need an analogy to warfare, it's
the consequences of war without the explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore depends heavily on Fuerth, who has developed a system of
passing hand-written, humor-laced, policy-filled notes during
meetings, meals and even receiving lines. The note-passing became
so disruptive during the president's cabinet meetings that protocol
was abandoned and Fuerth was given a permanent seat at the vice
president's immediate right.
</P>
<P>
   For meetings with foreign officials, Gore gets the benefit of
Fuerth's detailed knowledge in thick briefing books and then
distilled on a stack of note cards.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, when an aide urged Gore to dispense with the
cards, the vice president was said to reply that he did not want to
hurt Fuerth's feelings. Gore now says that if he ever said such a
thing, it was in jest and that in fact, he does need the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, Fuerth did not grow up privileged. His father, who
drove an ice cream truck, died of coronary thrombosis when Leon, an
only child, was 8; his widowed mother went to work in a dry
cleaning shop.
</P>
<P>
   After majoring in English at New York University, Fuerth entered
the Air Force as a second lieutenant. Back at the university, he
began a doctorate in Russian history, but joined the foreign
service when his wife, Lynn, had their first of two sets of twin
girls and he needed a paying job.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, he went to work for the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence. When Gore moved to the Senate, he
took Fuerth with him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore describes Fuerth as a cross between ``a rabbi and a
stand-up comic.'' But many outsiders don't see his lighter side.
His gruffness earned him the nickname Metternich on the Hill years
ago and Darth Vader more recently in the corridors of the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some people insist that too much work and too little staff
account for his irritability; others say it stems from deep
shyness. Said Toby T. Gati, who came to respect Fuerth when she was
the National Security Council's Russia expert: ``He's not a mother
figure. He's not a father figure. He's a patriarch.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Fuerth's image problem is his body language. He has a
habit of casting his glance downward, staring at his tightly folded
hands. The posture is so much a part of his persona that Gore did a
parody of it at a party to celebrate Fuerth's 60th birthday a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   After Fuerth suffered a mild heart attack in March 1999, he
drastically changed his habits, shedding 45 pounds and embracing a
tough exercise regimen. At his 60th birthday party a few weeks
later, Gore had this advice for him: ``We all want to say, `Relax!'
''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he is trying to do that, even reaching out more to a
class of people with whom he never felt comfortable: the Washington
press corps. ``Part of his problem is that he has a linear way of
doing things,'' said Michael McCurry, the former White House press
secretary. ``I once had a conversation with him in which I said,
`You have to learn the language and culture of dealing with the
press.' I might as well have been dealing with a foreign
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Fuerth's colleagues in the administration speculate that
he may be better suited in the job of, say, CIA director or
secretary of defense than of national security adviser, which has
typically required extensive public diplomacy and the ability to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuerth has something that no other national security expert
does: an intimate relationship with Gore. And Gore may just want to
keep the man he calls ``a great friend'' close to his side, doing
what he has always done: keeping him informed, passing him notes,
feeding him ideas, making him laugh and always, always giving him
the credit.

ADMINISTRATION RESPONDS TO GOP ATTACK ON CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration fired back Monday at
critics of the raid to take custody of Elian Gonzalez, blasting
prominent Republicans for making ``wildly inaccurate'' statements
about the operation and blaming the boy's relatives for having
forced the government's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who was described as having cried
after negotiations ended shortly before federal agents seized
Elian, said she had ``bent over backwards'' to achieve a peaceful
resolution to the custody dispute. Asked on NBC's ``Today'' show if
she had any second thoughts about having ordered a military-style
incursion before dawn Saturday, Reno replied: ``I have no regrets
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have been scathing in their criticism of the
administration's decision to forcibly remove Elian from his
great-uncle's home, and Monday they announced the start of an
investigation into the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Henry
Hyde of Illinois, said he was beginning a ``preliminary inquiry''
into the tactics used by armed Immigration and Naturalization
Service agents in Miami. Hyde said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert
of Illinois had requested the probe, which will lead to full
committee hearings if GOP officials decide they're warranted.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Senate majority leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi, Reno is also scheduled to discuss the issue Tuesday
morning with a group of Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In
addition, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator
Orin Hatch of Utah, sent the attorney general a letter asking for
the supporting documents the government used Friday afternoon to
obtain a search warrant for the INS raid.
</P>
<P>
   The boy spent a third day in seclusion Monday with his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his stepmother and 6-month-old step-brother
in guest quarters at Andrews Air Force base in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the activity by Republican leaders, they were
far less vocal in their attacks on the administration Monday,
perhaps because the controversy had entered a new phase, or maybe
because opinion polls showed Americans clearly in favor of the
operation that returned Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the 6-year-old boy's seizure, Lott had issued
a statement saying he thought ``that this could only happen in
Castro's Cuba.'' Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Florida
Republican, said Saturday night that a Band-Aid on Elian's arm in
photos of him with his father indicated the government had begun
``drugging'' him as part of a process of ``brainwashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several high-ranking Republicans followed with their own
assessments Sunday, the sharpest offered by the House majority
whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas. Saying he was ``sickened''
and ``ashamed'' by the INS action, DeLay essentially accused the
Clinton administration of having kidnapped the child by acting
without a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart Monday mentioned DeLay in his
angry response to what he depicted as a partisan effort by the GOP
to use the Elian drama for ``some perceived political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of Republicans who have come out and just
made what I have to view as wild statements, wildly inaccurate,''
Lockhart said. He said DeLay knew it wasn't true when he contended
that the government lacked a search warrant and that Elian's father
had abused his son.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart delivered equally harsh comments about the boy's Miami
relatives, with whom he lived since he was rescued off the Florida
coast five months ago until US agents snatched him Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important piece of information here is all of this
could have been avoided,'' said President Clinton's spokesman.
``This happened because the family did not respect the legal
process here that dictated the father should be reunited with the
young boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lack of respect and the unwillingness to go along with
what the court said and what the INS said led to no other
alternative,'' Lockhart added. Repeating the government's
explanation that authorities had been told there might be guns in
the Miami home or in the crowd outside, he suggested that the
administrationn would have received even more criticism if the INS
agents had gone in unarmed and violence had ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart took particular aim at claims by Elian's cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez that photos of the boy looking happy with his
father had been altered. The spokesman called that notion
``absolutely absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department implied Monday that Marisleysis, who has
lambasted the federal government for its use of force, may have
provided some of the impetus for the decision to use weapons in
raiding her home.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman, Carole Florman, said the 21-year-old woman had
told a department official _ presumably during a phone call, but
Florman did not elaborate _ there were ``more than just guns'' in
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who heard it was very alarmed and took that ... as
a possibility of guns and as a threatening statement,'' said
Florman. ``Her remarks certainly added to the concerns that we were
sending law enforcement personnel into a possibly volatile
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, on Monday's television interview, reiterated her
reluctance to order aggressive action to remove Elian from his home
in Miami, where the attorney general lived most of her life and
made her legal career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to avoid it with all my heart and soul,'' she said.
``But once having determined that we should go forward with it, it
should be done in the best, most professional way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder described Reno as so upset
after ordering Elian's removal at gunpoint that he had to close the
door of the room in which they were negotiating by telephone with
mediators in Miami. Holder said he then ``held the attorney general
in my arms, and she wept.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Podhurst, a Miami lawyer and longtime friend of Reno's who
was acting as an intermediary with the Gonzalez family Saturday
night, gave a similar account during a news conference in Florida
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Podhurst said the attorney general sounded very sad and near
tears during the last moments of negotiations over the telephone.
While he praised his old friend for her strength and courage, he
continued to insist for a third day that the talks had been
extremely close to a breakthrough when Reno broke them off and
ordered the INS assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that it worked out wrong,'' he said. He added that
Reno had shown ``extraordinary courage'' in remaining on the line
rather than just hanging up once she knew what she was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the University of Miami, Edward ``Tad'' Foote,
who also had acted as an intermediary, said he was ``disappointed
and dismayed'' that Reno had cut off the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Reno indicated Monday that she had ended the discussions for
several reasons: The Miami relatives had given their consent to
previous agreements and reneged; they seemed intransigent on the
key point of turning Elian over to his father immediately; and if
she had negotiated later into the morning, the optimum conditions
for a raid would have passed and the law-enforcement personnel
would have called it off.

CLINTON ATTENDS FUND-RAISER FOR CONGRESSMAN WHO VOTED TO IMPEACH
HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton attends at least one fund-raiser a
week. He is used to the hors d'oeuvres, the banter, the elegant
surroundings. But his visit to a swank Fifth Avenue home on Monday,
where spicy lamb turnovers were on the menu and Central Park was
visible outside, represented a new experience even for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first campaign appearance for a congressman who
had voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect, Clinton did not once bring up the fact that
Rep. Michael Forbes of Long Island had less than two years ago
voted in favor of all four articles of impeachment against him.
Forbes, as well, failed to recount that he had once issued a press
release urging Clinton to resign. Their remarks instead ignored
that ugly episode entirely and stuck to typical fund-raising
chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is somebody I've grown to have great affection
for,'' said Forbes, who collected $500,000 in campaign money with
Clinton's aid. ``He loves this country clearly. Every day, he wakes
up to see what he can do as a leader to make this country better.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who switched parties last year, was a Republican back
when he voted to oust Clinton from office. And Clinton's support
for him reinforces a reality of this post-impeachment White House:
the president, despite expectations to the contrary, is not holding
grudges as he rushes in the final months of his presidency to leave
a legacy that has nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has reached out to other impeachment stalwarts. He has
invited Rep. Henry Hyde, who led the impeachment effort as chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, to the Oval Office to discuss gun
control. At a recent East Room gathering on gun control
legislation, packed among a host of Democratic lawmakers, was none
other than Rep. James Rogan, a Republican of California and
outspoken supporter of returning Clinton to private life.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has even reached out, to some degree, to Rep. Tom DeLay,
the tough talking majority whip who helped stir up the impeachment
storm. DeLay is the chief Republican lawmaker charged with rounding
up votes for Clinton's effort to extend permanent normal trade
relations to China.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton considers impeachment not unlike the defeat
of his health care overhaul or the rejection of the comprehensive
test ban treaty. It was a political act, in his view, pushed by his
political opponents that gained so much momentum that others
followed along.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recently said he considers impeachment ``one of the
major chapters in my defeat of the revolution Mr. Gingrich led,
that would have taken this country in a very different direction
than it's going today, and also would have changed the Constitution
forever, in a way that would have been very destructive to the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has decided not to waste any energy on
personal animosity,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never had a problem compartmentalizing his political
life. He delivered a State of the Union address when the Lewinsky
scandal was first breaking and acted as though all was well. A year
later, in the heat of impeachment, he spoke to the assembled
lawmakers without a word about the fact that his job was on the
line. Nowadays, aides to Clinton say impeachment still riles him
but not to the point where it clouds his political judgment.
</P>
<P>
   As the election nears, the Clinton White House has once again
grown accustomed to criticism from Republican congressional
leaders. In recent days, there has been a loud chorus of
condemnation from Republicans over the administration's handling of
the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since the not guilty verdicts rang out in the Senate chamber on
Feb. 12, 1999, Clinton has engaged in a vigorous, coast-to-coast
campaign to help House and Senate Democrats win back the majority.
That includes a one-time Republican such as Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite suggestions from aides in the weeks after
impeachment that Clinton would launch a payback effort for those
who tried to remove him, Clinton's campaign stops have not had the
air of a personal vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get legislative accomplishments, he needs to
cooperate with those who tried to tar and feather him,'' said Norm
J. Ornstein, a congressional analyst with the American Enterprise
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 278 members of the House and Senate attempted to oust
Clinton. The president would accomplish nothing if he shunned them
all. And some of those lawmakers who tried to remove him now find
him an occasional ally.
</P>
<P>
   The very same Forbes who was praising the president over lamb
turnovers once issued an urgent fund-raising appeal that labeled
Clinton a lawbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart, the president committed the crimes of
perjury and obstruction of justice,'' Forbes wrote. ``This was not
about a ``Monica Lewinsky affair,' it was about using the power of
the presidency to obstruct our judicial system and to prevent the
truth from being told in a sexual harassment/civil rights
lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Campaign Committee, still bitter that
Forbes jumped ship, is aggressively backing the candidacy of Felix
Grucci, a businessman. A spokesman for the national Republican
group, Carl Forti, said Forbes divergent impeachment views
represent his ``lack of backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see the divergent views as nothing more than
run-of-the-mill politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, people are less likely to forgive someone
who has attempted to disgrace them, but this is politics and in
politics you sometimes try to secure a job for someone who tried to
remove you from yours,'' said Marshall Wittman, a congressional
analyst with the Heritage Foundation.

COMMENTARY: RENO FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frankly, I liked both pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, I gotta confess, that now-famous picture of a U.S. marshal
in Miami pointing an automatic weapon toward Donato Dalrymple and
ordering him in the name of the U.S. government to turn over Elian
Gonzalez warmed my heart. They should put that picture up in every
visa line in every U.S. consulate around the world, with a caption
that reads: ``America is a country where the rule of law rules.
This picture illustrates what happens to those who defy the rule of
law and how far our government and people will go to preserve it.
Come all ye who understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, I was also warmed by the picture of Elian back
in his father's arms. Some things you can fake _ like a 6-year-old
wagging his finger on a homemade video and telling his father to go
back to Cuba without him _ and some things you can't fake. That
picture of Elian and his father illustrated the very bond that our
law was written to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Hats off to Janet Reno for understanding that the Elian Gonzalez
case was about both of these pictures: the well-being of a child
and the well-being of our Constitution, on which all good things in
our society rest. But hats off twice to Reno for understanding that
these two noble virtues are not equal. The fear of causing some
trauma to Elian by rescuing him could never outweigh the need to
uphold the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   One only hopes that this affair will remind the extremists among
the Miami Cubans that they are not living in their own private
country, that they cannot do whatever they please and that they may
hate Fidel Castro more than the love the U.S. Constitution _ but
that doesn't apply to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   One also hopes that now that Reno has ended the kidnapping of
Elian by the Miami Cubans, the other hard-nosed lady in the
cabinet, Madeleine Albright, will end the Miami Cubans' kidnapping
of U.S. Cuba policy as well. Albright could start by relaxing the
embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   I share the Miami Cubans' visceral hatred of Fidel Castro's
regime. It is a government that has taught its people to write _
and then forced its most educated to become taxi drivers and, in
thousands of cases, prostitutes in order to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
   But the way to hasten the end of this regime is not with
embargoes and kidnappings. We have sanctioned Castro for 40 years,
and so far he has outlived nine U.S. presidencies. Normally, such a
policy would be adjusted. But this policy is not driven by
strategic thinking. It's driven by blind hatred of Castro by the
Miami Cubans, who, because of their perceived voting clout in the
key state of Florida, have been able to impose this policy on the
whole United States _ even though it has had the opposite effect
we, and they, want. It punishes Cuba's people and reinforces
Castro's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   What ails Cuba's economy is Fidel Castro's failed Marxism. But
the U.S. embargo obscures that, giving him a foreign bogeyman to
blame for Cuba's travails and enabling him to argue that Cuba is
under siege from America, therefore Cubans have to remain mobilized
and he, Castro, has to keep a tight rein.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Fidel Castro. He's a spent dictator who peddles Marxism
while keeping his economy afloat with Thomas Cook tours and
prostitution. As Albright knows, a wise U.S. policy today would be
focused on shaping post-Castro Cuba, so that we don't have another
Haiti _ where, after the regime collapses, everyone builds a raft
to get to Miami _ and so the Cuban people don't have another 40
years of repression. Our best tool for shaping post-Castro Cuba is
letting more Cubans study in the United States, training their
technocrats in managing a modern state and, yes, opening the way
for greater U.S. investment in Cuba, and in money flows, trade and
family visits. At best, this will create much greater internal
pressures on Castro to open his regime, and at worst it will help
ensure that whoever succeeds him will have to change. It was
precisely the ease with which the hard-line Cuban-Americans
kidnapped U.S. policy on Cuba for all these years _ with the help
of pandering politicians _ that made them believe they could get
away with kidnapping Elian. America is a lot better off today
because Janet Reno taught them otherwise, and a million Cuban
children would be better off tomorrow if Madeleine Albright could
administer a similar lesson in foreign policy. Go ladies!

METS' BULLPEN PUTS UP ZEROES FROM START TO FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you want to see six hearts leap at the same time,
Turk Wendell said, watch the reaction when the phone rings in a
bullpen where the relief pitchers don't know their roles. Six guys
think it may be their turn. Four or five, inevitably, will be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in relief _ especially for the Mets _ is so physically
demanding that Wendell, who worked in 80 games last year, runs five
to eight miles a day to condition himself. If pitchers don't know
when they'll be used, the mental obstacles can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way to have a good bullpen _ every guy needs to
know their roles,'' said Wendell, who got six crucial outs in the
late innings of the Mets' 1-0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers
on Monday. ``When you don't know your role, you have to deal with
that uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets pitchers were brilliant on Monday, working nine innings
with the score tied. A single by Matt Franco in the bottom of the
ninth brought in the only run and extended the Mets' winning streak
to eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Each pitcher in the Mets' bullpen knows precisely who does what.
Pat Mahomes understands that when a starting pitcher goes down to a
minor injury, he will be the first choice to fill in. The
right-handed Mahomes did it earlier this month, when Al Leiter
missed a turn, and he did it again on Monday, when Rick Reed's
bruised left hand kept him from starting.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes gave a strong effort, allowing only two singles and
lasting until there were two outs in the sixth inning. Then, with a
man on third and the left-handed batter Shawn Green coming up, Mets
Manager Bobby Valentine called for the left-hander Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   That was Cook's situation _ lefty on lefty _ and he got Green to
pop out, ending the threat. When Cook encountered trouble in the
seventh, it was Wendell who worked out of it, using a slider he
didn't think was very sharp to strike out Adrian Beltre and get
Devon White to pop out.
</P>
<P>
   After Wendell shut down the Dodgers in the eighth, the closer
Armando Benitez _ pitching the ninth inning of a tie game at home,
as expected _ fell behind each batter he faced but worked another
scoreless inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone did the exact job we wanted them to do,'' Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes recognized that he was taking the place of a pitcher who
has been very successful so far. Reed _ who now seems likely to
start Wednesday against Cincinnati _ has the second-best earned run
average in baseball, and Mahomes did a fair imitation. ``Not as
many innings,'' he said, ``but I was able to put a zero on the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes worked his slider and cutter off his fastballs, and
whenever he needed to make a pitch, Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley
said, he made it.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes looked best against Green, striking him out on a
fastball in the second and a cutter that fooled Green badly in the
fourth. The cut fastball, Mahomes said, is the biggest reason his
career has blossomed the last two years after seven seasons spent
meandering through the majors, the minors and the Japanese league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left-handers always killed me,'' Mahomes said. ``Now I have
another weapon against left-handers, instead of just a slow
curveball and changeup. The cutter looks like a fastball and gets
them out front a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes has learned the importance of accepting his role. After
Minnesota traded him to Boston in 1996, Mahomes expected to be a
closer. When his role became something different, he sulked and
wound up taking work in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahomes has a sharp focus now, Valentine has noticed, and he
watches the start of games from the dugout, preparing himself for
possibly pitching later. Long relief and spot starting is the least
glamorous job on a staff, but Valentine called Mahomes his ``staff
saver.'' Mahomes won't complain about how he is used.

<P>
   ``If you want to pitch in the major leagues,'' he said, ``you've
got to do whatever they tell you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had 18 hits on Sunday, but Mahomes doubted they would
duplicate the output against the Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort,
who baffled the Mets earlier this year despite performing in a
loss. Mahomes was right: Dreifort allowed five hits and three walks
in six innings, but the Mets could not score.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Dodgers reliever Terry Adams in the ninth, Robin
Ventura led off with a double and Melvin Mora pinch-ran. After a
walk, Jay Payton chopped a ball in the hole between shortstop and
third. Beltre, the third baseman, moved for it, but retreated when
shortstop Kevin Elster gathered the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to turn a double play, Elster tossed awkwardly to Beltre,
as if flipping an option pass, and Beltre's foot came off third
base as Mora slid in. Beltre's tag of Mora's hip was too late,
Umpire Gerry Davis ruled, prompting an argument that got Dodgers
Manager Davey Johnson ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Mora thought Beltre was afraid of being spiked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why he took his foot off the base,'' Mora said of
Beltre. ``Maybe if he did, it would have been a different story,
because he wouldn't have been scared of being cut. He didn't want
to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded, and after Elster threw home on a grounder
by Rey Ordonez for the first out, Franco's bouncer skimmed Adams'
glove, and Jon Nunnally raced home with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give myself an error, because that ball was hit right
at me,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   It went for a hit, one of eight for the Mets in a game in which
their pitching did best. These days, the Mets are making everything
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the fact that we're not wasting our good pitching
and we're not wasting our good hitting,'' Valentine said. ``That's
the sign of a good team.'' &QL;

CLEMENS ADDS ANOTHER PIECE TO HIS PUZZLE OF INCONSISTENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dissection of Roger Clemens continued Monday as
one of the greatest pitchers of this era had another performance
that added more confusion to his perplexing 14 months with the
Yankees. Clemens was inconsistent, then he was dominating and then
he was unreliable at the most inopportune time.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clemens discussed an aggravating 7-3 loss to the Minnesota
Twins as if he were analyzing his golf game. He actually mentioned
that the wind affected his pitches during a dreadful three-run
first inning and he said that he was not too disappointed about two
pitches that produced the tie-breaking run in the seventh because
they were solid pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is a proud pitcher, a five-time Cy Young Award winner
who believes that he should be perfect. Not just in every start,
but for every pitch. Clemens was almost perfect over five powerful
innings, but the first and the last inning he worked doomed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I need better results,'' he said. ``But it's coming
down to one or two pitches to getting things turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissection of Clemens (1-5) will continue because both he
and David Cone need to be consistent for the Yankees to be an
intimidating team. Joe Torre stressed how lucky the Yankees were to
enter the day with the best record in the major leagues because
their starters other than Orlando Hernandez are 2-6 with a 6.17
earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate to be 12-6 because we're not doing it right
yet,'' said Torre. ``I think we're in a very fortunate position to
have won 12 of 18 games and have the manager say that we're going
to play better than we're playing. I think that's a good sign.
Hopefully, it happens quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was bruised for five earned runs in six and two
thirds innings, is the reason the Yankees looked so listless while
losing for the third time in their last four games.
</P>
<P>
   He started the contest with two quick strikes on Todd Walker,
presumably unaffected by the wind at that point. But then he
uncorked seven straight balls and eight in nine pitches to put
Twins on first and second. Matt Lawton singled to load the bases
and Ron Coomers' squibber to first delivered the first run.
</P>
<P>
   After a strikeout, Clemens needed to retire Butch Huskey to
emerge with a 1-0 deficit in the first. Huskey had one hit in nine
at bats off Clemens in his career, but, once again, Clemens fell
behind in the count and threw a 2-1 split-finger fastball that did
not dive and he said acted more like a ``slow fastball.'' Huskey
ripped it between third and shortstop to put the Twins ahead, 3-0.
Some of the 35,693 fans at Yankee Stadium booed, the first of three
different times Clemens received such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt too good to be in that predicament early,'' said
Clemens. ``Like I said, I still had the chance to get out of it
fairly unscathed. But they were able to get that key hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre was mystified. He would never admit it, but Clemens seems
to puzzle him more than other pitchers. Torre praised Clemens'
repertory, which produced nine strikeouts, and said that type of
repertory will be ``fine'' all year. Still, Torre could not explain
how the future Hall of Famer could pump two strikes to open a game
and then walk two batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have an answer,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   From the second through the sixth, Clemens rebounded to retire
14 of 17 batters. Tino Martinez had a run-scoring single in the
first and the Yankees added two more in the sixth after left
fielder Jacque Jones lost a ball in the sun that fueled the rally.
Martinez had a run-scoring single and Shane Spencer had a sacrifice
fly off Eric Milton to even the score, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens should have barreled to the mound a new man. That ugly
first had been erased. But Clemens faltered again, unable to
contain a team he had stifled for five straight innings. Clemens
left his last start with a stiff back, but the back did not bother
him Monday. Inconsistency did.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a second-year player with 109 major league hits, stroked
a double to right center off a 1-1 slider. Matt LeCroy, a rookie
with nine major league hits, slapped a 1-0 fastball down the third
base line to give the Twins a 4-3 lead. So, five pitches after the
Yankees had saved Clemens, he was rattled by Jones and LeCroy, two
players most Yankees fans had never heard of until they purchased
scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made good pitches there,'' insisted Clemens. ``I made the
pitches that I wanted to make. Give them credit. They hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was giving credit to two unknown hitters who probably
collected his baseball cards at some point in their lives. It was a
nice gesture, but it did not sound like something one of the
greatest pitchers of his era should say. Then Clemens pulled on his
jacket and trudged away, the confusion following right behind him.

AIRLINE SUES TO RID AIRPORT OF BAGGAGE SCREENING DEVICE  
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continental Airlines filed a federal antitrust lawsuit Monday
against United Airlines and the committee that oversees operations
at Washington Dulles International Airport, contending that
recently installed baggage-sizing templates inhibit competition.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which was filed against United and the Dulles Airport
Airline Management Council in federal court in Virginia, comes
after the installation on April 15 of the templates at X-ray
security checkpoints at Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   United, which is the largest airline at Dulles, carrying more
than 40 percent of the airport's passengers in the year ended Feb.
29, had proposed installing the templates. The carrier uses the
equipment to screen bags at 24 other U.S. airports.
</P>
<P>
   Continental, which says it has more overhead bin space on its
planes and uses that as a marketing tool to attract customers,
opposed the templates, contending they would prevent its passengers
from carrying their bags onto its aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to carry on _ rather than check _ bags has been
hotly contested in the U.S. airline industry in recent years.
Airlines like United, American and Delta have installed sizing
equipment at airports to prevent travelers from carrying excessive
amounts of baggage into aircraft cabins. Many business travelers,
in addition to Continental, oppose these measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Dulles suit is the third time Continental has fought
installation of baggage-screening devices at airports. In late
1998, the airline, which is the nation's fifth largest, sued Delta,
the No. 3 airline, in California, contending that Delta's templates
at San Diego International Airport interfered with its carry-on
policies. That case was settled out of court. Soon afterward,
Continental also threatened to sue United, the largest U.S.
airline, over United's use of templates at Denver International
Airport. The airlines settled the matter without legal action.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington suit, Continental contends that United
``conspired with other airlines under the auspices of the Airline
Management Council to limit competition by requiring all airlines'
customers to conform to a single, restrictive standard for carry-on
baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental contends that the actions of United and the council
violate antitrust law and interfere with Continental's contractual
relationships with its customers. It also says that United ``led
the conspiracy among airlines who voted in favor of installing
sizers at Dulles, preventing Continental and other carriers from
competing for customers by offering more customer-friendly carry-on
policies.'' Continental and its regional partner, Continental
Express, are seeking removal of the templates and triple damages.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Sheridan, chairman of the Dulles Airport Airline
Management Council and Northwest's general manager at the airport,
said the decision to use the templates, which block large items
from entering X-ray machines at checkpoints, was made only after
installation was approved by the majority of members of the
council, as is required by its bylaws. Six carriers voted against
installation, he said: Continental, Continental Express, Northwest,
US Airways, Midwest Express and Virgin Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said that he had received no complaints about the
templates after some initial flaws were straightened out, and that
he was ``curious about Continental's allegations about back-door
deals being made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To my understanding, Continental was present at all meetings,
and nothing was not discussed in an open forum,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   United declined to comment on Continental's lawsuit. Most of the
other carriers that voted against the templates said they had no
plans to take legal action.
</P>
<P>
   From a legal perspective, some experts said that Continental
might have a valid claim.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Levine, a Harvard Law School professor, former official
of the Civil Aeronautics Board and a former executive at
Continental and Northwest, said that ``in the basic thrust of
Continental's argument, they are right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think overhead bin space is a legitimate service
dimension airlines can offer customers, especially business
customers,'' he said. ``This gives them the opportunity to keep
their bags with them and get out of the airport more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Continental is legitimate in its claim that it is being
interfered with in its ability to compete,'' he continued. However,
he also said it was not clear whether antitrust laws were being
violated.
</P>
<P>
   Levine further suggested that Continental might have
deliberately opted to file a federal antitrust suit to set a
national legal precedent it could use in the future to settle
similar disputes at other airports.

FORD PLANT IN BRITAIN MAY BE CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Adds sentence to end of 8th graf, `Helmut Panke ... $3
million a day.') 
 By ALAN COWELL with KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With Britain's troubled auto industry facing severe
cutbacks and job losses, Prime Minister Tony Blair and other
government officials have held talks with Ford Motor Co. as it
contemplates closing a plant near London.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said Monday that Blair met recently with
Jacques A. Nasser, the Ford chief executive, and that he and other
officials were in contact with Ford over an internal review of its
European operations, expected to be concluded in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   James Vella, a Ford spokesman, said: ``The review is continuing,
and no decision has been made'' about closing entirely the plant at
Dagenham, which employs some 4,500 workers producing the Ford
Fiesta compact. Ford announced in February that one shift would be
discontinued, eliminating 1,500 jobs, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But auto industry executives have been saying for over a month
that Dagenham is likely to be closed when the review is finished.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of another auto industry cutback carries huge
political freight after the government was apparently surprised by
the decision of BMW AG last month to sell its loss-making Rover
Group British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   BMW of Germany agreed to sell Rover's profitable Land Rover
sport utility vehicle division to Ford. It provoked an uproar with
a separate move to sell Rover's sprawling Longbridge car plant near
Birmingham to Alchemy Partners, a British venture-capital firm that
wants to produce only limited numbers of rebranded MG niche models
and cut thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a consortium led by John Towers, a former
Rover chief executive, approached BMW with a $1.3 billion
counterbid intended to maintain mass car production with fewer job
losses among Longbridge's 9,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, which said it had no prior knowledge of
BMW's plans to sell Rover, supported the counterbid. But in a
further setback for the government, executives close to the
negotiations said Monday that the Towers-led consortium was
scrambling to meet a BMW deadline to guarantee financing. Helmut
Panke, BMW's chief financial officer, said in an interview last
week that Rover was losing about $3 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   The government's discomfort over the Rover sale has deepened
with the debate over the possible closing of the Dagenham plant,
one of three major Ford plants in Britain. The opposition
Conservatives have already criticized the government for failing to
secure jobs or keep track of developments in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Blair denied that his meeting with Nasser had
been inspired specifically by the prospect of Dagenham's closing.
But she acknowledged that both the prime minister and the
Department of Trade Industry were ``in dialogue'' with Ford over
its review of European operations.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers reported that Blair had also telephoned Nick
Scheele, the chairman of Ford's European division, who met last
week with labor union officials representing Ford's British work
force.
</P>
<P>
   The labor unions have threatened to call strikes at other Ford
plants in Britain if Dagenham is closed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford has made steady inroads into the British auto industry in
recent years, buying such prestige marques as Jaguar and Aston
Martin before it acquired the Land Rover division from BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ford ranks as the top carmaker in Britain, with 12
percent of the market, but its sales fell 3.7 percent last year to
just under 390,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, moreover, it has been losing market share
steadily. Subcompact rivals like the Volkswagen Polo and Peugeot
206 have outshone the Fiesta, while Ford also failed to anticipate
the shift of the region's market toward more diesel engines and
toward very small minivans like the Renault Scenic.
</P>
<P>
   That has left it with surplus production capacity. A study by
PricewaterhouseCoopers said Ford's European assembly plants run at
72 percent of capacity, compared with 83 percent for General
Motors. In Europe, Ford operates nine major assembly plants
including modernized sites at Cologne, Germany, and at Valencia,
Spain. But the Dagenham plant has had longstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already announced that one of the two shifts at
Dagenham will be eliminated as production of the Ford Focus is
moved to a factory in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has singled out Dagenham for three reasons. The strength of
the pound against the single European currency, the euro, Ford
executives say, has made it much more expensive to produce cars in
Britain for export to the rest of Europe _ a reason also cited by
BMW as a cause of its huge losses at Rover, and by the French
carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen as a threat to its plant in the
British Midlands.
</P>
<P>
   The union at Dagenham, moreover, has resisted labor-saving
production changes that other European unions have been willing to
accept, industry executives say, so the factory has very low
productivity. And the mostly white, unionized workers at Dagenham
have fiercely resisted the hiring of Asian and black workers, in a
dispute that Ford fears could be deeply embarrassing and damaging
to its global reputation.

GOP LEADERS CALL FOR CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF RAID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders announced the start of a
congressional inquiry Monday into the pre-dawn raid that led to
Elian Gonzalez's reunion with his father, as the White House
angrily accused critics of making ``wild'' and inaccurate
statements about the case.
</P>
<P>
   As the rhetoric heated up, the 6-year-old Cuban boy remained in
seclusion with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington. Elian's Miami relatives continued to
seek a meeting with the boy to assure themselves of his well-being.
</P>
<P>
   One of their attorneys said they would seek a court order in
hopes of forcing Gonzalez to allow them to see the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cuban-Americans upset over the handling of the case
called for a general strike that would turn Miami into a ``dead
city'' Tuesday, leading dozens of businesses to announce plans to
close.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said Monday that she had ``no
regrets whatsoever'' about ordering the raid Saturday by federal
agents on the home of the Miami relatives, where Elian has been
staying for nearly five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied with the result,'' she said on NBC's ``Today''
program. She said she ``bent over backward'' trying to accommodate
the demands of the boy's Miami relatives. But in the end, she said,
they would not agree to give up total physical custody of the boy
to his father, despite her offer to place them all in the same
compound together to help ensure a smooth transition for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton felt the raid was ``the right thing to do and
was the only alternative remaining,'' said presidential spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this could have been avoided,'' he said. ``None of this
had to happen. This happened because the family did not respect the
legal process here that dictated the father should be reunited with
the young boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno planned to meet Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., and other lawmakers to hear their complaints about
how the raid was carried out. But aides said Reno would not back
down from her view that the relatives had given her no choice but
to enforce an order issued by the Justice Department nearly two
weeks ago revoking their temporary custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Armed federal agents battered down the door of the relatives'
home early Saturday and snatched the boy in a 3-minute operation
that brought cries of outrage in some circles.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers were eager to speak with Reno face-to-face, it
was unlikely that the meeting would quell the call for a
congressional investigation of the raid from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., announced
that he had ordered his staff to begin a preliminary inquiry into
the tactics used to remove Elian from the home where he had been
staying since he was rescued at sea nearly five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the inquiry would focus on ``whether the use of force
was necessary or appropriate under all of the circumstances.'' Hyde
added that information gathered during the course of the inquiry
would determine whether public hearings should be held.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of investigations brought an angry response from the
White House, where Lockhart accused Republicans of ``playing
politics'' with the plight of a 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the American public should not be surprised that
the first reaction from Capitol Hill is ... personal attacks on the
attorney general, personal attacks on the president, and then an
announcement of extensive investigative hearings,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also took issue specifically with comments made by
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who characterized as
illegal the Saturday raid on the Miami home of the Lazaro Gonzalez
family. DeLay said Sunday that the Justice Department had not
sought a court order beforehand authorizing them to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom DeLay went on television ... and said that there was no
warrant in this case ... It's factually not true and easily
knowable _ if you're not trying to play politics,'' Lockhart said
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spokesman Jonathon Baron dismissed Lockhart's comments as
``political rhetoric'' aimed at taking the focus off ``an
inexcusable action'' against Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no reason to conduct an armed raid on
this family ... To use armed force against this child and his
family to return a child to communist repression is inexcusable,''
Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also characterized as ``absurd'' charges by the boy's
Miami relatives that photographs of him laughing and playing
happily with his father had been ``doctored.'' They have also
asserted that Elian has been ``drugged'' since being taken by
federal authorities in order to prepare him for ``brainwashing'' by
the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Elian ``is living now in a vastly different
environment than he lived in over the last few months. He is with
his father. He is not part of a media circus. He is not being
subjected to the constant attention that must have been so
difficult to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, a group of citizens involved in the last-minute
negotiations, including attorney Aaron Podhurst, a close Reno
friend, criticized the government's gun-wielding seizure of Elian,
saying it believed a negotiated compromise on the transfer of the
boy was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Podhurst told reporters Reno was on the phone negotiating with
him when the raid took place. Although he thought most of the
issues had been resolved, he said Reno saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he refused to join in with others who denounced her
actions, saying that while he disagrees with her decision to send
in armed agents to seize the boy, he still considers her ``a close
friend'' and an ``extraordinarily strong woman'' who believes in
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Deputy Attorney General James Castello said that while
Podhurst and others involved in the 11th-hour negotiations may have
felt that a deal was at hand, ``the fact was that we were not
getting agreement from the family'' on the key demand that physical
custody of the boy would have to be transferred ``immediately ...
and fully'' to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans leaders continued to express outrage at the
use of force to reunite Elian with his father, several public
opinion polls indicated that a majority of Americans support the
government's actions even if they disagree with the tactics used in
carrying it out.

   JANESVILLE, Wis. _ Shooting pool as the jukebox played a Beatles
song in a neighborhood tavern, Karl Sorenson put his stick aside
for a moment and grabbed his beer for a deep swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to drink,'' said Sorenson, a 36-year-old guitar teacher
with the big-shouldered frame of a construction worker. ``This
one's number five, I think, or is it six?''
</P>
<P>
   For Sorenson, the night was still young. For all of the warnings
about the perils of drinking, Wisconsin is still a place where
drinking beer is regarded as an honored pastime. And Milwaukee,
long the beer capital of America, was home of the Miller, Schlitz
and Pabst breweries, among others. Today, Miller is the last large
brewery in Milwaukee.

   In a ranking of states, Wisconsin, where the legal drinking age
is 21, leads the nation in the percentage of adults who drink
alcohol, according to a study at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta. The survey found that Wisconsin led all
states in the percentage of adults who said they have had five or
more drinks in a single sitting in the last month, what the authors
of the study called binge drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Wisconsin, acknowledging that some of its residents
are drinking too much, last month passed provisions that increase
penalties for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the civic leaders who testified in favor of
stiffer penalties was John Bowlin, the president and chief
executive officer of Miller Brewing Co., based in Milwaukee.
Bowlin, who is said to be the first brewery chief executive ever to
deliver antidrinking testimony in the Wisconsin Capitol, said there
were ``those who abuse our product and must be targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the drinking survey came as no surprise to most
Wisconsin residents. The state led the nation in drinking in the
last study, which was conducted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Bawden, a lecturer at the University of Wisconsin who
has written about the history of breweries in the Midwest, said
visitors are often surprised by the number of watering holes here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who drives through Wisconsin for the first time says,
`Man, there's a lot of taverns here,''' Bawden said.
</P>
<P>
   Bawden and other scholars say the beer-drinking tradition traces
largely to the German heritage of Wisconsin, a state that claims a
bigger percentage of German-Americans than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every town with a sizable German population had a brewery
early this century. Among German immigrants, Bawden said, beer was
considered something of a temperance drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans were disgusted by the American taverns, which were
filled with men standing around drinking whiskey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In these German-American communities, he said, beer was
considered a relatively tame refreshment that was available at
virtually every gathering.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, people often drink beer at church-sponsored fish
fries during Lent. And many families in towns leave Mass on Sunday
to sit in a tavern, where neighbors catch up on the week's news and
people play cribbage.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the Rathskeller Bar
in the Memorial Union serves beer to 21-year-old students. Through
the 1970s, even some dormitories had beer bars.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, Massachusetts was the state with the
highest percentage of drinkers after Wisconsin. Utah led among the
teetotalers, with only 28 percent of adults saying they sometimes
drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the study found rates of drinking to be lower in the
South, a region where churches typically inveigh against alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   To Sorenson, there was no deep mystery about why people drink.
``It's fun,'' he said. ``In Wisconsin, it gets boring, especially
when it's cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, he said people in the Upper Midwest tended to be
reserved, even stoic, and a few drinks tend to let down there
guard. ``You have a few drinks, you can get a little crazy, and
it's OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson acknowledged that he often likes to have more than just
a few drinks. He said he can easily handle a 12-pack of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Kunkel, the bartender at Briggs Tavern in this small
Wisconsin city, said there was an explanation for the ability of
Wisconsin residents to drink large amounts of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start young,'' she said. ``You go to a graduation in
Wisconsin, there's beer. You go to a sporting event, there's beer.
You go to just about anything in Wisconsin, there's beer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dawn Johnson, 42, who shared a game of pool with Sorenson,
drinking was a recreation, much like snowmobiling or collecting
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something you do to pass the time,'' said Johnson,
who drank a couple of beers, and then knocked back a shot of
tequila.
</P>
<P>
   But alcohol does not always mean fun and games, as Johnson said
she knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some pretty bad things that had to do with
alcohol,'' said Johnson, as her smile vanished. ``Not nice at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   She was asked if she had ever considered quitting drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she said with a wry smile, ``only about every other
day.''

ARCHIVES SUBPOENAED IN WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel
investigating President Clinton, has issued a grand-jury subpoena
to the National Archives seeking help in determining whether the
White House deliberately withheld thousands of e-mail messages from
law-enforcement authorities and Congress, government officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the archives, which counsel the executive
branch on record-keeping, said that the subpoena arrived last
Tuesday and that officials were in the process of complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received a grand-jury subpoena from the office of the
independent counsel pertaining to the record-keeping practices of
the executive office of the president,'' said the spokeswoman,
Susan Cooper, a senior archives official.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper declined to elaborate, and the independent counsel's
office had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office, as well as the Justice Department, has been
looking into whether the White House deliberately concealed e-mail
messages in response to numerous subpoenas from congressional
committees and the independent counsel. The messages were sought in
connection with several topics, including Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and the White House's response to the
investigation of many of its fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have denied any effort to avoid compliance
with subpoenas. They say the problem was caused by malfunctioning
computer systems that failed to store all electronic messages
written to presidential aides from outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators are also looking into accusations that White
House officials threatened employees of a government contractor if
they disclosed that the messages were missing.

HOUSE PANEL TO BEGIN INQUIRY ON SEIZURE OF CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See alsoCUBAN-BOY, CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI, CUBAN-BOY-FORCE) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee and chief manager of the impeachment trial of President
Clinton, announced on Monday that his staff would begin a
preliminary investigation into the administration's tactics in
seizing Elian Gonzalez by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inquiry will focus on whether the use of such force was
necessary or appropriate under all of the circumstances,'' Hyde
said in a statement released by his office.
</P>
<P>
   While Republican leaders here and around the country continued
on Monday to criticize the raid in Miami on Saturday, most
Democrats rallied around the president, and some were even
relishing the prospect of another congressional investigation. In
the past, every time Republicans have investigated the president,
their popularity has fallen in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That did not seem to daunt the Republicans in Congress. Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, summoned Attorney
General Janet Reno to a meeting in the Capitol on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   And the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, wrote Reno requesting all documents related to the
application for a search warrant allowing federal agents to raid
the house in Miami where Elian was staying with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The boy remained with his father on Monday at Andrews Air Force
Base outside of Washington. There was talk about moving the family
to Wye Plantation, a government conference center on the Eastern
Shore of Maryland, but no decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas went before a television camera and
said he hoped the administration could convince the boy's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to defect and raise his family in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said: ``Certainly the picture that most of America saw _
that I saw _ of the boy being seized by a marshal who had an
automatic weapon is not what America is about. And I would've hoped
that they could have resolved this through mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has said nothing in public about the
matter since he issued a brief statement on Saturday that ``this
issue should have been handled through a family court.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he had ordered the preliminary inquiry at the request
of House Speaker Dennis Hastert. He said a decision on whether to
hold full-scale hearings would depend on the information developed
by his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats seemed delighted by the idea of a Republican
investigation. ``Part of me says, `Please don't throw me in this
briar patch,''' said Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, a former
general chairman of the Democratic Party. ``Letting the Republicans
run with this is the best thing that could happen to Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster and strategist, said:
``This is the Republicans making the same mistake over again.
There's a very strong likelihood that the public will see this as
just another round of partisan investigations that don't amount to
very much and are completely tangential to what the people care
about, to what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll conducted Sunday night found that most Americans
believe federal agents were only doing what was necessary to
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Hyde's inquiry, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., cracked,
``I hope this doesn't preclude Chairman Burton from also doing his
own investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman was referring to Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is chairman
of the Government Reform Committee and who has held a series of
highly partisan hearings involving the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Burton called the raid in Miami reckless and added,
``The American people have a right to feel safe and secure in their
own homes.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats also expressed regret. ``When I heard about it,
I was stunned and upset,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut. ``The most important factor should have been to save
the child from one more trauma in his life and to keep the
negotiations going.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he had not yet heard evidence
that it was necessary to have agents in riot gear with automatic
weapons. But Torricelli, who was himself involved last week in the
negotiations to resolve the situation, said he had concluded and
advised the Justice Department that a peaceful settlement was not
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, interviewed on the ``Today'' show on NBC, said, ``I tried
my level best to make sure we avoided this situation. I'm satisfied
with the result.''
</P>
<P>
   So are most Democratic politicians. ``The fact of the matter is,
they were successful,'' said Waxman. ``No one was hurt, no one was
injured and the boy was united with his father.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL'S RICHEST AND POOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four teams played baseball here yesterday. Three of
the teams have the largest payrolls in Major League Baseball based
on average value of all contracts, and the fourth ranks No. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a blue-collar kind of guy,'' Tom Kelly, manager of the No.
30 Minnesota Twins, said in the visiting clubhouse at Yankee
Stadium before his financially overmatched team played the No. 1
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what the blue-collar Kelly has to deal with:
</P>
<P>
   Double his team's 2000 payroll of $16.5 million, also No. 30,
and it will not reach the combined Yankees salaries of Bernie
Williams, David Cone and Derek Jeter ($34,357,143). The combined
salaries of the Mets' Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura ($20 million)
exceed the Twins' entire payroll. Kevin Brown alone will earn
nearly as much with Los Angeles this season ($15.7 million) as the
entire Minnesota roster.
</P>
<P>
   How do his players deal with games against teams with salaries
like these?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you fear is your team will be intimidated by one of those
teams,'' Kelly said, ``but I don't think that will be the problem.
I don't think this bunch gets intimidated. I hope I don't have to
eat my words.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's dinner Monday night was more savory. No. 30 Twins 7, No.
1 Yankees 3.
</P>
<P>
   At Shea Stadium, the No. 3 Mets played host to the No. 2 Dodgers
in a makeup game that was snowed out a couple of weeks ago. The
Dodgers had to stop here en route from Cincinnati to Atlanta and
play the game because they do not play a second series here this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, but there's nothing you can do about it,''
said Davey Johnson, the Dodgers' manager, who did not see the only
run of the game because he was ejected moments before the Mets
scored it.
</P>
<P>
   This is Johnson's second season with the Dodgers. The first was
a disaster. The team with an $87.8 million payroll, second only to
the Yankees, finished with a losing record. ``Maybe it was a shock
to you, but it wasn't a shock to me,'' Johnson said. ``When I came
in, the team had basically been put together. There were a lot of
things that didn't fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' poor performance, coupled with Bobby Valentine's
uncertain status with the Mets, has prompted speculation, at least
on New York talk shows, that through the influence of his good
friend Tommy Lasorda, the Dodgers' senior vice president, Valentine
could wind up in Los Angeles next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less about that,'' Johnson said when asked if he
had heard that one. ``I'm not even commenting on that. I don't know
anything about that. Nor do I care. I have my job to do. I don't
try to figure out what's going to happen a year from now, six
months from now, six days from now. There's a challenge here that
I'd like to be able to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, he added, this year's team has ``more of the
ingredients for a successful team.'' The Dodgers displayed some of
those ingredients during the weekend in Cincinnati, pummeling the
Reds by a composite three-game score of 36 to 7. But Pat Mahomes,
an emergency starter, and three Mets relief pitchers shut off the
Dodgers' run spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Twins, Mahomes, one of the lowest-paid Mets at
$750,000, was not intimidated by the higher-paid hitters he faced.
Twice he struck out Shawn Green, at $14 million a year the
second-highest paid player in baseball, and three times he retired
Gary Sheffield, a $9 million player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw some balls where I really wanted to throw them,'' said
Mahomes, who explained that he couldn't do that when he pitched for
the Twins in the early years of his career. ``When I was over
there, I was young. I threw the ball 96, 97 miles an hour. I'd just
rear back and throw it. Now I tend to locate the ball a lot better.
I didn't know how to pitch when I was there. Now I know how to
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference between playing for the Twins and playing
for the Mets? ``Obviously, big market, small market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures sent to clubs last week by the labor
relations department in the commissioner's office, the Yankees have
a $98.8 million payroll based on the annual average value of
contracts, the Dodgers $97.7 million and the Mets $92.1 million.
They are the only teams at $90 million or higher. The Twins are
last at $18.1 million.

   ``On paper why even play the game?'' Jacque Jones, one of the
young Twins, said after their conquest of the Yankees. ``But that's
why you play the game. On paper we're supposedly the worst team in

or what anyone else thinks as long as we believe.'' &QL;

 BIOSCOPE: HEARINGS ON STEM CELL RESEARCH THE START OF LONG DEBATE  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Congress will enter one of biotechnology's
ethical minefields this week, when a Senate committee considers
whether the government should fund stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells produce other types of specialized cells. The human
embryo contains the most potent stem cells. They can make every
nerve, bone and fiber in you or me.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have begun trying to control stem
cells to make them grow specific tissue, such as nerve cells to
repair a severed spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of turning human embryos into spare parts
factories touched a nerve in Congress, which several years ago
banned federal funding for such research. That ban did nothing to
stop private firms like Menlo Park's Geron Corp. from paying for
their own stem cell experiments.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter will hold hearings
on a bill to restore federal funding for stem cell research. His
star witness will be actor Christopher Reeve, paralyzed in a riding
accident, and now a candidate for the sort of therapy that might
one day come from stem cell experiments.
</P>
<P>
   So long as stem cells come from embryos it's difficult to
separate that discussion from the abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think you can be consistently pro-choice and still have
a problem with producing human embryos for experimental purposes,''
says Stuart Newman, a cell biologist at New York Medical College in
Valhalla, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Newman is a member of the Council for Responsible Genetics, a
scientific watchdog group that says the debate over federal funding
misses the point: Whether it is public or private dollars that
finance the experiment, the real ethical concern is how embryos are
obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, embryos for stem cell experiments would be leftovers
from in-vitro fertilization, Newman said. He fears that, in the
absence of federal laws, embryos will become items of trade,
produced to order for stem cell experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's bill would prevent federally funded stem cell
researchers from knowingly buying embryos that are sold for
profit-making purposes. Newman said those same sorts of rules
should also be enforced on private labs.
</P>
<P>
   The Biotechnology Industry Organization isn't anxious for
additional regulation of the private firms it represents. It says
the U.S. Food &AMP; Drug Administration supervises privately funded
experiments. BIO doesn't want private firms to be regulated by
other ethical oversight bodies that Congress might set up, so long
as the private firms don't take public bucks.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of this issue are complex enough so that nothing is
likely to happen to change the status quo in an election year. But
the issue of how we control the traffic in human parts is not going
away.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MONEY: This week, several veteran financiers will formally
announce the creation of a $250 million health care fund called
Versant Ventures. Its nine principals include Ross Jaffe, formerly
of Brentwood Capital, and Sam Colella and Beckie Robertson, who
hailed from Institutional Venture Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Colella said when Versant _ the word means experienced,
practiced, conversant _ started raising money last fall, biotech
was a contrarian play. ``It was prior to the big boom,'' he said.
``VCs were leaving health care and life sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks have since soared and retreated, but despite the
short-term fluctuations, the partners think they're in the right
place at the right time. ``There's a dearth of investment funding
in early stage health care,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe said Versant plans to do 10 to 15 deals a year, in four
broad areas: medical devices, biotech, medical services and
e-health.
</P>
<P>
   Their Web site already lists five deals, and when this reporter
joined them for a conference call, he interrupted a discussion of
how to respond to a sixth potential deal.
</P>
<P>
   GENOME ENVY?: My sharp-eyed colleague, science writer David
Perlman, spotted a curious advertisement in the Puritan's Pride
vitamin catalog, for RNA and DNA tablets ``which nutritionists are
excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Larry Sasich, a pharmacist with Ralph Nader's Public
Citizen Health Research Group, whether he was excited about RNA and
DNA pills.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a long-distance call, I could imagine him
shaking his head in disgust. Sasich wasn't aware of any condition
that would require supplemental amounts of RNA or DNA. Every cell
of any food imaginable contains DNA. Every time we take a bite, we
get a mouthful of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just seems to be aimed at the most gullible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the nutritionist at Puritan's Pride went unreturned.

 INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC ALUMS START DIGITAL REVOLUTION  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After years of watching their names roll by in
the credits of films like ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' Scott Stewart, Stuart Maschwitz
and Jonathan Rothbart last year left Industrial Light and Magic,
George Lucas' special-effects powerhouse, to form the Orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not exactly what you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Like the dozens of Lucasfilm spin-offs that dot the Bay Area,
the Orphanage does visual effects work for larger companies. But
this Gen X trio doesn't want to become a de facto contractor for
Hollywood bigwigs. Ultimately, they want to compete with the
bigwigs on both the big and little screens, as more companies like
DreamWorks SKG make forays onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With a business model that relies on special-effects jobs, Web
content and digital video _ an increasingly important facet of the
film industry _ they just might become one of the few
visual-effects firms to successfully move into producing feature
films.
</P>
<P>
   ``That crossover is just starting to happen,'' said Mark
Fishkin, executive director of the Film Institute of Northern
California in Mill Valley. ``When you look at the mingling of
Internet, technology and the people involved in the creative arena,
you're getting people who look at the industry in new ways.''
</P>
<P>
   With more directors shooting films using bits and bytes instead
of staggeringly expensive film stock (``Star Wars: Episode II''
will be shot digitally), people and companies with digital
movie-making expertise are in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Pair that with the vast maw for quality entertainment on the
Internet, and companies like the Orphanage that straddle art and
technology are seeing more venues for their work, Fishkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Take San Francisco's Shockwave.com. The entertainment site
recently signed ``Batman'' director Tim Burton and ``South Park''
creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker to create separate animated
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at these Internet cinema companies, they need good
material; they need a `Sopranos,' '' Stewart said. ``We want to be
the company that creates that.'' That approach to the Web, their
digital filmmaking chops and the fact that they can whip up a
visual-effects shot of a helicopter blowing up an entire floor of a
San Francisco hotel, has already helped the Orphanage land some
relatively high-profile deals in the indie film world _ an arena
better known for filmmakers who max out 14 credit cards in order to
finance their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Orphanage signed a $20 million deal to
co-produce a dozen or so feature-length, low-budget films with New
York's GreeneStreet Films, producer of 1998's ``Illuminata.''
</P>
<P>
   On its own, the Orphanage has produced four shorts _ shot on
digital video rather than traditional film _ and worked on two
films that were shown at this year's Sundance Film Festival. They
provided post-production for ``G,'' a film chronicling a camera's
30,000-foot descent from a plane without a parachute, and produced
their own digital documentary on the making of ``G,'' titled
``Falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Its films may not break the box office tally of ``Titanic,'' but
the Orphanage is one of the companies breaking the mold for the
traditional visual-effects firm. Others include Alameda, Calif.'s
Manex Entertainment, the special-effects house that recently won an
Oscar for ``The Matrix.'' In addition to creating the illusion of a
gravity-defying Keanu Reeves, the company produces its own films
and rents out its soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the profit margins are so minimal and the competition
is so tough in visual-effects work, many companies are taking their
technical expertise and their storytelling ability and looking to
develop their own content,'' said Tom Atkin, executive director of
the Visual Effects Society in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Orphanage principals obviously like to tout their digital
video abilities. But they also have a healthy respect for the
artistic.
</P>
<P>
   One of their favorite topics is ``What We Talk About When We
Talk About Love'' a 10-minute drama based on a Raymond Carver short
story. Produced by the Orphanage and directed by Stewart, it
chronicles a conversation between two couples about the thin line
between love and obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The three don't eschew spacecraft or explosions, but they think
many movies are bloated, special-effects vehicles devoid of strong
plot and characters.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why they left ILM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like being part of a giant machine,'' Maschwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Films like the ones that inspired us as kids didn't seem to be
coming through the door anymore,'' Stewart added.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, and a nod toward the ``Dickensian notion of
self-invention,'' Stewart and Rothbart invested several thousand
dollars of their own money, named their new venture ``The
Orphanage'' (Maschwitz joined later) and set up shop in the
International School in San Francisco, where dance troupes happily
thump around overhead, and an elevator man ferries people from
floor to floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be a place for the disenfranchised, for
artists or filmmakers who want to create but who don't want to work
for the man anymore,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Another founding principal of the company: immersion in all
things technological. And that doesn't mean just crafting digital
space pods, but using computers to do everything film-related.
</P>
<P>
   The computer language of zeros and ones is largely expected to
explode in popularity as a film medium, in part because celluloid
is much more expensive than hard drive space.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite improving technology and cheaper digital
cameras, relatively few mainstream filmmakers have made the leap
because much of the other digital infrastructure isn't in place
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convergence of digital production, distribution and
exhibition isn't really there yet,'' Fishkin said. ``But it is
changing quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Stewart, indie circle heavyweights like Richard
Linklater, the auteur behind ``Slacker'' and ``Dazed and
Confused,'' regularly call them with questions about how to work
with digital video (they're working on a project now with
Linklater).
</P>
<P>
   That kind of buzz garnered the attention of GreeneStreet Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expertise we have in terms of producing low-budget films
complemented the expertise they have in the effects area, and we
liked the fact that they can make their films more exciting with
special effects without dramatic increase in costs,'' said Chris
Uetwiller, head of production at GreeneStreet's digital film
division.
</P>
<P>
   Because independent filmmakers are often working with budgets in
the tens of thousands rather than tens of millions, special-effects
work is frequently out of the question, according to Fishkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Orphanage can create (special effects) for a fraction
of the cost, that's a huge benefit for independent filmmakers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that translates directly into the product itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make a film for less money, you can stay truer to
yourself because the risks aren't so great,'' Fishkin said. ``And
it doesn't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator'' to
recoup its costs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways the Orphanage adds special effects inexpensively
is the fact that they don't invest a ton of money in gear, says
Maschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   While at ILM, Maschwitz and Stewart were members of the Rebel
Mac Unit, a small faction of artists who used off-the-shelf
software and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   They've brought that same sensibility to the Orphanage, where
they made the 20-minute ``Last Birthday Card,'' an action/comedy
about competing hit men in San Francisco (which featured the
helicopter shot) for about $6,000. If made by traditional means,
the film would have cost several hundred thousand dollars, they
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, Maschwitz and Rothbart hope to bring that
cost-consciousness to both GreeneStreet Films and for-hire
special-effects work, which will largely help pay the bills,
including the rent on their new, 1,200-square-foot offices in the
Presidio, which they hope will house 10 staffers by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Orphanage principals wouldn't discuss the company's
finances, they did say they made a slim profit last year and expect
to widen that margin this year.
</P>
<P>
   For companies like the Orphanage, ``there's no hard formula,''
says Atkin. ``Some will sign deals with big companies, just like
the dot-com companies, and there will be others that fall through
the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ILM alums, like Scott Ross, one of the co-founders of
Digital Domain in Southern California, have enjoyed incredible
success. Others, like Richard Edlund, haven't. His Boss Film
Studios went belly up in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Orphanage founders take an optimistic view of their future,
pointing to other Bay Area companies that have managed to combine
technology with an independent streak born of operating outside the
Hollywood system.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar Animation Studios, the Lucasfilm spin-off behind the
successful ``Toy Story'' and ``A Bug's Life'' movies, is one of
their favorite role models.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar once performed visual-effects work for others, then
focused on shorts and has now shifted almost totally to making
their own animated films under an agreement with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pixar, the Orphanage's founders want to make films whose
stunning visuals are second only to clever, smart stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make movies my parents want to see,'' Stewart said,
``instead of, `Well, the dinosaurs looked cool.' ''

 TECH21: JUDGE SHOULD FORCE MICROSOFT TO PUBLISH CODE FOR WINDOWS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Breaking Microsoft or imposing restrictions on
its business practices might be effective ways to prevent Gates &AMP;
Co. from expanding their monopoly into new areas, but they won't do
anything to reduce the overwhelming dominance of Windows in PC
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even splitting the company into multiple ``Baby Bills,'' each
with the right to market all of the current company's products,
won't do that. Competition of that sort might result in lower
prices, but it wouldn't create any new alternatives to Windows or
bolster the chances of existing alternatives such as Linux or BeOS.
On the contrary, lower prices for Windows would actually make it
all the more difficult for challengers to gain any ground.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that this is a lost cause _ that Windows is so
firmly established as the OS standard that nothing the judge could
do would really reopen the desktop market.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but I think it's worth a try. It seems to me that one
relatively simple step would go a long way in this direction: Make
Microsoft publish, or at least license on reasonable terms, the
Windows application programming interfaces (APIs), together with
all the supporting code libraries that are needed to make Windows
applications run, to current or future developers of alternative
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as the good judge argued so convincingly in his
``findings of fact'' last fall, the key to Microsoft's power is
``the applications barrier to entry.'' Few users choose Windows
because it manages hardware so efficiently, and even fewer, I'm
sure, because it's so stable and reliable. People need it because
it's required for most of the applications they want to run.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of IBM's OS/2. Technically, it was far
superior to the Windows versions available at the time, but it
couldn't run Windows 95 applications, and that killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, most people don't pick Windows at all _ they get it
simply because it's what comes with a PC. But any PC-maker
contemplating switching to an alternative would have to face the
fact that such a move would instantly cost it most of its
customers, because its machines would no longer run the programs
they want and need.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose Microsoft had to disclose the code and technical
information Windows applications require, and to keep doing so as
it developed new versions. Linux distributors, Be and anyone else
who wanted to play _ maybe even IBM again _ could incorporate that
code into their systems, making it possible for customers to run
off-the-shelf (and off-the-Web) Windows applications in these
alternative environments, without rebooting, adding emulation
software or any other special burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this wouldn't trigger any large-scale abandonment of
Windows; if nothing else, inertia would prevent that. But other OS
developers would at least have a chance to demonstrate the merits
of their products without asking customers to give up all the
applications they depend on.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, that might lead to some real competition to Windows _
and isn't that what the case was supposed to be about in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   STAYING IN SYNC: If you deal with two PCs _ a desktop and a
notebook, or a work machine and one at home _ you probably know
already that keeping your calendar, contacts and other critical
information in sync is a challenge. It's even tougher if you work
on multiple platforms _ a PC at work, say, and an iMac at home. And
with the proliferation of ``post-PC'' digital devices _ cell
phones, PDAs, information appliances and what have you _ the
problem is only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I was delighted to come across the Web site of a San
Jose, Calif., startup called FusionOne. Its whole business plan is
based on solving the synchronization problem, and it has attracted
some impressive partners. Early financing came from 3Com and Nokia,
among others. Hewlett-Packard, EMC and a long list of well-known
venture-capital groups recently joined them in a third round of
funding worth $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The free service is in beta testing, but it's open to anyone and
it seems to work fine, though slowly at times. When you first sign
up, you specify what kinds of information you want it to sync _ it
can handle files and folders as well as calendar and contact
information. The data is then copied to FusionOne's servers (run by
Sun Microsystems) in 128-bit encrypted form, which the company says
it couldn't read even if it wanted to. As you enter new data,
within the categories you've set, the changes are automatically
sent to the server whenever you're online.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the only desktop operating system FusionOne's
synchronization software runs on is Windows (95, 98 and NT), but
Mac and Linux versions are in the works. But your data is available
on the Web from any browser on any platform.
</P>
<P>
   The system also works with Palm devices and, via Outlook for
Windows, Windows CE. As for phones, the only formats that currently
support wireless synching are WAP and GSM, which aren't yet widely
used in this country. But with a cable and software developed by an
Estonian company FusionOne recently acquired, it'll be able to
transfer data to and from 150 types of phones, including analog as
well as digital models.
</P>
<P>
   FusionOne doesn't have this market to itself. Puma Technology, a
longtime leader in desktop synchronization, has announced, but not
yet launched, a Web site called Intellisync.com. Motorola's
StarFish subsidiary and others are also contenders. ``Internet
desktop'' sites like Visto.com and Desktop.com offer some of the
same capabilities. And an industry consortium, which includes
FusionOne, is developing a new standard, called SyncML, that may
someday make it easier for others to get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But FusionOne is up and running already, and it's filling a real
need. Check it out _  &LR; www.fusionone.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   LOCKDOWN FOLLOW-UP: Like most 1.0 releases, last week's first
run of this column didn't go exactly as planned. The main problem:
I wrote too much for the space available, and some useful
information ended up on the newsroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, I want to go back to the subject of software
firewalls, programs that can protect your computer from hackers and
other uninvited guests. First, a bit more about the ShieldsUp Web
site ( &LR; grc.com/x/ &LR;   &LR; ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 &LR; ), cited last week as an
excellent resource. Run by Steve Gibson, a well-known PC
programming wiz, it offers lots of clearly presented information on
security problems and solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But what really makes it special is software built right into
the page that quickly tests your PC for security vulnerabilities.
Just click on the Test My Shields! and Probe My Ports! buttons, and
in a minute or two you'll see the results.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson also offers detailed assessments of a number of software
firewalls ( &LR; grc.com/su-firewalls.htm &LR; ).) Although he used to be
partial to BlackICE, the program I wrote about last week, he and
other users who've posted reports at his site have found some flaws
in it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he now recommends another program, ZoneAlarm 2.1 from
San Francisco's Zone Labs. Among other merits, it comes at a great
price: It's free for personal and nonprofit use and just $19.95 for
business use. You can download a copy at  &LR; www.zonelabs.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   None of these programs runs on the Mac, but I know of two others
that do: OpenDoor Networks' DoorStop
( &LR; www2.opendoor.com/doorstop/ &LR; ) and Intego's NetBarrier. DoorStop
is available in several versions, but the ``Personal Edition'' is
$59; NetBarrier is $74.95. OpenDoor, which is headed by a former
Apple networking guru, also provides a useful white paper about Mac
Internet security issues at  &LR; www2.opendoor.com/doorstop &LR; 
 &LR; /macOSsecurity.html &LR; . And you can find out still more about the
problem at a site called SecureMac ( &LR; www.securemac.com &LR; ).

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In theory I can drive, and I have a license to prove it; in real
life my motor skills are pretty much limited to walking. By nature
I am a vampire, not crazy about daylight, much less direct rays of
the sun. These are just two of the reasons I had never warmed up to
Los Angeles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was wrong, of course, as I learned in January when a business
trip took me to California. On a day when the wind chill in New
York was 17 degrees below zero, I was having lunch by the pool at
the elegant Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pasadena, surrounded by palm
trees and calm. Another afternoon I sneaked away to the nearby
Norton Simon Museum, filled with van Goghs and Cezannes. I returned
to New York thinking of all the art I had never seen on the other
coast. And so I went back to Los Angeles this month for a long
weekend of art gazing. The trip would not be a hunt for history's
greatest paintings but an immersion in a different cultural
experience.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could I get around by taxi? (Yes, easily though not cheaply.)
Would I find works that I loved? (Yes, especially when I wasn't
looking for them.) Most pressing, in the land of cars and sun,
could I banish a devilish voice that kept whispering in my ear,
like some reject from an old Woody Allen movie, ``Why did you leave
New York?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In three crammed days I discovered that art viewing around Los
Angeles has its own relaxed indoor-outdoor atmosphere. At the
extravagant Huntington Library, Museum and Botanical Gardens,
visitors wander through acres of gardens, stopping in when they
choose at the four exhibition buildings. Meandering in and out also
describes a visit to the Getty Center, with its multilevel complex
of Richard Meier buildings, Robert Irwin-designed garden and
spectacular hilltop views. That indoor-outdoor pattern was one of
the trip's revelations and delights.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rocky start proved that serendipity shapes any quick
trip. I headed to downtown Los Angeles and the Geffen Contemporary,
the larger of the Museum of Contemporary Art's two locations. Signs
in the window said ``Closed for Installation.'' Closed for two
weeks. The online listings I had consulted, most usefully, hadn't
mentioned this; the efficient concierge at my hotel, the Peninsula
Beverly Hills, hadn't been aware of it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My luck changed when the taxi drove on to MOCA's main building,
many blocks away. There I found a show by one of my favorite video
artists, Tony Oursler, known for haunting installations that
question the way television and video rule our lives. Ragdoll-like
figures have faces and ranting voices projected by video onto their
cloth heads; one lies under a flowered sofa that looks as if it was
salvaged from the set of Roseanne's old sitcom. Seen so near
Hollywood, these mischievous installations seemed like subversive
agents in the land of show biz. (Still, the New Yorker's voice in
my ear pointed out how many labels acknowledged Metro Pictures, a
Chelsea gallery I can walk to.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A smaller selection of works from the permanent collection
included a room of Mark Rothkos, a room of Franz Klines, and
several Robert Rauschenberg combines worth lingering over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After lunch in MOCA's pleasant courtyard restaurant, Patinette
(with fresh salads and sandwiches), I headed for Santa Monica and
Bergamot Station, a trendy complex of galleries lined up in two
long, low industrial buildings that used to be storage sheds. There
were some standouts among the two dozen galleries, including
Patricia Faure and Patricia Correia. But galleries are always hit
or miss. Especially for a weekend tourist, Bergamot is primarily
about its mall-like, something-for-everyone experience, with
corrugated metal buildings, asphalt parking lot, and works that run
from mediocre to cutting-edge lined up side by side.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That night I met an old friend for dinner at Mimosa, a French
bistro in West Hollywood with photographs and mirrors lining the
walls, and comfy banquettes. Its version of country cooking is
refreshingly light (a delicious tomato tart). When I mentioned that
on my January trip I had liked Los Angeles for the first time, my
friend said, ``That's because you were in Pasadena.'' Oh. One
reason I'm a bad driver is that I'm really bad at geography.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday I saw the difference. The landscape on the way to
San Marino and the Huntington changed as the city limits and its
high-rise bank buildings were left behind, and a greener view of
hills appeared. (The $60 cab fare was the steepest of the weekend;
most fares around town were in the $15 to $20 range.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I spent the better part of the day at the Huntington, the
highlight of the trip. Formerly the home of the 19th-century
railroad mogul Henry Huntington, the estate represents the upside
of robber baron wealth. In glorious 80-degree weather, I wandered
on a path that led to the Camellia Garden, which looked like a
scene from ``Alice in Wonderland,'' with pink, white and red
camellias. The red Captain Rawes, a placard said, was named for the
English sea captain who carried it to England from China in 1820.
</P>
<P>
   The most elaborate of the 15 gardens may be the Japanese, with
its fish pond, bonsai, bamboo trees and model teahouse. The
Shakespeare garden includes plants and flowers named in the works.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I strolled aimlessly along these elegant paths, one led to
``The Art of Bloomsbury'' in the newly opened Boone gallery, once
Henry Huntington's garage. It is a jewel of an exhibition, brought
over from the Tate in London. Though the Bloomsbury group was
instrumental in introducing Post-Impressionism to England, its
mystique owes more to its Bohemian love affairs and literary
biography. The exhibition's surprises include the lucid greens in
Duncan Grant's ``Self-Portrait in a Turban'' from 1910 (according
to Virginia Woolf, the year ``human nature changed''). There is
Vanessa Bell's mordant, brightly colored portrait of Lytton
Strachey, and Grant's pensive view of the pregnant Bell. She was
carrying his child; he was gay; no wonder she looks sad. I found
Bell's ``Studland Beach'' to be an exhilarating discovery, a
mysterious, evocative painting with wide swaths of midnight blue
and sand colors, and figures with their backs to the viewer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main building, the neo-Classical Huntington Gallery (once
the mansion where Henry lived with his wife, Arabella), holds a
feast of tapestries, decorative arts and portraits by Gainsborough,
Reynolds and Romney. The central gallery is a long, dramatic room
under a skylight, with 20 full-length 18th-century portraits. The
most famous, Gainsborough's ``Blue Boy'' and Sir Thomas Lawrence's
``Pinkie,'' stare at each other from opposite walls. But the others
are just as resonant, including Reynolds' `` Siddons as the Tragic
Muse.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The smaller, Scott Gallery holds American decorative arts,
paintings and sculpture from the 18th through the 20th century, and
the library's rare books include a Gutenberg Bible and a 1410
illuminated manuscript of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After such an immersion in history, it made sense to repair,
like a proper gentlewoman, to the Rose Garden Tearoom, a small
building with a view of the rose arbor, serving a full English tea.
(Don't try this without a reservation.) (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the afternoon, there would be time to dash to
the Norton Simon, not far away, and sprint through. But because I
had been there so recently I headed back to Beverly Hills and the
galleries near my hotel. The Peninsula has a traditional, country
club atmosphere, with furniture of dark, polished wood. But the
armoire in the good-sized room hid a VCR and television, and the
hotel's service and location were ideal. A vase of roses appeared
shortly after I arrived. Housekeepers seemed to come every five
minutes (actually three times a day). And I soon found a favorite
spot, sitting under an umbrella in the Roof Garden, the peaceful
rooftop restaurant by the pool and spa.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had been greeted with the information that the hotel offers
free limousine service within Beverly Hills and the adjacent
Century City, but I never needed it. The Peninsula is just a few
blocks from Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard's shopping district,
and I played the New Yorker by walking. Turning onto Rodeo, I was
instantly drawn into the Martin Lawrence gallery, displaying
Picasso's Vollard Suite, with its whimsical etchings of artists'
studios and mythological creatures. There was little time left to
visit the other galleries that dot the neighborhood.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At dinner that night in the hotel restaurant, the Belvedere
(very Peninsula, staid but good), I read a small book I had picked
up at the Huntington: ``A Lady's Guide to Perfect Gentility,''
published in 1856. ``Be careful,'' the guide warned, ``how you
indulge in sarcasm. If you are constitutionally inclined to this,
you will find that there is no point in your character which needs
to be more faithfully guarded.'' Why did this passage make me
pause? Could it be I was easing into California? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While I was preparing for the trip, nothing had elicited such
violently different responses as the question, ``Should I go to the
Getty?'' I'd heard that it was too crowded and no longer crowded,
that the architecture had to be seen and could be skipped. Ruth
Bachofner, owner of one of the most inviting Bergamot galleries,
had decided things when she said, ``You have to go; it's the
contemporary Acropolis.'' It is; it is also slightly Disney.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The experience begins with a ride on the tram, as they call it,
a train that carries all visitors from the entry level up a hill to
the main buildings. There, smiling employees in blue vests point
you in the right direction. They didn't sing ``It's a Small
World,'' but I was ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I entered the courtyard surrounded by gleaming Meier
buildings, this became an experience I wouldn't have missed. I
looked down on the city from several angles, and at the garden with
its huge spiral of flowers. Descending, I walked among its stones
and across bridges, over water running downhill over rocks. It was
surprisingly soothing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there was a charming exhibition of a new acquisition,
``Carmontelle's Transparency: An 18th-Century Motion Picture.''
Carmontelle, who designed the Parc Monceau in Paris, was also
commissioned by the Duc d'Orleans to produce portraits and
theatrical performances. His ``transparency'' is a delicate
watercolor and gouache on a scroll of translucent paper about 12
feet long. Called ``Figures Walking in a Parkland,'' it includes
scenes of boats, figures on horseback, men and women gathered under
trees. Walking by the scroll from left to right, you can imagine a
boat passing behind a hill as the river bends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how it was meant to be viewed. The scroll was
placed in an illuminated box with handles, then rolled from one
side to the other; each backlighted scene passed through the frame
like a graceful comic strip set in motion. A reproduction in an
illuminated box lets you scroll through as Carmontelle did.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I found one work to adore in the collection (more than I hope
for in most museums). Munch's ``Starry Night'' (1893) is a
near-abstract, deep-blue painting of a coastline. The day before, I
had noticed that the wall label for Bell's ``Studland Beach''
mentioned Munch's influence on that work; here, with good fortune I
could never have planned, was the breathtaking evidence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Getty had not been crowded when I arrived at 11 on Sunday
morning, after an easy 15-minute ride from the hotel. And though it
was filling up when I left at 1, it was not uncomfortably jammed.
Too bad my next stop was.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ''Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen'' at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, downtown, is the kind of
blockbuster show that calls for a ticket with an entry time. The
galleries were so packed (a weekend liability) it was nearly
impossible to see. And this exhibition demands more than cursory
attention. It is quite historical for a blockbuster, short on gold
and long on elegant funerary statues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed, I fled the crowds and walked through Lacma's
permanent galleries. It was late Sunday afternoon and even on a
crammed weekend you have to know when you're just walking, not
seeing. When I arrived at a gallery filled with teacups and saucers
called ``Art of the Cup,'' I knew I had reached my saturation
point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I may have been through with art, but I wasn't through with L.A.
In a perfect Hollywood ending, I had dinner with friends in the
enclosed courtyard at Spago Beverly Hills. Some showbiz cliches are
true; Wolfgang Puck's food lived up to its hype. I bypassed
``Wolfgang's Childhood Favorites'' (Wiener schnitzel in Beverly
Hills?), and chose an incredibly light risotto with sweet peas,
shrimp and morels. For the moment, under the stars at Spago, that
devilish New Yorker's voice was nowhere to be heard.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ending a three-week strike, janitors here voted
overwhelmingly on Monday to accept a new contract that will raise
their wages above the federal poverty level by the time it expires
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Service Employees International Union Local
1877 said members approved the contract by a vote of 1,747-91.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year deal provides raises of 60 cents an hour in the
second and third years of the contract. Workers in the major office
areas of downtown Los Angeles and Century City will receive raises
of 70 cents an hour in the first year; workers in suburban areas,
who recently received health benefits worth $2 an hour, will
receive 30-cent raises in the first year. The contract also
provides for a $500 bonus for each janitor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the contract expires, the janitors' wages will be
above the federal poverty level of $16,700 a year for a family of
four.

ALBRIGHT DEFENDS U.S. INTENTIONS ON ARMS CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-U.S.-ARMS) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to
convince the world Monday that the United States was not
threatening to undercut a quarter century of progress on
international arms control by developing a new anti-missile defense
system that had drawn criticism from Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration were bent on sabotaging the ABM
treaty and strategic arms control,'' she told an international arms
control conference, ``we have surely gone about it in a strange way
_ in the open, with care and in consultation not only with
Congress, but after extensive discussions with our allies and other
countries, Russia and China emphatically included.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the opening of an international conference called
to review a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, Albright
also argued that the United States had reduced its nuclear arsenal
by 60 percent since the end of the Cold War, and had joined in
cutting NATO's nuclear stockpile by 85 percent. She spurned calls
for the quicker elimination of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, none of us has it within our power to create
overnight the conditions in which complete nuclear disarmament is
possible,'' she said. The speech offered no new initiatives but was
more of an accounting of how the administration wanted to define
its record.
</P>
<P>
   Albright walked into an almost solid wall of criticism of the
United States inside and outside the General Assembly hall because
of what was widely perceived as the slow pace of nuclear
disarmament more than a decade after the end of the Cold War and
because of the fears that the proposed American anti-missile
defense system would start a new international arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the United States _ which last fall saw the Senate
reject another crucial accord, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty _
is seen as setting a bad example for other countries that can now
cite political pressures for refusing to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration's legacy is the re-legitimating of
nuclear weapons after the end of the Cold War,'' said Daniel
Plesch, director of the British American Security Information
Council, an independent research group in Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan, which tested nuclear weapons in 1998, and
Israel, which is assumed to have nuclear arms, were also criticized
Monday as some conference delegates demanded they adhere to the
nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the focus of the conference. The
treaty, which came into effect in 1970, has been ratified by 187
countries. Only four _ India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba _ have
refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear testing has no place on our planet,'' said Brian
Cowen, Ireland's foreign minister. ``The time to rid the world of
these weapons is now.'' Nuclear arms are the only weapons of mass
destruction not banned by international treaties. The United States
and Russia have the majority of the world's nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen's speech was one of the day's toughest, but his sentiments
were echoed by other governments, independent arms control groups
and former American arms control officials. Republicans in
Congress, including Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have been especially harsh
in attacking international arms control agreements, and independent
experts say they are puzzled by this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What appears anomalous to me is that historically, the
Republican Party has led in the area of arms control
strengthening,'' said Jonathan Granoff, co-chairman of the American
Bar Association's committee on arms control and disarmament, said
in an interview Monday. ``The scuttling of arms control through
ballistic missile defense or through the undermining of the
commitment to nuclear disarmament contained in the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty is against the heritage of the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Graham Jr., who was the Clinton administration's special
representative for arms control from 1994 to 1997 and is president
of the independent Lawyers' Alliance for World Security, says that
much of the annoyance with the United States stems from commitments
all nuclear powers made five years ago to work harder on
eliminating nuclear weapons in return for international agreement
to make the nuclear nonproliferation treaty permanent.

AOL MOVIEFONE TO INTRODUCE VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking its cue from an incident in a ``Seinfeld''
episode, AOL Moviefone will announce Tuesday that it is introducing
voice-recognition capabilities to its telephone service in New York
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The move will allow callers to buy movie tickets and get
information on show times and theater locations by simply speaking
into the phone rather than wending their way through a labyrinth of
touch-tone menus.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Moviefone and Lucent Technologies, which
developed the speech recognition technology that will be used, said
the germ of the idea came from a ``Seinfeld'' episode in which
Kramer receives a new phone number that is very similar to the
Moviefone number _ 777-FILM _ and begins to imitate the phone
service when people mistakenly call him. At one point, exasperated
with the touch tones, he tells a caller, ``Why don't you just tell
me the name of the movie you'd like to see?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jarecki, Moviefone's chief executive, said that the
service will be available beginning Tuesday in New York and New
Jersey, but will eventually expand to more than 35 markets around
the country. The technology will be able to understand the names of
movies, when spoken by callers, as well as zip codes, credit card
numbers and other information needed to make the service work,
Jarecki said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, from Lucent's Bell Labs Speech Solutions
division, is able to understand a wide range of voice pitches and
accents, as well as filtering out background noise.
</P>
<P>
   Moviefone, which began offering a telephone movie-ticket service
in 1989, was acquired last May by American Online and is now part
of AOL's Interactive Properties Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the phenomenal growth of our moviefone.com service on
the Web, our phone service still serves the majority of our
audience each week,'' Jarecki said. ``This will save people time
and ultimately drive more traffic to the service.''

APRIL IN OJAI MEANS TENNIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ Dick Gould has played or coached at the Ojai
Tennis Tournament for more then 50 years, the last 38 as the men's
coach at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal has won 11 Pac-10 titles under Gould at the
century-old tournament, and Ojai (pronounced O-high) has provided
more memories then Gould can count. But it's not the wins Gould
remembers most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you always remember the losses more then the wins,''
Gould says, with a hearty laugh. ``Those tend to stay with you
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould has suffered both losses as a player for Stanford, where
he was as gutty and hard-nosed as they come, but rarely as
talented. Which is why the two wins he let slip away gnaw at him
after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time he led USC All-American Ed Atkinson 5-3, 40-love
in the third and deciding set, only to crumble in a bitter fall. A
year later Gould was a service point away from victory against UCLA
No. 1 Norman Perry, leading 5-2, 40-15 in the third. But once
again, Gould didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I choked them both away,'' Gould said. ``Those are the two
things I remember most, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those painful memories, the Ojai has been blissful
for Gould, who's been a participant in one form or another since he
was a seventh-grader in Ventura. Like so many others, he is a
fixture at this tradition-filled event, which turns 100 this year
and maintains its popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring tournament has become part of the Ojai landscape,
made special by subtle touches like the freshly squeezed orange
juice and the tea and cookies served at Libbey Park. Or the
wonderful weather and outpouring of hospitality from local
residents, many of whom open their home and tennis courts to the
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Ojai is host to the Pac-10 and Big West championships and
the Division III West Invitational. In addition, more then 1,600
entrants compete on more than 150 courts in 38 youth,
interscholastic and open events.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in Ojai this weekend, you don't have to walk far to
see a tennis match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of its appeal is that you can see any kind of tennis,
from 12-and 13-year-olds to the Pac-10 championships,'' Gould said.
``And unlike some tournaments, where there's only men or only
women, you have both at the Ojai, and that also sets it apart.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the top amateur tennis tournament in the country. Over
the years, more than 80 former Ojai players went on to win at least
one Grad Slam title, including Bill Tilden, Pancho Gonzalez, Tony
Trabert, Billy Jean King, Arthur Ashe, Jimmy Connors, Michael
Chang, Tracy Austin and Stan Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Ojai was founded in 1896 by William L. Thacher, who played
tennis at Yale before moving to Ojai to assist his brother Sherman
at the Thacher School. An elimination tournament was formed in
1899, laying the foundation for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine this small, quaint little town out in the
middle of nowhere starting something like this, then having it grow
into the even that it has?'' Gould said. ``It's so tucked away,
almost off the beaten path, even difficult to get to. Just think
what it was like years ago, when people had to get there by horse
and buggy.''
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding tennis drives the Ojai, but it's the people
involved who make it a must-see experience, even for non-tennis
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see so many of the same faces from year to year, and for
me it's even more special because I grew up in the area, so I get
to see all my old buddies, guys I've played with or against or
coached against,'' Gould said. ``It's just a great atmosphere and a
wonderful event.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tournament's volunteers and organizers have been
involved throughout the years. Ruby and Jack Morris, former
presidents of the Ojai Tennis Club, have been associated a combined
90 years. Ironically, neither were tennis fans when they first got
involved in the early 1950s. It didn't take long to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you do in April,'' Ruby Morrison said. ``It's
something we look forward to every year, the whole town does. It's
so unique, when you come downtown to Libbey Park, there's oak trees
and lots of grass and hospitality. It's such a personal thing and
people around here take great pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the fans keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever heard anyone tell me they won't be
back,'' Morrison said.

CLINTON ATTENDS FUND-RAISER FOR CONGRESSMAN WHO VOTED TO IMPEACH
HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to correct 8th graf to begin `Today' sted `Monday.')  
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton attends at least one fund-raiser a
week. He is used to the hors d'oeuvres, the banter, the elegant
surroundings. But his visit to a swank Fifth Avenue home on Monday,
where spicy lamb turnovers were on the menu and Central Park was
visible outside, represented a new experience even for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first campaign appearance for a congressman who
had voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect, Clinton did not once bring up the fact that
Rep. Michael Forbes of Long Island had less than two years ago
voted in favor of all four articles of impeachment against him.
Forbes, as well, failed to recount that he had once issued a press
release urging Clinton to resign. Their remarks instead ignored
that ugly episode entirely and stuck to typical fund-raising
chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is somebody I've grown to have great affection
for,'' said Forbes, who collected $500,000 in campaign money with
Clinton's aid. ``He loves this country clearly. Every day, he wakes
up to see what he can do as a leader to make this country better.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who switched parties last year, was a Republican back
when he voted to oust Clinton from office. And Clinton's support
for him reinforces a reality of this post-impeachment White House:
the president, despite expectations to the contrary, is not holding
grudges as he rushes in the final months of his presidency to leave
a legacy that has nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has reached out to other impeachment stalwarts. He has
invited Rep. Henry Hyde, who led the impeachment effort as chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, to the Oval Office to discuss gun
control. At a recent East Room gathering on gun control
legislation, packed among a host of Democratic lawmakers, was none
other than Rep. James Rogan, a Republican of California and
outspoken supporter of returning Clinton to private life.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has even reached out, to some degree, to Rep. Tom DeLay,
the tough talking majority whip who helped stir up the impeachment
storm. DeLay is the chief Republican lawmaker charged with rounding
up votes for Clinton's effort to extend permanent normal trade
relations to China.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Clinton considers impeachment not unlike the defeat of
his health care overhaul or the rejection of the comprehensive test
ban treaty. It was a political act, in his view, pushed by his
political opponents that gained so much momentum that others
followed along.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recently said he considers impeachment ``one of the
major chapters in my defeat of the revolution Mr. Gingrich led,
that would have taken this country in a very different direction
than it's going today, and also would have changed the Constitution
forever, in a way that would have been very destructive to the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has decided not to waste any energy on
personal animosity,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never had a problem compartmentalizing his political
life. He delivered a State of the Union address when the Lewinsky
scandal was first breaking and acted as though all was well. A year
later, in the heat of impeachment, he spoke to the assembled
lawmakers without a word about the fact that his job was on the
line. Nowadays, aides to Clinton say impeachment still riles him
but not to the point where it clouds his political judgment.
</P>
<P>
   As the election nears, the Clinton White House has once again
grown accustomed to criticism from Republican congressional
leaders. In recent days, there has been a loud chorus of
condemnation from Republicans over the administration's handling of
the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since the not guilty verdicts rang out in the Senate chamber on
Feb. 12, 1999, Clinton has engaged in a vigorous, coast-to-coast
campaign to help House and Senate Democrats win back the majority.
That includes a one-time Republican such as Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite suggestions from aides in the weeks after
impeachment that Clinton would launch a payback effort for those
who tried to remove him, Clinton's campaign stops have not had the
air of a personal vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get legislative accomplishments, he needs to
cooperate with those who tried to tar and feather him,'' said Norm
J. Ornstein, a congressional analyst with the American Enterprise
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 278 members of the House and Senate attempted to oust
Clinton. The president would accomplish nothing if he shunned them
all. And some of those lawmakers who tried to remove him now find
him an occasional ally.
</P>
<P>
   The very same Forbes who was praising the president over lamb
turnovers once issued an urgent fund-raising appeal that labeled
Clinton a lawbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart, the president committed the crimes of
perjury and obstruction of justice,'' Forbes wrote. ``This was not
about a ``Monica Lewinsky affair,' it was about using the power of
the presidency to obstruct our judicial system and to prevent the
truth from being told in a sexual harassment/civil rights
lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Campaign Committee, still bitter that
Forbes jumped ship, is aggressively backing the candidacy of Felix
Grucci, a businessman. A spokesman for the national Republican
group, Carl Forti, said Forbes divergent impeachment views
represent his ``lack of backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see the divergent views as nothing more than
run-of-the-mill politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, people are less likely to forgive someone
who has attempted to disgrace them, but this is politics and in
politics you sometimes try to secure a job for someone who tried to
remove you from yours,'' said Marshall Wittman, a congressional
analyst with the Heritage Foundation.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a storm that brought abundant clouds and rain to the
Northeast last week moves into eastern Canada, yet another storm
will approach the Middle Atlantic States from the south. Onshore
flow will resume over much of the Eastern Seaboard, promoting cool
readings and rain in some sections. In the mountains of West
Virginia and western Virginia, there may even be some periods of
steady snow.
</P>
<P>
   A strong area of high pressure will remain over the Rocky
Mountains, bringing unseasonable warmth to the region. In the
central Plains, there will be some showers as a weak disturbance
drifts to the east. Meanwhile, the deserts of the Southwest will
turn hot.
</P>
<P>
   A low pressure system will swirl into the Northwest, bringing
valley showers along with mountain snow. Meanwhile, the coast of
southern California will turn a bit milder. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: VERIFYING TORNADOES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late last week a damage survey confirmed that several tornadoes
had occurred near Louisville, Ky., during Thursday's severe
thunderstorm outbreak. When twisters are large and seen by many
people, the job is easy. In other cases, people sometimes confuse
benign, pendulous clouds with tornadoes. Damage thought to be
caused by a tornado is often a result of straight-line winds
generated when downdrafts of thunderstorms spread rapidly after
hitting the ground. Experts look for spiral patterns in damaged
trees and buildings as evidence of the swirling winds of a
twister. &QL;

 &HT;    Former Texas star Brown's a target, on court and on WNBA's draft
list
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now that Edwina Brown has become an ultra-hot
commodity in WNBA circles, possibly even the top pick in today's
draft, she has discovered that there is no such thing anymore as an
innocent little pickup game at Gregory Gym.
</P>
<P>
   On a Monday evening in late March, Brown, along with four of her
now former University of Texas women's basketball teammates, were
taking on all comers at Gregory Gym. The all comers happened to be
male.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's makeshift team had just defeated one all-male team when
another all-guy squad challenged them.
</P>
<P>
   One male in particular seemed intent on making sure that Brown,
who recently was awarded the Margaret Wade Trophy as the national
women's player of the year, wasn't going to show him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was really upset that his manhood was being
stomped,'' Brown recalled. ``He didn't want to get showed up by a
girl. I posted him up, and he was trying to foul me hard. I knew
it, and so did everybody else. He was trying to strip me (of the
ball). And he used a closed fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Dude, calm down. Relax.'''
</P>
<P>
   The closed fist came down painfully hard on Brown's right hand.
Thinking she had a jammed knuckle, she persevered through the
pickup game and competed days later in the Women's Basketball
Coaches Association All-Star game in Philadelphia as part of the
women's NCAA Final Four festivities. It wasn't until she got back
to Austin, 10 days after her injury, that she learned her injury
was much more severe than a knuckle jam.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays revealed she had a fractured bone in the middle of her
hand. Her hand was placed in a plastic splint, and the fracture
prevented her from participating in the WNBA draft camp in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But the injury doesn't seem to have hurt her chances for today's
WNBA draft. Brown, along with four other college seniors, will be
guests of the WNBA for the draft, which starts at 10 a.m. at the
league's New York offices. Brown still will be wearing a splint,
but it's expected to come off within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a versatile guard who can play point or shooting guard on
the professional level, has been forecast as the top college player
selected. Depending on whether Olympic standout Teresa Edwards
makes herself available for the draft, Brown could be selected by
the Cleveland Rockers with the first selection. ESPN.com anointed
Brown as the probable top pick last week.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA draft is unique compared to other pro drafts because of
the talent pool from which it selects. College players such as
Brown and Kansas' Lynn Pride, another top prospect, are available
for the draft, as are foreign professionals. Players such as
Edwards, who played in the now-defunct American Basketball League,
also are eligible for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL folded in December 1998. The WNBA teams absorbed most of
its top players in last year's draft when only a dozen collegians
were picked. But there were some ABL stars, Edwards among them, who
did not sign a WNBA contract. Edwards is a 35-year-old point guard
and in September will be playing for her fifth Olympic
team.(backslash)
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT HAS GUARDS GALORE
</P>
<P>
   The talent pool for today's draft is not a deep one because most
of this season's college stars were juniors. This draft class is
guard-heavy. Like its NBA counterpart, the WNBA covets centers. But
there are only three truly talented posts in this year's class _
North Carolina State's Summer Erb, UCLA's Maylana Martin and Penn
State's Andrea Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Because Brown can play point guard _ she averaged 6.0 assists
last season despite running the UT offense only half the time _ she
has separated herself from the crowded pack of mostly shooting
guards. Another aspect of Brown's game that makes her so attractive
to scouts is her rebounding. She averaged 8.4 rebounds a game this
season and led the Longhorns in that category for the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where I play, I just want to be on the floor,''
Brown said. ``I'm one of those types of players who can do
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA coaches appreciate that versatility almost as much as her
scoring skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown is probably the most explosive guard in the draft,''
Seattle Coach Lin Dunn said. ``She is 5-10, very physical and a
great defender. She can hit the jumper and the three-point shot.
She is an exceptional shooting guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Nancy Lieberman-Cline, Detroit coach and general manager:
``Going to the shooting guard, Texas' Edwina Brown and (Tulane's
Grace) Daley are clearly the two top collegiate players at that
spot. We have Brown rated as the best and Daley right behind her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 Conference will have an impact on the draft. Besides
Brown, Pride will vie to be the top pick. The athletic forward did
not participate in the pre-draft camp, which could hurt her stock.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, aside from its draft pool, also is unique in that it
has a set pay scale for its draftees. Players who are selected in
the top five of the draft will be paid $52,500 for the season, in
addition to living expenses. Fourth-round picks make $26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she has no plans to hire an agent and refers all
agents who call her to coach Jody Conradt or Barb Kowal, a UT
assistant athletic director. Brown also is not worried about her
fractured hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe everything happens for a reason,'' she said. ``I
looked at this as a chance to work on my left hand. I know that
this is all part of God's plan and will. I know that there is a
next level for me (after college). This injury could have set me
back if I had a negative attitude.''

GOVERNMENT'S MICROSOFT PROPOSAL SEEKS TO WIDEN COMPETITIVE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-SUIT and related stories and graphic) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its proposal for breaking up Microsoft, the government is
betting that two monopolies, when no longer under the same
corporate roof, would behave very differently than they do today _
and thus create a more open, competitive environment in the
software industry.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Justice Department's tentative proposal,
which is expected to be submitted to a federal judge later this
week, would be to force Microsoft Corp. to break off its
industry-standard Windows operating system into one company, and
its Office applications software business and most other Microsoft
operations into a second company.
</P>
<P>
   In the long-running antitrust case, Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson found that Windows had a monopoly with nearly 85 percent of
the market for personal computer operating systems. Its Office
product is a bundle of programs including word processing,
spreadsheet and database software, and analysts estimate that it
holds about 90 percent of the market for such programs for business
use of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Office software came up only a few times during the
lengthy trial, which focused mainly on accusations that Microsoft
used its market power to stifle the challenge to Windows posed by
Internet software. Yet throughout the case, the government referred
to Microsoft's arm-in-arm, self-reinforcing linkage between Windows
and Office as being a crucial part of its strategy to defend its
monopoly _ or, in legal terms, raising the ``applications barrier
to entry.'' Jackson, in his ruling earlier this month, embraced the
government's concept of the case.
</P>
<P>
   David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School, explained:
``What the government seems to be trying to do is change the
incentives for both monopoly products, Windows and Office. If they
are split up, you would have more of a duopoly structure with the
same kind of tension that exists between Microsoft and Intel, which
is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel dominates the market for microprocessors, the chips that
power personal computers, almost in the same way that Microsoft
dominates the market for PC operating systems, which control the
basic operations of the machines. The two companies cooperate
closely, but they also have an interest in encouraging competitors
to each other. Intel, for example, wants to make sure the market
for its chips is as broad as possible. So it has invested in
companies developing Linux, an increasingly popular version of the
Unix operating system, which competes with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   By placing Microsoft's Office business in a separate company
from Windows, analysts say, the executives in charge of Office
would have some of the same kinds of incentives as does Intel. At
present, Microsoft does not make a version of Office for Linux. But
in a stand-alone company, the Office managers could well find it in
their interest to develop a version of Office for Linux. Dan
Kusnetzky, an analyst at the research firm International Data
Corp., says that if 2 million of today's 12 million Linux users
bought Office, that could be roughly a $600 million business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Office has always worked better with Windows, that is
part of the way Microsoft drove people to the Windows operating
system,'' Kusnetzky said. ``But as a separate company, that linkage
should change. Then, people would not care what the underlying
operating system is.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed split-up would address one issue that has been a
frequent complaint from other software companies _ that Microsoft
gives its own applications programmers preferred access to the
inner workings of Windows technology. With Office no longer in the
same company, the Windows team would have no incentive to give it
preferred treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long maintained that it does not withhold from
rivals the technology inside Windows _ called application program
interfaces, or APIs _ that other programs must have to run smoothly
with the Microsoft operating system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said that the government
plan, if actually presented to the federal court, would be a ``very
radical and extreme proposal.'' Such a proposal, Murray said, was
in no way justified by the case presented in court, which, he said,
dealt with the allegation that Microsoft illegally tied its
Internet browser to its industry-standard Windows operating system.
Microsoft has denied all the allegations in the suit and plans to
appeal Jackson's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A breakup is a harsh sanction. But splitting the Windows
business and the Office business into stand-alone companies was not
the most extreme of the remedy proposals that had been considered
by the Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft. The
toughest breakup proposal was to not only split off the Office
applications business, but to give the Windows programming code to
perhaps three different companies to create immediate competition
in the operating system business.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of that approach, analysts said, is that it might
well balkanize the Windows operating system _ a familiar standard
used on 300 million desktop computers worldwide. The prospect of
``fracturing'' the Windows standard concerned many economists,
investors and PC users _ most of whom would not regard three
versions of Windows as a triumph of ``consumer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Justice Department shunned that approach. Instead,
according to one person close to the proposal, the government's
goals were to craft a remedy package that restrains Microsoft's
behavior, opens the industry to greater competition and yet does
not require the Justice Department to continuously police
Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The split-up companies would still be huge and profitable. In
the fiscal year ending in June, the Windows business is expected to
have revenue of $9.5 billion, according to Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. Revenue for the Office applications business is expected to
be $10.5 billion. And its consumer unit, which includes everything
from its MSN Internet service to Microsoft keyboards and mice, is
projected to have revenue of nearly $3 billion. The consumer
division, a person close to the government's proposal said, would
likely be folded into the company that takes the Office
applications business.
</P>
<P>
   The gross profit margins, before taxes and other expenses, are
an astronomical 95 percent on Microsoft's Windows business,
analysts estimate. On the applications business, the gross profit
margins are more than 80 percent, analysts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some analysts have speculated that a breakup of
Microsoft into two monopolies could prove a windfall for investors.
After Standard Oil was split up in 1914 and the AT&AMP;T breakup in
1984, they noted, the pieces were soon worth far more to investors
than the combined companies had been.
</P>
<P>
   That theory apparently provided scant comfort to Microsoft
investors Monday. Microsoft's stock dropped $12.3125 a share, to
$66.625 a share. The main cause of the falloff was a belated
reaction to the company's disappointing quarterly revenue growth,
reported on Thursday after the close of the market but before the
Good Friday holiday.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts also doubted the theory that a breakup would
benefit investors. ``I see it more likely to result in a
destruction of shareholder value, not an unlocking of shareholder
value,'' said David Readerman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners
in San Francisco.

 &HT;    Orlando's idea right for Hawks
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Hawks should send a thank-you card to the Orlando
Magic. By giving Doc Rivers a chance, the Magic cleared a path. All
businesses try to think outside the box, as management jargon has
it, but some company has to be the first to make a beyond-box move.
Orlando did it.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Orlando made Rivers, who was then 38 and who hadn't
worked even as an assistant, its head coach. The Magic subsequently
overachieved so outrageously that Rivers stands as the new model
for NBA teams seeking a coach. As of Monday, that list officially
includes the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to put specifics on it,'' said general manager Pete
Babcock, speaking of his criteria. Then he did anyway. ``We're
looking for energy, a specific direction, a commitment to player
development, someone who can relate well to players and at the same
time be demanding.'' In sum, the Hawks are looking for the
anti-Lenny.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens isn't the wrong coach for every team, but he was
for the band of fledglings this had become. At the end, even
Wilkens had to know it. He resigned because his other choice was to
get fired. Babcock and Stan Kasten took great pains Monday to speak
no ill of the newly deposed, but it was clear that familiarity had
had its accustomed effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a truism that five years is about the max (for any pro
coach),'' Babcock said. ``It's like a great speech. You can deliver
the speech 100 times and it's still a great speech, but the 100th
time it isn't as impactful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Hawks can find a new voice, emphasis on ``new.'' Tubby
Smith would be a splendid candidate, but he isn't apt to leave one
of the three best college jobs for the team that finished with the
NBA's 25th-best record. Isiah Thomas would generate major publicity
but would come with an outsize ego and hasn't been able to divest
himself of the CBA. (Can't coach a major-league team while owning
an entire minor league.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Hawks shouldn't feel a need to make a Big Splash with a
Big Name. As the composition of NBA rosters grow ever younger, it
seems forward-thinking to follow Orlando's example and hire a coach
of tender years and limited seasoning. ``I would never downgrade
head-coaching experience,'' Babcock said, ``(but) Doc's success
opens the door for everyone in the league to be more flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot names among NBA assistants are Byron Scott of Sacramento
and Rick Carlisle of Indiana. The Hawks figure to consider both,
but they should look first at another former player. They should
look first at Nate McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   He's 35, barely two years removed from a career so distinguished
that Seattle was moved to retire the number of a player who never
averaged more than 7.6 points. McMillan has spent this season on
the Sonics' staff. He played under the huckster Jim Valvano at
North Carolina State, played for the canny George Karl as a pro,
played alongside the raging Gary Payton. Presumably this varied
background left McMillan with a feel for motivation, for tactics
and for ego-massaging.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, the resourceful McMillan was heralded as a
coach-in-waiting. He need wait no longer. Orlando has shown the
way. The Hawks should be brave enough to follow.

GOP EXPECTS TO RAISE $18 MILLION AT GALA HONORING BUSH

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Party expects to raise at least $18
million, the largest sum collected at a fund-raising event by
either major party, at a black-tie dinner on Wednesday night
saluting Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A month from now, however, that record may be shattered by the
Democratic Party when it holds its annual springtime gala, a
tribute to President Clinton. Unlike the Republicans' event at the
Armory here, to be attended by 1,600 guests in tuxedos and evening
dresses, the Democrats plan to hold a barbecue at the MCI Center
sports arena on May 24 with 15,000 guests encouraged to wear blue
jeans and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   There is another fundamental difference between the parties' two
big-money galas. A majority of the money raised by the Republican
Party for its dinner is soft money, the unlimited, often large,
contributions that Vice President Al Gore has challenged Bush to
eliminate from this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the vice president's challenge, the Democrats have
tried to transform their annual gala into a small-donor event, with
ticket prices starting at $50. But many contributions will be
soft-money checks of $100,000 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our folks are going to come to this event on the Metro, not in
limousines,'' said Terry McAuliffe, the dinner's chairman and the
chief fund-raiser for the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996. It was the
idea of McAuliffe, who has raised more money than any fund-raiser
in the history of the Democratic Party, to place an emphasis on
collecting small donations at the tribute to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford May, the communications director for the Republican
National Committee, objected to the Democrats' effort to portray
the Republican gala as a dinner for wealthy contributors. ``That is
disingenuous and misleading and they know it,'' May said. ``Our
average donation is lower than theirs. We will tell you what ours
is. Up until now, they have refused to reveal their average
donation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' average donation is $55, officials said. Jenny
Backus, the Democrats' spokeswoman, said the party did not reveal
its average donation because it viewed the information as
proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have spent much of their time soliciting soft-money
contributions during the lull between the primaries and this
summer's nominating convention. On Monday night, Clinton and Gore
and their wives attended a fund-raising dinner in New York that was
expected to raise $2.2 million for the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, the Democratic National Committee
surprised many fund-raisers by outraising the Republicans, who
traditionally raise more. The Democrats raised $26 million from
January to March, while the Republicans raised $24 million. The
Democratic effort was bolstered by the efforts of Clinton, who
attended 41 fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican event on Wednesday night, called Gala 2000, will
shatter last spring's record of $14 million at a salute to former
President George Bush. The fund-raising for this year's gala was
led by 50 vice chairmen, each of whom raised $250,000 or more, said
Mel Sembler, the finance chairman of the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an enormous amount of enthusiasm out there
for our nominee,'' Sembler said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Fox, the gala chairman and chief executive of the Harbour
Group, an industrial products manufacturer, said on Monday, ``The
response has been absolutely incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The gala comes 10 months after George W. Bush, who has already
raised record sums for his own campaign, held his first
presidential fund-raiser in Washington, an event that raised $2
million and was attended by hundreds of lawyers and lobbyists.
Although he is running as a Washington outsider, Bush was embraced
then, and will be feted on Wednesday, by hundreds of this city's
most powerful and influential Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The gala invitation list reads like a who's who of Republican
lobbyists from K Street, the capital's corridor of influence. Some
of the Republicans' biggest contributors are listed on the program,
including Kenneth Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corp. in Houston,
which has given more than $500,000 to past Bush campaigns; Charles
J. Wyly Jr., the Dallas investor whose group, Republicans for Clean
Air, spent $2.5 million on attack advertisements against Sen. John
McCain of Arizona; and Carl H. Lindner, the chairman of American
Financial Group, who personally gave the Republicans $550,000 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The party's fortunes have also been bolstered by the new
big-money donor club known as the Regents. Each member gives
$250,000 to the party. There are 56 ``Regents,'' and party
officials hope to recruit 44 more by Election Day.

 &HT;    `Resignation' buys time for Hawks duo
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not surprisingly, those who run the Hawks still don't
get it. Either that, or they simply wished to save themselves from
the guillotine of their combined bosses at Turner Sports, Time
Warner Inc. and AOL by slicing off the head of Lenny Wilkens and
presenting it as a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I'm sorry. Hawks president Stan Kasten and Hawks general
manager Pete Babcock said Monday at Philips Arena during a hastily
called news conference that Wilkens resigned. You know, just like
Richard Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a joke. This almost is as funny as Kasten and
Babcock hiring the most troubled player in the NBA named Isaiah
Rider before the season, telling the famously meek Wilkens to do
something with him and firing both of them after the Hawks dropped
into purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   I keep forgetting. Wilkens resigned. That's right, he just
happened to decide over the last few days to leave the Hawks, even
though he spent much of the last couple of weeks expressing his
eagerness to coach the team for an eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Wilkens definitely had to go after this season's 28-54
disaster turned Philips Arena into the loneliest place in Atlanta
during Hawks games. The public rebelled against Wilkens' mellow
coaching style of 27 years and a roster of young and boring players
with little athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this season, the Hawks continued their yearly meltdown
early in the playoffs with old and boring players with little
athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens didn't hire any of those players. Kasten and Babcock
did. That means Wilkens is only the symptom here, and that also
means the problem for the Hawks is elsewhere. Like wherever Kasten
and Babcock have gathered during the past 10 years to make
decisions for this hapless franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Not only isn't Kasten going anywhere as president of the Braves
and Thrashers as well as the Hawks, but neither is Babcock. With
Wilkens' departure, they've bought themselves maybe three more
years of excuses and alibis.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the NBA draft in June. Since the Hawks finished
brutal enough this season to earn a lottery pick, Kasten and
Babcock will have the chance to suggest during another rocky season
that it will take a while before the new guy meshes with the
previous new guys that Wilkens wouldn't play _ you know, just
because they weren't that good, but so much for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also have the traditional grace period for a new coach.
That's good for a couple of seasons right there for Kasten and
Babcock. And, as they already like to tell the public, the Hawks
will have all of that money under the salary cap to purchase free
agents. No, not this summer, but the next summer.
</P>
<P>
   And, when the Hawks still are sorry three summers from now,
we'll likely hear the same words from Babcock during a news
conference that we heard after Wilkens, uh, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a tremendous burden on him with all the changes we
made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a great deal of responsibility, and an even greater
sense of frustration for not providing the coaching staff with the
atmosphere to allow us to maximize our potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As difficult as this is for us, we think the future is
extremely bright. We're excited about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yadda, yadda, yadda.

ALBRIGHT TAKES SECURITY STEPS IN WAKE OF LAPTOP DISAPPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Decrying ``inexcusable and intolerable'' security
lapses at the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Monday stripped her intelligence office of its right to
police itself, reassigned two diplomats and ordered supervisors to
rethink their security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The measures came as the FBI led an investigation into the
disappearance more than two months ago of a laptop computer
containing highly sensitive files, including intelligence sources
and methods weapons related to weapons proliferation, senior
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, whom aides described as extremely angry, targeted the
department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research for punishment,
transferring a top administrator and an analyst and placing its
overall security under the aegis of the Bureau of Diplomatic
Security, whose tasks including protecting U.S. embassies and
envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that a series of incidents have ``put our nation's
secrets at risk'' and damaged her department's reputation, Albright
chided every employee under her leadership to make security ``your
top priority in all its aspects all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, security is not a subject in a university
course,'' said Albright in a press briefing. ``Ninety-nine percent
success is a failing grade.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing laptop comes four months after officials discovered
an eavesdropping device in a State Department conference room, and
promptly expelled a Russian diplomat from the country. In 1998, a
man dressed in a tweed sportcoat strolled into the executive
secretary's office, six doors down from Albright's office and
walked out with sheaves of classified documents while two
secretaries worked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Monday they have not yet
determined whether the laptop computer, which vanished from a
sixth-floor work area of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research,
was lost or stolen. It not known whether the computer may have been
sought for its hardware or its files, which carried a ``code word''
classification, higher than top secret.
</P>
<P>
   But department officials appeared to proceed under the
assumption that the files _ which drew on material culled from
sensitive human and electronic sources _ were likely to fall into
the hands of adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about extremely sensitive information here,''
said James P. Rubin, the department's spokesman. Various agencies
are still examining the implications of losing such files, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright ordered the transfer of two employees from Intelligence
and Research, pending the results of the investigation.
Administration sources identified those reassigned as Nancy May,
the acting executive director of the bureau, and Allen Locke,
director of the bureau's office of analysis for strategic,
proliferation and military issues.
</P>
<P>
   Neither official responded to requests for comment. The
temporary transfer was ``not a finding of fault,'' Rubin stressed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Albright ordered all senior supervisors at the
department to review their security practices and demanded an
intensified program of annual refresher classes for people who
handle classified information. She said, moreover, she would work
with lawmakers to possibly establish a new senior position at the
department to handle security matters.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties have prodded Albright to better
safeguard U.S. secrets. Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, the chairman of
the House International Relations Committee, announced he would
hold hearings into security failures at the department.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., a Delaware Democrat, praised Monday's
steps to ``shake people out of their lethargy.'' But Biden also
blamed steady cutbacks in the State Department's budget, including
a Republican-led move earlier this month to slash international
funding by over 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reduction will surely harm the State Department's ability
to assure robust information security,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   The laptop incident spotlighted the struggle of a relatively
obscure, often criticized bureau that seeks to provide independent
intelligence to the secretary of state and her deputies, while
functioning in the shadows of the deep-pocketed Central
Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the
National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Among the larger intelligence services, the State Department's
bureau _ with shrinking personnel and an antiquated computer system
_ has long been viewed as an institutional stepchild with an
unmotivated staff. The CIA has been known to withhold intelligence
from the bureau, staffers there said. Albright consulted the CIA
chief in announcing her steps Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place they sent people who weren't making a great
deal of progress in their overseas posts,'' said one former CIA
official of the bureau. ``The general impression at CIA and DIA was
that these were second-raters. They were not considered
top-drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   Toby Gati, the former assistant secretary of the Bureau of
Intelligence and Research, charged that her office had been
neglected by Albright and her top aides. While she said there was
no excuse for the bureau's ``terrible mistakes,'' Gati said its
staff toiled under the constant mantra of ``doing more with less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the secretary nor her deputy cared a whit about
Intelligence and Research, nor have they made much use of its full
potential,'' said Gati, who led the bureau from 1993 to 1997. ``If
the department really cared about security, it would have given
Intelligence and Research the resources to do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Godson, an intelligence specialist who is a professor of
government at Georgetown University, said it is unfair to single
out the State Department for security breaches. It is an easier
target, he said, because it has a more public image and frequently
clashes with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department has made a number of egregious mistakes,
but it's not the only one,'' said Godson, who served in the White
House during the 1980s. ``To be fair, lots of other services have
made mistakes like that.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department intends to ask a federal
judge this week to break Microsoft into two companies to bring
about competition in the software industry, officials and others
aware of the government's deliberations said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes less than a month after settlement talks
between the government and Microsoft broke down and a federal judge
found Microsoft in wide violation of federal and state antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, ruled that
the company was a predatory monopolist, there is no assurance that
he will accept the proposed remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft called the idea ``a radical and extreme example of
government regulation that would be bad for consumers and for the
high-tech economy.'' A spokesman, Mark Murray, added, ``There is no
basis in the evidence presented in this case for this sort of
radical remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people with knowledge of the Justice Department's plan
said it called for one company to retain the Windows
operating-system business and for the other to take the rest of
Microsoft's operations, including software programs like Word and
Excel, Microsoft's Web browser and its Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be about a 60-40 split of Microsoft's estimated
$23 billion in revenue this year, with operating systems being the
lesser share. While in some ways the plan would create two
monopolies in place of one, the premise is that their incentives
would differ and that they would therefore behave differently.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's inclination to seek a breakup of the
company was reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal, The
Washington Post and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, officials said the 19 states that
joined with the Justice Department in the case appeared to be
seeking remedies short of a breakup. Now that the states have been
briefed on the federal plan, they generally support it, several
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whether the states will endorse the plan in
full or formulate a plan of their own by Friday, the deadline set
by the judge. It also remains possible that the states will fail to
agree among themselves, in which case they are to submit a proposal
based on the opinion of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The broad idea behind the Justice Department's plan is to create
incentives for increased competition in the operating-system and
related businesses. One reason Windows has no significant
competitors is that Microsoft generally does not create software
for non-Windows operating systems, with the exception of Apple
Computer's.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Office, the suite of programs that includes Word for
word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations, commands
over 90 percent of that business, known as application software, so
an operating system that cannot work with Office stands little
chance of prospering.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft argues that a new applications-software company
would have no more incentive to write for smaller operating systems
than the company does now. Murray, the Microsoft spokesman, said,
``There is no evidence that would lead anyone to believe that
Office stands as the linchpin for resolving all of the government's
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Because any break-up proposal would almost certainly be stayed
pending appeal, the government plans to ask for several interim
restrictions on Microsoft's behavior, to remain in force for three
years if a break-up plan is ultimately approved and implemented,
and 10 years if it is not.
</P>
<P>
   As part of these so-called conduct remedies, Microsoft would
have to publish a standardized price list for Windows so that the
company could not raise the price for companies that do not go
along with Microsoft's requests.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would be forbidden to strike exclusive contracts with
other companies, as it did with Internet service providers that in
past years were asked to feature Microsoft's Web browser and no
others.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would also have to make available the Windows
interface codes that allow other companies to write programs for
Windows without discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   And the company would not be allowed to build certain new
applications, such as Web browsers and media players, into Windows
without also offering a version of Windows that did not provide
access to that new application. Computer makers would get a
discount on Windows if they asked for Windows without the new
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls most of these ideas excessive, beyond the scope
of the evidence presented during the trial, and notes that these
conduct remedies might be stayed pending appeal, along with the
breakup proposal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was Microsoft's decision to build a Web browser, Internet
Explorer, into Windows four years ago that prompted the
government's suit. The decision assured that, over time, Internet
Explorer would be installed automatically on nearly all of the
world's personal computers, driving the market leader of the time,
Netscape, to a marginal position today.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new government plan, the applications software company
would retain possession of Internet Explorer, meaning that
Microsoft would have to create a stand-alone version _ something
the company has adamantly refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   The applications-software company could license Internet
Explorer back to the Windows company _ but only once. When the time
came to upgrade the browser, each of the new companies would have
to do that on its own, thereby creating competition in the browser
business and, perhaps, giving Netscape a chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   While the conduct remedies would expire in three years, the
government would also ask for strong anti-collusion rules for the
new companies, and they would stay in place indefinitely. Those
rules have not been described.
</P>
<P>
   One person with knowledge of the government proposal stressed
that the Justice Department had settled on this plan for several
reasons. First, it does not fragment the operating system, as some
other remedies might. That could lead to incompatible computers and
programs. Windows will remain the industry standard, unless the
company loses that position through competition.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, the government would also not be required to
maintain long-term, constant, intrusive monitoring of Microsoft, as
would be likely with a series of remedies that modify conduct. Both
Microsoft and the courts would likely find that idea objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government plan, the Windows company would face no
specific limits or regulation after three years. But by then, the
government hopes, other operating systems might begin to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   It would be left to Microsoft's leaders to decide which of the
new businesses would carry the name Microsoft and retain the key
executives. And other details of the breakup, including how to
divide Microsoft's $17.8 billion cash reserve, would be decided
later.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said the investment firm Greenhill &AMP;
Co., which the Justice Department retained in December to study the
financial impact of various proposals to resolve the antitrust
case, had not yet put a value on the separate businesses that would
result from the breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   While the government position could change in modest ways over
the next few days, officials said this fundamental plan was
unlikely to be altered. Neither Microsoft nor the government
displayed any indication that they might try to settle the case
before the remedy phase. Microsoft remains supremely confident that
it will overturn the district court decisions on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been studying various remedy ideas
for over a year and had wanted to offer a structural remedy of this
sort during the settlement talks that began in November and ended
early this month. But Microsoft refused even to discuss the idea,
so structural remedies were taken off the table almost before the
talks began.
</P>
<P>
   With the talks behind them, and the need for compromise with the
defendant removed, the Justice Department moved quickly back to
discussions of structural remedies, and one official said Attorney
General Janet Reno had approved the current approach.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials first shared their proposal with
some of the key state attorneys general who are partners in the
suit on Thursday and Friday and asked them for help and
concurrence. Both state and federal officials said the federal plan
was modified in some ways as a result of discussions with the
states.
</P>
<P>
   A senior state official said the Justice Department ``has been
receptive and respectful of our point of view.'' But one
knowledgeable official also said that while the government intends
to enlist as many of the states as it can in its plan, it will file
the plan with Jackson by Friday regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has said he would prefer a single remedy proposal from
the plaintiffs but would be willing to accept two, one from the
federal government and the other from the state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the states had been promoting less severe
remedies, even though many of them personally preferred the idea of
breaking up Microsoft, several officials said. Concerned about
their prospects on appeal, and about public opinion, among other
issues, the states had been planning to ask only for conduct
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several days, however, opinions began to change.
Conduct remedies require strong enforcement mechanisms to remain
effective, and the states were having trouble finding mechanisms
they were certain could work. ``The more we considered the conduct
remedies,'' the state official said, ``the more we saw that they
would necessitate constant oversight and intrusion on Microsoft,
and nobody was comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, last Wednesday, The Washington Post published an
interview with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive officer,
in which he said the company had done nothing wrong and saw no
reason to alter its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the attorneys general, working that very day on
enforcement mechanisms, ``saw this as a real slap in the face,''
one official said. With that sort of attitude, he added, ```we knew
enforcement would be ongoing and difficult.''

 &HT;    George W. Bush to visit Dayton

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A Dayton neighborhood development group is taking
George W. Bush to school today and educating him on the benefits of
individual development accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He may be a willing student.
</P>
<P>
   Bush visits Dayton today for the first time as the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He is meeting with a small group of local officials who have
used individual development accounts to spur low- and
moderate-income families to save more and buy homes. These accounts
are programs in which banks or other groups match money put into
savings accounts by low- and moderate-income people. The money can
then be used to buy a home or pay for school.
</P>
<P>
   Today's meeting was arranged by OIKOS Community Development
Corporation, which coordinates a local IDA program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to speak with local officials at 12:30 p.m. in
the auditorium of the Corpus Christi Parish Center in Dayton's Five
Oaks neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Bush touched on individual retirement accounts first in an April
11 speech in Cleveland, when he detailed a broad slate of
initiatives to help the working poor. He proposed a federal tax
credit for banks that match up to $300 in savings participants put
aside. The full $600 could be withdrawn tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   OIKOS has 68 people in its program, matching $2 for every $1
saved up to a total of $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the IDA programs are a really good idea and any
candidate worth their salt is going to lock onto this idea,'' said
Bob Beachdell, a VISTA volunteer with OIKOS. ``That is what we
really need. Funding is from both parties. It has a place in both
parties.''

 &HT;    Wilkens walks away from Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Hawks actually launched their search for a
new coach last weekend, days before Monday's announcement that
Lenny Wilkens would resign as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Stan Kasten and general manager Pete Babcock knew
they were going to make a change before the season ended and they
had already reached agreement with Wilkens before the announcement
at the team's practice facility at Philips Arena. Wilkens, who was
home in Seattle and did not attend the news conference, is
guaranteed the remaining $10.4 million on the final two years of
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through Career Sports Management Inc.,
Wilkens said, ``Atlanta will always hold a special place in my
heart. I have wonderful memories, both personally and
professionally, but it is time to explore new challenges and new
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Cooper, Wilkens' agent, said he expects his client to
land one of the NBA's eight or nine anticipated job openings, and
the salary in the new job will be deducted from the money the Hawks
are obligated to pay him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should Lenny not find a position that he's comfortable with,''
Kasten said, ``we have invited him to join our front office next
season. That tells you how much we think of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The winningest coach in NBA history with a career record of
1,179-981, Wilkens was 310-232 in his seven seasons with the Hawks.
Near the end of this year's dismal 28-54 season, the worst in
franchise history and the worst mark of Wilkens' 27-year coaching
career, he was clearly unhappy about the fortunes of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a terrible year. Just awful,'' he said. ``Don't
even try to sugar-coat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his resignation, Wilkens, 62, plans to coach again and
speculation has him linked to Washington, which announced recently
that interim coach Darrell Walker would not return next season. The
Wizards appear to need a prominent coach for their roster of
high-salaried, veteran players. Wilkens also has been mentioned as
a possibility if jobs open in Portland or Seattle, teams that are
currently in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hawks, Kasten said he was ``extremely optimistic''
about the search for Wilkens' replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had talks with some interesting names over the
weekend,'' he added. ``I'm not going to start naming people, but
there are some impressive people who have an interest in our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Former NBA All-Star and league executive Isiah Thomas is the
foremost name on the Hawks' list, but a few weeks ago it appeared
Thomas would not sell his interest in the CBA and would remain
ineligible to coach in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever it is, I'm confident that he will join Pete in giving
us an extremely talented team,'' Kasten said. ``Just as Lenny and
Pete were a great team. We had seven good years with Lenny. Even
this season, I must say he worked as hard as he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said Babcock's job is not in jeopardy; in fact, the team
president gave his general manager a vote of confidence Monday.
Asked whether Babcock had the ability to take the Hawks to the next
level, Kasten responded, ``Absolutely and without reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the talent he's brought to our team,'' Kasten
continued. ``Just two years ago we had four All-Stars on our team.
What does that tell you? Look at the record of talent we have
assembled here over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must tell you that I feel much more confident about our team
than our record would indicate. I have no hesitation in saying
that. With a high draft pick in June and the ability to sign a
quality free agent next summer, I feel that our future here is very
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hawks forward Alan Henderson agreed with Kasten's
assessment of the team, he expressed disappointment over seeing the
only coach in his professional career leave the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't want to get started next year, even though I'm very
sad to see Lenny leave,'' he said. ``He was good to me. He taught
me a great deal. He and I had a number of conversations about next
season and I felt good about it.

DISPUTE COULD WARM U.S.-CUBA RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - In an immediate sense, the hostility in
Cuban-American official relations is unlikely to be touched by the
Elian Gonzalez case. But over the longer term, the dispute could
encourage trends in American public opinion that favor more relaxed
ties, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   To change the relationship, the trade embargo enacted by
Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996 would need to be
ended, an impossibility in an election year and in the current
overheated atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican candidate, George W. Bush, wins in November,
there is not likely to be a change in policy; nor is it clear that
Vice President Al Gore would push for much change, particularly
given Fidel Castro's defiance on the question of improving
relations.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Clinton administration officials have repeatedly
said there will be no change in policy toward Cuba because of a
family argument over a 6-year-old. The White House went out of its
way to focus the drama as a legal one, not a matter between two
nations.
</P>
<P>
   But subtle shifts in Congress and small tinkering by the Clinton
administration on the travel ban to Cuba last year point to
movements in policy and attitudes that the Gonzalez case could
propel in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200,000 Americans, both legal and illegal travelers,
visited Cuba last year, nearly double the number from 1998,
according to Julia Sweig, the deputy director for Latin American
affairs for the Council on Foreign Relations. According to the
Cuban government, Americans now account for the second-largest
group of visitors, after Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot more exposure to Cuba,'' said Sweig, noting that
the American travelers included groups as diverse as Hollywood
producers and Midwestern farmers looking for business selling seeds
to nongovernmental agencies. (The farmers went under a new program
sanctioned by the Clinton administration, but they found little
business.)
</P>
<P>
   This exposure has contributed, Sweig said, to a ``certain sense
of exhaustion: people are tired of deferring to a Cuban-American
minority view.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll last May showed that 70 percent of Americans
favored lifting the trade embargo with Cuba; 28 percent were
opposed. More than 20 years earlier, another Gallup Poll showed 63
percent favored abolishing the trade embargo and 37 percent were
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News Poll this month, in the heat of the Gonzalez battle,
showed a shift in opinion, with respondents evenly split on whether
to restore relations with Cuba and end trade restrictions. The
poll's respondents strongly favored removing travel restrictions
between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, where opposition to improving ties with Cuba has
been the most resilient, the Senate voted last year 70-28 to end
the restrictions on sending food and medicine to Cuba, a softening
of attitude that took some by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, congressional supporters of broader ties with
Cuba noted that earlier in the Elian Gonzalez dispute, Sen. Robert
C. Smith, R-N.H., could not muster enough support in the Republican
Senate caucus to give asylum in the United States to the child.
</P>
<P>
   The most passionate anti-Castro crusaders in Congress
nonetheless believe that in the short term the heightened tensions
stirred by the case have boosted their efforts to slow any move to
normalize relations. But others doubt there will be any lasting
impact.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in permitting more Americans to go to Cuba, the
Clinton administration believes it has broadened the debate within
the United States and undermined somewhat the power of the
Cuban-Americans in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Since last May, academics, artists, scientists and other
professionals have been allowed to apply for licenses from the
Treasury Department to visit Cuba; the departure points were
expanded from Miami to include New York and Los Angeles. Many other
people have gone illegally as tourists, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez case was important because it was ``the first time,
two governments find themselves on the same side of an issue,''
said Wayne Smith, who was the head of the U.S. Special Interests
section in Havana from 1979 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It also served a purpose for policy in a human way. ``The more
Cubans are seen as normal human beings _ that the father is a
decent guy _ public opinion will swing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration policy has been carefully designed,
according to a former National Security Council official, to ensure
that it is not ``Castro-centric'' but rather ``people-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feinberg, who dealt with Cuba policy on the council in
the early Clinton years, said the administration decided there was
not much gain in aiming a policy at Castro, who has consistently
defied any attempts at relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, the policy was designed to build up a civil
society in Cuba so that in the ``indeterminate time when the regime
collapses, that there is not a vacuum and a transition to a
peaceful society is much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Democratic administration would be reluctant to initiate
sharply changed relations with Cuba because Castro has been so
unreceptive, Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes that Clinton offered but did not achieve last
year was a direct postal link between Cuba and the United States.
An administration official said Monday that Castro had rebuffed the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was considering easing the travel
restrictions further last fall but put the idea aside at the height
of the Gonzalez crisis. At the same time, there was a proposal to
enlarge the remittance program, which was eased in January 1999 to
allow American citizens to send $300 each quarter to family members
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva last week, the
United States vigorously pushed the case against Cuba.
Administration officials said they were pleased that a motion
citing a deteriorating human rights situation in Cuba was passed by
a larger margin than in the past.

CUBAN BOY'S PETITION FOR ASYLUM SEEN WEAKENED BY FATHER'S CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fact that Elian Gonzalez is in the custody of
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, most likely weakens his or his
Miami relatives' case for him to be granted asylum in the United
States, immigration lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Before federal marshals wrested the 6-year-old Cuban boy from
the relatives' home in Miami just before dawn Saturday, he had
signed an application for asylum. Last week, the United States
Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta agreed to hear his
application on May 11, and his father agreed to hold Elian in the
United States until then.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Gonzalez has custody of his son, he can make a
stronger case against asylum and take him home to Cuba, perhaps
before May 11, said Jose Pertierra, an immigration lawyer in
Washington who is not involved with the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that's what's being planned by Juan Miguel's
attorneys,'' Pertierra said. He said the case of Lazaro Gonzalez,
the great-uncle who had been holding the boy in Miami, had been
weakened by several factors, including his losing the day-to-day
care of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The father, whose lawyers have not disclosed their strategy,
could try to withdraw the application for asylum that Elian signed,
Pertierra said, or he could ask Elian himself to withdraw it.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Immigration and Naturalization Service could interview
the boy, find that he is not competent to understand his
application and ask the court to dismiss it. That, however, appears
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something we would do,'' said Maria Cardona,
spokeswoman for the immigration service. She said the argument the
immigration service intends to make before the court's three judges
is not whether the asylum application should be honored or
dismissed but whether a 6-year-old is competent to make one.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, a lawyer who represents the Miami relatives, said
he expected the court to hear the case on schedule because the
father has no right to try to derail it. ``As the 11th Circuit
Court ruled,'' Eig said, ``Elian is the plaintiff _ not Lazaro, and
not Juan Miguel.''

   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co. has rescheduled its annual
meeting for May 23. The meeting had been scheduled for this
Thursday but was postponed because of a delay in processing the
company's proxy statement by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

<P>
   In addition to the routine business, the company is asking
shareholders to authorize a new class of stock to represent New
York Times Digital, the company's Internet business division.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Times Co. filed an initial registration
statement with the SEC for the new class of shares related to the
Internet unit. The shareholder vote paves the way for the offering
but does not require the company to proceed, said Catherine Mathis,
a company spokeswoman. After the annual meeting, the company will
decide whether and when to offer the shares ``based on market
conditions,'' she said. &QL;

HIGH WINDS PROMPT NASA TO DELAY SHUTTLE LAUNCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ High winds Monday forced at least a
one-day postponement of NASA's bid to launch the shuttle Atlantis
on a repair mission to the fledgling U.S.-led international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis and its crew of seven were tentatively re-scheduled for
lift off at 3:52 p.m. EDT Tuesday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   However, forecasters placed the prospects of continued high
winds and thunderstorms Tuesday at 80 percent. NASA launch director
Dave King did not rule the possibility that mission managers could
postpone a second attempt until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has until Wednesday to begin the mission to the
uninhabited first components of the new station before it faces a
postponement until May 11.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday, NASA must give up the use of Air Force
radar-tracking equipment here that is required for every U.S.
rocket launch. A handful of commercial and military rocket launches
have lined up behind Atlantis for the use of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the advancing weather system proved more powerful
than originally forecast. As it swept across the southeastern
United States, cross winds at the shuttle's emergency runway kicked
up well above the 17 mph limit.
</P>
<P>
   If problems develop early in the spacecraft's 8 1/2-minute climb
to orbit, the long runway at Kennedy must be prepared for a shuttle
crew to attempt an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's scrub cost $616,000 in lost rocket engine propellants
and labor, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   The launch bid was called off with nine minutes left in the
Atlantis countdown. Shuttle commander Jim Halsell and his crew had
been strapped aboard the spacecraft for nearly 2 1/2 hours,
successfully satisfying all other launch criteria, hoping the wind
velocities would drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the rationale,'' Halsell said when informed of
the postponement. ``We will wait until the conditions are better.''
</P>
<P>
   The launch period is constrained by the ability of the shuttle
to reach the new international station, which is circling the Earth
at an altitude of about 220 miles.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlantis lifts off Tuesday, NASA plans to extend the shuttle
mission from 10 to 11 days because it will take the shuttle three
days rather than two days to reach the orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis visit is intended to set the stage for the arrival
of the station's three-person Russian crew module in July and the
first resident crew this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew plans to replace failing batteris aboard the
first components of the new orbital outpost and repair the U.S.
communications system. Astronauts Jim Voss and Jeff Williams plan
to re-secure a wobbly cargo crane on the exterior of the outpost
with a lengthy spacewalk.

JANUARY SPENDING ON CAMPAIGN ADS DOUBLES; COUNTING THE MONEY IN
N.C.; GORE CLOSES GAP IN OREGON 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Candidates for political office spent twice as much on
television advertising in January as in the same month in 1996,
according to the Television Bureau of Advertising. Based on figures
compiled by Competitive Media Reports, a company that tracks
spending for commercials, the bureau reported that political
expenditures on local television stations across the country came
to $12.8 million for January. That was double the $6.4 million
spent four years ago. The rise was attributed in part to a more
competitive primary season and the early scheduling of primaries in
several major states. The bureau, the broadcast television trade
group, forecasts a nearly corresponding rise for the entire
campaign: It predicts that this year, candidates at all levels will
pay $600 million _ $550 million of that on local stations, the rest
on the networks _ for commercials. Four years ago, a total of $400
million was spent on political advertising, the bureau said.

   THE GOVERNORS: CASH COMPETITIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   With North Carolina's gubernatorial primary only eight days
away, the money and the polls seem to be moving in different
directions in the Democratic race. Attorney General Mike Easley has
had a comfortable lead in recent polls over Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker,
but Wicker has raised more than Easley. The lieutenant governor has
collected $4.7 million, while the attorney general has raised $3.6
million. On the Republican side, former Mayor Richard Vinroot of
Charlotte holds a modest lead in both the polls and fund raising.
He has raised $2.4 million, compared with $1.6 million for Leo
Daughtry, the state House majority leader. A third candidate, Chuck
Neely, a Raleigh lawyer and former legislator, has raised $1.06
million.

   A year ago, it appeared that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was on
his way to being the first Republican presidential candidate to
carry Oregon since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Polls showed him leading
Vice President Al Gore by more than 10 points. Since then Gore has
closed the gap; the latest poll, an April 10-17 survey of 504
likely voters by The Oregonian, has Bush leading by only three
points, 40 percent to 37 percent. The poll, which has a margin of
error of plus or minus four points, also found Ralph Nader, the
Green Party candidate, running best among third-party contenders,
at 7 percent; Patrick J. Buchanan, the likely Reform Party
candidate, had only 2 percent.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One recent morning, Becky Michaels, who handles
advertising at a Midtown publishing house, left her Upper West Side
apartment with the kind of look that hadn't called to her in many
months: a skirt that sat somewhere in the mezzanine section of her
thigh, not in the orchestra. Her husband, a musician, asked if she
intended to go to the office ``like that.'' Michaels, who had
wavered about putting the skirt on in the first place, found
herself feeling uncomfortably low-rent for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly as long as there has been a ``Style With Elsa
Klensch,'' designers have stood in front of television cameras
trying to promote modern fashion as a laissez-faire enterprise.
Hike your skirt up to your sciatic nerve; let it graze your
Achilles' tendon. It doesn't matter; anything goes. But, of course,
anything does not go.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of the last eight years, short skirts and
dresses _ micro-minis, minis, garments with hemlines resting
anywhere north of the knee _ have been rare sightings on the
world's most influential runways, like Prada's. Even designers like
Alessandro Dell'Acqua, once known for revealing skirts, have shown
noticeably fewer of them lately. What runways and their ambassadors
_ fashion editors _ have earnestly legislated instead is a length
just at or below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Real women haven't necessarily abided. Until not too long ago,
among the many women who don't read Vogue as carefully as if it
were a warning on a can of paint stripper, shorter skirts turned up
defiantly, just as flat shoes and other looks the fashion
establishment considers passe managed to do. But now, it seems,
working women are indicating that they would like to keep their
legs more or less to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kalinsky, the Atlanta retailer who last year opened a
New York boutique, recently recalled that his customers used to
fight him ``tooth and nail'' on the sophisticated knee length he
encouraged. Shoppers, he said, would ask to get the skirts hiked
up. He would try, often unsuccessfully, to caution them against it.
He would offer them these words, he said: ``If you go this short,
it's going to look like Talbot's.'' But two years ago, Kalinsky
noticed that women had stopped asking him to hem their skirts.
</P>
<P>
   At shopping environments a little less rarefied than Kalinsky's,
Henri Bendel, for example, sales of short skirts started to slip
last year. Ed Burstell, the store's fashion director, said the
sales of shorter lengths started to decline last fall. As a result,
the store carries far fewer above-the-knee skirts than it once did.
The look ``could have the connotation of looking cheap,'' Burstell
suggested, adding, ``There are other ways you can convey
sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   New hemline opinions tend to raise the kind of questions that
other shifts in taste lack the history and symbolism to force. One
theory long promulgated by fashion watchers is that hemlines rise
in boom times (the 1920s, the '80s) and fall during less
economically vital years (the early '70s). The current abandonment
of shorter lengths contradicts that idea.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, what, if anything, does the shift represent?
The triumph of fashion's dictatorial strain? The true death of the
suit (with which short skirts were often associated) as a
professional costume? Or perhaps something deeper, a weariness of
bringing a ``go ahead and objectify me'' brand of feminism to the
office? That is, a reluctance to display too much, after a
protracted national conversation, in the wake of the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, about what does and doesn't constitute sexual
misbehavior at work.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy McCarver Root, a photography editor at Us Weekly, said she
stopped wearing short skirts to her Manhattan office in the last
year because ``I feel a little bit uncovered.'' Shannon Luckoski,
26, an administrative assistant in Atlanta, said her instinct to
abandon short skirts was validated on a recent evening when she
wore a short, animal-print version to a bar and found the hand of a
former colleague on her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent dinner shared by about 10 professional women, all in
their 20s or early 30s, at an East Side restaurant, the talk turned
to the fact that none wore short skirts anymore, not even at night.
What was surprising was how many used words like ``inappropriate''
and ``sluttish'' to describe how they now felt in short skirts they
once wore without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kerry Bernstein, who is 27 and works in marketing at a
corporate investigations firm, said that while she was recently
packing up clothes for the Salvation Army, she was shocked to
discover skirts that fell to midthigh, ones she breezily wore to
work two years ago, but would never wear today. ``You don't want to
think about men as you walk out of an office checking you out,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Douglas, 30, a commercial real estate executive, said she
had sent all of her short skirts to Goodwill, including one she was
wearing when she met her husband at a wedding four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Ann Taylor, arguably the nation's iconic purveyor of career
clothing, the skirt suit _ or the interview suit, as it is known in
retail parlance _ has had a noteworthy past couple of years.
Calhoun Sumrall, a vice president and design director at the store,
said that three or four years ago, the skirt length for the
standard Ann Taylor interview suit was 19 inches, not too far above
the knee on a woman of average height. It later dipped to 21 inches
and now rests at 22 inches. Sumrall pointed out that while shorter
lengths do well as part of the store's more casual collections, the
best-selling length sits below the knee at 24 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of women embrace a style long after avant-garde
designers present it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Where showy skirts have received their greatest play of late is
affixed to the waist of Julia Roberts in ``Erin Brockovich,'' which
is based on the story of a real-life single mother who didn't have
much time for the fantasy of fashion magazines. Erin Brockovich set
about uncovering deadly corporate malfeasance in three-inch heels
and skirts that appear no wider than a Post-it note. Jeffrey
Kurland, the film's costume designer, had most of the clothes made,
in part because the streetwalker style Brockovich favored in the
late 80's, when the movie is partly set, weren't so easy to come
by.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland has spent much of his career observing urban habits in
the service of dressing characters that populate Woody Allen
movies. He theorized that women have been moving subconsciously
away from provocative lengths ever since Americans began speaking
more openly about sexual harassment, which is to say, since the
Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings.

<P>
   This is the sort of argument that Ally McBeal, champion of the
uber-mini, might have had little tolerance for early on in her
television life. Last season, McBeal, the angst-ridden lawyer, was
held in contempt of court during one episode for wearing a skirt
that barely reached past her hips. She was furious at being
condemned for her choice, but as the episode progressed, McBeal
came to see her brash attempts at postfeminist expression as a kind
of trouble-making self-involvement, which made people around her
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   This season Ally has often shown up at work in pants.

ELIAN DRAMA COULD HELP THAW U.S.-CUBA RELATIONS

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Elian Gonzalez affair has painted an all-too-human
face on the 40-year conflict between the United States and Cuba, an
issue that doesn't cross many American minds much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-month stay in the United States, the bright-eyed and
vulnerable 6-year-old shipwreck survivor has found himself caught
up in a media frenzy and torn by the bitter squabble between his
communist-ruled country and its exiles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   As efforts move forward to return the boy home, the underlying
question is whether Elian's travail _ for many, the pop culture
event of the moment _ will have any lasting impact on U.S.-Cuba
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this crisis has done is awaken American public opinion to
the sense, or nonsense, of U.S. policy toward Cuba,'' Julia Sweig,
deputy director for Latin America on the Council on Foreign
Relations in Washington, said Monday. ``It's not going to have any
short-term impact, but it's accelerated a process that started
before Elian: a national rethinking of U.S.-Cuba policy.''
</P>
<P>
   That policy, forged in the 1960s and reinforced in the 1990s
with the Helms-Burton Act and other anti-Castro legislation,
includes a near-total embargo on trade with the island and a tight
restriction on travel there by U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone expects the embargo to be dropped soon. That would
require more political will than can be mustered for now and might
cause more harm than good in both Cuba and the United States, Sweig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's saga also suggests that the U.S.-Cuba conflict, once a
cornerstone in the Cold War, has largely become a feud among
Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   But the hatred between Castro and his enemies will likely hobble
a steady march toward a more normal relationship between Washington
and Havana, some analysts say. Castro needs his enemies in Miami to
stiffen the resolve of his people. The Miami Cubans have powerful
friends in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Elian drama could help speed the thaw that has been
going on in recent years. What is being contemplated in Washington,
Sweig and others say, is how to ``manage down'' the embargo and
other sanctions in order to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect anything bold,'' said Shawn Malone, a Cuba
analyst at Georgetown University in Washington. ``But what (the
Elian affair) could lead to, is that most Americans will no longer
actively oppose any opening to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   That opening is already under way, helped along by Pope John
Paul II's trip to the island in January 1998, by the evaporation of
U.S. fear of a communist threat from Cuba and by an eagerness by
many U.S. companies to participate in the opening of the Cuban
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration last year began allowing friends and
family in the United States to send money to Cuba. It also approved
food and medical sales to non-governmental agencies on the island,
and gave Cuban-Americans the right to visit there once every 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been dramatic. Remittances to the island now
run to the hundreds of millions of dollars. And some 150,000 U.S.
citizens will travel to Cuba this year with Washington's
permission, 90 percent of them Cuban-Americans returning to visit
friends and relatives, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and
Economic Council, a New York-based lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps another 25,000 Americans will go to Cuba illegally,
flying through Mexico, Canada and other third countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as many as 60,000 Cubans will come to the
United States this year, a third of them with the right to settle
here permanently and the remainder with permits for visits that
could stretch into months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see more contact between Cubans on both sides of the
Florida Straits and that can only be positive,'' said Delvis
Fernandez, director of the Cuban-American Alliance, a
Washington-based coalition seeking to improve ties to the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of separation, you create a lot of myths about one
another,'' Fernandez said. ``We need new schemes of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. businesses have long been clamoring for the chance to trade
with the island. Nearly 3,000 U.S. executives journeyed to Cuba
last year, hoping to learn the ropes and to make contacts in
expectations that the embargo will end sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``To wait for politics to catch up to business means that a
business is behind the curve,'' said John Kavulich of the U.S.-Cuba
Trade and Economic Council. ``Change will be more frequent and more
expansive as time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation allowing food and medicine sales directly to the
Cuban government was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee recently with the tacit consent of Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., the committee chairman who is an anti-Castro stalwart. But
it was not submitted for a vote by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Texas Farm Bureau's 12-person board of directors led a
delegation of farmers and agribusiness executives to the island
this week. It is the group's second visit there since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the embargo lifted,'' said Mike Barnett, a farm bureau
spokesman in Waco. ``It hasn't changed anything since Castro came
in. The only ones being hurt are the Cuban people.``
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost the only ones. Cuba imports hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of food and other agricultural products, Barnett
noted. ``We'd like a piece of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Castro in many ways has been helped more than harmed by the
embargo, some analysts say. His revolution has been at least as
much about guarding Cuba's independence from foreign domination as
it has Marxism. And for more than 100 years now, the biggest
foreign threat to the island has been the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo reminds the Cuban people that they have powerful
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Castro called a ``one-day truce'' Saturday in appreciation of
the Clinton administration's help in returning Elian to his father.
But neither the Cuban regime nor the media it controls have let up
on its attacks of U.S. ``imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government media downplayed the affair while
ramping up attacks on the Czech Republic, a former socialist block
ally, for leading the condemnation of Cuba in the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 people marched past the Czech Embassy in Havana,
shouting ``traitors, lackeys, puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the same day a U.S. appeals court ruled that the
boy must stay in the United States pending a May 11 hearing, an
evening television program set up to discuss the saga for two hours
every weeknight instead devoted five hours to lambasting the
perfidy of the Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   Although some 100,000 Cubans attended a rally Thursday to
protest the boy's continued stay in the United States, many in the
crowd drifted away after a few minutes of speeches. Those who
stayed spent more time visiting among themselves, sitting on
Havana's seawall or simply staring into space.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Save Elian'' T-shirts worn by many protesters were faded,
the boy's image bleached by the harsh tropical sun.

 &HT;    Expert's opinion of siege supported by evidence, judge says
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. said
Monday there is ``corroborative evidence'' to back up the opinion
of the court's expert that no muzzle blasts are seen on the
infrared videotapes taken at Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993, when a
fire broke out that led to the deaths of David Koresh and 75 other
Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the wrongful-death lawsuit against the
government claim FBI gunfire pinned many Davidians inside a burning
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stressed that he does not consider the preliminary
analysis by Vector Data Systems, a British firm that conducted a
re-creation of the final day at Mount Carmel, incontrovertible
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is evidence from an expert,'' Smith said. ``That expert's
opinion may be controverted.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith made his comments before the start of a pretrial hearing
on the plaintiffs' request that he sanction the government in the
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by surviving Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mike Caddell of Houston, the lead plaintiffs attorney,
said the government dumped more than 100,000 pages of records on
the plaintiffs after a court-ordered deadline. He also accused the
government of tampering with the evidence. The plaintiffs are
seeking $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sanctions hearing, though, Smith told attorneys that
Vector Data detected 57 thermal events or flashes of light on the
government's 1993 infrared tape (which picks up heat signatures).
</P>
<P>
   Vector Data, however, said the flashes are not muzzle blasts,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their preliminary opinion is that there were no muzzle blasts
at all on the FLIR (Forward-Looking Infrared) tape,'' Smith said.
``That's not merely expert opinion. It's backed up by corroborative
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Vector Data's experts showed him video of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms breaking the window into Koresh's
bedroom, trying to enter Mount Carmel during the Feb. 28, 1993,
raid that saw four ATF agents and five Davidians killed. Glass from
the shattered window fell on the roof and was pinpointed as the
source of one of the flashes some have identified as a muzzle
blast, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to tell you that every type of flash was
identified that specifically,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Vector Data will turn in a written report to him May
8.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford said he was pleased with Vector
Data's preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's consistent with what we've said all along,'' Bradford
said. ``There was no gunfire behind the compound on April 19th.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the test protocol for the re-creation was not
followed. Temperature requirements were not met, and the helicopter
carrying one of the FLIR cameras did not fly at the right altitude,
according to Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not rejecting the report,'' Caddell said. ``I haven't seen
it. We've got five issues in this lawsuit. Gunshots are just one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sanctions hearing, an FBI pilot testified he thought
there was audio on the FLIR tape that captured the fire at Mount
Carmel. The 1 1/2-hour tape, however, has no sound. Caddell called
the lack of audio ``suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who was not identified by name, said it was
``standard operating procedure'' to turn on the audio while
operating the FLIR camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when I heard the tape had no audio on it,''
the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   Learning the FLIR tape had no audio led him to call the FBI's
Office of General Counsel, the pilot said. During that
conversation, he speculated why there might not have been sound,
the pilot testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to think of any plausible reason why there was no
sound on the tape,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   Either nothing was going on or there might have been
conversation inside the surveillance plane of a ``sensitive''
nature that led someone to turn the audio off, the FBI pilot
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, who assisted Justice Department attorney Marie Hagen,
noted that the secondary FLIR operator, who was responsible for the
audio, was inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible that an inexperienced operator simply forgot to
turn it back on?'' Bradford asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' the pilot said. ``That is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   However, an audio expert tapped by Caddell claimed that his
analysis of the FLIR tape led him to think the audio may have been
erased from the FLIR tape.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cain, a forensic tape expert who worked for the Secret
Service, testified that the FLIR tape is silent until after the
video image ends. Then there is ``hissing,'' which indicates the
audio had been on, according to Cain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the audio has been erased,'' Cain said. ``I
think the evidence is fairly substantive.''
</P>
<P>
   But an expert witness for the government, Bruce Koenig, a former
FBI agent, testified that what Cain was hearing was attributable to
his copying the original FLIR tape and taking it back to his
Wisconsin lab to study. Koenig said the hissing is not heard on the
original FLIR tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had his report saying it was there,'' Koenig said. ``I
checked. There was nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell told reporters that the audio might have been stripped
off the FLIR tape to cover up a request to fire military tear gas
canisters, which are flammable. He noted that when the audio was on
during the morning of April 19, it recorded an FBI request to fire
military tear gas canisters at an outlying bunker area at Mount
Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A military tear gas canister might have started the fire in
the kitchen,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, however, scoffed at Caddell's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no proof presented that anything was destroyed or
withheld,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also had different viewpoints on an eight-minute gap
in the photographs taken by an FBI aerial photographer, who, like
the pilot, wasn't identified. The photographer, who said his job
was to take photographs of anything significant, didn't take
photographs of a tank collapsing the Davidians' gym, a tank ramming
the corner of Mount Carmel (where the fire first broke out) and the
start of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine, sir, with all this activity that there
was nothing going on that you felt warranted a photograph,''
Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer said he may have been giving the pilot a
``break,'' since the pilot had to hold open a window for him to
take photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, I'd have to say the pilot wasn't in a position for
me to take a photograph,'' the FBI photographer said. ``Also, it
looks far worse on the FLIR than it does to the naked eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not rule on whether to grant sanctions Monday. He gave
attorneys the week to submit written arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Smith released copies of an order denying the
government's request for a summary judgment in the case. He also
denied the plaintiff's request to reinstate Richard Rogers, the
former commander of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, and Jeffrey
Jamar, the FBI special agent in charge during the siege, as
defendants in the lawsuit.

DEBATE ON MIAMI RAID RIDES ON WHETHER DEAL WAS NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In three minutes on Saturday morning, the national
debate over who should have custody of Elian Gonzalez was replaced
by a much more intense dispute over whether Attorney General Janet
Reno had acted wisely in ordering the 6-year-old boy seized by
armed agents in a pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday that dispute was intensified by comments from the
White House and from Congress, and by the release of documents from
both sides in the nightlong negotiations over the child, documents
that hardly differed in words but were separated by a chasm of
conflicting interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiations were proceeding,'' four Miami civic leaders
maintained in a statement issued Monday afternoon. ``They had not
broken down. People were acting in good faith. Progress was finally
happening after the months of stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno, interviewed on the NBC News television program
``Monday,'' said, ``We just kept getting mixed signals from a
family that had given us hope and then pulled it back, said they
would comply with the law and then said on several occasions that
we would have to take the child by force.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gregory B. Craig, lawyer for Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, said in an interview, ``We were, as far as I can tell,
never close to an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing from either side on Monday definitively settled the
question of whether the Justice Department's efforts to broker a
deal between the families Gonzalez could ever have succeeded. And
for all the complaints over the raid's being done in darkness, or
over the arms carried by the agents, that had been the central
question before Reno.
</P>
<P>
   And as Friday night wore on into Saturday morning, the biggest
difference _ untouched as progress was made over times, places and
conditions _ was over trust, and that may have been too broad a gap
to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Craig said, the attorney general told Juan
Miguel Gonzalez that she did not want to have to send people in to
take Elian out by force. Gonzalez objected, telling her the Miami
relatives would never give in. ``They are never going to give up
the boy voluntarily,'' and every day's delay makes things worse,
Craig quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Miami relatives said they did not believe
that the father and the government would keep their word to have
the boy stay in the country until a judicial appeal decided the
asylum issue surrounding his case.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the Justice Department completely open with both sides.
While Reno spoke of deadlines to the Miami leaders, especially
Aaron Podhurst, a lawyer she has known well for many years, she did
not let them know a raid was imminent. Podhurst complained Monday
that she had led him to put two of the other civic leaders, Carlos
M. de la Cruz and Carlos Saldriga, ``in harm's way'' by sending
them to the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, where the raid was
nearly at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when she met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Craig on
Friday afternoon, she did not tell them she had been in touch with
the Miamians _ who also included Edward T. Foote II, president of
the University of Miami _ since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But she did disclose the overture at some point that day,
telling Craig she was going to explore the Miamians' efforts. Craig
says he told her he had no confidence that the Miami relatives had
more in mind ``than a ploy to take us through Easter and into next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he told her that he and Gonzalez were ready to go to
Miami themselves to get the boy (for the Miami relatives' lawyers
had said that was all they needed to do), and she told him not to
do anything rash.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he asked the attorney general to get him something
in writing if she expected him to take anything from the Miami
relatives seriously. She asked the Miami civic leaders for
something concrete, in a document, and they faxed her a one-page
proposal about 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That document, which was never given directly to Craig, proposed
that the two families live together ``in a mutually agreed, neutral
site in Miami-Dade County.'' Except for marshals to guard them, the
Gonzalez clans would have no one around other than a neutral
facilitator ``to help the family members get together and do what
is in the best interest of the child.'' Their lawyers would be
barred. This arrangement would be maintained until all legal
proceedings were ended.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal from the Miamians also included this sentence:
``We understand that you have transferred temporary custody of
Elian to his father.'' Podhurst maintained Monday that this had
conceded the custody question. Craig said that it had not done so
satisfactorily and that the open-ended joint living arrangement had
muddled the question of who could legally speak for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:58 p.m., Craig received a different proposal from the
Justice Department, apparently a product of the department's talks
with the Miami leaders about what might be acceptable to Juan
Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal moved the venue for the joint living arrangements
from Florida to Airlie House, a conference center in the Washington
suburbs. But that concession was not enough for Gonzalez, who
returned from dinner to Craig's office, or for Craig, who said he
thought the open-ended joint living arrangements were a mistake. He
also said a provision for the Miami leaders to nominate a new team
of experts to advise on how to deal with Elian was thoroughly
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also suggested that there would be conditions on
the father's custody; Craig said there had been no conditions on
Lazaro Gonzalez's temporary custody, so he asked why new ones were
being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:53 Justice sent another proposal. It softened the
suggestions of new custody conditions, and made it clear that while
both families would live at Airlie House, they would have separate
living quarters. But the timing was still an issue, and Craig said
none of the joint arrangements should exceed one week.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department kept talking with the Miami leaders, who
kept talking to the family of Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After those talks, at 2:10 a.m., Justice faxed another draft to
Craig. It gave him most of what he had demanded, including a 3:30
a.m. turnover of the boy to U.S. marshals at the federal courthouse
in Miami. It dropped the plan for nomination of a new group of
experts. And most important of all, it limited the joint residence
arrangement to a one-week period of transition in Elian's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Craig complained Monday that the one-week limitation had not
been included in another section, which allowed the attorney
general to direct the conditions of the transition period. He said
Holder had agreed to add it, but not to insert another section that
Craig sought, declaring Juan Miguel Gonzalez's right to ``challenge
the reasonableness of any condition imposed under this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder asked Craig to wake up his client and get him to agree.
Craig said he told Holder to ``sell it to them first.'' But, he
said Monday, he would have tried to persuade his client to agree,
and at about 2:50 a.m., he told Holder to ``proceed as if we had
agreed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That same draft, with the one-week limitation, was faxed to
Miami at 2:59 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   From here on, the accounts diverge. The Miami group insists that
it was making progress. But Craig says he was told the Miamians
were now changing their minds about letting Elian go to the
Washington area, suggesting instead White Oak Plantation on the
Georgia-Florida border.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Monday that she told Podhurst ``at about 4 in the
morning that we had run out of time, because we kept getting mixed
signals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues,'' she said ``was where would the families
meet. And the father did not want to come to Miami, because of the
tension and the tense atmosphere in Miami.'' She said Podhurst
``said that was a deal-breaker, and so we agreed that we had tried
our best.''
</P>
<P>
   With immigration agents on their way to raid Lazaro Gonzalez's
home, Reno talked to Podhurst again at 4:21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us remember it vividly,'' she said Monday. ``And he
said, `Could I have just five minutes?' And I said, `Five minutes.'
``And he said, `That means 4:26.' And I said, `That's right.' He
continued to keep me on the phone, and I kept on the phone because
I wanted to try to do everything I could. But we did not feel like
we could delay any longer, because the action was carefully timed.
And if it did not go forward at this time, it would be very
difficult in the future to effect a safe extrication of the little
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation unfinished, she put Podhurst on hold when the
raid began. When she picked up the phone again, he shouted angrily
at her. She cried, according to Podhurst and Holder, who said he
put his arms around her.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Miami leaders' statement said, ``We were
completely surprised and astonished that the government would
resort to armed marshals when we were so close to agreement,
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said: ``The attorney general stretched and pushed and
waited and tried as hard as she possibly could. I thought, prior to
her decision to go in, that she had been paralyzed by the
worst-case scenario. To accuse the attorney general of being
precipitous is, with all due respect, preposterous.''

ALBRIGHT DEFENDS U.S. INTENTIONS ON ARMS CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add four grafs to end of original text.)  
(With RUSSIA-U.S.-ARMS) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to
convince the world Monday that the United States was not
threatening to undercut a quarter century of progress on
international arms control by developing a new anti-missile defense
system that had drawn criticism from Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration were bent on sabotaging the ABM
treaty and strategic arms control,'' she told an international arms
control conference, ``we have surely gone about it in a strange way
_ in the open, with care and in consultation not only with
Congress, but after extensive discussions with our allies and other
countries, Russia and China emphatically included.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the opening of an international conference called
to review a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, Albright
also argued that the United States had reduced its nuclear arsenal
by 60 percent since the end of the Cold War, and had joined in
cutting NATO's nuclear stockpile by 85 percent. She spurned calls
for the quicker elimination of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, none of us has it within our power to create
overnight the conditions in which complete nuclear disarmament is
possible,'' she said. The speech offered no new initiatives but was
more of an accounting of how the administration wanted to define
its record.
</P>
<P>
   Albright walked into an almost solid wall of criticism of the
United States inside and outside the General Assembly hall because
of what was widely perceived as the slow pace of nuclear
disarmament more than a decade after the end of the Cold War and
because of the fears that the proposed American anti-missile
defense system would start a new international arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the United States _ which last fall saw the Senate
reject another crucial accord, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty _
is seen as setting a bad example for other countries that can now
cite political pressures for refusing to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration's legacy is the re-legitimating of
nuclear weapons after the end of the Cold War,'' said Daniel
Plesch, director of the British American Security Information
Council, an independent research group in Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan, which tested nuclear weapons in 1998, and
Israel, which is assumed to have nuclear arms, were also criticized
Monday as some conference delegates demanded they adhere to the
nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the focus of the conference. The
treaty, which came into effect in 1970, has been ratified by 187
countries. Only four _ India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba _ have
refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear testing has no place on our planet,'' said Brian
Cowen, Ireland's foreign minister. ``The time to rid the world of
these weapons is now.'' Nuclear arms are the only weapons of mass
destruction not banned by international treaties. The United States
and Russia have the majority of the world's nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen's speech was one of the day's toughest, but his sentiments
were echoed by other governments, independent arms control groups
and former American arms control officials. Republicans in
Congress, including Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have been especially harsh
in attacking international arms control agreements, and independent
experts say they are puzzled by this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What appears anomalous to me is that historically, the
Republican Party has led in the area of arms control
strengthening,'' said Jonathan Granoff, co-chairman of the American
Bar Association's committee on arms control and disarmament, said
in an interview Monday. ``The scuttling of arms control through
ballistic missile defense or through the undermining of the
commitment to nuclear disarmament contained in the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty is against the heritage of the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Graham Jr., who was the Clinton administration's special
representative for arms control from 1994 to 1997 and is president
of the independent Lawyers' Alliance for World Security, says that
much of the annoyance with the United States stems from commitments
all nuclear powers made five years ago to work harder on
eliminating nuclear weapons in return for international agreement
to make the nuclear nonproliferation treaty permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many non-nuclear weapons states _ particularly nonaligned
countries, but also some Western countries, indeed even some NATO
countries _ believe that the nuclear weapons states have not lived
up to commitments that they made in exchange for everyone else
agreeing'' to make the treaty permanent, Graham said. ``If that
doesn't change over the next few years, it could have a very
negative effect on the long-term viability'' of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conference here is focused on the treaty to halt
the spread of nuclear weapons, much attention was also given Monday
to the perceived threats to the antimissile accord.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative, speaking for the
European Union, called the ABM treaty ``one of the pillars of
strategic stability'' and said it must be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan also joined in voicing concerns
about the disruptive potential of a missile defense system _
without mentioning the United States _ when he said in a speech
opening the conference Monday morning that ``it could well lead to
a new arms race.''

A BARRAGE OF NEWS RELEASES FROM THE SENATE CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement Monday
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's characterization of the federal
agents who seized Elian Gonzalez as ``storm troopers'' was
``extreme and unwarranted,'' and that he was exploiting the
6-year-old boy for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded by saying it was Clinton who was exploiting
the issue, and that on matters of immigration, ``I'm one of the
people that probably understands this area better than most people
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after federal agents seized the Cuban boy from
relatives at gunpoint in Miami's Little Havana, Elian has become
one of the more furious sources of contention in the United States
Senate campaign in New York. Monday, the two sides industriously
issued no less than four separate news releases, and Giuliani
appeared at a news conference excoriating ``Fidel Castro, Bill
Clinton and Janet Reno'' _ he repeated the three names three times
_ and the agents' use of force. ``The action was unprecedented and
unconscionable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides began the day by issuing her statement from her
campaign headquarters in Manhattan while she was at the White House
as hostess of her eighth, and last, Easter Egg Roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relieved that Elian has been reunited with his father,''
Clinton said in her first remarks since Saturday's raid, pointing
out that the action ``was accomplished rapidly and without
injury.'' She also said, ``At a time that cried out for healing,
the mayor chose to exploit this situation by making divisive
attacks on the United States law enforcement officers.'' She
concluded, in an obvious reference to Giuliani's temperament and
his recent heated statements from behind a podium, ``It is time for
all of us to take a deep breath and allow Elian and his father to
spend time together outside of the media and political spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded at a news conference at Brooklyn College
after a graduation ceremony for 292 New York City firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's finally emerged _ good!'' he said sarcastically of
Clinton, who was at the White House and Camp David, Md., with the
president and their daughter, Chelsea, last weekend. When a
reporter offered to read Clinton's statement for Giuliani, the
mayor cut him off. ``I don't really care what she said,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor then began a nearly 15-minute monologue about the
case, including recollections of his time as the third-ranking
official at the Justice Department in the Reagan administration. As
associate attorney general, Giuliani was in charge of drug
enforcement, prisons and immigration. ``So this is not a new issue
for me,'' he said. He repeated his contention that Elian should be
granted asylum from a totalitarian government, and added that New
York City would never remove a child in a custody case in such a
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use machine guns, we don't use people dressed up in
war armament,'' Giuliani said. He did not repeat the term ``storm
troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a nonpartisan
group representing 17,500 federal agents and officers, issued a
news release Monday expressing their ``strong disgust'' with the
characterization and saying that anyone who used the word ``storm
trooper'' owed the officers an apology.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, supporters of Clinton were busily turning out
their own documents against the Republican mayor. Aides in the
office of City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat,
provided City Hall reporters with a copy of a 1995 Daily News
article describing ``Any Time Baby,'' a 50,000-pound armored
personnel carrier that was used by the police department to evict
squatters from three buildings on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   City Council aides also made available to reporters a letter,
dated Monday, to the mayor from Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn, a
Manhattan Democrat, who wrote that she was ``surprised'' to hear
about Giuliani's ``newfound concern'' about the use of excessive
force by law enforcement. Quinn said Giuliani's statements were
``somewhat at odds'' with his record, and mentioned in particular a
1998 World AIDS Day vigil at City Hall in which participants were
watched by sharpshooters on the roof of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Howard Wolfson, Clinton's spokesman, said the mayor was
using his criticism of Fidel Castro to appeal to conservative
voters, and challenged the mayor not to refer to Elian in future
fund-raising letters. Although one of Giuliani's aides said over
the weekend that the mayor's recent statements about Elian on
national television had nothing to do with fund-raising, his
campaign staff has readily acknowledged in the past that Giuliani's
television appearances do in fact bolster his fund-raising.
Giuliani has raised $19 million so far.

CONNECTICUT HOUSE APPROVES RAISING MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The Connecticut House of Representatives
approved a compromise bill Monday that would raise the state's
minimum wage by 55 cents over two years, to $6.70 an hour by 2002.
The State Senate is likely to vote on the increase later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed by a 99-to-45 vote in the
Democratic-controlled House, is a watered-down version of a
Democratic proposal that would have increased the state's minimum
hourly wage to $6.75 beginning Jan. 1, which would have made it the
highest minimum wage in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In hope of ensuring the bill's approval by the Senate, which has
a slight Democratic majority, and by Gov. John Rowland, a
Republican, House Democrats proposed a less ambitious increase. The
bill passed Monday would raise the state's $6.15 minimum wage by 25
cents an hour on Jan. 1 and 30 cents more in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minimum wage does not meet basic needs,'' said Rep.
Christopher G. Donovan, a Democrat from Meriden, who defended the
bill against several Republican attacks on the House floor. ``It's
time to make an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Oregon have the highest minimum wages _ $6.50 an
hour _ and the Massachusetts minimum will increase to $6.75 in July
2001. In New York and New Jersey, the minimum is the same as that
set by the federal government: $5.15.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut House also added provisions to its bill
specifying who would be eligible for the increases. Tip-earning
hotel and restaurant workers, who are paid a lower minimum wage of
$4.70 a hour, would not be eligible for the increase. But
Connecticut bartenders, whose minimum wage is $6.15, would be.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLIP, N.Y. _ As a high school varsity football player, Dennis
Fleming waited impatiently for afternoon practice to end so he
could sneak off and snort heroin.
</P>
<P>
   After being expelled from school for assaulting another student
_ ``I split his head,'' Fleming said _ he indulged his appetite for
drugs full time. He was arrested several times for burglary and car
theft, spent a Christmas in jail and drove his mother to the brink
of despair, all for the sake of his next fix.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming is one of a small number of suburban teen-agers who have
become addicted to heroin after experimenting with it at
increasingly younger ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was doing was wrong,'' Fleming, 18, said when he
returned recently to East Islip High School to tell other students
about his ordeal. ``I felt suicidal. But the easiest way for me to
deal with it was to run to my drug of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroin use by teen-agers does not yet amount to a national
epidemic. But the average age at which heroin users first try the
drug has been dropping in the last decade for several reasons, drug
treatment specialists and law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin is easier than ever to find. Its falling price puts it
within reach of a teen-ager's allowance. Its unprecedented purity
allows users to avoid using needles and to snort it. And its
popularity, sociologists say, has shifted from the inner city to
the suburbs, where few teen-agers have witnessed the damage that
heroin can do.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers are still more likely to use alcohol and marijuana
than heroin. ``It may have more the quality of a fad than anything
else,'' said Dr. David F. Musto, a medical historian at Yale
University. ``There isn't the atmosphere supporting heroin use that
there was in the late 60s and early 70s.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem has produced overdoses and arrests in suburban
pockets around the country, from New York to Delaware, Florida and
Texas. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has scheduled
a hearing on May 9 by the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics
to look into heroin use by suburban adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Although popular culture has been blamed for making heroin look
glamorous to adolescents, drug treatment specialists call such an
explanation simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   And more than a few parents have been deceived into thinking
that their children could not possibly be using heroin because they
do not look like addicts. Dennis Fleming's mother never expected
him to wind up addicted, she said, because he played Little League
baseball for so many years. ``I was never ever aware he had done
heroin,'' Christine Fleming said. ``I didn't know the symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroin's attraction for adolescents has little to do with
personality traits, said Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, a child
psychiatrist who is president of Phoenix House, a nationwide
network of drug treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for us, as we get older, to forget how powerful peer
pressure is and how needy kids are to have friends and the
acceptance of their friends,'' Rosenthal said. ``If they are pained
and drugs are available, and if they fall into a peer group where
drugs are the currency, it's really going to stack the deck against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fleming and nine other adolescents from Long Island
discussed their heroin addictions in a series of interviews, they
said they were not lured astray by music or other pop influences.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, who were undergoing drug treatment at Phoenix
Academy, a program run by Phoenix House in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., and at
Outreach Project in Brentwood, N.Y., blamed stress in school or at
home for their heroin use. ``I felt it was easier to handle the
pressure when I was high,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, in answering questions, said they came from broken
or troubled homes, lacked self-esteem or felt depressed, and craved
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt what I was doing was the cool thing, to hang out with
my crowd,'' said Fleming, whose addiction landed him in treatment
at Phoenix Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Some teen-agers reported finding heroin for sale alongside the
designer drug Ecstasy at raves _ all-night underground dance
parties. ``I was going to underground raves,'' Fleming said. ``It
would be like a real zombie fest.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teen-agers admitted that they did not like heroin at
first, but feared balking in front of their friends. When Michael
Nevins, 17, of Lindenhurst, was introduced to heroin on his 13th
birthday, he recalled, ``I was throwing up all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroin is plentiful around New York, law enforcement officials
say, because it is funneled by Colombian traffickers who undercut
Asian suppliers by offering a purer product. The high purity has
enticed adolescents who flinch at the notion of pricking a vein
with a needle, but will sniff heroin under the misconception that
breathing it into their lungs is less addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, medical director of the National Center
on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, estimated
that at least half the sniffers wound up injecting their heroin as
tolerance developed for it. ``There's a myth out there that you
can't die and you can't get addicted if you're snorting,'' Kleber
said.
</P>
<P>
   With heroin cheaper than ever, users themselves say, a bag
supplying a single potent high averages about $10, or less than the
cost of a movie ticket with popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lifestyle goes on and people don't see it,'' said Megan, a
baby-faced 16-year-old who spoke on the condition that her last
name and hometown be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Megan was 14 when she started sniffing heroin because, she said,
``a lot of people that I know got high and they looked like they
were enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she turned 15, Megan said, she was skipping school and
consuming six to eight bags of heroin a day. Even in treatment at
Outreach Project, she found it hard to see herself as an addict.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of a real junkie, I think of somebody sitting in
a corner with a needle in their arm,'' Megan said.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City region, suburban adolescents, a
predominantly white group, are now more likely to be seduced by
heroin than urban teen-agers, many of whom are black and have
rejected heroin after witnessing the devastation it has wreaked
among their elders, according to Travis Wendel, a sociologist at
John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``There's a whole lack of
generational memory with the white kids,'' Wendel said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest survey by the New York State Office of
Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, conducted in 1998, about
3.5 percent of 198,000 Long Island students interviewed in the
seventh through 12th grades acknowledged trying heroin. Two percent
said they had done so in the last 30 days, and 1 percent _ nearly
2,000 students _ admitted to being heavy heroin users.
</P>
<P>
   Gwenn Lee, the office's communications director, said the
numbers for Westchester County were comparable. ``Our biggest
problems are in Westchester and the Island,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York City, the same survey found that a smaller share
of adolescents had tried heroin _ 2.6 percent of 527,000
adolescents in the 7th through 12th grades, with 0.9 percent saying
they used it in the previous 30 days and 0.6 percent acknowledging
heavy use.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the Monitoring the Future Study at the University of
Michigan has tracked heroin use among high school and junior high
students since 1975. The yearly survey by the university's
Institute for Social Research showed that heroin use by high school
seniors went from 2.2 percent of the seniors sampled in 1975 to
below 1 percent in 1991, only to rebound to about 2 percent in
1997, where it has pretty much stayed. But the latest survey,
released last December, found that although 2 percent of high
school seniors had reported using heroin, 2.3 percent of sophomores
and eighth graders had admitted trying it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This experimentation among younger students has experts
concerned. Annual surveys of illicit drug use, conducted by the
federal government's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, show that the average age at which heroin is first
used has declined from 26.4 years in 1990 to 17.6 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert L. DuPont, a clinical professor of psychiatry at
Georgetown University Medical School, said he was seeing more
middle-class teen-agers who had casually turned to injecting
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island teen-agers interviewed said they traveled to
Brooklyn or Queens to buy heroin, and paid for it by reselling some
to friends in the suburbs at a markup. ``The only hard part was
getting a ride,'' said Anthony, 16, who asked that his last name
and town not be used.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Ruperto, 17, said he had no trouble buying heroin in
his hometown, Brentwood. ``If they told me I was too young,'' he
said, ``I'd turn around and buy from someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The adolescents scoffed at the stereotype of a predatory adult
loitering around the schoolyard to entice teen-agers into trying
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my town, the biggest seller was a 15-year-old kid who
weighed 80 pounds,'' said Simona Troisi, who is now 20. ``Sometimes
the people you cop from are younger than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers said it had been easy to deceive their parents,
who wanted to believe they were not using heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lies, that's how I got my money, lies,'' Megan said of her
costly habit. ``I'd take it from my mother, steal it from my
boyfriend. I owed people hundreds of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Troisi said her parents learned about her addiction after she
sold her father's vintage Gibson guitar for $600 to buy heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only time my mom said she ever saw my dad cry,''
she said.

TEXT OF FINAL OFFER FOR DEAL ON MOVING BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBAN-BOY-FORCE) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the final proposal from Attorney
General Janet Reno and the Justice Department to the Miami civic
leaders they were negotiating with for the reunion of Elian
Gonzalez with his father, as provided by the civic leaders:
</P>
<P>
   1. By 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 22, Elian Gonzalez will be
delivered to the Miami Federal Courthouse accompanied by Lazaro
Gonzalez's family members, where he will be in the A.G.'s custody
and guarded by U.S. marshals. The group will be driven to a hotel
for overnight accommodations. They will be guarded by U.S. marshals
and may not leave with Elian.
</P>
<P>
   2. On Saturday, April 22, Elian Gonzalez and Lazaro Gonzalez's
family will drive or fly to Washington, D.C., under escort by
U.S.M.S. and proceed to Airlie House. The child will be guarded by
U.S.M.S.
</P>
<P>
   3. Upon Juan Gonzalez's arrival at Airlie House, A.G. will
parcel Elian Gonzalez into Juan Miguel Gonzalez's care. During the
residence at Airlie, Elian Gonzalez will live with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez. Lazaro Gonzalez's family will reside at Airlie House in
separate quarters.
</P>
<P>
   4. A.G. to choose three recognized experts.
</P>
<P>
   5. The attorney general wants to ensure a smooth transition for
Elian Gonzalez from the Miami relatives to his father. To that end,
parole will be conditioned on Juan Miguel Gonzalez's agreement to
meet with members of the Lazaro Gonzalez family to meet with the
government experts, and to give those experts access to Elian
Gonzalez for appropriate evaluation. The experts shall advise the
attorney general as to what further transitional arrangements may
be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   6. The attorney general, as a condition of parole, shall direct
and appropriate transition in consultation with the government
experts, not to exceed one week.
</P>
<P>
   7. The parties will remain in residence for a period determined
by the A.G., not to exceed one week.
</P>
<P>
   8. Departure control order to be issued for Elian Gonzalez ...
to assure Elian Gonzalez remains in the United States consistent
with existing (United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit)
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   9. Lazaro Gonzalez and his family agree to waive any right to
sue Juan Gonzalez and his family with respect to the custody of
Elian Gonzalez.

KINGS, QUEENS AND SLOT MACHINES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other gamblers did not look pleased. ``Taking a card with 12
showing, and the dealer's card up is a 5!'' growled the
silver-haired man at the other end of the blackjack table. ``I'd
never, (italics)ever(end italics) do that!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling lucky,'' I explained, trying not to sound
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Dumb thing to say. The guy at my left shoulder smiled
patronizingly. ``What he's trying to tell you is, if you hadn't
asked for that card, it would have gone to the dealer, and we all
would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh. What I'd done wrong was win at the expense of everyone else.
I drew an 8 on my 12, for a total of 20, often a winning hand in
blackjack, otherwise known as 21. The dealer, it was revealed in
the tense denouement of the hand, had 15, and if I had passed and
the 8 had gone to him, his over-the-limit 23 would have meant a
payoff for the whole table. Instead he drew a 4, for a total of 19,
a victory over my fellow players.
</P>
<P>
   Sheepishly, I scooped up my chips _ a hundred dollars' worth,
the precise amount I had started with an hour and a half earlier _
and backed away from the table in the Grand Pequot Casino, the
poshest of the gambling rooms at Foxwoods, the betting mecca in
Mashantucket, Conn., eight miles north of Exit 92 of the
Connecticut Turnpike and about a two-hour drive from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Was a card game supposed to be this jaw-clenchingly
intimidating? The man on my right, who wore a large ceramic belt
buckle and a look of utter exasperation, had glanced at me
disdainfully any time I as much as hesitated during a game. ``He
doesn't want to part with his money,'' he announced when I failed
to double my bet on a 6 of clubs and 4 of diamonds I had been
dealt. In another round, he had actually commandeered my hand,
making the cutoff signal to the dealer on my pitiful behalf.
</P>
<P>
   OK I admit it. When it comes to risk, I'm no Evel Knievel, even
when it's to be taken over drinks, on green felt. We had come to
the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation for the kind of weekend we had
never spent: my wife and I were gambling babes-in-the-Foxwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'd been to Las Vegas a couple of times, and had lost all
of $90 on the slots. As for Val, her idea of a madcap betting
impulse was tickets to a movie we hadn't read about first. Our
chromosomes seemed to be short the gene for blowing large amounts
of money on games of chance. So we had to know: was it possible for
us to find the music that so many others hear, to swing for a
couple of days to the beat of clinking coins?
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a place to find out, it was Foxwoods, the
impossibly vast, turquoise-roofed casino-resort that rises over the
New England countryside like a multitiered mountain of cash.
Foxwoods is to wagering what San Simeon is to tract houses: simply
overwhelming in scale. ``Oh my God, it's huge,'' Val said, as we
approached the complex on Route 2. Minutes earlier, we had passed a
herd of grazing sheep on the two-lane highway that links the casino
with I-95, just west of the Rhode Island line. Now, a contemporary
palace loomed incongruously in the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Foxwoods, opened by the tribe in February 1992 and expanded
several times since then, today occupies a total of 4.7 million
square feet. The network of casinos is connected to two hotels,
with 1,136 rooms; a 280-room inn is situated nearby. Threading
through the complex are 24 restaurants, 17 stores, a dance club,
theater and arcades: the betting parlor as mall.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Foxwoods is designed to trigger all sorts of familiar
American spending rituals. There is, after all, almost nothing else
to do there. For if Las Vegas is a neon shrine to glitz, and
Atlantic City a dowdy hybrid of grime and show biz, Foxwoods
represents the suburbanization of casino culture. All it seems to
lack is a Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly doesn't lack crowds. (Foxwoods estimates that
40,000 people visit daily.) When I tried to make a hotel
reservation in early March, I was told no rooms were available
until late April. I went to the Foxwoods Web site and found other
recommended places to stay, including a Hilton in Mystic, a
20-minute drive from the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring that the Mystic Seaport, a popular tourist destination
in its own right, would be an additional diversion, we booked a
room at the Hilton on the ``executive level.'' For a $20 surcharge
we got Continental breakfast, a newspaper at the door, and a few
other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, across the street from the Mystic Aquarium, met our
weekender specs: well-run, quiet, comfortable. A staff member
actually called to ask if the room-service breakfast was up to
snuff. The coffee was great, we felt compelled to report. The
Hilton, which is owned by the tribe, also offered shuttle service
to Foxwoods: on the weekend we were there early this month, the
shuttle ran every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   From New York City, we made the trip to Mystic at the tail end
of a Friday evening rush in about three hours, including a stop for
dinner. The drive from Mystic to Foxwoods on Saturday morning,
along a country road lined with ivy-covered trees, was not the
car-clogged nightmare I was imagining, and it was easy to find a
spot in the garage underneath the newest hotel in the complex, the
Grand Pequot Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Up the elevator to the casino level. The wide, coldly appointed
walkways had that unmistakable Mall of America feel. ``It sort of
reminds me of the Orlando Airport,'' Val said. The Indian flavor
was minimal; here and there were reminders of the casino's
proprietorship, as in the booths marked Wampum Club, the casino's
players club. (It reminded us that we really should pay a visit to
the new Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, just down
the road, to learn something about the tribe.)
</P>
<P>
   The casino attire was retirement-village casual _ the average
age was about 60 _ and everywhere there were men in sweatsuits and
women in sneakers and windbreakers. Some visitors brought their
children, who were scrupulously kept from the casinos by the
security people.
</P>
<P>
   Many gamblers had arrived on the charter buses that pulled in
and out of Foxwoods' own depot in endless rotation. The visitors'
props of choice were little plastic buckets (the better to lug your
quarters in) and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about nicotine and slot machines? The place was
bathed in eau d'ashtray. I gazed at the casino map _ you
(italics)needed(end italics) a map _ and noticed a zone marked
``Nonsmoking gaming tables.'' Val charted a course for slots in the
fresher air.
</P>
<P>
   I took a wrong turn at the Food Court and ended up at the doors
of a room that looked as if it were built to hold a fleet of 747s.
But no, it was just the Foxwoods bingo hall, with seating for
3,200. Enough bingo for the entire population of Moonachie, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   My destination, however, was video poker. If baccarat is the
sort of abstract expressionism of casino gambling _ I haven't a
clue how it's played _ the slot machines are finger painting. All
you need is a dollar and a digit. You can sit at a slot for what
feels like days, pressing the maximum-bet button and watching the
dials spin.
</P>
<P>
   Video poker is a step up to gambling kindergarten, requiring
higher-level brain function: you have to press multiple buttons
after deciding whether to hold the cards the machine deals you.
</P>
<P>
   I was prepared to part with $400. I also wanted the money to
last the weekend, and I thought that electronic poker could be an
entertaining and low-pressure introduction. Foxwoods has a normal
Vegas-style assortment of gambling distractions: craps tables,
roulette, keno, betting on the horses. There was even a New England
regional poker tournament. My inclination was to lose my money as
anonymously as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But first, I had to find a slot machine, and on this Saturday
afternoon, that was no safe bet. The 25- and 50-cent slots were
standing room only everywhere I turned. In some instances, single
bettors were hogging two machines. Wheelchairs were maneuvered next
to machines at awkward angles; one man was wandering around with
what looked to be a portable IV drip, a plastic tube protruding
from his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Some players, apparently fearful of forgetting their Wampum Club
cards, inserted them in the machine with plastic cords affixed to
their sweaters, like umbilical cords.
</P>
<P>
   I finally settled into a 25-cent video poker machine in the
middle of a long row, breaking one of the rules passed on to me by
a slots-crazed acquaintance: try for a machine on the end, because
it gets more traffic and thus has more cash to dispense. Stay with
one machine and be patient, she also advised.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea whether these were wagering facts or fiction, and
I had no chance to try out some of the strategies. End machines
were as hard to come by as summer rentals with ocean views.
</P>
<P>
   The captivating fog of money-lust enveloped me. I looked at my
watch, and an hour had been consumed, then two, along with $125.
I'd been up $25, down $100, down $150, up, down, up, down. The man
and woman next to me deftly balanced cigarettes between their
fingers as they worked the buttons. Four aces flashed on my screen,
and then 45 minutes of nothing. The man irritated me with his
squeals of delight every time he won. The woman's teeth clicked.
Another man walked by, inserted $5 in a machine, quickly lost it,
and left. Ha! Amateur! Somewhere, jackpot bells rang and quarters
dropped like hail. But not for me.
</P>
<P>
   I rendezvoused with Val outside the smoke-free slots area. She
was skipping. ``I won $56,'' she said, sounding so merry I could
spit. ``How nice for you,'' I said, smiling through gritted teeth.
</P>
<P>
   We had a late lunch in the Bistro at Foxwoods, the casino's
designated nonsmoking restaurant. I was grumpy, but the Bistro chef
revived my spirits. Mixed greens doused in a chianti vinaigrette
and stuffed sea bass on a bed of orzo was a dandy consolation. A
shrimp cocktail also arrived, fresh and appetizing, each crustacean
on its own lemon slice, followed by an architecturally ambitious
presentation of beef tournedos. With wine and tip, the meal came to
about $90.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to video poker. We made another vow to get in some
culture; we really should stop by the Indian museum. But first, I
had to play another $50 bill in my wallet that seemed to cry out:
Go ahead. Bet me.
</P>
<P>
   For the evening, Foxwoods was presenting the Charlie Daniels
Band. Pass. (Willie Nelson was to perform the following weekend;
Harvey Korman and Tim Conway, Olivia Newton-John and Kenny Rogers
were scheduled for May.) Foxwoods fatigue was setting in fast. We
got in the car, drove to Mystic and relaxed before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The historic village is compact and crowded with small
boutiques. In the late afternoon, families were out for strolls and
poking their heads in the children's clothing and toy stores. That
evening, we meandered through a long, leisurely meal down by the
Seaport at the Capt. Daniel Packer Inne on Water Street, around the
corner from Mystic Pizza: littleneck clams baked in boursin cheese,
fresh shrimp with a hot sauce, yellowfin tuna, duck, a dazzling
chocolate cake with ganache and butter cream and a bottle of
chardonnay came to about $110 with tip.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning was overcast. I got dressed quickly and early,
stepped over the fat Sunday paper at our door, and headed for the
car, jacks and kings and aces swimming in my head. Val had had
enough; betting the 401(k)s was not her vice, so she lingered over
the paper on a lounge chair by the hotel's heated pool.
</P>
<P>
   I hardly noticed the cigarettes all around me now, as I located
a machine in the Grand Pequot Casino and started feeding it 50s. In
no time _ well actually, about two and a half hours; I was afraid
to get up for fear of losing my spot _ I was down $180. I would
have stayed longer, but I had run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ATMs, of course, were installed for my convenience on the
betting floor. I retrieved a C-note and headed for my date with the
seething denizens of that blackjack table. When I left the table
later that afternoon, with enough money in my pocket for lunch and
gas and tolls on the Triborough Bridge, I felt as if I had made it
through a hazing ritual. I even entertained the idea of a return
trip. After all, we never did get to that Indian museum.

POLICE SAY SUSPECT SHED CUFFS AND STOLE VAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A prostitution suspect who was left unattended in a
police department van managed to slip through handcuffs early
Monday and escape to New Jersey with the van and an officer's
ammunition and bulletproof vest, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the suspect, Tacoma Hopps, 35, was wanted
as a parole violator from Georgia and decided to try to escape
rather than being returned to jail.
</P>
<P>
   If that was her plan, it failed. The police said Hopps, who is
also known as Precious or Dimples, was recaptured after she left
the van at a strip mall and set off shoeless down a highway in
Secaucus, N.J., carrying the vest, handcuffs and a magazine of
hollow-point bullets, all inside a green duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged in New Jersey with possession of stolen
property, possession of handcuffs, possession of hollow-point
bullets and with being a fugitive. She was ordered held at the
Hudson County Jail and was awaiting extradition to New York to face
charges of prostitution, auto theft and escape.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Hopps' misadventure began at 2:15 a.m. at 10th
Avenue and West 46th Street, when she solicited an undercover
officer. As arrests go, it was routine: Two officers from a
Manhattan South vice enforcement unit handcuffed her wrists behind
her back and placed her in the rear seat of an unmarked Ford van.
</P>
<P>
   But a few minutes later, when the officers stepped from the van
to pick up another suspect, they left the keys in the ignition, the
police said. Hopps climbed into the front seat and drove away,
heading south down Ninth Avenue for the Lincoln Tunnel, they said.
</P>
<P>
   How she slipped from the cuffs remained a mystery. ``It appears
she is very agile with her hands,'' said Sgt. Andrew T. McInnis, a
Police Department spokesman. Hopps was next seen shortly after 3
a.m., walking barefoot along Route 3 in Secaucus, said Lt. John
Buckley, head of detectives at the Secaucus Police Department. She
was arrested after officers saw the police equipment in the bag.
Later, the Secaucus police found the van at a strip mall parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Hopps, who told the police that her most recent address was the
Royal Motel in Secaucus, has been arrested repeatedly since the
1980s on drug and prostitution charges, the police said. McInnis
said the circumstances surrounding her arrest Monday were being
reviewed to determine whether the vice officers should face
disciplinary charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prisoners are not to be left alone, barring unique
circumstances,'' he said. ``The officers' actions, and the
incident, are under investigation.''

E-MAIL MYSTERY KEY TO TEXAS A&AMP;M STUDENT'S DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ill.) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Local and state authorities are trying to identify the
mysterious ``Kelly'' who assured the parents of a Texas A&AMP;M
University student that their son was fine even after he had been
killed and his body dumped on a Central Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
   E-mails sent by someone claiming to be Texas A&AMP;M junior Kerry J.
Kujawa said that he would be back in several days. But authorities
believe that Kujawa may have been dead since shortly after he left
College Station on April 7 to go to San Antonio to help Kelly, whom
he met on the Internet. The last several e-mails were sent several
days later. All of the correspondence was sent from Kelly's e-mail
address.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, authorities confiscated the computers of Kujawa, his
parents and others in an effort to find Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that by locating the individual they can learn who
shot Kujawa once in the back of the head with a small-caliber
weapon, leaving his body without shoes or socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bizarre and unusual case, very bizarre,'' said
Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vingar.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is said to have self-identified as a girl with boyfriend
problems, said Texas A&AMP;M University police director Bob Wiatt.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kujawa _ a slender, humorous, 20-year-old
mechanical engineering student from Richmond _ did not have a
girlfriend, said his mother, Lucille Kujawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made one bad decision in his life _ and this is it,'' the
mother said. ``He was a very sweet boy. He didn't deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kujawa didn't return to the Texas A&AMP;M campus, family and
friends weren't concerned because they were receiving e-mails,
supposedly from Kujawa, assuring them that he was all right, Wiatt
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the e-mails usually ended with: ``I'll be back in a few
days, everything is okay. Don't worry, I'm still taking care of
Kelly.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails were sent from Kelly's Internet account, Wiatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on April 20, after friends raised concerns, the adviser
at Kujawa's college dormitory filed a missing-person report with
campus police, Wiatt said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Dr. Elizabeth Peacock of the Travis County Medical
Examiner's Office used dental records to identify a body found on a
ranch just off Pursley Road west of Dripping Springs as that of
Kujawa.
</P>
<P>
   The badly decomposed body was found by someone on the ranch
looking for the cause of a foul odor, Hays County Justice of the
Peace Rex Baker said. Baker and others estimated that the body had
been there for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   While Kujawa said he was going to San Antonio, it is unclear
whether he got there and, if so, how. Nor can officials explain how
he came to the Central Texas area where his body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Kujawa's 1990 Ford Probe was found at Easterwood Airport in
College Station, having been in the long-term parking lot since
April 10, the Monday he promised to return after a weekend trip to
San Antonio, Wiatt said.
</P>
<P>
   A review of airport records indicates that Kujawa did not take a
flight from the airport during the weekend of April 7, Wiatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the investigation includes campus police, the Hays County
Sheriff's Department and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing that he was going to San Antonio is just part
of what we're looking into,'' said DPS spokesman Vingar. ``We're
looking at other things. This investigation is wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   However, finding Kelly through the e-mail address is a key,
Wiatt said. But that could be easier said than done, a Houston
computer expert said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Lee, who hosts the weekly radio show ``Technology Bytes''
for Pacifica, said law enforcement officials first will match the
computer files of those who received e-mails from Kelly with
Kelly's Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   If they are lucky, Lee said, that will lead them to the computer
of the so-called Kelly. Lee said a similar effort helped officials
break a child pornography case.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is easy and common for people to mask their
identities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lee said, Kelly could have given the Internet provider
incorrect identity and address information.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, though some computer searches will indicate the
telephone number from which Kelly sent the reassuring e-mails, the
sender could have masked that information or used a different
telephone line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it is possible for someone to steal the Internet access of
another, and send e-mails on that account. Proving that the owner
of an e-mail address is the same person who sent an e-mail can be
difficult without corresponding evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to make it hard to be found on the Internet,
that can be done,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Kujawa said the family hopes to have a funeral service
Thursday at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Richmond, where their
son was an usher. He is survived by his parents, John and Lucille
Kujawa of Richmond, and a brother, Kraig Kujawa of Lombard, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Kujawa said her son was the neighborhood's ``fix-it
man'' and could repair almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was 11 years old, he took down a ceiling fan and put
up a new one,'' she said. ``At first, I was upset, because he was
messing with electrical wires. But then, I was amazed because he
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kujawa was a national merit scholar who graduated sixth among
more than 500 seniors at Austin High School in 1998. He won the
district junior varsity championship in the 1600 meters as a high
school sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Lucille Kujawa saw her son was March 19, at the
end of spring break, which he spent putting in the base for a
storage shed the family was building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had expected to see him again at Easter,'' she said.

DEBATE ON MIAMI RAID RIDES ON WHETHER DEAL WAS NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes ``Monday'' to ``Today'' in 4th graf. Corrects 1st
reference to Eric H. Holder in graf that begins ``Craig complained
...'') 
By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In three minutes on Saturday morning, the national
debate over who should have custody of Elian Gonzalez was replaced
by a much more intense dispute over whether Attorney General Janet
Reno had acted wisely in ordering the 6-year-old boy seized by
armed agents in a pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday that dispute was intensified by comments from the
White House and from Congress, and by the release of documents from
both sides in the nightlong negotiations over the child, documents
that hardly differed in words but were separated by a chasm of
conflicting interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiations were proceeding,'' four Miami civic leaders
maintained in a statement issued Monday afternoon. ``They had not
broken down. People were acting in good faith. Progress was finally
happening after the months of stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno, interviewed on the NBC News television program
``Today,'' said, ``We just kept getting mixed signals from a family
that had given us hope and then pulled it back, said they would
comply with the law and then said on several occasions that we
would have to take the child by force.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gregory B. Craig, lawyer for Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, said in an interview, ``We were, as far as I can tell,
never close to an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing from either side on Monday definitively settled the
question of whether the Justice Department's efforts to broker a
deal between the families Gonzalez could ever have succeeded. And
for all the complaints over the raid's being done in darkness, or
over the arms carried by the agents, that had been the central
question before Reno.
</P>
<P>
   And as Friday night wore on into Saturday morning, the biggest
difference _ untouched as progress was made over times, places and
conditions _ was over trust, and that may have been too broad a gap
to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Craig said, the attorney general told Juan
Miguel Gonzalez that she did not want to have to send people in to
take Elian out by force. Gonzalez objected, telling her the Miami
relatives would never give in. ``They are never going to give up
the boy voluntarily,'' and every day's delay makes things worse,
Craig quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Miami relatives said they did not believe
that the father and the government would keep their word to have
the boy stay in the country until a judicial appeal decided the
asylum issue surrounding his case.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the Justice Department completely open with both sides.
While Reno spoke of deadlines to the Miami leaders, especially
Aaron Podhurst, a lawyer she has known well for many years, she did
not let them know a raid was imminent. Podhurst complained Monday
that she had led him to put two of the other civic leaders, Carlos
M. de la Cruz and Carlos Saldriga, ``in harm's way'' by sending
them to the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, where the raid was
nearly at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when she met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Craig on
Friday afternoon, she did not tell them she had been in touch with
the Miamians _ who also included Edward T. Foote II, president of
the University of Miami _ since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But she did disclose the overture at some point that day,
telling Craig she was going to explore the Miamians' efforts. Craig
says he told her he had no confidence that the Miami relatives had
more in mind ``than a ploy to take us through Easter and into next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he told her that he and Gonzalez were ready to go to
Miami themselves to get the boy (for the Miami relatives' lawyers
had said that was all they needed to do), and she told him not to
do anything rash.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he asked the attorney general to get him something
in writing if she expected him to take anything from the Miami
relatives seriously. She asked the Miami civic leaders for
something concrete, in a document, and they faxed her a one-page
proposal about 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That document, which was never given directly to Craig, proposed
that the two families live together ``in a mutually agreed, neutral
site in Miami-Dade County.'' Except for marshals to guard them, the
Gonzalez clans would have no one around other than a neutral
facilitator ``to help the family members get together and do what
is in the best interest of the child.'' Their lawyers would be
barred. This arrangement would be maintained until all legal
proceedings were ended.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal from the Miamians also included this sentence:
``We understand that you have transferred temporary custody of
Elian to his father.'' Podhurst maintained Monday that this had
conceded the custody question. Craig said that it had not done so
satisfactorily and that the open-ended joint living arrangement had
muddled the question of who could legally speak for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:58 p.m., Craig received a different proposal from the
Justice Department, apparently a product of the department's talks
with the Miami leaders about what might be acceptable to Juan
Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal moved the venue for the joint living arrangements
from Florida to Airlie House, a conference center in the Washington
suburbs. But that concession was not enough for Gonzalez, who
returned from dinner to Craig's office, or for Craig, who said he
thought the open-ended joint living arrangements were a mistake. He
also said a provision for the Miami leaders to nominate a new team
of experts to advise on how to deal with Elian was thoroughly
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also suggested that there would be conditions on
the father's custody; Craig said there had been no conditions on
Lazaro Gonzalez's temporary custody, so he asked why new ones were
being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:53 Justice sent another proposal. It softened the
suggestions of new custody conditions, and made it clear that while
both families would live at Airlie House, they would have separate
living quarters. But the timing was still an issue, and Craig said
none of the joint arrangements should exceed one week.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department kept talking with the Miami leaders, who
kept talking to the family of Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After those talks, at 2:10 a.m., Justice faxed another draft to
Craig. It gave him most of what he had demanded, including a 3:30
a.m. turnover of the boy to U.S. marshals at the federal courthouse
in Miami. It dropped the plan for nomination of a new group of
experts. And most important of all, it limited the joint residence
arrangement to a one-week period of transition in Elian's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Craig complained Monday that the one-week limitation had not
been included in another section, which allowed the attorney
general to direct the conditions of the transition period. Eric H.
Holder, the deputy attorney general, agreed to add it, but not to
insert another section that Craig sought, declaring Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's right to ``challenge the reasonableness of any condition
imposed under this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder asked Craig to wake up his client and get him to agree.
Craig said he told Holder to ``sell it to them first.'' But, he
said Monday, he would have tried to persuade his client to agree,
and at about 2:50 a.m., he told Holder to ``proceed as if we had
agreed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That same draft, with the one-week limitation, was faxed to
Miami at 2:59 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   From here on, the accounts diverge. The Miami group insists that
it was making progress. But Craig says he was told the Miamians
were now changing their minds about letting Elian go to the
Washington area, suggesting instead White Oak Plantation on the
Georgia-Florida border.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Monday that she told Podhurst ``at about 4 in the
morning that we had run out of time, because we kept getting mixed
signals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues,'' she said ``was where would the families
meet. And the father did not want to come to Miami, because of the
tension and the tense atmosphere in Miami.'' She said Podhurst
``said that was a deal-breaker, and so we agreed that we had tried
our best.''
</P>
<P>
   With immigration agents on their way to raid Lazaro Gonzalez's
home, Reno talked to Podhurst again at 4:21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us remember it vividly,'' she said Monday. ``And he
said, `Could I have just five minutes?' And I said, `Five minutes.'
``And he said, `That means 4:26.' And I said, `That's right.' He
continued to keep me on the phone, and I kept on the phone because
I wanted to try to do everything I could. But we did not feel like
we could delay any longer, because the action was carefully timed.
And if it did not go forward at this time, it would be very
difficult in the future to effect a safe extrication of the little
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation unfinished, she put Podhurst on hold when the
raid began. When she picked up the phone again, he shouted angrily
at her. She cried, according to Podhurst and Holder, who said he
put his arms around her.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Miami leaders' statement said, ``We were
completely surprised and astonished that the government would
resort to armed marshals when we were so close to agreement,
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said: ``The attorney general stretched and pushed and
waited and tried as hard as she possibly could. I thought, prior to
her decision to go in, that she had been paralyzed by the
worst-case scenario. To accuse the attorney general of being
precipitous is, with all due respect, preposterous.''

NOW, AS THEN, WAR RESISTER IS PERSISTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even before climbing the flight of well-worn stairs,
you could tell from a sign in the front window that you were
entering the offices of the War Resisters League. ``End
terrorism,'' it announced to anyone who looked up from Lafayette
Street in Greenwich Village. ``Disarm the Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things do not change. That goes for the War Resisters
League, steadfastly finding reasons to condemn American military
policies at a time when dissent is not exactly rife in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Another constant is David McReynolds, who was standing at the
top of the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds has been with the league for four decades. During the
long Vietnam War, he was its field secretary, meaning he was a
point man on the protest campaigns of those days. Now, at 70, his
beard steely gray, he is technically retired. The key word seems to
be ``technically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we have a title for me,'' he said. ``I'm an
emeritus of some kind. I'll have to ask someone up front what my
title is.''
</P>
<P>
   He never got around to it. Too many distractions got in the way,
including a conversation about why he is running for president as
the candidate of the Socialist Party USA.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he can't win (though he hopes for more than the 6,720
votes that he got the last time he ran, in 1980). Why bother?
Because, McReynolds replied, there's a new generation of students
out there looking for answers that they will never hear from the
major parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to feel there is a reason to take part in
political life,'' he said, adding that he had been ``very
well-received'' on his visits to college campuses. ``I sort of keep
waiting to be heckled,'' he said. He figures that his age protects
him.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for calling on McReynolds was to talk less about his
campaign than about Vietnam, which is with us once more as we near
the 25th anniversary of the war's end, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No backward glance would be complete without examining the
antiwar movement. And few of its generals, if one may give a
military rank to a devoted pacifist, stood front and center more
than David McReynolds _ at the draft-card burnings and repeated
demonstrations that ultimately helped build a critical mass of
domestic opposition to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   It bothers him, he admits, that the movement's role is receding
into the mists of history. ``The whole thing has sunk into a memory
hole,'' he said. ``But I accept that. It's 25 years ago. It's
another century. It's farther away from young people than World War
I was when I was a student. But it is important for people to go
back and look at the history and understand what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In some circles, it is fashionable to dismiss the 60s protests
as the excesses of college students with draft deferments, pampered
kids who were in it for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll while
unfortunate sons of the poor and the working class had to take
their chances in the rice paddies and jungles.
</P>
<P>
   No question, many back then went to sit-ins and lie-ins and
teach-ins mainly because those -in's were in. And, McReynolds said,
``I'm sure there were some hippies _ who I would have slugged if I
had a chance _ who spit on soldiers.'' He can get equally worked up
about ``the ultra-militants who would so happily throw rocks at the
cops from behind our lines at demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the ``peace, love, dope'' types nor the ``off the
pigs'' screamers formed the core of the antiwar resistance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who led the movement were very courageous,'' he
said. ``Many of them went to prison. Many did go to Canada because
they had given up on this country. The guys who actually organized
the demonstrations and burned their draft cards et cetera were
taking very substantial risks they didn't need to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McReynolds added, the rest of the country caught up
with the resisters in deciding that America _ that's America with a
C, not a K _ had lost its way in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wore us out,'' he said of that era. ``I was alcoholic
during much of it. I'm not blaming the war for the alcoholism, but
I was an alcoholic.'' He stopped drinking about the time the war
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``From one point of view,'' McReynolds said, ``it was a
wonderful time _ to feel that you were doing something, or that you
shortened the war by one day, or saved one life on either side. To
some extent, we did that. Some observers don't realize how
important the Vietnam peace movement was in moving this government
to finally negotiate.''

IRAN REFORMISTS SUFFER ANOTHER SETBACK AS 12 NEWSPAPERS ARE
BANNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for extensive rewriting. In graf referring to the second
round of voting, corrects `a majority' to `a sufficient percentage
of votes.')  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Two months after their triumph in parliamentary
elections, the reformers in Iran have come under fierce pressure
from the still powerful Islamic conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners have jailed writers and annulled some election
results. And in the latest blow on Sunday, Tehran courts ordered
eight dailies and four weeklies to stop publishing immediately.
</P>
<P>
   All of the banned newspapers supported President Mohammad
Khatami, whose calls for reform of the judiciary and for open
political debate have won him broad public support, but also fierce
enemies in the clerical establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Reform leaders appealed for calm. ``We ask the Iranian nation to
keep calm and to be patient and careful about any action that could
lead to any kind of violence in society,'' pleaded one of the few
surviving reformist newspapers, Sobh-e-Emrouz.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was far different from that after the first round of
voting, when many of the reformers who are now being hounded were
exuberant about their triumph and were predicting the start of an
era of more openness and social freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But the more cautious among them also warned that conservative
forces would not passively relinquish their power over the daily
lives of Iranians and over government institutions like the courts.
</P>
<P>
   And now, those reformers say they are not surprised at the moves
against the newspapers. Many conservatives blame their poor showing
at the polls on the energetic, outspoken press that has blossomed
since Khatami's election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this was predictable,'' said Abdollah Ramezanzadeh, a
close associate of Khatami and governor of Kurdistan Province.
``And we're expecting things to get a little worse.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still no date set for a second round of voting for
Parliament, which is supposed to take office in just five weeks.
Many reformers say they are afraid that Khatami's opponents will
try to set off a backlash that would provide an excuse for greater
repression.
</P>
<P>
   They point to events in Tehran last summer, when university
students who protested the closing of a liberal newspaper were
attacked by vigilantes, sparking riots that Khatami was able to
check only with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's circumstances the reformers will be the ones to
suffer from any chaos in society,'' said Emadeddin Baghi, an editor
of one of the 12 banned newspapers, Fath. ``So it's important for
us to step back for the moment and stay calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Baghi, 39, will soon face his own test of nerves. He has been
summoned to appear in a Tehran court next Monday to answer charges
that he insulted Islamic values in articles he wrote. He said he
expects to be convicted and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a few days,'' he said of his trial, ``but the
result is already clear in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Baghi would join two other Fath editors,
Akbar Ganji and Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, in prison, as well as
Latif Safari, the publisher of another newspaper, Neshat. The three
were jailed in the last few weeks after being accused of defaming
Islam or the Iranian revolution of 1979, which overthrew the shah
and brought the Shiite Muslim clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
   Even Khatami's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, has been summoned
to court on charges of violating press guidelines at the newspaper
he helps run.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the reform movement began shortly after elections
on Feb. 18, when pro-Khatami candidates won nearly 70 percent of
the 290 parliamentary seats. The reformers appeared poised to
solidify their victory, and control of Parliament, in a second
round of voting, for constituencies where no candidate won a
sufficient percentage of votes. The second round was expected to
take place last month. But the conservative Council of Guardians,
which has final say over all legislation and many other matters,
has methodically undercut the first-round results.
</P>
<P>
   The council voided the results in 10 provincial constituencies,
saying some victors had not campaigned fairly, and announced that
it would re-examine the ballots in Tehran. Most of the voided races
were won by Khatami supporters. There are fears that the
hard-liners who control the old Parliament will not release their
grip on power and will disregard the vote entirely.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first blow struck at the reformers after the elections came
when Saeed Hajjarian, a strategist for the movement and close ally
of Khatami, was gunned down in a Tehran street. He survived, and
the assassination attempt was widely blamed on extremist groups
within the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations apparently angered Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who immediately denounced as un-Islamic
those who would besmirch the name of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks set off a series of assaults, verbal and judicial,
on the reformers. Parliament approved a restrictive press law, as
well as legislation that removes institutions like the judiciary
and military from parliamentary monitoring. Last week, 140 members
signed a petition that called a group of reformers traitors for
attending an academic conference about Iran in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   More strident attacks have come from other quarters. Hard-line
clerics have publicly called for the killing of some reformers and
accused the reform press of destroying the values of the
revolution. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a militia that
does not answer to the president, threatened to unleash what it
called ``Islamic violence'' against reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, who controls the militias, courts and official news
media, tried to cool matters, cautioning against ``illegal action''
to silence the reform movement. But he, too, has accused it of
fomenting unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attacks have clearly shaken the reformers,
Khatami's confidantes said they saw some positive aspects to the
crackdown. And they said the public's hunger for change could not
be ignored or discounted for long.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, they said the order to close the newspapers was
ostensibly based on a rarely used 1957 statute that permits the
government to arrest people or suspend an activity to prevent a
possible crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Mr. Khatami's election in 1997, they would just go to
an editor and say, `Close,''' said Ramezanzadeh, the confidant of
the president. ``This time they closed the papers according to the
law, even though the law is questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Council of Guardians had even issued explanations _
vague, but still explanations _ for voiding some of the recent
parliamentary elections. ``We live in a Third World country, yet
our opponents have dealt with us very calmly compared to what
happens in the countries around us,'' he added. ``The reform
movement has actually forced the opposition to play by the same
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a small group of university students held a protest
rally Monday, the operative attitude in the reform camp is one of
restraint. Journalists and lawyers associated with the reformers
said they would not react to the ban on their newspapers in the
same way they once did, by simply reopening a few days later with
the same staff but a different name.
</P>
<P>
   At a newsstand on Vanak Square, one of the busiest intersections
of Tehran, crowds milled in front of the slim choice of newspapers
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those papers all reported the reality of what's happening
here,'' said a woman in a black chador, or cloak, who gave her name
as Khavar. ``I don't believe much is really hidden in our country.
Even without the media, we can see. But I am worried. This is the
future of our country and whatever happens, they are punishing us,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Another disappointed newspaper buyer, who also would give only
his first name, Mehrade, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what will happen,'' he said. ``There's a crisis,
and it could be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not expect Khatami to do much to overturn the
newspaper closings or the trials of his supporters. ``He can't
perform magic,'' Mehrade said. ``You have to be able to move your
hands to perform. He can move, but very slowly.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A decade after the collapse of communism appeared to
make superpower arms controls routine, the old disputes over
missile defenses have suddenly returned to the forefront of
U.S.-Russian relations. And though experts think new rules of the
nuclear game are technically feasible, the issue has been caught up
in U.S. election politics and Russian suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the fundamental principles that Washington and
Moscow have accepted for almost three decades, that the only way to
encourage reductions in strategic arms is to restrict ways to
counter them _ an understanding codified in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But a new-found U.S. interest in developing a missile defense,
which proponents say would defend against rogue states like North
Korea and Iran, has called the treaty into question.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russia has strongly opposed any changes in the treaty.
And in recent weeks, President-elect Vladimir Putin has
strengthened his hand in the dispute by getting his Parliament to
ratify the long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty known as
START II and conditioning the accord on continued U.S. adherence to
the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans in the U.S. Senate equally adamant about
developing anti-missile defenses, resolving the dispute during
President Clinton's visit to Moscow in early June will be difficult
at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very sensitive period,'' said Anatoly Diakov, the
director of the Moscow-based Center for Arms Control and the
Environment. ``Both sides have to decide whether to support the
arms control regime or destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly heated debate is something of a surprise
because arms control had ceased to be a bitter bone of contention
in recent years. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
expectation was that the hard bargaining over warheads, missiles
and bombers was over. The two sides were no longer adversaries. And
while U.S.-Russian arms control talks often lagged, that seemed
little more than a matter of benign neglect.
</P>
<P>
   But the demise of the Soviet Union also left the United States
without a consensus on the threats that confront the nation and on
how best to reduce the risk of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers in Washington have cast the heart of old
nuclear arms controls, the ABM accord, as an anachronism, which
needs to be radically modified or abandoned altogether so the
United States can build an anti-missile shield against ``rogue''
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sought to blunt the political assault
from the right by proposing a limited defense, which would require
amending the ABM treaty, but not jettisoning it.
</P>
<P>
   Its proposal would protect all 50 states from an attack by
several dozen warheads carried by North Korean missiles or half a
dozen warheads mounted on Iranian rockets. The plan, which would be
carried out by 2005, would involve the construction of a radar in
Alaska, the deployment of 100 interceptors there and upgrades to
five existing radars.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton plan is both too little for many Republicans and
too much for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials doubt the United States would go through all
the cost and trouble of developing a national missile defense just
to counter tiny North Korea. And while the 6,000 warheads in
Russia's arsenals are more than enough to overwhelm a limited
defense, Russian officials worry that the Clinton plan would
unleash a new race to deploy anti-missile defense, which the
cash-poor Russian military is doomed to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American plan of a national missile defense is not
perceived in Russia as something that is justified by the North
Korean or Iranian nuclear programs,'' said Sergei Rogov, the
director of the United States and Canada Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's plan is an even greater worry for
the Chinese, who have only about a dozen land-based missiles that
are capable of striking the United States. Beijing has already
vowed to respond by expanding its nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have been telling Moscow they
should cut a deal now and agree to amend the ABM treaty, because
the terms they would be offered by a future Republican president _
if George W. Bush is elected _ would be far less favorable.
</P>
<P>
   The most logical trade-off, specialists say _ and one that U.S.
officials hint Clinton may in fact propose _ would grant the United
States the right to build a limited missile defense to counter
possible Third World missile threats.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Washington would agree to the Russian demand that
both sides make especially deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms as
part of a START III nuclear accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who are pressed for cash, have urged that both
sides slash their nuclear arsenals to 1,500 warheads. The Pentagon
has previously argued that the United States needs about 2,500
warheads to meet its military requirements, but Washington could
try to mollify the Russians by agreeing to a limit below 2,000
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   A small but influential group of specialists in Russia argues
that the trade-off could be in Russia's interest. Rogov, for
example, argued that a small-scale U.S. defense would not
dramatically alter the strategic balance if the limitations were
carefully defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may belong to a minority, but I believe this is not going to
fundamentally change the mutual nuclear deterrence model,'' he said
in an interview. ``It will create some problems, but manageable
problems if we get what we want in START III.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, however, the Kremlin insists that it is not
interested. It has warned that it will not agree to revise the
treaty and that a U.S. decision to withdraw from the accord would
unravel the entire framework of arms agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Russia would not only stop reducing its arsenal of strategic
arms, Putin has warned, but it might also deploy new multiwarhead
missiles, abandon the agreement banning medium-range missiles and
even withdraw from the accord limiting conventional arms in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Russians have offered only to cooperate on defenses
against shorter-range nonstrategic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Having staked out such a tough opening position, Putin may find
it difficult to reach a compromise with Clinton. Nor does it help
that Clinton is nearing the end of his term and has not always been
able to prevail in the arms-control debate at home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian specialists fear that if a deal were stuck at the
June summit meeting Clinton would find it difficult to persuade the
Republican-dominated Senate to support it. They note that the
Clinton administration suffered a stinging setback last year when
the Senate rejected the treaty banning nuclear tests. If a deal is
to be made, they say, it should be cut with a leader who can make
it stick.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after an anti-missile failed a crucial test in January,
supporters and opponents of the defense system asked the
administration to postpone a decision on whether to go ahead with
such a system until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Russia reached an agreement with Clinton, there would
be no guarantee that the next American administration would not
come to Russia 18 months after that for another round of talks on
modifying the ABM treaty and perhaps yet again,'' said Alexander
Pikayev, an arms-control specialist at the Moscow Center of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to cut off the tail of a cat you should do it once
and not three times,'' he said.

LEWIS IS THE UNDISPUTED, AND UNHERALDED, CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no designation in athletics that has the
figurative, almost primal status that comes with being the
undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The title belongs to Lennox Lewis, but how he wishes it defined
him. Monday, sitting on the side of a boxing ring at Madison Square
Garden, his feet dangling over the apron like a child on a
playground swing, Lewis conceded that he may be a bit out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Not because he is relentlessly polite, courtly and respectful _
a fighter by vocation _ but because great champions are often
defined by their opponents. And while Lewis may have beaten
everyone he was supposed to beat in the last five years and may be
the recognized king of boxing's mountain, Lewis sighed at one point
as he said: ``I'd like to be fighting the guys from my era, really.
I don't want to box the young guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at Madison Square Garden, the 34-year-old Lewis boxes
one of the young guys, the 6-foot-7-inch, 250-pound Michael Grant,
who is seven years his junior. Still, it is the specter of fighting
Mike Tyson, or even Evander Holyfield for a third time, that keeps
coming back to Lewis, a haunting that Lewis is powerless to
exorcise. And he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a potential opponent who excited him, Lewis
answered: ``Yeah, but I don't think he wants to fight me. I'd like
to fight Mike Tyson, but he's a movie star now. He hasn't been
taking it too seriously. What can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning his head from side to side as if he were furtively
looking for someone behind him, Lewis added: ``And there's
Holyfield. He's still lurking around somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is what he is, a champion waiting for the unforgettable
rivalry, a fight or series of fights that could give him greater
star power.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Grant, who is undefeated and has immense
size and punching power, can provide the intriguing, entertaining
test that will enhance Lewis' profile _ provided Grant does not win
and launch a new era in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Grant became a credible contender five months ago with a
come-from-behind victory over Andrew Golota. Knocked down twice in
the first round, Grant fought back for a 10th-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That confirmed to him and everyone that Mike is not just a
tremendous athlete who became a fighter _ it confirmed that he's a
fighter,'' Grant's manager, Craig Hamilton, said. ``He got up off
the canvas and won.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grant has been fighting as a professional only since 1994.
He has been busy in that time, winning 31 fights, including 22 by
knockout, but he has far less experience than Lewis. Lewis, who is
6-5 and usually fights at about 245 pounds, has a &QC; 35-1-1 record in
10 years as a professional after an 82-fight amateur career that
included two Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant is still a gangly, uncoordinated kid,'' Lewis' trainer,
Emanuel Steward, said Monday. ``People have talked about Grant's
height bothering Lennox, but I've watched tapes of Lennox fighting
tall fighters even as an amateur, and he traditionally fights tall
guys real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who worked out for about an hour Monday afternoon before
meeting with reporters, had nothing derogatory to say about Grant.
He even praised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the No. 1 contender in the people's mind and in my
mind,'' Lewis said. ``He's done the work to get there. He's got
height, reach and strength. But I don't think this fight will go
the distance. He's not been in the ring against a boxer like me.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the closest Lewis got to stirring up prefight bad
blood.
</P>
<P>
   He may be too amiable for that. He smiled easily Monday, joking
with Steward and the few others who help him train. He entered the
Garden for his workout without fanfare, emerging from a back
entrance, and did his warm-up exercises in a darkened corner. A
businesslike, no-frills session in the ring followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relaxed,'' Lewis said. ``I've been through this many
times now. I'm not loud, but I know my talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Steward offered his own analysis. ``Lennox's strengths,''
the veteran trainer said, ``are unheralded.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Lennox Lewis, it seems, is unheralded.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis was done with his interviews, he left the Garden
through a 33rd Street exit and walked 25 yards to a waiting
limousine. On the busy Manhattan street, no one called out the name
of the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. No one asked
for his autograph or a picture.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of security guards walked with Lewis, and when the
group reached the curb, Lewis turned and thanked them. Then he
ducked his head and disappeared inside the limousine, which joined
the flow of taxi cabs, cars and buses of Midtown traffic.

BOEING`S TOP FINANCIAL OFFICER TAKES LUCENT JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little more than a year after she was wooed away from General
Motors to help turn around The Boeing Co. with a value-oriented
approach to business, Chief Financial Officer Debby Hopkins has
resigned to take the same position at Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, 45, became Boeing's highest female executive ever when
she joined the aerospace giant in December 1998, a time when Boeing
was struggling to recover from production problems that had sent
its stock tumbling and had seriously damaged its once-shining Wall
Street reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she was with Boeing for only a short time, Hopkins
is credited with overhauling its antiquated financial system, and
bringing financial discipline to the world's biggest aerospace
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debby Hopkins was a factor for change in a company that really
needed it,'' said Joe Campbell, aerospace analyst for Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was no shrinking violet,'' Campbell said. ``She held her
own ... This was a woman who was a whirlwind of energy and she made
a lot of changes, all of which were positive for Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jacobs, analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, said Hopkins
``brought a new openness at the company toward financial
performance, and was a major reason for the restoration of investor
confidence in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins performed so well that she was considered one of three
candidates to replace Boeing President Harry Stonecipher, who is
planning to retire next April.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts believe the leading contender for that job now
is Alan Mulally, head of Boeing's commercial operations. Mike
Sears, who runs the company's military aircraft and missiles unit
in St. Louis, is also thought to be in the running.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgable industry analysts, as well as sources within
Boeing, said there was nothing untoward in the sudden departure of
Hopkins. Lucent had been after her for some time and finally
presented her with a salary and financial package that Boeing could
not match, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hopkins was attracted to the Lucent job because it meant
returning to her high-tech roots, they said. Before she became vice
president of finance and chief financial officers for General
Motors Europe, Hopkins spent 13 years at the Unisys Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the passion and velocity of a high-tech company,''
Hopkins said in a statement. ``And Lucent is at the center of one
of the fastest-growing industries today. When I was offered the
opportunity to join Lucent ... I couldn't pass it up.''
</P>
<P>
   She replaces Donald K. Peterson, who has been named chief
executive officer of Lucent's new Enterprise Networks Group, slated
to be spun off later this year. Lucent was spun off from AT&AMP;T Corp.
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said Monday he learned last week that Hopkins was offered
the Lucent job, and he tried to talk her into staying at Boeing. He
declined to say what kind of counter offer was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and I talked,'' Condit said in an interview with the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ``I'm not going to get much deeper than
that ... We had those conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Boeing didn't make Hopkins an offer she could not
refuse, Condit had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take into account all the pieces of what any offer
has _ how does it fit with the profile of your industry. The kind
of offer you would make out of a Microsoft is very different than
the kind of offer you make out of Boeing. There are certain things
we can do logically, and things we cannot do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins' appointment at Lucent was effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband and two children plan to relocate to Far
Hills, N.J. Lucent is headquartered in nearby Murray Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Skowronski, a former Lockheed Martin executive who was
brought to Boeing by Hopkins about a year ago to be vice president
of finance and treasurer, will be acting chief financial officer
until a replacement is named, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is the world's largest telecommunications equipment
maker. The company declined to say what it agreed to pay Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Hopkins earned more than either Condit or Stonecipher
at Boeing, according to the annual proxy statement that was
recently mailed to shareholders for the annual meeting on May 1.
She received stock options worth nearly $5 million. Her total
compensation in 1999 was more than $6 million, including a bonus of
$633,600.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins received a signing bonus of $750,000 when Boeing hired
her, according to a filing Boeing made last year with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing shares fell $2.38 to $37.88 Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange, and analysts said it was a reaction to the news about
Hopkins. The stocks of other aerospace and defense companies were
up on Wall Street Monday, and so were Boeing shares before word of
Hopkins' departure became widely known.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the investor standpoint, her absence from Boeing will be
missed,''said Jacobs, the industry analyst. ``One of the question
marks is who will fill those shoes. It will be tough to find a
replacement for her. ... It's probably going to take several weeks
or even months to find a replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs and other analysts said Hopkins has built a strong
financial team at Boeing, and what she started will not be undone
by her leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has put in place new financial controls and a new way of
thinking within the company in terms of financial measures,''
Jacobs said. ``That will still be the guiding force, same as
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit, in the interview with the Post-Intelligencer, said the
company is ``headed in the right direction'' and that will not
change, regardless of who ends up replacing Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built an incredibly capable team,'' Condit said.
``Debby had a real hand in building that team. We have a lot of
momentum going for us.''

MICROSOFT IS MAIN CULPRIT IN NASDAQ DROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to adjust stock figures for Cisco and McDonald's.)  
(See also MICROSOFT-MARKETPLACE, MICROSOFT-SUIT) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks had another rocky session Monday, as
aftershocks from a violently negative reaction among investors to
Microsoft's most recent earnings report reverberated through the
Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which reported results from its third fiscal quarter
after the market closed on Thursday, was battered, falling 12 5/16,
or 15.6 percent, to 66 5/8. It was the biggest loss in the software
giant's share price since Oct. 26, 1987, a week after the stock
market crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The slide was a huge contributor to the 161.40-point, or 4.4
percent, decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which closed at
3,482.48. A late rally in many Nasdaq shares pulled the index off
its lows for the session. Still, Microsoft was responsible for more
than 41 points of the Nasdaq's drop.
</P>
<P>
   Investors moved into other sectors of the market as they exited
Microsoft and other technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average managed to rise, even though
Microsoft is a component of the blue chip index. The Dow closed at
10,906.10, up 62.05 points, or 0.6 percent. Gains in financial
stocks like American Express, which reported strong earnings,
General Electric and J.P. Morgan outweighed weakness in Microsoft
and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Rising prices for drug, chemical and consumer stocks helped to
limit losses in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which closed
at 1,429.86, down 4.68 points, or 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was battered.
The Russell, which has been dominated by the performance of a
relatively small group of technology and biotechnology stocks, fell
13.30 points Monday, or 2.8 percent, to 468.54.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the midst of the decline in technology over the last
six weeks or so, I don't think investors have reconciled the fact
they were overweight technology at the expense of everything
else,'' said Jonathan Oleksy, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``We are seeing genuine interest in sectors
like drugs, chemicals, banks and utilities. Technology will still
ultimately command a large weighting of a person's portfolio. But
by the time you wring out this excess ownership more of this
rotational activity will have gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Nasdaq market now down 31 percent from its peak on
March 10 and 14.4 percent for the year, some analysts said they
were beginning to look for signs that technology stocks are forming
a bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq market is now just about as oversold relative to
its two-month moving average as it was back in 1987,'' said Laszlo
Birinyi, who heads his own stock market research firm in Greenwich,

   ``We are getting close to a level where I may actually do a
little buying myself, in Microsoft and in technology in general,''
said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
``If you are underweight technology, I would put some cash to work
if the Nasdaq composite got to 3,250.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Microsoft's stock has been harshly
treated: So far this year, the stock is down 43 percent. Among
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies, the decline has dropped Microsoft
into fourth place in terms of market capitalization. It now trails
General Electric, Cisco Systems and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   And it has put a major crimp in the carrying value of Bill
Gates' holdings. Based on the most recent data on Microsoft
shareholders, the decline in the stock since the start of the year
has wiped out nearly $40 billion in paper assets from Gates'
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was far and away the most actively traded issue
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 157 million Microsoft shares changed hands, the
third-highest ever for a U.S. stock. Trading in Microsoft was about
three times as heavy as in the next most active issue Monday, Cisco
Systems. Cisco fell 1 11/16, to 63 7/16. The stock traded as low as
59 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, however, traders said business was fairly quiet.
European markets were closed in observance of Easter Monday. Among
Dow stocks, American Express rose 7, to 150, after it reported
first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, which also reported solid earnings, gained 2 3/16, to 71
15/16. And McDonald's rose 2 7/8, to 38 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Big chemical companies like DuPont and Dow Chemical gained.
DuPont rose 1 3/4, to 56. And Dow Chemical was up 3 5/8, to 109.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Microsoft, Exodus Communications was the biggest
loser on the Nasdaq market. Late Thursday the manager of Internet
sites reported a loss that was wider than expected. On Monday the
stock was hammered, falling 25 3/16, to 82 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't see this terrific rotation that is going on, I
would be much more worried,'' said David Williams, manager of the
$1.2 billion Excelsior Value and Restructuring fund at U.S. Trust
Co. ``As long as the rotation continues, the market can probably
move higher.''

 J.D.'s BITTER SPOONFUL OF CASTRO OIL  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - For the better part of two years it was as if the
entire state of Arizona had only one elected official _ John
McCain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As far as the national me dia was concerned, we had only one
senator in Washing ton and no elected members of the U.S. House of
Repre sentatives.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are, living in one of the nation's fastest grow ing
states, and the major TV networks and major newspa pers ignored
every official from Arizona except one.
</P>
<P>
   As both a journalist and a longtime resident, I've qui etly
endured this long-stand ing affront. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in the Elian Gonzalez case have changed all that.
The time has come to look into the eyes of the TV executives who've
spent years snubbing Arizona's other politicians, avoiding them,
dismissing them, and say:
</P>
<P>
   Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   You'd understand why if you'd seen any of the news reports
featuring Arizona Rep. J.D. Hayworth talking about the Gonzalez
case.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth called the re moval of Elian from the home of his Miami
relatives ``the lowest point of the Clinton presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for the immedi ate resignation of Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   He described what hap pened in Little Havana as ``the raid on
the home of this small boy.'' As if Elian was born and raised in
Miami, rather than Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth said ``Bill Clin ton and Janet Reno went into that home
prepared to use deadly force to satisfy Fidel Castro.'' As if
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, didn't even exist.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth described the action taken by federal agents an
``abduction.'' As if a child can be abducted from his kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Hayworth proved why he once was voted No. 1 in
the ``No Rocket Scientist'' category in a Wash ingtonian magazine
survey of Capitol Hill staffers.
</P>
<P>
   He also proved why it is that whenever an Arizona politician
other than McCain is given the national stage, outsiders suggest we
change the name of the state capital to Hooterville.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Hayworth's office why he so easily dismisses the
father-son relationship be tween Juan Miguel and Elian and was sent
a statement from Hayworth saying in part, ``Juan Miguel will never
have custody, in the true sense of the word, of his son as long as
they remain under Castro's thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth said he's calling on congressional leaders ``to
immediately bring up legisla tion to give Elian permanent residency
status.''
</P>
<P>
   Most responsible parents don't even let their children decide
what drink they can order with their Happy Meals. Hayworth believes
a 6-year-old is capable of de ciding whether he wants to seek
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Hayworth doesn't believe that, but doesn't care.
Every game played in Washington needs a political football. It
doesn't matter to some if the object getting passed and kicked
happens to be a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   The TV networks and big newspapers go right along. We can't stop
it. With McCain out of the picture, however, us folks out in Green
Acres country might suggest to big-time media types that they
bypass Rep. Hayworth for someone with slightly more humanity.
</P>

   Arnold Ziffel, maybe. &QL;

PLAY BY DAVID HARE IS RULED HIS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal lawsuit charging that David Hare's one-man
play about the Middle East, ``Via Dolorosa,'' misappropriated
elements from another author's one-man play has been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read the two plays, and the plays are, beyond the bare
minimum structure of a play addressing contemporary issues
involving the Middle East, the plays are substantially different,''
Judge Denny Chin of U.S. District Court in Manhattan wrote in his
decision, which was released on Friday. ``They are completely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   In a civil complaint filed last May, Steven Greenstein charged
that the Royal Court Theater in London rejected his one-act play,
``Voices From the Holy ... and Not So Holy Land'' in 1997, and then
used its ideas, structure and some dialogue for Hare's play. The
suit named only the Royal Court as the defendant and not Hare.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hare expressed relief at the decision,
particularly on behalf of the Royal Court, which commissioned him
to write ``Via Dolorosa,'' and because the litigation has delayed
the PBS broadcast of a film version of his play. ``We've been
hamstrung by this litigation,'' he said. ``From this tenuous claim
you can actually hold up a project for 10 months and cost the Royal
Court $40,000 in legal fees, which it doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Via Dolorosa,'' which started in September 1998 at the Royal
Court, opened on Broadway at the Booth Theater on March 18, 1999.
In the one-act monologue, the author recounts his trip to Israel
and conversations with people on each side of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Sims, a lawyer at Proskauer Rose LLP, which
represented the Royal Court and its co-defendant, the English Stage
Company, said that such claims were part of a trend. ``Even when
these claims are meritless,'' Sims said, ``it costs money to defend
them, and plaintiffs hope they will get some money to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   In his decision Chin said there were decisive differences
between the two plays. Hare's is told by him, for example, while
Greenstein's is not told from the author's point of view and could
be played by any actor. Hare's play is nonfiction, and Greenstein's
is fiction. And while conceding that the plays have a few things in
common, the judge said that some overlap was to be expected ``with
any treatment of the discussion of the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a copyright claim, the lawsuit charged that by
reading Greenstein's play, the Royal Court entered into a contract
that obligated it to compensate the playwright. Chin also rejected
that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hare _ who said he had not read Greenstein's play
_ expressed concern that such cases would force the Royal Court to
re-evaluate its open submissions policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Greenstein said. ``I think that my claim
was legitimate.''

CONTROVERSIAL CALL LEADS TO DODGERS LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; NEW YORK _ The Los Angeles Dodgers paid some respect to four
Mets pitchers who held everyone but Todd Hundley hitless, but they
also spoke of being weary from a rough first month.
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue showed; Hundley had all three of the team's hits.
There were also breakdowns in the field, and a pair of them in the
ninth inning led a 1-0 Mets win Monday at Shea Stadium in a makeup
game the Dodgers weren't happy playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won eight in a row and the Dodgers lost for the
first time in eight road games. After scoring 36 runs on 37 hits in
thrashing the Reds, the Dodgers were shut out for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Having already opened the season with 12 of their first 17 games
on the road, the Dodgers left Cincinnati on Sunday to play this
game, rescheduled from the April 9 snowout. After the loss, the
Dodgers took a charter flight to Atlanta, where they'll begin a
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in at a decent hour (Sunday) night, but still you fly,
unpack, you sleep, you pack back up, come the ballpark,'' said
Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort, who pitched six shutout innings.
``So guys are going to be a little sluggish. But the guys played
their (butts) off on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial call and missed grounder in the ninth doomed the
Dodgers. Robin Ventura led off the inning with a double against
Terry Adams (1-1), Melvin Mora pinch-ran and Jon Nunnally was
walked.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton hit a grounder between shortstop Kevin Elster and
third baseman Adrian Beltre. Elster fielded it and flipped the ball
to Beltre, but Beltre didn't have his foot on the base so he tried
to tag Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the bag was behind me, but I didn't know exactly where
it was,'' Beltre said. ``I felt it when I touched it, but I wasn't
sure, so that's why I tagged him, too. That's why I was trying to
get him both ways. I got him. Both (ways).''
</P>
<P>
   Third base umpire Gerry Davis disagreed, calling Mora safe.
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson argued and was thrown out for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty good angle, and even though he tried to tag him
it looked to me like his foot was on the bag,'' Johnson said.
``That's what I had a beef with Gerry. . . . I didn't cuss him. I
said, `What in the world are you throwing me for that for?' He said
`I have a right to throw you any time I want to throw you.' I said,
`Thanks. Great call.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, many of the Dodgers thought Mora was out. Mora had
a different idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Beltre) thought I was going to hit him with my spikes,'' Mora
said. ``He tagged me late. I think he was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't over. With the infield drawn in, Adams got Rey
Ordonez to ground to Elster, and Mora was forced at home.
Westlake's Matt Franco then grounded a pitch back to the mound, but
Adams couldn't come up with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it glanced off his glove and behind him, which enabled
Nunnally to score the game's only run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I was too quick in trying to get my glove to
the ball, and then to home plate, but it just went off the top of
my glove,'' Adams said. ``It's play that should be made in that
situation, but I didn't make it. I didn't field my position like I
should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Dodgers had chances to take the lead and failed.
Beltre grounded into a double play with runners on first and third
and one out in the second. In the fifth and sixth, the Dodgers had
runners on second with one out and didn't get a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But the best chance was in the seventh when the Dodgers had
runners on second and third and one out. New York reliever Turk
Wendell struck out Elster. Pinch-hitter Dave Hansen walked and
Devon White popped out to catcher Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those days,'' Hundley said. ``These last couple of
days, it was serious tough travel.''

KARROS IS FINALLY HEALTHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros was hobbled the
final days of spring training by a bruised ankle, then he missed a
few games in San Francisco with an ailing back.
</P>
<P>
   And before the road trip began, Karros had an injection into the
back of the shoulder because of an irritation. Karros says he feels
``great,'' but he'd like to be hitting better. He was 0 for 1 in
Monday's 1-0 loss to the Mets at Shea Stadium, but he was on base
three times with two walks and being hit with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, a slow starter, is hitting .190, but he has four homers,
12 RBI and a .329 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I where I want to be? No, but it's strictly from an average
standpoint,'' said Karros, who didn't acknowledge the injection.
``We're 11-7 right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros had the inflammation at least twice in the past, and on
those occasions it was early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets it from swinging,'' said Dodgers physical therapist
Pat Screnar, who also said Karros is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   __ Park's preference? Dodgers manager Davey Johnson isn't a big
fan of personal catchers for certain pitchers, but he's done it on
a few occasions, most notably in Baltimore with right-hander Scott
Erickson and catcher Lenny Webster.
</P>
<P>
   Though Johnson has tried to steer away from it, he admits
there's something to the way backup catcher Chad Kreuter and
right-hander Chan Ho Park work together. Park's had four starts
this season and Kreuter has caught three of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every since my first year as manager, I have a little (book) I
keep of who caught, so it's easy for me, when I open up that page I
can look and see,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked if his book contained anything value about
Park and Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some information about it. That is being
considered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Park went to pieces last season, having mental breakdowns and
looking confused; he was 13-11 but with a 5.23 ERA. Kreuter, who
played at Pepperdine, showed his value during Park's first start
this season in Montreal. Park was wild and reeling and Kreuter
talked to him time and again to ease Park's mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the three games Kreuter has caught, Park is 2-1 with a 3.00
ERA. He's 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA in one start throwing to Todd
Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Park is questionable for Thursday in Atlanta. He opted not to
throw a bullpen in New York, wanting to give the blister on the
middle finger of his pitching hand another day to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to throw a good bullpen,'' Park said. ``That's why I'm
going to wait, to make sure it's a better bullpen. I checked
(Monday) and it felt OK, but I want it to feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Johnson talked with Jeff Williams on the
flight to New York to tell the lefty reliever he would be sent to
Triple-A Albuquerque to make room for Kevin Brown on the 25-man
roster. . . . Right-hander Gregg Olson threw in the bullpen again
and said his right forearm was ``a lot better than it was,'' but he
said a timetable for his return is not yet set. He was eligible to
come off the disabled list Monday. . . . Hundley went 4 for 40 with
four RBI last season as a right-handed hitter. Against the Mets'
Dennis Cook, Hundley got his fourth hit in 11 at-bats as a righty
this season. He went 3 for 4 in the game and is batting .302.

ENERGY SECRETARY SAYS THAT THREAT OF BLACKOUTS IS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Raising the specter of widespread blackouts, the
United States secretary of energy said Monday that the nation's
electric system might fare worse this summer than it did in 1999
because of a rocky transition to deregulation when demand for power
is booming.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with government officials, corporate executives and
customer advocates here and in Hartford, Conn., the secretary, Bill
Richardson, called for new steps at the state and federal levels to
line up customers who would be willing to be unplugged on the
hottest summer days in exchange for appropriate payment, and for
identifying the backup generators that some hospitals, factories
and big companies maintain for emergencies and using them on days
when electricity demand peaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried as a nation, despite a hugely booming economy,
about problems in our electricity grid,'' Richardson said at a
forum at the New Jersey Institute of Technology Monday afternoon.
Richardson had a similar appearance in Hartford Monday morning and
had scheduled one in New Orleans Monday evening. He plans to hold
another, in Sacramento, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of blackouts last summer, he said: ``Fortunately, we
were able to avoid a widespread systems failure, this time. But we
may not be so fortunate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things may get worse before they get better. That's especially
alarming in light of the National Weather Service prediction of a
long hot summer in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the region's electricity suppliers _
Consolidated Edison, Public Service Enterprise Group, General
Public Utilities _said they had made extensive investments since
last summer and would be ready for hot weather this year.
</P>
<P>
   And in Hartford, Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G.
Rowland, said that state officials expected Connecticut's largest
power generator, the Millstone 3 nuclear plant, to be in service
this summer; last year, it was sidelined because of management
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland, who was the co-host of the session in Hartford with
Richardson, said the public should be aware that conservation would
be required on peak demand days. And in Newark, E. James Ferland,
the chairman, president and chief executive of PSE&AMP;G, said that New
Jersey could face shortages ``if there are problems in the Midwest
and we are required to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed with Richardson's short-term steps.
``Turning on old dirty diesel generators that are the standby
backup generators is going to be an environmental disaster,'' said
Nathaniel Greene, an electricity expert at the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group, who was one of 19
panelists at the 90-minute session here.
</P>
<P>
   The experts suggested a variety of reasons that the difference
between electric supplies and peak demand had become uncomfortably
small. One is that New England, New York and the Middle Atlantic
states are all in various stages of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, the monopoly utilities generated power,
transmitted it over their own lines and sold it to their own
customers, but now some utilities have gotten out of the generating
business while dozens of other companies have gotten into it. Under
the deregulated system, electricity is bought and sold wholesale,
hour by hour or minute by minute.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty, according to several participants, is that the
new system has not provided proper incentives to companies to build
new transmission lines. Scott Weiner, a former head of the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy and now a
senior vice president of Sithe Northeast, an independent power
producer, said that the deregulated system was not ``sending price
signals that allow for the construction of new capacity and shoring
up transmission systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although New England runs low on spare capacity on peak days, he
said, some companies are taking generators out of that region and
shipping them elsewhere in the country to make larger profits.
</P>
<P>
   The session was moderated by Kurt Yeager, the president and
chief executive of the Electric Power Research Institute, a
nonprofit organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that has complained
recently that deregulation has cut investment in research and
development. In a recent report, the institute said that the
electric system was in the worst condition it had been since the
great northeast blackout of 1965.

Miami, rather than Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth said ``Bill Clin ton and Janet Reno went into that home
prepared to use deadly force to satisfy Fidel Castro.'' As if
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, didn't even exist.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth described the action taken by federal agents an
``abduction.'' As if a child can be abducted from his kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Hayworth proved why he once was voted No. 1 in
the ``No Rocket Scientist'' category in a Wash ingtonian magazine
survey of Capitol Hill staffers.
</P>
<P>
   He also proved why it is that whenever an Arizona politician
other than McCain is given the national stage, outsiders suggest we
change the name of the state capital to Hooterville.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Hayworth's office why he so easily dismisses the
father-son relationship be tween Juan Miguel and Elian and was sent
a statement from Hayworth saying in part, ``Juan Miguel will never
have custody, in the true sense of the word, of his son as long as
they remain under Castro's thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth said he's calling on congressional leaders ``to
immediately bring up legisla tion to give Elian permanent residency
status.''
</P>
<P>
   Most responsible parents don't even let their children decide
what drink they can order with their Happy Meals. Hayworth believes
a 6-year-old is capable of de ciding whether he wants to seek
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Hayworth doesn't believe that, but doesn't care.
Every game played in Washington needs a political football. It
doesn't matter to some if the object getting passed and kicked
happens to be a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   The TV networks and big newspapers go right along. We can't stop
it. With McCain out of the picture, however, us folks out in Green
Acres country might suggest to big-time media types that they
bypass Rep. Hayworth for someone with slightly more humanity.
</P>

   Arnold Ziffel, maybe. &QL;

WILLIAM GALLAGHER, 77, WHO WORKED TO AID THE BLIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Francis Gallagher, a retired president of the American
Foundation for the Blind, died last Wednesday at his home in
Webster, Mass., south of Worcester. He was 77 and had long been
ill, said the foundation, based in New York, where Gallagher
formerly lived.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, who lost his own sight in boyhood, joined the staff
of the foundation in 1972 as director of program planning. In that
role, he oversaw policies carried out by regional branches
stretching from New York to San Francisco, and advised on matters
like fund raising, public relations and research objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He was named associate director for advocacy in 1978, managing
field services, government relations, publications, conferences,
workshops and training sessions. He advanced to executive director
in 1980, added the title of president in 1989 and retired the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which in addition to serving the blind preserves
the archives of Helen Keller, the organization's principal
fund-raiser and adviser into the 1950s, credits Gallagher with
having kept staff and trustees abreast of the needs of the blind by
establishing national advisory boards of leaders in education,
rehabilitation and aging.
</P>
<P>
   It says he also helped improve standards for the accreditation
of specialized schools and agencies that offer services to the 10
million Americans who are blind or have only limited sight.
</P>
<P>
   William Gallagher was born in Maynard, Mass., near Boston, and
graduated from the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown,
Mass., where he was president of the student council, president of
the athletic association, captain of the wrestling team and a
member of the debating society. He graduated from Holy Cross
College with a degree in sociology in 1948 and received a master's
in social work at Boston College in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He started 40 years of service to the blind that year as a child
social worker for the City of Boston and for the Catholic Guild for
All the Blind in Newton, Mass. He then worked at rehabilitation
centers in Newton and in Bridgeville, Pa., and in 1965 was named
director of rehabilitation services for the New York Association
for the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in that position until recruited by the American
Foundation for the Blind in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher is survived by a sister, Mary Langan, of Clifton Park,
N.Y. His wife, Catherine O'Brien Gallagher, died in 1990.

JANE TRAHEY, 76, AD EXECUTIVE AND AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ill., N.J.)   By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Trahey, one of the most prominent advertising women of the
1960s, who was best known for Blackglama's ``What Becomes a Legend
Most?'' campaign, died of cancer Saturday at her home in Kent,
Conn. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a brilliant copywriter, Trahey was also credited with
catchy slogans for Dynel, Union Carbide's synthetic hair (``It's
not fake anything. It's real Dynel.''), Danskin Inc. (``Danskins
Are Not Just for Dancing.'') and Echo Scarves (``The Echo of an
Interesting Woman.'').
</P>
<P>
   Among her other clients were Elizabeth Arden, Bill Blass,
Olivetti typewriters, Hamilton watches, Pauline Trigere fashions
and Ebony magazine. She also created public service advertising for
the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, for which she served as
vice president and a member of the board. Trahey was named
Advertising Woman of the Year in 1969 by the American Advertising
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Trahey founded Trahey Advertising Inc. in New York in 1960. The
name was changed in 1966 to Trahey/Wolf after she formed a
partnership with Henry Wolf, the photographer and art director.
After Wolf left in the early 1970s to open his own production
company, Trahey took as a partner Peter Rogers, who had been
working for her as an account executive and de facto office
manager.
</P>
<P>
   She and Rogers worked together on the Blackglama ads starting in
1968. The ads in the early years featured celebrities like Barbra
Streisand, Lauren Bacall and Maria Callas swathed in mink, with the
catch phrase ``What becomes a legend most?'' The celebrities were
considered so glamorous that they were never identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   The ads continued to be produced by Rogers after Trahey gave up
the agency business in the mid-1970s. The last ad, featuring Tommy
Tune, ran in 1996, making it one of Madison Avenue's
longest-running campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Trahey was too creative to worry about the details of running a
business, recalled Rocky Piliero, who worked as production manager
of her agency starting in 1969 and who is still working with
Rogers. ``It was a very informal company, like a playground,''
Piliero said Monday. ``Ms. Trahey didn't like accounts. She liked
projects. She liked to do something new. She'd be gung-ho for six
months, then get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep her fertile mind active, Trahey also gave lectures to
professional women's organizations and wrote scores of magazine
articles, novels, humorous pamphlets, a play and a self-help book
called ``Jane Trahey on Women &AMP; Power: Who's Got It. How to Get
It.''
</P>
<P>
   Her play, ``Ring Round the Bathtub,'' which was produced on
Broadway in 1972 and starred Elizabeth Ashley, was a sentimental
look at an American family in Chicago, her hometown, during the
Depression. She also wrote of her youthful experiences in ``Life
With Mother Superior,'' a novel that was made into a film called
``The Trouble With Angels'' starring Rosalind Russell and Hayley
Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Her other books included ``Thursdays Till Nine,'' a humorous
novel about a fictional Texas department store, inspired by an
early job at Neiman Marcus, and ``Pecked to Death by Goslings,''
based on her experiences converting a Connecticut barn into a home.
</P>
<P>
   She called the converted barn Versailles, she said in a 1964
article in The New York Times, ``not because it looks like it, but
because it costs as much.'' She later sold that house.
</P>
<P>
   Trahey's first job was at The Chicago Tribune in the clippings
library, known as the morgue. ``My mother never got over it,''
Trahey recalled years later. ``Every time she would call and
someone would answer ``the morgue'' she'd cross herself and hang
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Her entry into advertising came at the Carson Pirie Scott
department store in Chicago. In 1947 she went to Dallas as
advertising director of Neiman Marcus, rising to become sales
promotion director before leaving for New York to start her own
agency.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the agency in the 1970s, she divided her time for
many years between Chicago and New York, working as a consultant,
before settling in Connecticut two years ago with Jacqueline
Babbin, a friend for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever she lived, Trahey never stopped writing or
lecturing and could occasionally be cajoled into taking on a
challenging project, as she did in 1981 for Joe Famolare, who had
been making thick-soled shoes and fashionable clogs since 1970.
When fashions changed, Famolare called on Trahey, who put his
picture in the ads and turned him into a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Trahey is survived by her sister, Anita Richter, and a niece,
Kristina Richter Becker, both of Englewood, N.J.

FRITZ ALEXANDER II, 73, JUDGE WHO BECAME A DEPUTY MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fritz W. Alexander II, the first black judge to serve
a full term on New York State's highest court and a deputy mayor
under Mayor David N. Dinkins, died Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital
at 73. The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   From his days as a Supreme Court justice in Manhattan to his
eventual rise to the State Court of Appeals, Alexander was known
for his stands on civil liberties and the rights of the accused.
After he left the bench in 1992 to become deputy mayor for public
safety to his former law partner, Dinkins, Alexander helped steer
the mayor through a series of municipal crises, both fiscal and
civil.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a leading figure in the city's black legal
community, helping found both the National Bar Association, a black
lawyers' group, and an organization that encouraged young blacks to
enter the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``American justice has lost a great champion, a vigilant
defender to the end of translating the ideal of equal opportunity
into day-to-day reality,'' Judith S. Kaye, New York State's chief
judge and a former colleague of Alexander on the Court of Appeals,
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was born Carl Bernard Zanders Jr. in Apopka, Fla., on
April 24, 1926. After his mother fell ill _ he never knew his
father _ he was raised in the family of his mother's brother, Fritz
Winfred Alexander, a lawyer in Gary, Ind., who gave Alexander his
name and his interest in the law. After serving in the Navy during
World War II, he graduated from Dartmouth College in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   While attending New York University Law School, where he became
president of his class, Alexander befriended a young neighbor in
Harlem's Riverton Apartments named David Dinkins. In 1957, he and
Dinkins and a third lawyer, Thomas Benjamin Dyett, formed the law
firm of Dyett, Alexander &AMP; Dinkins. The firm, the leading black
firm in the city in its day, represented, among others, the United
Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Allied Federal Savings and Loan in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the influential Carver Democratic Club in Harlem,
Alexander also helped coordinate Dinkins' upset victory in a State
Assembly race in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Alexander was appointed a Civil Court judge, and also
served in the State Supreme Court's Criminal Branch and in the
Appellate Division. He was also a member of the State Commission on
Judicial Conduct, which disciplines judges. In 1985, when Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo appointed him to the State Court of Appeals, he
became the first black judge to serve in other than an interim
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote an opinion that it was a constitutional violation to
keep mental patients on antipsychotic medication without their
consent. But he also wrote a widely cited opinion that criminal
defendants who believe they have been represented by incompetent
lawyers have to first prove their innocence before they can sue the
lawyer for malpractice, which made it much harder for the
defendants to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was remembered as perceptive and thorough on the
bench, warm and sociable off, with a sense of humor that belied his
sometimes formal bearing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Dinkins was elected mayor, he approached his old
friend and partner and asked him to become deputy mayor. To his
surprise, Dinkins said, Alexander accepted. His colleagues on the
bench were astounded. ``It was shocking to us, because that was the
zenith,'' Kaye said. ``But I think he had the sense that he could
help his friend, and he wanted to be at his side.''
</P>
<P>
   While Alexander always preferred to work behind the scenes,
Dinkins said he was at the center of all the major decisions of his
administration, whether over the city's latest budget troubles or
racial unrest in Crown Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins said he counted Alexander as one of his most trusted
advisers. ``I have this expression that I use for people on whom
you rely to be accurate: `If he tells you a flea can pull a plow,
hitch him up.' That was Fritz,'' Dinkins said. ``He was very good,
he was a legal scholar but, more importantly for my purposes, he
had a compassion for people and understanding things.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office with the rest of Dinkins' administration in
1993, Alexander served as a special counsel to the Manhattan law
firm of Epstein Becker &AMP; Green.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Beverly J. Alexander, three children
by his first wife, who died, two stepchildren and three
grandchildren.

5 PHOENIX FIRMS AIM TO ENTICE WORKERS TO LIVE DOWNTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Workers from a handful of downtown Phoenix's biggest
employers could soon get help to buy a home close to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 135 people will receive $5,000 in down payment and
closing cost aid through the new Downtown Phoenix Homeownership
Program.
</P>
<P>
   The housing initiative is a $675,000 venture between non-profits
and businesses. It's being unveiled by community leaders today at
Heritage Square.
</P>
<P>
   Employees from Arizona Public Service, The Arizona Republic,
Bank of America, the Downtown Phoenix Partnership's Retail Council
and Wells Fargo Bank are eligible for the housing aid.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Phoenix has made a comeback from the sea of empty
parking lots it was after quitting time a decade ago. But the area
still lacks 24-hour residents.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are backing the housing incentives to bring more
residents to central Phoenix, cut back on traffic congestion and
pollution and entice new employees.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have worked with mortgage company Fannie Mae to
entice buyers to blighted or downtown areas to cut traffic
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's Chamber of Commerce has a program to help its employees
buy in the city. Los Angeles firefighters and police officers are
given assistance to purchase homes in the city instead of the
suburbs. And in Maryland, at least 25 employers are helping workers
with at least $3,000 if they buy houses close to their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix program is believed to be the first of its kind for
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five thousand dollars can mean the difference between becoming
a homeowner or remaining a renter,'' said Elisa de la Vara,
director of Fannie Mae's Phoenix Partnership office.
</P>
<P>
   The boundaries where people can buy and get the interest-free
loans vary by company. The biggest targeted area stretches between
Broadway and Camelback Roads and 19th Avenue and 24th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Other downtown Phoenix firms are expected to join the effort and
offer their workers incentives to buy homes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a seed to start a central-Phoenix housing boom,'' Jo
Marie McDonald of Phoenix Community Alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, which is the largest source of U.S. home financing,
teamed with Phoenix Community Alliance and Neighborhood Housing
Services to help Phoenix area businesses set up the
employee-housing program.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies involved have all set aside $150,000 to help
their employees buy houses, while Neighborhood Housing Services has
contributed $75,000 to start a pool for small-business workers
covered under Downtown Phoenix Partnership's Retail Council.
</P>
<P>
   APS, BofA and Wells Fargo employees interested in the program
should contact their human resources department. Employees from The
Arizona Republic and Downtown Retail Council can call Neighborhood
Housing at (602) 258-1659. &QL;

CABLEVISION MAKES DEAL TO ADD TO ITS NEW YORK CUSTOMERS
</HEADLINE>
  By JAYSON BLAIR   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Cablevision Systems Corp. has obtained an
additional 125,500 customers in the New York metropolitan region in
a $1.1 billion deal that will make it the nation's largest local
cable provider, company officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The move takes the company out of the Boston area and is the
final step in a plan announced last year to consolidate it in and
around New York. It also puts Cablevision's focus on expanding
beyond the bounds of a traditional cable company into Internet and
other types of media, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the company has begun telephone service over
cable lines to customers in parts of Long Island and in Fairfield
County, Conn.; expanded its high-speed Internet service over cable
modems and standardized its channel lineups throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden and Radio City
Music Hall and operates Rainbow Media MetroChannels, a set of
television channels stressing New York programming, has set its
sights on becoming a telecommunications and entertainment company
that provides service and content through several media.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest deal, the company agreed to trade its 357,000
Boston area subscribers to Media One, which is to be acquired by
AT&AMP;T as a division, for 125,500 subscribers in the northern suburbs
of New York City, the officials said. The deal calls for AT&AMP;T to
provide Cablevision with $284 million in cash and $878 million in
stock, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T deal was made final last week, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transaction is consolidating the New York market,'' James
L. Dolan, president of Cablevision, said Monday. Time Warner Cable
of New York City has 1.8 million customers in Manhattan, Queens and
parts of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision announced a deal to sell its 306,000-subscriber
cable system in the Cleveland area in December to the Adelphia
Communications Corp. for $1.53 billion in cash and stock, and
agreed to sell its 48,500-subscriber cable system in Kalamazoo,
Mich., to Carter Communications in March for $172.5 million in
stock. Cablevision officials say they hope that some of the money
from the three agreements can be applied toward the company's debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are all expected to be completed by the end of the
year and would give Cablevision 2.9 million customers in its
remaining regional cluster, which includes New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.

BOSTON BANK SAYS IT HAS WON BOARD SEATS AT CARVER BANCORP 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Boston bank that has been waging a long-running
battle over Carver Bancorp in Harlem said late Monday that a court
decision had given it two seats on the board of Carver, a
financially troubled institution that is the largest black-run bank
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Two executives of the Boston Bank of Commerce, a black-owned
bank that is one of Carver's largest shareholders, ran for Carver's
board at a tumultuous shareholder meeting in February; they were
defeated by a narrow margin, 30,000 of the 1.7 million votes cast.
The executives, Kevin Cohee and his wife, Teri Williams, have
challenged the election on several grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Delaware Chancery Court issued a ruling invalidating
about 86,000 votes that were cast in favor of the incumbent
directors, David R. Jones, the bank's chairman, and David N.
Dinkins, the former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge ruled that Teri and Kevin are on the board,'' said
Robert Patrick Cooper, general counsel of Boston Bank. ``They look
forward to sitting at the next board meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carver executives believe the ruling is technical in nature
and may appeal it, said Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for the bank.
``It does not say they can go on the board,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A trial on the other issues raised by Boston Bank is scheduled
to begin next month in Delaware, where Carver is incorporated. The
main issue in the case is whether Carver improperly sold shares to
friendly Wall Street firms to stuff the ballot box rather than to
strengthen the bank's financial position.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling is the latest twist in what has become a bitter
fight over the future of the bank, which was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents have criticized the bank's new president, Deborah
C. Wright, for her lack of banking experience; though she once
worked on Wall Street, she was more recently the president of the
Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, an economic development agency.
</P>
<P>
   Wright and her supporters have, in turn, criticized Boston Bank
as an interloper without the community ties that the bank needs.
They note that Cohee has proposed merging Carver with his
institution, a plan that he says he has abandoned.

each day but less than total care. Some have supportive families,
others do not. Some require more help than their families can give.
Few of them want to be in hospitals or nursing homes. None of us
should want them there. The high cost of institutional care
impoverishes families and strains federal and state health care
budgets, and most people prefer to age where they live, at home.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, in an attempt to slow the growth of Medicare costs,
Congress tightened up on payments for nursing homes and for the
medical and social services given by home health care agencies to
people who remained at home. Several of the nation's biggest
nursing home chains have since filed for bankruptcy, blaming the
changes in federal payment policy for their plight. New data just
compiled by the Congressional Budget Office show that home health
care has suffered sharp losses too.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are, in fact, alarming. Medicare spending on home
health care has dropped by 45 percent, from $17.5 billion in 1997
to $9.7 billion last year. The result in just one year, from 1997
to 1998, was that the number of people receiving home health care
shrank by 600,000, from 3.6 million to 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Pear reported in The New York Times last Friday,
reports from across the country indicate that the most disabled are
being rejected or forced from the rolls. Home health care agencies
are spurning old people whose care may cost them more, they fear,
than they can be reimbursed. Patients are backing up in hospitals
and nursing homes, where their care is more costly, or are going
without any help at all.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does nothing, home health care payments will be
automatically cut by an additional 15 percent next year. But the
sharp drop in home health care has caught both Republicans and
Democrats by surprise. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is leading a
bipartisan move in the Senate to cancel the planned reduction, with
support from dozens of senators of both parties. A similar effort
in under way in the House. That is only prudent. The cut should be
dropped, and serious study given to what the payment system ought
to be. Congress had reason to try to rein in ballooning Medicare
costs in 1997. But the nation's oldest and most fragile citizens
should not have to suffer for good intentions that have gone awry.

EDITORIAL: A VIETNAM PREMONITION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 25:
</P>
<P>
   As the nation reflects this week on the meaning of the Vietnam
War 25 years after the fall of Saigon, a few fateful words of
Lyndon Johnson's tumble across the decades to remind us that a
senseless conflict might have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   On a May morning in 1964, as Johnson was weighing whether to
expand American military involvement in Vietnam, he confided in a
conversation with Sen. Richard Russell that he did not really know
why Washington should go to war in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Sgt. Kenneth Gaddis, who was one of his valets,
Johnson said he was troubled by the idea of sending this father of
six children to war. ``And what the hell are we going to get out of
his doing it?'' Johnson asked himself. ``And it just makes the
chills run up my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so many years later it is hard not to be saddened and
angered by Johnson's failure to follow that simple impulse. His
comments, recorded by the White House and published a few years ago
by Michael Beschloss in a compendium of Johnson tapes titled
``Taking Charge,'' captured a larger truth that still rests
uneasily on the American soul. No compelling national interest was
served by waging war in Vietnam, and the men who directed the war,
including Johnson and his secretary of defense Robert McNamara,
knew it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   More than 58,000 American servicemen lost their lives in a land
of negligible political and economic importance to the welfare of
the United States. The idea that communism would advance inexorably
across Asia if Ho Chi Minh was victorious in Vietnam was the
hallucination of men numbed, and trapped, by the liturgies of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The same men also violated a cardinal principle of politics and
warfare by drafting citizens for combat without first building
strong public support for their cause. The Gulf of Tonkin
resolution, approved by Congress in 1964 after the Pentagon
reported that U.S. naval vessels had been attacked by North
Vietnam, was a flimsy license for committing the country to a land
war in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As opposition grew, and demonstrations against the fighting
spread across the country, Johnson and his aides failed to
recognize that a divided democracy cannot sustain a foreign war
without doing grievous damage to itself and its principles. By the
time Johnson realized the harm he had done, his political career
was wrecked and the domestic achievements of his presidency had
been overshadowed by his reckless spilling of American and
Vietnamese blood.
</P>
<P>
   The physical wounds of those who fought bravely in Vietnam
healed long ago, but the war will always loom large in their lives,
as it does in the political memory of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It changed America in innumerable ways, for better and for
worse. It undermined a generation's faith in the judgment and
truthfulness of its military and diplomatic leaders. But above all,
it taught us that the United States must not commit its soldiers to
protracted combat in the absence of clear security interests, and
that future wars cannot be fought without the support of the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   For these and many other reasons, the Vietnam War Memorial in
Washington is different from the other monuments where America
honors its fallen soldiers. The starkness and simplicity of the
memorial, with the name of each soldier etched in polished black
granite, reminds visitors that no victory is celebrated on this
spot, no noble cause honored in memory of those who sacrificed
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The monument instead commemorates the needless sacrifice of
troops who were betrayed by a president who prosecuted a war he did
not believe in for a goal that he could not define in public
speeches or private conversation. That, more than anything, is what
the nation must remember this week, and that is why the words of
Lyndon Johnson still sting.

EDITORIAL: BATTLING OVER THE CITYSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 25:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities do not come often to preserve New York City's
dramatic skyline and the character of its neighborhoods. Earlier
this year the Giuliani administration presented one such
opportunity when it proposed the boldest change in zoning rules
since 1961, with the aim of saving residential neighborhoods from
destruction by wanton development of towering skyscrapers and
barren plazas like the Trump skyscraper under construction near the
United Nations. In the last month, however, leaders of the city's
real estate industry have begun mobilizing against the proposals.
Some of their objections are constructive. But the brazen attempt
to kill off reform must be rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The need to update the zoning laws has been clear for many
years. Back in 1961 the prevailing philosophy was that the city's
residential streets were too crowded. Planners envisioned a
beautiful new city of giant apartment towers and big open plazas.
In some cases, like the West Side of Manhattan, they effectively
sanctioned tearing down vital neighborhoods to achieve their end.
</P>
<P>
   But just as that thinking got embodied in zoning codes and law,
far-sighted thinkers like Jane Jacobs rediscovered the vitality of
the city's streets. Fights erupted between developers and
neighborhoods all over the city, and the zoning code grew so
complicated with so many exceptions that decisions on what to
build, and where, ended up being the province of a specialized
handful of lawyers, lobbyists and operatives bearing sacks of
campaign donations for city political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the City Planning Commission will have the first of a
series of hearings on the proposed zoning changes. The new zoning,
put together by Joseph Rose, the commission chairman, would impose
height limits ranging from 35 feet to 720 feet in most
neighborhoods outside Midtown and Lower Manhattan. The changes
would involve a trade-off of height for bulk. They would encourage
buildings to rise on the street line, with storefronts to promote
the street life that healthy neighborhoods need, and would shrink
or eliminate plazas.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the city's community boards favor these changes,
though some feel they do not go far enough. Many architects and
experts worry about creating too much homogeneity, and some want
more latitude for creativity. But the Real Estate Board, which is
the main group of the industry, says it is opposed philosophically
to any limitations on height, arguing that the market should drive
buildings to be as high as developers want.
</P>
<P>
   Some developers have pointed to legitimate technical problems in
the zoning proposals, fearing that projects already assembled and
financed might be unfairly aborted. Many other developers and
owners of prime sites, including some religious institutions, say
they feel straitjacketed and should have more flexibility to
develop their sites or use air rights to build elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A timetable has been adopted requiring that the Planning
Commission and City Council act on the changes before the autumn.
There is plenty of time to refine the proposals before then. What
should not happen is something that may have already started. The
public should guard against attempts by the real estate industry to
use campaign contributions in an election year to get politicians
to back off their responsibilities. The objective should be to let
developers and architects create new buildings, while saving
neighborhoods for the people who already live in them.

A HOOPS STAR IS REBORN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here comes trouble _ that's what they all figured.
Chris Webber's reputation arrived way ahead of him. And it wasn't
scribbled all cute on a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   A talented underachiever. A young rebel who dared take on an
almost legendary coach. In trouble with the law. All but chased out
of town by two teams by the time he was 25.
</P>
<P>
   Then when he was traded to the Sacramento Kings, that Siberian
outpost of the NBA, Webber didn't even want to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, coming to (Sacramento) seemed like the lowest point
of my career,'' Webber said. ``And really, it's been more like
rebirth time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's trouble of a much different nature. The kind almost
impossible for other teams to handle. After five often-turbulent
seasons with Golden State and Washington, Webber has gone from the
poster boy for the spoiled NBA star to the future of the league.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings have no answer for center Shaquille O'Neal in their
opening playoff series, the Lakers have none for Webber. In
Sacramento's four regular-season games against the Lakers, Webber
averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 on Sunday at the Staples Center, it was more of the
same, the 6-10 Webber scoring 28 points in 27 minutes, flashing by
and over A.C. Green and Robert Horry. The only thing that could
stop him was fouling out, which he did, much to his dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, he's just like Shaquille is to the Lakers,'' said
Kings center Vlade Divac. ``He's our main guy. He's had an all-pro
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one, he was determined to win and lead this team.
I've just tried to help him. Whatever he wants to do, I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to figure as to who this might come as bigger news,
the Warriors, Wizards, Kings or Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State coach Don Nelson was so high on Webber, who was
coming out of college after two years at Michigan, he engineered a
complex draft-day deal in 1993 with Orlando, trading for the No. 1
overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever disputed Webber's talents. But Nelson soon soured on
Webber, who didn't want to play center. Then he quickly wanted to
renegotiate his contract, and his independent streak did not sit
well with the regimented Golden State coach.
</P>
<P>
   Things turned ugly, and after his rookie year, he was traded to
Washington and reunited with his former Wolverines teammate Juwan
Howard. The Bullets were heralded as the team of the future, with a
new frontcourt and soon a new nickname, the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   But Webber left his fans disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In January of '98 he was charged with marijuana possession
during a traffic accident. He and Howard were named in a
sexual-assault complaint by a woman whom Webber said he had never
seen before. A grand jury did not indict the players.
</P>
<P>
   For a young man, Webber was carrying a lot of bad baggage when
he reluctantly arrived in Sacramento to start last year's
lockout-shortened season; it had all the makings of a bad marriage:
The seemingly arrogant, troubled power forward to the lowly Kings,
in a city far from the national spotlight of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know him before,'' Divac said. ``I can't judge him.
But from the first moment I met him, he's been like my younger
brother. He's the greatest young guy I ever met. I had so much fun
with him. He's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamed with his first true center in Divac, unexpectedly paired
with a real point guard _ Jason Williams, who tried to get him the
ball _ Webber led the Kings to their first winning season in 17
years. A team that had gone 27-55 the previous year went 27-23 in
the abbreviated '99 season. Webber averaged 20 points and 13
rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   He acted like the model team player. There was no trouble off
the court. Webber quickly went from a player gathering the wrong
kind of reputation to a franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   This year he stepped it up again, averaging a career-high 24.5
points (sixth in the league) and 10.5 rebounds (fifth), and 4.6
assists. Webber's stock has risen so far that Utah's Karl Malone,
never quick to praise the NBA's young bucks, has become a convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry so much about the future of the game anymore
because of players like Chris Webber,'' Malone said. ``I have a lot
of respect for him now. No doubt, he's turned his career around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to determine the calmer lifestyle of Sacramento has
helped him focus on his career, but not even Webber _ only 27 _ is
certain how much influence the dimmer lights have played on his
turning his career around.
</P>
<P>
   What he and everyone else around Sacramento is certain about, is
that he has to stay in the game if the Kings are going to have any
chance of upsetting the Lakers. Webber bemoaned Horry for
``flopping'' to draw fouls in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if Robert Horry isn't a four-man (power forward),
then don't play him at that position,'' Webber said. ``You know
what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``I fouled out _ three or four offensive fouls in 27 minutes in
one of the biggest games of my life _ and it doesn't feel good. . .
. I'm not going to worry about offensive fouls or trying to lose
weight so I can't bump him.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber actually only has 10 pounds on Horry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him say I was flopping, but I don't flop,'' Horry
said. ``The only time I flop is when I get hit with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand Horry, though. Like most everyone else, he
has come around on Webber. When Horry sees Webber now, he sees
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in Washington, he was just trying to put on a show
a lot,'' Horry said. ``Now he's playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think once you come into the league, you're just going
to step into an all-star role. It takes time to mature. I think
he's matured, knows his game, knows what works for him and is using
it to the best of his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see he's always been a manchild. In college he was
bigger than everybody; now he's about average size. But he's so
strong and agile, you knew eventually it was going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you know where, and when.

VICTIMS SEEK `PART IN THE SYSTEM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JUDI VILLA  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - No one phoned Louise Pattison when her son's killer was
released from jail; she didn't find out until she asked four days
later.
</P>
<P>
   And though she was allowed to speak during the court proceedings
that were supposed to bring the justice she sought, Pattison felt
her words had no impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have recited Mary Had a Little Lamb. That's what it
was received as,'' said Pattison, whose son, Brian Seth, 21, was
murdered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pattison is among a group of Arizona victims who complain that,
despite having a law on the books for 10 years protecting victims'
rights, they often feel like outsiders in a system that caters to
the rights of defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, April 24, as the U.S. Senate debates whether to approve a
federal Constitutional amendment, Pattison and other victims of
crime say Arizona's law has made strides but remains rife with
problems, ranging from failure to force convicts to make financial
amends to failure to inform victims about court dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims overall feel that their rights pale in comparison to
the defendants,'' said Dan Levey, a victims advocate for the state
Attorney General's Office. ``They want to have a part in the
system, but that's hard when you're an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pattison's words: ``It's hard to say; who did we matter to?''
</P>
<P>
   The federal amendment, sponsored by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., would
amend the Constitution to put victims' rights on equal footing with
the rights of criminal defendants.
</P>
<P>
   It would guarantee such things as the right to be present at
court hearings, the right to speak at sentencing and to have a say
in plea agreements, the right to a speedy resolution of the case
and the right to repayment for losses. It would also force the
courts to weigh the safety of the victim when considering any
release order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put them (victims) into the fundamental law, and they become
of the same importance as other values of our criminal justice
system, such as the rights of defendants,'' said Steve Twist, a
local victims advocate. ``The balance will be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is one of 32 states that currently have some form of
victims' rights, but still, victims say, the promises often ring
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 75 percent of offenders pay off all the restitution
they are ordered to pay before they're released from probation or
parole, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   And judges tend to be more protective of a defendant's rights,
guaranteed by the Constitution, than they are of a victim's rights,
protected only by the state. They admonish victims that they might
be asked to leave the courtroom if they cry, stare at the
defendant, walk out too often and even cough too loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, it's a whole different world in there,'' said Sue Osolin,
whose son, Ryan, was shot three times in the back of the head and
killed in 1997. ``It's hell in there, but not so bad when you think
of other states where people can't even be in the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys watched Osolin's reactions when they showed
graphic photos and once asked for a mistrial after she bowed her
head and a victims advocate blew her nose, Osolin said. Osolin, who
is nearsighted, learned to take off her glasses when the pictures
came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not getting me out of the courtroom,'' she said. ``I
have a right to be here, and God forbid I shed a few tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Levey, whose brother Howard was murdered in 1996, says that, if
nothing else, talk of the federal amendment will raise awareness of
victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal amendment is one way we can scream out to the
country and say victims are important too,'' Levey said. ``The main
thing we're looking for is equity. Being equal and having a part in
the criminal justice system rather than being on the periphery
looking in.'' &QL;

SHAQ HAS STERN WARNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ So Rick Adelman wants to make an issue over
non-foul calls with regard to Shaquille O'Neal. Apparently, the
Sacramento Kings coach does so at his own peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine. He can be an idiot,'' O'Neal said of Adelman's
complaints, which came in the wake of the Lakers' victory over the
Kings in Sunday's first-round playoff opener. ``What Rick Adelman
doesn't want to do is wake me up. (By) crying and whining, he'll
wake me up.''
</P>
<P>
   So, 46 points, 17 rebounds and five blocked shots isn't woken
up?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Neal _ who made just five trips to the foul line _
contends officials miss numerous defensive fouls committed against
him, Adelman contends it is O'Neal who got away with the bullying
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Shaquille O'Neal is a great player,''
Adelman said, ``but they do not officiate the game the same for him
with all his strength as they do for everybody else. . . . I just
think we need to find something else (defensively), because they
are not going to call anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded O'Neal: ``My game is a game of tai-chi, I'm good
enough to go around people. I don't have to go through them. I've
never had to go through (Kings center) Vlade Divac. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Kings have nothing to complain about?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson had his own postscript on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might talk about the officiating a little bit myself, if I'm
prodded long enough,'' Jackson said. ``I mean, really, (the Kings)
shot 35 foul shots to our (14)? They had 20 more foul shots in the
game. That's a disparity you usually don't see at home. But you
know . . . that's the way the game went, and it looked to me early
like they weren't going to give any simple, cheap fouls to Shaq. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it boils down to refereeing as much as it just
boiled down to who wanted the game more and who played with more
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant figured the Kings' ire could work in the Lakers'
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're thinking more about the officials than they're
thinking about playing us,'' he said, ``I think sure, that can work
to our advantage, because to some extent they're losing focus. But
I think come game time on Thursday, they're not going to be
thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of officials was all the rage in the Kings locker room
after Game 1. Chris Webber fumed over the pair of offensive fouls
called against him while jostling with Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs read the papers, just like normal people,'' Horry
said, ``A lot of times, it's just talk to try to get the refs to
(call the game differently).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Waiting, the hardest part: Having handled the Kings Sunday,
the Lakers are eager for more, but they'll have to wait until
Thursday to try to make it a 2-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big bummer,'' Horry said. ``To take this many days off,
the competition level drops in practice, and you'll be so anxious
to get out there and play the game, it kind of hurts you at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But hopefully, the only thing this will do is make us better,
because there's still a lot of stuff that coach is throwing in to
make us a better team, and we're still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal called the delay ``very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, especially for me, a guy that takes a pounding,''
he said. ``I'm going to chill out today. Then (Tuesday), I'm going
to get a massage, a little steamy-steam-steam, mineral bath-bath.
Wednesday, put my face back on, then Thursday be ready to play. So
it's good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Payday for Shaq: O'Neal had little to say about a New York
Times report that indicated he will sign a contract extension this
offseason. O'Neal, whose contract expires in 2003, is eligible for
a three-year extension worth $83.5 million, starting at $24.75
million in 2003-04.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been discussed,'' O'Neal said. ``I haven't even
thought about it. You know, it really doesn't matter to me. I make
good money, the organization takes care of me. We'll see.''

 &HT;    Interactions between drugs and alternative remedies
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medicine and pharmaceutical science have a good understanding of
which drugs interact with each other and which foods interfere with
the actions of drugs. But the question of interactions between
pharmaceuticals and natural remedies _ herbs, minerals and high
doses of vitamins _ is a new one for researchers. Here's a sampling
of what's known so far:
</P>
<P>
   If you take:
</P>
<P>
   St. John's wort for depression.
</P>
<P>
   And also take:
</P>
<P>
   Protease inhibitors to fight HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction could:
</P>
<P>
   Increase metabolism of drugs in liver; make levels of drugs in
blood lower than intended; speed development of the virus'
resistance to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   If you take:
</P>
<P>
   Licorice to reduce inflammation, soothe digestion and regulate
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   And also take:
</P>
<P>
   Nifedipine, enalapril or prazosin to regulate blood pressure and
heart arrhythmia and prevent heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction could:
</P>
<P>
   Cause the body to retain sodium, increasing blood pressure and
canceling out the drug's intended effects.
</P>
<P>
   If you take:
</P>
<P>
   Valerian for insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   And also take:
</P>
<P>
   Diphenhydramine or other antihistamines sold as over-the-counter
allergy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction could:
</P>
<P>
   Increase the drug's potential for causing drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   If you take:
</P>
<P>
   Feverfew for migraines.
</P>
<P>
   And also take:
</P>
<P>
   Warfarin or heparin
</P>
<P>
   as blood thinners.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction could:
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the ability of platelets in the blood to clot; a double
dose of anticoagulants from the drug and herb may cause internal
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   If you take:
</P>
<P>
   Kava to reduce anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   And also take:
</P>
<P>
   Levodopa or carbidopa to treat Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction could:
</P>
<P>
   Drug restores levels of a brain chemical; herb interferes with
the same chemical. The combination could worsen symptoms of
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   If you take:
</P>
<P>
   Milk thistle as a
</P>
<P>
   general detoxification aid or to improve liver function.
</P>
<P>
   And also take:
</P>
<P>
   Oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy or regulate the
menstrual cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction could:
</P>
<P>
   Disable the action of a particular enzyme; may reduce absorption
and effectiveness of pills.
</P>
<P>
   If you take:
</P>
<P>
   Cascara sagrada
</P>
<P>
   as a laxative.
</P>
<P>
   And also take:
</P>
<P>
   Thiazide diuretics to reduce high blood pressure by helping the
body eliminate salts and water.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction could:
</P>
<P>
   Cause the body to excrete potassium; potassium deficiency
impairs heart function.

BUSH, ZEDILLO CHRISTEN NEW BORDER BRIDGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ With about 3,000 Mexicans cheering them
on, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
formally opened a new trucks-only bridge across the Rio Grande on
Monday and proclaimed it a new symbol of globalized commerce and
bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The new World Trade Bridge is located several miles outside of
town and is expected to alleviate some of the traffic snarls
produced by the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, one more barrier has fallen. One more divide has been
bridged,'' Bush told the crowd of Mexican dignitaries, laborers and
students who assembled under the shade of a giant new customs
station, where goods from the United States are inspected before
being trucked into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work to extend the benefits of NAFTA from northernmost
Alaska to the tip of Cape Horn. I will call upon the United States
Congress to give me fast track negotiating authority to
aggressively recruit new trade agreements in our hemisphere,'' Bush
said in an oblique reference to his GOP presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sought congressional renewal of fast-track
authority two years ago, but withdrew the request when it became
apparent that labor-backed legislators in his own Democratic Party
might help defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I will look south not as an afterthought but as
a fundamental commitment of my presidency,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who takes credit for fostering friendly relations with
Mexico as governor, said the current mood of economic cooperation
wasn't always a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there have been walls and divides between Mexico
and the U.S. We must be committed to raise the bridges of trade and
friendship and freedom,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that half of the $200 billion annual trade between the
two countries passes through Texas, Bush said ``this partnership
may seem inevitable, but it hasn't always been so.'' He said the
neighbor nations are only now emerging from an era of ``distrust,
division ... divided by our history, our culture and our
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now understand our nations share more than a border. We
have common interests,'' Bush said, adding that the two nations
have been building mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're celebrating today _ not just a bridge of
concrete and steel but a lasting alliance of common hope and
friendship,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo praised Bush for ``understanding our culture'' and
helping improve bilateral relations. The Mexican president, who
leaves office later this year, said the fact that he has christened
six bridges in six years speaks to the improved cooperation.
Zedillo also hailed President Clinton for being a ``great friend''
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-lane bridge cost $128 million, of which Mexico pitched
in $33 million, mainly from a consortium of private Mexican
investors. Under Mexican law, the bridge can only be used by trucks
and commercial vehicles _ a rule that played havoc with Bush's
travel planners.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mexican federal authorities refused a Bush campaign
request for Bush's motorcade to use the bridge to enter Mexico for
the dedication. But the federal officials relented Sunday when
Bush's gubernatorial staff made the same request.
</P>
<P>
   The span, which opened April 15, is the fourth to connect the
two Laredos. The first three were clogged from an estimated 1.3
million vehicle crossings a year _ 38 percent of all ground-based
trade between the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To divert international commercial traffic away from the cities'
connecting downtowns, the Colombia Solidarity &UR;  &LR; bridge was opened 17
miles northwest of Laredo two years ago. It crosses the border
where a small sliver of the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon abuts the
Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   But with more and more traffic being generated by the North
American Free Trade Agreement, the fourth bridge _ this one within
Nuevo Laredo's state of Tamualipas _ had been sought for several
years. Since the fourth bridge's recent opening, Laredo's total
truck crossings have quickly increased by 50 percent, hitting a
local record 8,000 crossings on one day last week.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand for the ceremonies Monday were Tamaulipas Gov.
Tomas Yarrington and U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow. Bush's
entourage included Texas Secretary of State Elton Bomer and
Railroad Commissioner Tony Garza.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush travels to Ohio in the company of four Texas
Democrats _ two current and two former members of the state
Legislature. Aides said Bush and the Democrats, who will visit
Washington, D.C., later in the week, will call for a new bipartisan
tone in the nation's capital, like the one Bush claims to have
established in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Karen Hughes said among those tentatively set to
make the trip are House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San
Angelo; Senate Criminal Justice Committee Chairman Ken Armbrister,
D-Victoria; and former Reps. Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont and Hugo
Berlanga, D-Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Democrats would be on hand to challenge
``unfair'' claims of the Gore campaign that Texas ranks low in
health care, education and other key services. Junell, one of the
state's most influential Democrats and chief overseer of state
spending, endorsed Bush's re-election bid in 1998.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Clinton may be president, and Al Gore may be
vice president, but, as Tony Bennett put it, ``the best is yet to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   The song seemed tailor-made for Monday night's fund-raising gala
in midtown Manhattan with political ambition unbound, both for
Gore, who wants to be president, and Hillary Clinton, who aspires
to move on from first ladyship to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Al and Hillary and Tipper revived their foursome for
the night, chatting and schmoozing with contributors to raise money
for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They raised $2.2 million from more than 1,000 people who
attended the mammoth fund-raiser at the Sheraton Towers. This was
less than the $2.8 million that the president and vice president
raised from about 100 contributors two weeks ago in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore introduced Hillary and Hillary introduced Bill and
Bill introduced Al. It was one of the first role reversals of its
kind, where the vice president was given top billing and presented
as the ranking guest of honor and gave the longest speech.
</P>
<P>
   In his tribute to the vice president, Bill Clinton said, ``I
feel absolutely comfortable putting the future of my daughter and
the grandchildren I hope she'll give us in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee set up two reception rooms at the hotel, one with
Clinton and one with Gore, and guests who had given or raised
$25,000 each shuttled between them before sitting down to a dinner
of filet mignon.
</P>
<P>
   Guests included the actress Lauren Bacall; Jean Kennedy Smith,
sister of President Kennedy; Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the author and
Kennedy confidant; Sam Waterston, the actor; Harvey Weinstein,
co-chairman of the Miramax unit of Walt Disney Co.; Lawrence
Rockefeller, a Republican and New York environmental lawyer; Steve
Rattner, the financier; Martha Stewart, the doyenne of home and
hearth; and Michael Coles, the unsuccessful candidate for the
Senate from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand was Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who was one of the
few establishment politicians to support Gore's primary rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by several other New York politicians, including
Carl McCall, the state controller; Rep. Anthony Weiner of Brooklyn;
and Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The event also drew other long-time major party donors,
including Orin Kramer of New Jersey and Jonathan Tisch, the chief
executive of Loews Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Clinton and Gore, the party raised $26 million
in the first quarter of this year toward its goal for the year of
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Stewart, the comedian, was the master of ceremonies and
began the evening with a few Elian-related comments, saying he
could not ignore the news of federal agents snatching the
6-year-old Cuban boy in a pre-dawn raid. He said Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, Hillary Clinton's opponent in the Senate race, had
complained about ``the use of nonexcessive force'' in the taking of
the boy early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also joked that the federal government had no choice but
to conduct the armed raid. ``Any Jewish person will tell you the
terror that they feel when they hear the phrase `Miami
relatives,''' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seated with Hillary Clinton at dinner was Bernard L. Schwartz,
chairman of Loral Space and Communications Corp., a major
Democratic donor and friend of the Clintons. Loral is the subject
of a Justice Department investigation into whether it violated
export law by giving sophisticated satellite technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   The event caused considerable traffic gridlock across New York.
The Clintons arrived together on Air Force One after their weekend
at Camp David, but left in separate motorcades. Al Gore arrived
later on Air Force Two and Tipper Gore arrived separately. The
foursome posed such a need for heightened security that the
director of the Secret Service traveled with the Clintons on Air
Force One.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores spent the afternoon at the home of their daughter,
Karenna, who arrived late for Monday night's event because, as the
vice president explained it, she had to attend a class at law
school. Her husband, Dr. Drew Schiff, also attended.
