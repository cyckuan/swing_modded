<HEADLINE>  Stocks Dip: Down Ends Off 13.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Monday, forcing investors to  
contend with the possibility that the Dow Jones industrial average 
might not close above 10,000 any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable TV and Internet stocks provided some upward momentum to  
the technology sector. But personal computer shares sold off, 
leaving the Nasdaq composite down 25.33 at 2,395.94 and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index off 2.28 at 1,297.01. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow index crossed 10,000 several times last week in intraday  
trading. On Monday it failed even to do that, meandering throughout 
the session and ending 13.04 lower at 9,890.51. The Dow is still up 
more than 8 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward M. Kerschner, stock market strategist at PaineWebber,  
said that unless interest rates move meaningfully lower or 1999 
earnings growth is significantly higher than current forecasts of 5 
percent to 8 percent, ``expect -- in the best case -- to see the 
market stall around these levels for a good few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no economic news to influence trading today. Interest  
rates edged higher in the bond market, reversing an earlier 
decline. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds closed at 5.57 
percent, up from 5.55 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But cable TV stocks rose on takeover news. MediaOne rose 7 3/4 to  
68 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange after Comcast offered to buy it 
for $44.3 billion. Comcast's Series A shares lost 6 1/2 to 66 3/8 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares also continued to blaze higher, with America  
Online gaining 10 3/4 to 130 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal computer stocks were weaker after Donaldson, Lufkin and  
Jenrette Securities analyst Kevin McCarthy lowered his earnings 
estimate on Dell Computer and said he expects the PC industry to 
grow only 8 percent in 1999. That is down from his previous 
estimate of 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer shares slipped 2 3/8 to 37 7/8.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street has been jittery for weeks about the health of the  
computer market. On Friday, IBM led the Dow industrials lower after 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Thomas Kraemer issued a word of 
caution about the computer maker. On Monday, BancBoston Robertson 
Stephens &AMP; Co.'s Dan Niles followed suit, and IBM's shares fell 1 5/8 
to 167. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were largely responsible for leading the  
market out of its autumn slump, said Tony Dwyer, chief equity 
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. It is crucial that they 
begin to perform better if the market is to continue to improve. 
That isn't likely, given the extremely high prices on technology 
stocks, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're an index watcher, and you're watching the Dow 30  
stocks, you've got to be bullish,'' Dwyer said. ``But if you're an 
investment adviser, you have to look at everything, not just 30 
stocks. And if you're looking at the broader market, you've got to 
sell it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled 824 
million shares, down from the 1.08 billion on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.19 to 610.49, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.49 to 717.36. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.38 to 393.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Japanese stock market was closed for a  
holiday. The DAX index in Frankfurt skidded 1.42 percent, as 
government crises both domestically and on the European Union 
level, as well as uncertainty over the Kosovo conflict, made 
investors wary. The FT-SE 100 index in London eased 0.17 percent, 
and the CAC in Paris gave up 0.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lists More Targets in Beef War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States, already in a trade war with  
Europe over bananas, on Monday targeted $900 million in European 
products in a separate fight over Europe's ban on American beef 
treated with growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the dispute is settled, American consumers could see  
Danish hams, French truffles and Belgian chocolates disappearing 
from store shelves by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 81 European products were put on a preliminary target  
list from which the Clinton administration said it will select a 
final list of goods that will be subject to punitive tariffs of 100 
percent starting as early as June. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher tariffs would effectively double the prices and are  
designed to eliminate the goods from the U.S. market in retaliation 
for lost sales the American cattle industry says it is suffering 
because of Europe's ban on imports of beef containing growth 
hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has put the lost export sales at $500 million  
annually. More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed 
hormones approved by the Food and Drug Administration to cattle to 
make them grow faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The EU's 10-year, arbitrary and scientifically unjustified ban  
on U.S. beef has had a substantial negative impact on U.S. beef 
producers,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Scher, America's trade negotiator on agricultural matters,  
told reporters that all 15 nations in the European Union had 
products on the list in an effort to bring maximum pressure on the 
European Union to drop its beef ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The list, while covering predominantly agriculture products,  
contains a limited number of manufactured goods, including Italian 
moped motorcycles and hair clippers. The agriculture goods included 
canned hams from Denmark, other types of pork, beef, poultry, a 
variety of tomato products, Roquefort cheese, truffles, onions, 
chestnuts, paprika, goose liver, chewing gum, chocolate and mineral 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	This list will be pared after an April 21 public hearing, when  
the administration will give U.S. importers a chance to argue that 
certain products should be excluded from the tariffs because of 
economic harm to their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hit list is in addition to $520 million in European  
products ranging from Scottish cashmere sweaters and French 
handbags to Italian cheese and German coffee makers targeted in a 
separate battle involving European import restrictions that limit 
shipments by American-based banana companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the banana fight, the administration began requiring  
importers to post bonds equal to the 100 percent duties as of March 
3, pending a ruling by the World Trade Organization on the proper 
amount of penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports indicate that WTO arbitrators believe the $520  
million damage estimate in the banana case is too high and should 
be reduced. The administration has said it will comply with 
whatever damage figure the WTO deems appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the banana case and the beef dispute, the United States  
is seeking to impose trade sanctions after the European Union 
refused to abide by WTO rulings in favor of the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union said in a statement that the beef sanction  
threat ``will inevitably have a chilling effect on trade'' between 
the world's two largest trading partners and questioned the $900 
million package of threatened sanctions, saying it was 10 times 
larger than the amount the U.S. side had been claiming in damage 
just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials have resisted sales of hormone-treated beef,  
citing fears about possible long-term health consequences, in a 
dispute that has stretched for more than 10 years. In 1989, the 
United States actually imposed 100 percent tariffs on $94 million 
in products, including canned tomatoes, wine coolers and pet food. 
Those punitive tariffs remained in effect for five years, until 
Europe agreed to allow a scientific panel to study the issue.	   Leonard Condon, vice president for international trade at the 
American Meat Institute, said the U.S. industry would like to see 
the administration try a rotating approach to sanctions that would 
target a different group of European products every six months in 
an effort to bring maximum pressure on the European Union to change 
its position. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing trade tensions between the United States and the  
European Union are coming at a time when the U.S. trade deficit is 
skyrocketing as the global financial crisis cuts into American 
exports of manufactured goods and farm products.

<HEADLINE>  Rodman Says He's Back for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman offered only his word that  
whatever prompted him to leave the Los Angeles Lakers is resolved 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's ever ironed out. They just kind of subside for a  
while,'' he said Sunday after ending a self-imposed layoff to 
address personal issues that kept him from the team for eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be here the rest of the season. I've used up my hall  
pass,'' he said, adding that his return got just the kind of 
reaction from his teammates that he anticipated -- none. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't expecting these guys to come over and shake my hand  
... or anything like that. I expected the team to go on as though 
nothing happened. So, that's what we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played 23 minutes and had four points and six rebounds to  
help the Lakers, who he says fined him $100 per day, beat the 
Orlando Magic 115-104. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time rebounding champion left the Lakers after  
practice March 13, telling coach Kurt Rambis he needed time to 
resolve personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the first four games of a six-game road trip, and the  
Lakers lost three of them after going 9-0 with him in the lineup. 
He said he hadn't given much thought to the team being unbeaten 
when he plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's good that we won (Sunday),'' he said. ``That way I  
don't have to answer all the critics tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman insisted leaving the team had nothing to do with  
drinking, gambling or marital problems. Instead, he said he was 
sorting out whether he wanted to continue playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed spending part of the layoff gambling in Las Vegas.  
He shrugged off a suggestion that that seemed like an odd way to 
confront issues bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's me. A lot of people go to Cancun or Hawaii ... I'm  
different. I do it my way,'' he said, adding that he gave 
retirement serious consideration before wife Carmen Electra 
convinced him to get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game ain't worth that much for me to lose who I am ... I  
would have stayed out. I probably would have gotten kicked out of 
the state of California. But it doesn't matter. I have to keep my 
head and my life together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old forward, who's played on five NBA championship  
teams, did not apologize -- publicly, or to his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't need to do that. I won't do that,'' Rodman said.  
``Like I said, action speaks louder than words. I came back ... 
People have to understand this is me. Just let me do what I've got 
to do and everything will be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates were supportive.  
</P>
<P>
	``He had personal problems and our organization was gracious  
enough to let him go to Vegas and do some gambling and clear his 
head, whatever,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``But he's back. We all 
said what we had to say to him. Hopefully, he doesn't do that 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 games, Rodman has averaged 2.1 points and 9.9 minutes  
while playing about 24 minutes per outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can grab a stat sheet, and what he brings won't show up,''  
teammate Derek Harper said. ``But his energy and his knowledge of 
the game, his defensive ability, his rebounding ability, it helps 
our basketball team. Hopefully, he's going to be here the rest of 
the season. That's what I hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman arrived in town at about 3 a.m. and rode the team bus to  
Orlando Arena where he spoke briefly with Rambis before heading to 
the opposing locker room to meet with the Magic's Chuck Daly, who 
coached Rodman in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just asked him if he was all right,'' Rambis said. ``He said  
he was all right, and that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Rodman assured him he will not leave the team  
again, the coach said: ``I don't think anybody can make those 
assurances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis became coach on Feb. 26, the same day Rodman first played  
for the Lakers. He declined to speculate on what might happen if 
the forward leaves the team again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to cross that bridge if and when it happens,''  
Rambis said. ``I'm not going to sit here with hard and fast rules 
to what happens in future situations.''

<HEADLINE> Comcast To Buy MediaOne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the cable industry's biggest merger ever,  
Comcast Corp. is buying MediaOne Group Inc., trying to hasten the 
day when cable companies become media supermarkets offering TV, 
phone service and high-speed Internet hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	The $44.3 billion stock swap deal, announced Monday, would  
combine the No. 3 and No. 4 players in the country and is the 
latest in a string of mergers in the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It would allow Comcast to nearly double its subscribers,  
although it would still remain third behind Time Warner Inc. and 
AT&AMP;T's cable division, the former Tele-Communications Inc. The new 
Comcast would have 11 million subscribers in 33 states. 
</P>
<P>
	That's cause for worry among consumer advocates, who decry the  
fact that cable rates have been rising well above the rate of 
inflation. Government rate regulations have been relaxed in recent 
years and will end on March 31. That, critics fear, could allow 
these giant companies to raise rates even faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the dramatic effect of relaxed public oversight and it  
will only continue now,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of 
Consumers Union's Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable operators are scrambling to merge so they will have the  
financial clout and subscriber base to offer an ever-increasing 
number of channels and add new services such as telephones and 
Internet access, which are expected to become widely available in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable TV's popularity continues to grow and the advent of  
digital TV promises room for even more channels. More than 77 
percent of the nation's 98.1 million TV-viewing homes had cable 
last year, up from nearly 70 percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cable is being thought of in a different way, and you must  
have largeness to be able to survive,'' said Barry Hyman, a media 
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's $44 billion purchase of Tele-Communications was the  
biggest deal up until now. Earlier this month, Adelphia 
Communications Corp. announced it would buy Century Communications 
Corp. for $3.6 billion to become the nation's fifth-largest cable 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies defend their rate increases, saying they are  
needed to invest in new services. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said Monday the company  
has already disclosed it would raise rates 5 percent this year and 
the merger will not change those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Comcast will own cable systems throughout the eastern  
half of the United States, as well as California, Nevada, Colorado, 
New Mexico and Arizona. By the end of this year, 70 percent of 
Comcast's cable systems will be upgraded to handle two-way traffic 
and begin launching new services, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne is a spinoff of the western regional phone company U S  
West Inc., which in late 1997 gave up on the idea that cable and 
phone providers could complement each other. 
</P>
<P>
	But the union of cable and phones has reemerged as a key to the  
future of these companies. AT&AMP;T plans to offer telephone service 
through Tele-Communications' cables and it has forged an alliance 
with Time Warner to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said Comcast is also pursuing a telephone deal with  
AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cable systems, Philadelphia-based Comcast's  
interests include stakes in the E! Entertainment cable network, the 
QVC home-shopping channel, the National Hockey League's 
Philadelphia Flyers and the National Basketball Association's 
Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne, based in Englewood, Colo., also has interests in  
wireless communications businesses outside the United States 
serving more than 3 million customers, but will explore selling 
those operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined companies generated more than $8 billion in revenue  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, MediaOne shareholders would receive 1.1 Comcast  
shares for each of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent MediaOne shares soaring $7.75, or 13 percent, to  
$68.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast stock tumbled 9 percent, as often happens to an  
acquiring company in a stock swap. It fell $6.50 to $66.37 1/2 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall in Comcast stock decreased the value of the deal,  
originally pegged at $48.65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne's president, CEO and chairman, Charles Lillis, will  
become vice chairman of Comcast and join its board of directors, 
along with three additional MediaOne designees. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast will also inherit MediaOne's nearly 25 percent stake in  
Time Warner Entertainment, the division that holds most of Time 
Warner's cable systems, the Warner Bros. studio and HBO. Time 
Warner said it supports the deal.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Interest Rates Fall / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $6.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.375 percent, down from 4.470 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.420 percent, down from 4.530 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since Jan. 25, when the  
bills sold at a rate of 4.305 percent. The six-month rate was the 
lowest since Feb. 1, when the rate was 4.390 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.498 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,889.40, and 4.597 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,776.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 4.74 
percent last week from 4.77 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Dip: Down Ends Off 13.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Monday, forcing investors to  
contend with the possibility that the Dow Jones industrial average 
might not close above 10,000 any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable TV and Internet stocks provided some upward momentum to  
the technology sector. But personal computer shares sold off, 
leaving the Nasdaq composite down 25.33 at 2,395.94 and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index off 2.28 at 1,297.01. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow index crossed 10,000 several times last week in intraday  
trading. On Monday it failed even to do that, meandering throughout 
the session and ending 13.04 lower at 9,890.51. The Dow is still up 
more than 8 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward M. Kerschner, stock market strategist at PaineWebber,  
said that unless interest rates move meaningfully lower or 1999 
earnings growth is significantly higher than current forecasts of 5 
percent to 8 percent, ``expect -- in the best case -- to see the 
market stall around these levels for a good few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no economic news to influence trading today. Interest  
rates edged higher in the bond market, reversing an earlier 
decline. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds closed at 5.57 
percent, up from 5.55 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But cable TV stocks rose on takeover news. MediaOne rose 7 3/4 to  
68 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange after Comcast offered to buy it 
for $44.3 billion. Comcast's Series A shares lost 6 1/2 to 66 3/8 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares also continued to blaze higher, with America  
Online gaining 10 3/4 to 130 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal computer stocks were weaker after Donaldson, Lufkin and  
Jenrette Securities analyst Kevin McCarthy lowered his earnings 
estimate on Dell Computer and said he expects the PC industry to 
grow only 8 percent in 1999. That is down from his previous 
estimate of 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer shares slipped 2 3/8 to 37 7/8.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street has been jittery for weeks about the health of the  
computer market. On Friday, IBM led the Dow industrials lower after 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Thomas Kraemer issued a word of 
caution about the computer maker. On Monday, BancBoston Robertson 
Stephens &AMP; Co.'s Dan Niles followed suit, and IBM's shares fell 1 5/8 
to 167. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were largely responsible for leading the  
market out of its autumn slump, said Tony Dwyer, chief equity 
strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. It is crucial that they 
begin to perform better if the market is to continue to improve. 
That isn't likely, given the extremely high prices on technology 
stocks, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're an index watcher, and you're watching the Dow 30  
stocks, you've got to be bullish,'' Dwyer said. ``But if you're an 
investment adviser, you have to look at everything, not just 30 
stocks. And if you're looking at the broader market, you've got to 
sell it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled 824 
million shares, down from the 1.08 billion on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.19 to 610.49, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.49 to 717.36. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.38 to 393.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Japanese stock market was closed for a  
holiday. The DAX index in Frankfurt skidded 1.42 percent, as 
government crises both domestically and on the European Union 
level, as well as uncertainty over the Kosovo conflict, made 
investors wary. The FT-SE 100 index in London eased 0.17 percent, 
and the CAC in Paris gave up 0.54 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Is a Big Betting Favorite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- This city's oddsmakers aren't taking any  
chances with Duke's chances of winning a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils are such a prohibitive favorite in Las Vegas  
sports books that bettors would have to wager $7 for every dollar 
they could win on Duke winning its last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Odds vary at each sports book, but most have had to make Duke  
such a big favorite to try to discourage bets on the Blue Devils 
and get some money bet on the other three teams in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the biggest favorites we've ever had,'' said  
Pete Korner, who helps set odds for sports books at Las Vegas 
Sports Consultants. ``We're just trying to get some money on the 
other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korner opened Duke at a 1-3 favorite, but most sports books went  
well beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Las Vegas Hilton, bettors wanting to put money on Duke on  
Monday found the Blue Devils a 1-7 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not getting that many bets on Duke now,'' book manager  
Chuck Esposito said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Duke the heavy favorite, bettors can get 9-2 on Connecticut  
winning the title, 10-1 on Michigan State and 12-1 on Ohio State at 
the Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is such a big favorite because the public wants to see if  
they can keep winning like they have,'' Esposito said. ``They 
really haven't been tested in the second half of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is listed as an 11 1/2-point favorite in Saturday's semifinal  
against Michigan State, while Connecticut is a 5 1/2-point favorite 
over Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA tournament generally is a big betting event at casino  
sports books, second in total volume only to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the tournament began, bettors could wager not only on  
individual games but on which team would win the national 
championship.

<HEADLINE> Cal Coach Hits the Deli Circuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ben Braun has his priorities, even if the  
California coach is busy preparing for the NIT semifinals: Delis 
first, beating Oregon next. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving in New York on Sunday, Braun immediately headed  
to the Carnegie Deli, where he had matzoh ball soup, corned beef 
and pastrami, the start of his own personal deli tour of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While some players may visit the Statue of Liberty or see a  
Broadway show the next few days, others are set to join Braun on 
his deli jaunts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a couple of guys who are on the first team All-World  
eating team, and they will probably make the rounds with me,'' 
Braun said Monday. ``I've got some scouting reports, and we've got 
a couple of stops in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braun wouldn't reveal his final choices, but mumbled something  
about a ``few on Second Avenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promises to take a time out Tuesday night, when California  
(20-11) plays Oregon (19-11) in the opening NIT semifinal at 
Madison Square Garden. Xavier (24-10) plays Clemson (19-14) in the 
other -- the first ever meeting between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third matchup between Pac-10 foes Cal and Oregon,  
with the Ducks winning the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throw out the first two,'' said Braun, whose Bears reached the  
semis with wins over Fresno State, DePaul and Colorado State. 
``Pride is on the line. Now we have a chance to play for an NIT 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon coach Ernie Kent says the Bears may have the emotional  
edge, but the previous games were far from blowouts. Oregon won in 
Berkeley 71-69 in overtime on Jan. 2, and then won 93-82 in the 
regular-season finale in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in tough, hard battles with them,'' said Kent,  
whose Ducks beat Georgia Tech, Wyoming and Texas Christian to make 
it to New York. ``We know each other very well, so we don't have to 
go overboard on preparation. But we will have to combat that energy 
burst they'll bring having lost to us a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ducks, bidding for their first 20-win season in 23 years,  
are led by forwards A.D. Smith (13.1 points) and Alex Scales (14.5 
points), with guard Terik Brown (12.1 points) running the show; The 
Bears, making their first appearance at Madison Square Garden since 
1946, counter with guards Geno Carlisle (15.6 points) and Thomas 
Kilgore (14.9 points). 
</P>
<P>
	Of the four NIT semifinalists, perhaps Xavier has the most  
incentive. The Musketeers, who had a 21-10 mark after losing to 
Temple in the Atlantic-10 tournament, were stunned when they were 
left out of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But after beating Toledo, Wake Forest and Princeton to reach the  
NIT's final four, coach Skip Prosser is satisfied with the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot say enough how grateful we are to be here,'' Prosser  
said. ``I've never been through this before. But I talked to 
coaches who have been in a situation where they should have gone to 
the NCAAs and didn't. And to a man, they said the NIT was a great 
experience, especially if you get to New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xavier won the 1958 NIT.  
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, which will have a slight height advantage over the  
Musketeers, is looking for its first postseason championship of any 
kind since winning the Southern Conference 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think coming to New York will be a springboard for the  
future,'' Tigers coach Larry Shyatt said. ``It was also important 
for them to get another road win before coming here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson earned its trip to New York by beating Georgia and  
Rutgers on the road and Butler at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers are led by guard Terrell McIntyre, who averages 17.9  
points per game, and boast a frontline of 6-8 Harold Jamison, 6-9 
Andrius Jurkunas and 6-10 Tom Wideman. Jamison averages 12.6 points 
and 9.9 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Xavier, though, may have the best player on the court in 6-8  
senior James Posey, the A-10's defensive player of the year who 
also averages 17 points and 9.3 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Musketeers' comeback 65-58 win over Princeton on March  
17, Posey had 19 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's winners play for the NIT title on Thursday  
night, preceded by a consolation game.

<HEADLINE> 'Shakespeare in Love' Wins 7 Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a night of surprises and upsets, the  
romantic comedy ``Shakespeare in Love'' won seven Academy Awards on 
Sunday, including best picture and best actress for Gwyneth 
Paltrow. Steven Spielberg's bloody World War II epic ``Saving 
Private Ryan'' won the prize for directing and four other Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Benigni, as an Italian Jew shielding his son from the  
horrors of the Holocaust in ``Life is Beautiful,'' pulled off a 
stunning first -- winning as best actor in a foreign film. The 
tragi-comic film, which Benigni also wrote and directed, won 
additional Oscars for foreign film and dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English,''  
he said, as he leapt to the stage for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow, never before nominated, was honored for her role as the  
object of a young Bard's affections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence,'' she  
said, sobbing, as she named her fellow nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Judi Dench, who played the imperious but fair-minded Queen  
Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James Coburn, the 
alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction,'' won best supporting 
Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' which led all contenders with 13  
nominations, also picked up Oscars for original screenplay, art 
direction, costume design and musical or comedy score. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth,'' another best picture nominee, won just one award,  
for makeup, while the fifth contender, ``The Thin Red Line,'' 
Terrence Malick's comeback movie about WWII in the Pacific, was 
shut out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' also took prizes for cinematography,  
editing, sound and sound effects editing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I allowed to say I really wanted this?'' Spielberg joked as  
he accepted his second directing Oscar. His first was for 
``Schindler's List'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg earnestly expressed gratitude to all families who lost  
sons in World War II, and addressing his father, a veteran, said: 
``Dad, this is for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split between best picture and director marked the first  
time since 1989 the prizes went to different movies. That year, 
``Driving Miss Daisy'' won as best picture, while Oliver Stone was 
named best director for ``Born on the Fourth of July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unflinchingly realistic ``Private Ryan'' had looked as if it  
might become a runaway favorite early in the evening when it picked 
up the editing and cinematography, which are often precursors of 
best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Shakespeare in Love,'' with its clever dialogue and  
showbusiness anachronisms, obviously entranced the Academy's 
voters. It was what Hollywood has seen little of in recent years: a 
literate, believable romance that had a lot of fun -- not to mention 
beautiful and handsome stars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the longest Oscars awards show ever (four hours, two  
minutes), the most controversial moment came and went quickly, as 
director Elia Kazan -- reviled by some for naming names during the 
McCarthy era -- stepped out to accept a lifetime achievement award. 
Many members of the audience applauded heartily, some stood, while 
others, like actors Nick Nolte and Ed Harris, sat silently. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Benigni, the only performer in a foreign language film  
to win an Oscar was Sophia Loren for ``Two Women'' in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, it was Miss Loren who presented him with his first  
award of the night. The perpetually ebullient Benigni clambered 
over the backs of seats and hopped onto the stage after Loren 
openly rooted for her fellow Italian and announced his foreign film 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to kiss everybody,'' said Benigni.  
</P>
<P>
	Another Holocaust film, ``The Last Days,'' won the documentary  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	Dench, who made an indelible impression despite her brief screen  
time in the romantic comedy, held up her gold statuette and said 
with a smile: ``I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should 
only get a little bit of him.' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Oscar for the 64-year-old British stage  
actress, who had been nominated last year for playing a different 
queen, Victoria, in ``Mrs. Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn, 70, had never been nominated.	   ``I've been doing this work for like over half my life, and I  
finally got one right, I guess,'' said the veteran actor, whose 
dozens of films include ``Our Man Flint'' and ``The Magnificent 
Seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them you do for money, some of them you do for love.  
This is a love child,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Whoopi Goldberg, who changed costumes repeatedly to mimic  
film characters, got the show off to a rousing start when she came 
out in full regalia as Elizabeth -- who figured in two of this 
year's contenders -- getting a rousing ovation, then a laugh when 
she announced with an accent that was more Bette Davis than 
British, ``I am the African Queen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She joked about being the last master of ceremonies of the  
century and millennium, saying: ``I am the last 20th century fox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And referring to this year's furor over the special Oscar for  
Kazan, Goldberg joked: ``I thought the blacklist was Hattie 
McDaniel and me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a runaway favorite helped make the 71st Academy  
Awards among the most anticipated in recent history. With two 
well-received films as the leaders, the campaign for votes was 
conducted largely in Hollywood trade paper and newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax, which often stages big-money campaigns for its Oscar  
candidates and succeeded two years ago with a best-picture win for 
``The English Patient,'' laid out millions for ``Shakespeare in 
Love'' ads. 
</P>
<P>
	DreamWorks was forced to counter with an estimated $4 million to  
promote its ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle of the dueling studios prompted calls for  
restrictions on campaign expenses. But, as in the political arena, 
no one has proposed how to limit the expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kazan controversy started after Karl Malden proposed an  
honorary award for the director of ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' 
``On the Waterfront,'' ``East of Eden,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' 
and other classics. The board of governors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan had long been criticized because he named names of his  
former Communist Party comrades before the House Un-American 
Activities committee in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	After the academy announced the honor, he was attacked as a  
traitor by those whose defiance of the committee placed them on the 
industry's blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor over the Kazan award overshadowed another honorary  
Oscar this year -- the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to longtime 
producer-director Norman Jewison, whose credits include ``The 
Cincinnati Kid,'' ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``Fiddler on the 
Roof'' and ``Moonstruck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian-born Jewison was hailed by the president of the  
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a ``superior 
craftsman through four decades of moviemaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewison's films have earned 45 Academy Award nominations and  
more than 10 Oscars, including a best picture award for the 1967 
film ``In the Heat of the Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's awards returned to the small but classy Dorothy  
Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center after several 
years at the larger, but less glamorous Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was one of the last in a borrowed hall. If all goes  
well, the academy will present the awards in its own theater in a 
brand-new complex on Hollywood Boulevard in 2001. It will mark 
Oscar's first appearance in the Hollywood district of the city 
since 1960.

<HEADLINE> Mob Boss Tied To Japan Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A police investigation has found a mob boss is the  
second largest individual investor in Japan's biggest airline, a 
newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe Tadamasa Goto, who heads a gang affiliated with  
the Yamaguchi-gumi, the nation's largest organized crime syndicate, 
has acquired 1 million shares in Japan Airlines Co., said the 
Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan police would not comment  
on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japan Airlines spokesman said the company couldn't immediately  
confirm who owns its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't check the register of shareholders until the end of  
the fiscal year,'' said spokesman Geoffrey Tudor. ``The register of 
shareholders will be sealed until Mar. 31.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JAL's fiscal year ends on that date.  
</P>
<P>
	The reported stake exceeds a 300,000 share minimum for stock  
owners wanting to submit proposals to management at the airline's 
annual shareholder meeting, which will likely be held in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is not large enough to rank among JAL's top nine overall  
investors, which include Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. and 
the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yamaguchi-gumi, based in the port city of Kobe in western  
Japan, has about 18,300 members around the country, according to 
the National Police Agency. Goto's gang is based southwest of 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	JAL has had trouble with racketeers in the past.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, police arrested two men on suspicion of extorting  
$155,000 from the airline. The men allegedly demanded money in 
return for promising to ensure trouble-free shareholders' meetings 
for the airline.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Braces for Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anticipating settlement talks, Microsoft is  
reviewing parts of its antitrust case where it believes it could 
offer enough flexibility to satisfy government concerns over its 
behavior, people close to the case said today. 
</P>
<P>
	No negotiations are planned currently, these sources said, and  
any settlement of the landmark antitrust fight is seen as unlikely 
because both sides remain far apart on some core issues. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous effort to reach compromise, last May, broke down in  
Washington, and Microsoft already has started to formulate plans to 
appeal any trial verdict. The judge is expected to rule this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft has said it is willing to change some ways it does  
business with other high-tech companies, including the nation's 
computer manufacturers, Internet providers and others. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft wields its considerable influence to force other 
companies into restrictive agreements to exclude potential 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	These contracts, for example, include limits that Microsoft  
places on computer-makers over ways they can modify its dominant 
Windows operating system software sold with their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other contracts limit how Internet providers can distribute  
browser software from other companies, such as Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always said we are willing to work with the government  
to address their concerns about our contract language, or to 
formalize some of the flexibility that computer manufacturers have 
today in an informal way,'' said a company official who requested 
anonymity. ``But any settlement must preserve Microsoft's ability 
to innovate and add new features to our products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government also charges that Microsoft uses the market  
dominance of Windows -- used by roughly 90 percent of the world's 
personal computers -- to help maintain what it describes as the 
company's monopoly power. The company established the popularity of 
its own Internet browser software after bundling it with newer 
versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Microsoft introduced the latest version of its  
Internet browser software, which includes a new feature allowing 
customers to listen seamlessly to digital radio broadcasts while 
browsing the Web -- similar to rival technology already offered by 
Seattle-based RealNetworks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft considers itself under orders to explore a settlement  
from the judge, who advised lawyers for both sides to use wisely a 
lengthy recess in the trial. The case is expected to resume no 
earlier than April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do believe we've established a strong legal record on the  
key issues in this case,'' the Microsoft official said. ``But we 
also believe that settling this case without the need for more 
protracted litigation would be good for everyone concerned, 
particularly for the industry as a whole and for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Key players for any settlement talks will be in Washington this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general for the 19 states suing Microsoft along with  
the Justice Department expect to be here starting Tuesday for a 
previously scheduled conference, and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
also is visiting later this week on a book tour, although he isn't 
planning to meet with government lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Panel Opens Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The U.N. Human Rights Commission opened its annual  
six-week session today with a plea for more efforts to prevent 
abuses and punish the guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We meet today at the end of a century which has witnessed  
brutality on a scale without historical precedent,'' said Mary 
Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. ``It has also 
charted a new course in the protection of human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Protection and prevention must define the Commission's work in  
the years to come,'' she told the 53-nation watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a former president of the Irish Republic, said more  
must be done to implement existing international law and try those 
accused of crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-week commission meeting, violations in countries  
including Iraq, Sudan and Myanmar as well as the Yugoslav province 
of Kosovo will come under the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union announced today that it had decided not to  
press for formal condemnation of China, which has recently clamped 
down on dissidents. The West dropped long-running efforts to push 
through a censure motion on China last year after developing 
countries repeatedly sided with Beijing to block the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU could not agree on a resolution, but said in a statement  
it would use the Geneva meeting to ``express its growing concerns 
on the human rights situation in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese President Jiang Zemin will meet Robinson in Geneva on  
Friday, but will not address the commission. Robinson said in a 
statement that she continued to be ``concerned about human rights 
issues in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A four-man U.N. technical team returned from Beijing after  
giving advice to authorities on how to ratify two international 
covenants on political and economic rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Many foreign dignitaries are due to speak -- including eight  
foreign ministers on Tuesday. Dozens of non-governmental 
organizations are on hand to lobby for their causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Andersen of Ireland was elected president of the meeting at  
its opening session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ours is an island still seeking to finally heal the scars of  
history,'' she said. ``Like so many countries here we have learned 
the long and hard way how much human rights matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting opened under unprecedented security, with the U.N.  
compound barricaded by barbed wire and guarded by armed soldiers to 
prevent Kurds from invading the building to protest Turkey's 
detention of their leader, Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 Kurds began a demonstration today in front of U.N.  
headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Big Holyfield-Lewis Bets Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A late flood of money -- perhaps more than $1  
million -- was bet on Evander Holyfield just before he stepped into 
the ring with Lennox Lewis, drawing the attention of investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Gaming Control Board confirmed Monday that it is  
looking into the bets made at a number of Las Vegas sports books in 
the hours before the March 13 fight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of the money ended up being refunded to bettors when  
the fight was ruled a draw, even though Holyfield appeared to have 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe by gambling regulators comes on top of investigations  
by a Manhattan grand jury, a state Senate committee and the New 
York State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada investigators are primarily concerned with whether the  
money was bet on behalf of one individual or group by so-called 
``messenger'' bettors, which is against Nevada law. But a source 
close to the probe told The Associated Press that the agency was 
also working with out-of-state agencies investigating the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at any betting patterns we can find,'' said  
Keith Copher, chief of enforcement for the agency that regulates 
Nevada casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $1 million may have been bet just before the fight in  
Las Vegas sports books and those run out of the Caribbean, causing 
the odds favoring Holyfield to jump. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime Las Vegas bettor said the betting pattern was so  
unusual that he suspected the money was bet with inside knowledge 
of what the outcome might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a real scam, except it didn't work,'' said Lem  
Banker, one of a very few sports bettors who has made a living over 
the years wagering on sporting events and is well respected in the 
industry. ``There was a lot of what I call `unnatural money' 
wagered on Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had been a slight favorite in the week before the  
fight, but the bout was nearly a pick 'em by Saturday, said Pete 
Korner of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which sets the odds for 
most Las Vegas sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	Then just before the fight began close to midnight EST, a rush  
of money pushed odds to as much as 8-5 and 9-5 on Holyfield, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously somebody or some group was playing Holyfield very  
late,'' Korner said. ``They did their homework well waiting for the 
price to come down before they bet it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Lupo, sports book director at the Stardust hotel, said the  
late Holyfield money caused the line to move from minus 130 to 
minus 160 (8-5) just before the fight. But Lupo said he believes 
the bets were not out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see any unusual betting,'' Lupo said. ``It was all  
small money, no real large wagers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mirage, which has one of the largest casino sports books,  
had no comment, according to spokeswoman Jenn Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, investigators want to know whether the money  
was bet by ``messenger'' bettors who fanned out to various casinos 
to make bets at the direction of one bettor. 
</P>
<P>
	Messenger betting is done primarily by big bettors to get bets  
down at various casinos without the odds being raised too quickly 
and to avoid the identification forms that must be filled out for 
any bet of $10,000 or more.

<HEADLINE> Break-Ins Point to Bombing Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDREWS, N.C. (AP) -- Bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph may be  
the intruder who broke into up to 12 mountain homes from July to 
January to steal food and toilet paper or sometimes just to get a 
shower and a shave, a federal agent said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The break-ins were very similar and occurred in a defined area,  
said Woody Enderson of the Southeast Bomb Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do feel they are a strong indication of his presence,'' he  
said, despite the absence of hair or other evidence that might 
specifically link the break-ins to Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
	The break-ins have happened since July, the last confirmed  
sighting of Rudolph, Enderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the break-ins as very significant in the hunt for  
Rudolph, the suspect in a fatal Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic 
bombing last year and others in Atlanta, including the 1996 Olympic 
Park bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, someone wouldn't go into someone's house to take a  
shower and shave,'' Enderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the leads, Enderson and other members of the task force  
announced a reduction in the number of agents involved in the 
search in the Nantahala Forest in western North Carolina. He did 
not give specifics on the reduction but said it had been planned 
for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Enderson reiterated a long-standing belief by members of the  
task force that all of their leads indicate that Rudolph is still 
in the area and that he is not receiving any help.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Judge Had Been Fired Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The judge at the center of the dispute surrounding  
the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis draw was dismissed by another 
boxing organization a year ago for being ``a loner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Robinson, president of the fringe World Boxing Union, said  
he had no problems with the way Eugenia Williams scored bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider the WBU to be a family and Eugenia Williams didn't  
fit in,'' he said. ``She was a loner and not a team player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, reached at her city hall office in Atlantic City,  
N.J., where is she is a clerk, refused to take a call from The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, appointed by the IBF for Lewis-Holyfield bout, has  
appeared before a New York state Senate hearing concerning her role 
in the fight at Madison Square Garden on March 13. 
</P>
<P>
	She judged the fight 115-113 in favor of Holyfield. However,  
after watching a replay, she said she would have scored it 
differently had photographers not impeded her view. 
</P>
<P>
	English judge Larry O'Connell scored it 115-115, while South  
African judge Stan Christodoulou favored Lewis, 116-113. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBU, headquartered in Britain, dismissed 30 judges last year  
and Williams was among them. She has been a judge 10 years. 
Robinson said she worked at about one championship fight per year 
for the WBU for four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In another matter, the WBU said that starting April 1, judges at  
its championship bouts will score on a 20-point system instead of 
the current 10-point system. Robinson said the 20-point system 
would allow greater flexibility.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky's Book Tour Draws Hundreds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Admirers said they wanted a page of history.  
Collectors hunted for an autograph. Critics scoffed at the 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds turned out Monday for Monica Lewinsky's first -- and  
perhaps only -- stop in the United States to promote her biography 
``Monica's Story.'' Some arrived as early as 7 a.m., milling in a 
line that stretched into the street outside the bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern, a Los Angeles native, arrived an  
hour late for the 12:30 p.m. signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica looked strong, confident and in charge,'' said  
Elizabeth Jewels, who took an afternoon break from work to get her 
copy of the book signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the media, only photographers and cameramen were allowed  
inside -- briefly and only a handful at a time. Other journalists 
were barred from entering Brentano's Bookstore. Ms. Lewinsky was 
cordoned off at the back of the store, hidden from onlookers 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who managed to enter, the posted guidelines were  
clear: ``Absolutely no memorabilia, no photographs posed or 
otherwise.'' A book receipt was required, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd inside was respectful, unlike stops she made on a book  
tour in England and Scotland, where she was greeted by placards 
bearing such messages as ``Take her back, Bill.'' The only sign 
Monday read: ``Monica Rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the onlookers were admirers, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's hysterical not historical,'' said Herb Zoolman of  
Woodland Hills. ``I wouldn't want to help make her rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some were taken aback by the commotion generated by the signing,  
which promoters touted as Lewinsky's only appearance in the United 
States. She was expected to return to Britain to resume her 19-stop 
book tour there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get this,'' said Taly Boczan, a 20-year-old literature  
major at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was having 
lunch nearby. ``This is so bizarre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, ``You can't pass up the opportunity to see  
Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many saw Lewinsky Sunday night, when she turned out for the  
annual Vanity Fair post-Oscar fest at Morton's. She mugged for 
cameras before disappearing inside the fern-laden Melrose Avenue 
eatery.

<HEADLINE>  Oscar Parties Rage Into Wee Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- After a long Oscars ceremony, they  
partied like it's 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners, losers, also-rans. Famous, infamous, unknowns. They  
vamped, got kissy-faced and celebrated at post-Oscar parties raging 
into the wee hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	After the official academy Governors Ball at the downtown Los  
Angeles Music Center, limousines fanned out across Southern 
California. Many headed to West Hollywood, the most popular 
destination with six major bashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Best-director Steven Spielberg his ``Saving Private Ryan'' star  
Tom Hanks showed up at the DreamWorks-Paramount party at Barnaby's, 
where guests dined on raw oysters, shiitake mushroom pizza and 
chicken pot pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Handshaking. Hugs. Air kisses. Make that big wet kisses from  
Italy's ``Life is Beautiful'' Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni. 
</P>
<P>
	There was head-shaking, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Monica Lewinsky, shrouded in a black gown, showed up at Morton's  
for the annual Vanity Fair fest. She mugged for cameras before 
disappearing inside the fern-laden Melrose Avenue eatery. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern was still inside when Jay Leno,  
king of the Lewinsky jokesters, strolled past the giant Oscar 
topiary at the Morton's entrance and went inside. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known if Leno encountered Ms. Lewinsky, but actress  
Uma Thurman could be seen talking to her at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an eclectic crowd: Madonna dancing with Ricky Martin,  
Edward Burns of ``Saving Private Ryan'' arm-in-arm with actress 
Heather Graham and ``Sling Blade'' star Dwight Yoakam with actress 
Bridget Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Hopkins, Jim Carrey, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Steve  
Martin, Tim Allen, Willem Dafoe, Mariah Carey were all there. 
Steven Baldwin -- blond hair slicked-back, wearing black leather 
pants and an ankle-length overcoat -- also showed up. So did Ed 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only party we're going to go to. We're not into  
this kind of stuff that much,'' McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pagani, Elton John was holding court in a purple Versace  
suit. His annual AIDS bash raises more than $300,000 and partygoers 
included Janet Jackson, Rod Stewart and Leann Rimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Just up the street on Sunset Boulevard, the online Hollywood  
Stock Exchange and Excite! gathering dubbed Rock the Oscars 
featured a performance by Beck on the House of Blues stage. The 
computer-equipped party, described as a ``convergence of the 
digital world and Hollywood,'' allowed Internet users to contact 
partygoers online. 
</P>
<P>
	The pink and posh Beverly Hills Hotel hosted the Night of 100  
Stars party to raise money for Martin Scorsese's film preservation 
foundation. Ernest Borgnine, Elliot Gould, Tony Curtis and Rod 
Steiger were among those invited. 
</P>
<P>
	When the curtain came down on the 71st annual Academy Awards, a  
fleet of stretch limousines were idling outside. But departures 
were delayed for the obligatory rounds at the Governors Ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it networking: Lots of let's-do-lunch and  
have-your-people-call-my-people banter. Governors Ball guests were 
greeted by the sounds of a string band, appropriate considering the 
age of the majority of the guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those inside was 89-year-old director Elia Kazan, whose  
lifetime achievement award created a stir in Hollywood. Sitting at 
a table with Karl Malden, Kazan said: ``I'm glad it's over, but it 
was a nice evening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Oscar winners making the rounds of the ball were Benigni,  
James Coburn, Judi Dench and Gwyneth Paltrow. But most of the stars 
were boarding limos an hour later to hit other parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Today is Tuesday, March 23, the 82nd day of 1999. There are 283  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On March 23, 1775, Patrick Henry made his famous call for  
America's independence from Britain, telling the Virginia 
Provincial Convention, ``Give me liberty, or give me death!'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1792, Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 94 in G Major (the  
``Surprise'' symphony) was performed publicly for the first time, 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1806, explorers Lewis and Clark, having reached the Pacific  
coast, began their return journey. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1919, Benito Mussolini founded his Fascist political movement  
in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, the German Reichstag adopted the Enabling Act, which  
effectively granted Adolf Hitler dictatorial legislative powers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, during World War II, the U.S. government began  
evacuating Japanese-Americans from West Coast homes to detention 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, Pakistan became an independent republic within the  
British Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, America's first two-person space flight blasted off  
from Cape Kennedy with astronauts Virgil I. Grissom and John W. 
Young aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, President Reagan first proposed development of  
technology to intercept enemy missiles -- a proposal that came to be 
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, as well as ``Star 
Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Dr. Barney Clark, recipient of a permanent artificial

<HEADLINE> Al Unser Jr. Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Al Unser Jr. underwent two hours of surgery  
Monday so surgeons could insert a metal plate into his injured 
right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, who broke the ankle during a crash in the Marlboro Grand  
Prix of Miami on Sunday, was listed in good condition Monday night. 
He is expected to be released from Methodist Hospital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no surprises or problems during the surgery. ... He  
will be staying in Indianapolis for the remainder of the week and 
is expected to start therapy next week,'' said his surgeon, Dr. 
Terry Trammell. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Indy 500 winner could be back racing in four to six  
weeks, but won't be able to walk for eight to 12 weeks, Trammell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's accident, Unser broke two bones in his ankle and  
also sustained a small break in his left knee and tore a ligament. 
Doctors have fitted his knee with a brace. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's accident, Unser collided with rookie Naoki Hattori  
in the first turn of the first lap the Florida race. Hattori 
suffered a broken leg in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser was trying to end a three-year winless streak while coping  
with his 12-year-old daughter's sudden paralysis as the result of a 
viral infection on the spinal cord.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Desjardins Out 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia defenseman Eric Desjardins will  
sit out at least 10 days after hyperextending his knee during the 
Flyers' victory over the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Desjardins partially injured his ACL and bruised the bone, Dr.  
Art Batolozzi said Monday after the defenseman underwent an MRI at 
Pennsylvania Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knee's not really painful, but I'm a little bit frustrated  
and disappointed. I was just coming back from being sick and then 
this injury puts me out of the lineup again,'' said Desjardins, who 
will wear a knee brace. ``I'm happy it's not that bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Flyers were in Toronto on Monday night to face  
the Maple Leafs. Meanwhile, rehabilitation exercises for Desjardins 
started Monday and will last at least 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to allow his knee to calm down. (His return) will  
depend on how quickly his knee becomes comfortable with skating 
again,'' Batolozzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Desjardins left in the final period of Sunday's 5-4 victory  
against the Red Wings, which ended the Flyers' 12-game winless 
streak.

<HEADLINE> Albright Makes Appeal on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appealed  
today to senators and House members to amend or defeat foreign 
affairs spending proposals set for votes this week, saying the 
cutbacks contemplated from administration requests are ``outrageous 
and unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As approved by committees in the House and Senate, these  
resolutions would take a meat ax to American leadership,'' Albright 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal before the Senate entails a cut of 15.3 percent  
from President Clinton's request while the reduction before the 
House is 21 percent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both resolutions propose ever-tighter spending caps from  
fiscal year 2001 to 2004. The result would be a foreign policy 
straitjacket for whomever is president and secretary of state 
during that time,'' Albright added. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department fact sheet shows a proposed reduction of $3.2  
billion from the administration's request for FY2000 in the Senate 
and $4.5 billion in the House. The amount of the administration 
request was not disclosed but the base funding level for the 
current year is $18.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the past week, the administration has been pummeled by  
some in Congress, not for asking for too much, but rather for too 
little, especially for embassy security,'' Albright said. ``Now we 
are presented with budget resolutions that would require us to 
underfund virtually every major program we have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say to my good friends, where would you have us cut? The war  
against drugs? The battle against terror? Our efforts to control 
the threats posed by loose nukes and the prospect of nuclear 
expertise being put up for sale to the highest bidder? Support for 
peace in the Middle East, Bosnia, Northern Ireland?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called the budget resolutions ``a clear and present danger  
to America safety, prosperity and values. 
</P>
<P>
	``No member of the House or Senate should vote for them without  
understanding that or without accepting responsibility for the 
consequences. The resolutions should be amended or defeated, they 
should not be approved,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Extend Gains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures extended their gains Monday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as a group that controls two-thirds of the 
world's oil supply closed in on a new agreement to reduce output. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil, unleaded gasoline and natural gas futures also  
moved sharply higher. On other commodity markets, soybeans and corn 
rose sharply, as did copper. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude rose as the 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting  
Countries were set to meet Tuesday in Vienna to formally ratify a 
plan that beginning in April would slash some 2 million barrels 
daily from world production in a bid to shore up prices. Crude 
until recently had been hovering at 12-year lows because of 
oversupply and a global economic crisis that sapped demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, another major producer that is not a member of the  
group, also planned to cut 100,000 barrels from its production over 
the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Those agreements in the past week have led to a sharp increase  
in futures prices and prices at the pump, but they could be 
short-lived as investors await clear indications of whether the 
cuts are actually being made. There is still disagreement about 
whether oil producing nations have slashed the promised 3.23 
million barrels daily from production that they agreed to at this 
time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for April delivery rose 26 cents to $15.50 a  
barrel; April heating oil rose 1.70 cents to 42.39 cents a gallon; 
April unleaded gasoline rose 1.78 cents to 49.42 cents a gallon; 
April natural gas rose 7 cents to $1.769 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade amid  
speculation the U.S. Agriculture Department might announce it 
planned another donation to cash-strapped Russia, with soybean meal 
or oil as the centerpiece of that package. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said after a meeting with  
Russian officials that they had requested more food aid this year 
and that the U.S. agency would consider that request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is under pressure to boost exports as  
the trade deficit grows and farmers suffer from weak sales because 
of a global economic crisis. That has led to increased food 
donations to economically depressed countries and more 
government-backed loan and credit guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	May soybeans rose 10 cents to $4.99 1/4 a bushel; May corn rose 3 1/4  
cents to $2.32 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange as  
supplies continued to pour out of Singapore warehouses, boosting 
speculation Japanese manufacturing demand is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures have been in the doldrums for months as increased  
world supply is met with weak demand from the important Asian 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumption from Japan in manufacturing electronics and building  
offices is seen as key to reviving the moribund metal's outlook in 
that region. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts noted, however, warehouse inventories are likely to  
begin increasing in coming days as new supplies arrive from Chile, 
the world's top producer. Still, copper consumers were taking the 
opportunity to snap up supplies amid fears the rally would continue 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
	May high-grade copper rose 2.75 cents to 64.50 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Mom, Son Settle Lottery Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- A son who was sued by his own mother  
after he refused to share a $2.15 million lottery jackpot settled 
on Monday by agreeing to give her nearly a quarter of the prize, 
his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Klingebiel and her son, Michael Klingebiel, settled on  
the day the case was to go to trial, said his attorney, Henry 
Rzemieniewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klingebiel claimed she and her son had a decade-old  
agreement to buy lottery tickets together and share any prizes. 
Each month, she sent him $20, while he also put in $20, to buy 40 
lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, they split a $500 prize. But when he won a 1997  
drawing, Klingebiel claimed that he had bought the ticket on his 
own and did not have to share the winnings with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klingebiel sued for half. The settlement gives her 22.5  
percent, Rzemieniewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rzemieniewski said he was concerned that a jury might be  
sympathetic to a mother, and he didn't want to risk losing a 
greater percentage of the award. Klingebiel ``made a business 
decision,'' the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klingebiel's attorney did not return calls on Monday, and  
calls to Mrs. Klingebiel's home went unanswered.

	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- A man who refused to share a $2.15  
million lottery award with his mother made a ``business decision'' 
to settle a lawsuit Monday and give up nearly a quarter of the 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis and Michael Klingebiel embraced after their lawyers  
worked out an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klingebiel, who stopped speaking to her son after suing him  
in 1997, wants ``the chance to mend fences with her son and 
daughter-in-law,'' said her lawyer, Gary Blaustein. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klingebiel said she and her son had a decade-old agreement  
to buy lottery tickets together and share any prizes. Each month, 
she sent him $20, while he also put in $20, to buy 40 lottery 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	When a ticket Klingebiel bought won the Pick-6 drawing on Oct.  
2, 1997, he called his mother and said, ``We won.'' But Klingebiel 
said he was talking about his wife, Jillanne. He said he did not 
have to share it with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klingebiel sued the couple in December 1997, seeking half  
the winnings. The settlement, reached on the day the trial was to 
begin, gives Mrs. Klingebiel 22.5 percent of the winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Klingebiel's attorney, Henry Rzemieniewski, said he was

<HEADLINE> Military Computer Systems Said Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military's key communications  
infrastructure linking combat, intelligence and command forces is 
dangerously vulnerable to attacks from cyberspace and requires 
urgent changes in Defense Department policy, said a study released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence  
systems, known as C4I, is compromised by security problems and also 
by a military culture prone to treating such problems as a lesser 
priority, the National Research Council reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate at which information systems are being relied on  
outstrips the rate at which they are being protected,'' it said. 
``The time needed to develop and deploy effective defenses in 
cyberspace is much longer than the time required to develop and 
mount an attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite evidence of security lapses in C4I -- which handles  
communications and warning tasks all along the chain of command -- 
the Pentagon's ``words regarding the importance of information 
systems security have not been matched by comparable action,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troops in the field did not appear to take the protection of  
their C4I systems nearly as seriously as they do other aspects of 
defense,'' said the report, which Congress ordered the Pentagon to 
commission in 1995. The council is an independent organization 
chartered by Congress to advise the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The report indicated the problems were due more to the  
Pentagon's management of the systems than to the technology itself. 
It cited C4I workers' lack of stature compared with traditional 
combat forces, compatibility problems between the services and a 
need for more budget flexibility on the matter from both the 
Defense Department and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Pentagon acknowledged that the U.S.  
military's strength ``is our information technology,'' and that 
``our dependence on such assets, which may be subject to malicious 
attack, makes information technology our weakness as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said that as the council's report was being prepared, the  
Defense Department had already improved protection against computer 
attack by implementing new programs, establishing a joint task 
force for computer defense and expanding training of its 
information technology personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Allard, an analyst who has written about C4I, said  
its weaknesses are in part the fault of ``Industrial Age'' military 
acquisition policies -- applying to computers as well as tanks, 
ships and aircraft -- that give the services their own procurement 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ships and tanks may perform different tasks, he said, but the  
Army, Navy and other services need a single-standard computer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-first century combat is the war of the databases, in  
which information flows must go from the foxhole to the White House 
and back down again,'' said Allard, a former Army colonel and 
analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who 
had not yet read the council's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommended:  
</P>
<P>
	--Making C4I a greater budget priority in defense spending, with  
a flexibility that can ``exploit unanticipated advances in C4I 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Designating an organization responsible for providing direct  
defensive operational support to commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	--Funding a program to conduct frequent, unannounced penetration  
testing of C4I systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensuring that programs are operable even if one part has been  
penetrated by an adversary. 
</P>
<P>
	--Emphasizing the importance of information technology in the  
military leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishing an Institute for Military Information Technology,  
possibly as part of an existing body.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Mandatory Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to let an  
Indiana school district require all high school students suspended 
for disciplinary reasons to undergo drug testing before they are 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck  
down the requirement as a violation of students' privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action is not a decision and sets no precedent. In fact,  
the court's denial of review could confuse the already-murky law 
surrounding student drug-testing across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was a drug-testing policy formerly imposed at two  
Anderson, Ind., high schools. Lawyers for the Anderson Community 
School Corp. asked the justices to reinstate the policy, which they 
called vital to ``deterring drug and alcohol use among students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected a challenge to a Charlottesville, Va., curfew that  
contains exceptions for minors accompanied by a parent or on an 
errand for a parent and in possession of an explanatory note, or 
attending various school, religious or civic activities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Held, 8-1, that states do not violate the Constitution when  
they cancel public university professors' rights to negotiate 
workload rules as part of their union contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected the appeal of a New Jersey woman sentenced to life in  
prison for her husband's 1996 murder, the first woman ever 
convicted under the federal Violence Against Women Act. The 
justices turned asked Rita Gluzman's arguments that Congress 
exceeded its power to control interstate commerce when in 1994 it 
made it a crime to cross state lines to hurt, harass or intimidate 
a spouse or intimate partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court in 1995 ruled in an Oregon case that random  
drug tests for student athletes do not violate the Constitution's 
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. 
</P>
<P>
	That 6-3 ruling emphasized the ``role model'' effect of student  
athletes' drug use but also noted the importance of ``deterring 
drug use by our nation's schoolchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last October, the highest court let another Indiana school  
district -- in rural Rush County -- continue conducting random drug 
testing for all students participating in extracurricular 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices left that policy intact by rejecting, without  
comment, a challenge to it. 
</P>
<P>
	But no court has ever condoned the random testing of all public  
school students. 
</P>
<P>
	In striking down the drug-testing policy in Anderson, a  
three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals drew a 
distinction between it and those involved in the Oregon and Rush 
County cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``A testing policy for students in athletics or other  
extracurricular activities applies only to students who have 
voluntarily chosen to participate in an activity,'' the appeals 
court said. ``Drug testing could be construed as part of the 
`bargain' a student strikes in exchange for the privilege of 
participating in favored activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the Anderson case, the appeals court said, ``Such testing  
is a consequence of unauthorized participation in disfavored 
activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The policy adopted in 1997 for Anderson's two public high  
schools required that all students suspended for any reason for 
three days or more take a urine test to screen for drug and alcohol 
use before being readmitted. 
</P>
<P>
	If the test detected drug or alcohol use, the result was  
disclosed only to parents and a designated school official. The 
test result was not used for additional punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	James R. Willis II was a freshman at Highland High School when  
in December 1997 he was suspended for five days for fighting. The 
school official to whom Willis was taken right after his fight 
later testified that there was no indication he had been using 
drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis refused to take the required drug test for readmission,  
and, with his father, sued the school district. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge upheld the drug-testing policy, but the  
7th Circuit court reversed that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the school district must restrict drug  
testing in such disciplinary cases to students individually 
suspected of using drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Anderson Community School Corp. vs. Willis, 98-1183.

<HEADLINE>  'Shakespeare in Love' Wins 7 Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Academy Awards were a lot like a Roberto  
Benigni acceptance speech: long, full of surprises and sometimes 
difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-plus Oscar hours Sunday night -- the longest ceremony ever --  
narrowly favored the Bard over blood and love over war, as the 
romantic romp ``Shakespeare in Love'' reaped seven awards, 
including best picture and best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The violent World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan'' won five  
Oscars, including the directing award for Steven Spielberg in an 
unusual -- though hardly unprecedented -- split between best picture 
and best director. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Benigni who charmed the audience with his exuberance  
in pulling off a stunning first: winning as best actor in a foreign 
film for ``Life is Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni, who wrote and directed ``Life is Beautiful,'' also  
became the first filmmaker in 50 years to direct his own 
Oscar-winning performance. In 1948, Laurence Olivier directed and 
starred in ``Hamlet,'' for which he won the best acting prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful,'' a tragicomic film set mostly in a Nazi  
concentration camp, won additional Oscars for foreign film and 
dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a moment of joy and I want to kiss everybody,''  
Benigni enthused in accepting the foreign-language Oscar, after he 
bounded to the stage by walking across the tops of the chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He planted kisses on both cheeks of presenter Sophia Loren.  
Fittingly, it was Miss Loren who was the only other performer in a 
foreign language film to win an acting Oscar, for ``Two Women'' in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, when he picked up his acting award, Benigni burst into a  
fractured-English riff on joy, gushing about how ``my body is in 
tumult'' and ``everything is in a word that I cannot express.'' At 
one point he said his desire was ``making love with everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Benigni at times was difficult to decipher, so, too, was the  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' did pick up best picture, but director  
John Madden was snubbed. The film's leading lady Miss Paltrow won, 
but her leading man Joseph Fiennes wasn't even nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	And the award to ``Shakespeare's'' Judi Dench gave new meaning  
to the label supporting actress: as Queen Elizabeth I, Dame Judi 
was on screen only briefly, yet still took home an Oscar statue.

little bit of him,'' she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare,'' which led all contenders with 13 nominations,  
also picked up Oscars for original screenplay, art direction, 
costume design and musical or comedy score. Madden's film imagined 
a young Shakespeare suffering from writer's block, and falling in 
love with the beautiful woman played by Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax Films, which released both ``Shakespeare in Love'' and  
``Life is Beautiful,'' was a big winner Sunday night. The two 
movies combined for 10 Oscars.

Spielberg and the cinematographer both won, but the film didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-time directing winner -- Spielberg was honored for  
``Schindler's List'' in 1993 -- he earnestly expressed gratitude to 
all families who lost sons in World War II, and addressing his 
father, a veteran, said: ``Dad, this is for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie also took prizes for cinematography, editing, sound  
and sound effects editing. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Oscar voters split between best picture and  
director was in 1989, when ``Driving Miss Daisy'' won for best 
picture and Oliver Stone for ``Born on the Fourth of July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg had a hand in another winning film. The Holocaust  
movie, ``The Last Days,'' won the documentary feature award. 
Spielberg was executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth,'' another best picture nominee, won just one award,  
for makeup. The fifth contender, ``The Thin Red Line,'' Terrence 
Malick's comeback movie about WWII in the Pacific, was shut out 
entirely despite seven nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	James Coburn won the first Oscar of his long career -- as the  
alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this work for like over half my life, and I  
finally got one right, I guess,'' said the 70-year-old actor, whose 
dozens of films include ``Our Man Flint'' and ``The Magnificent 
Seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them you do for money, some of them you do for love.  
This is a love child,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial moment of the ceremony came and went  
quickly, as director Elia Kazan -- reviled by some for naming names 
during the Hollywood blacklist era -- stepped out to accept a 
lifetime achievement award. Many members of the audience applauded 
heartily, some stood, while others, like actors Nick Nolte and Ed 
Harris, sat silently.

</P>
<P>
	She changed costumes repeatedly to mimic film characters,  
getting the show off to a rousing start when she came out in full 
regalia as Elizabeth I to a rousing ovation, then a laugh when she 
announced with an accent that was more Bette Davis than British, 
``I am the African Queen.''

<P>

<HEADLINE>  'Shakespeare in Love' Wins 7 Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Academy Awards were a lot like a Roberto  
Benigni acceptance speech: long, full of surprises and sometimes 
difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-plus Oscar hours Sunday night -- the longest ceremony ever --  
narrowly favored the Bard over blood and love over war, as the 
romantic romp ``Shakespeare in Love'' reaped seven awards, 
including best picture and best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The violent World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan'' won five  
Oscars, including the directing award for Steven Spielberg in an 
unusual -- though hardly unprecedented -- split between best picture 
and best director. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Benigni who charmed the audience with his exuberance  
in pulling off a stunning first: winning as best actor in a foreign 
film for ``Life is Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni, who wrote and directed ``Life is Beautiful,'' also  
became the first filmmaker in 50 years to direct his own 
Oscar-winning performance. In 1948, Laurence Olivier directed and 
starred in ``Hamlet,'' for which he won the best acting prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful,'' a tragicomic film set mostly in a Nazi  
concentration camp, won additional Oscars for foreign film and 
dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a moment of joy and I want to kiss everybody,''  
Benigni enthused in accepting the foreign-language Oscar, after he 
bounded to the stage by walking across the tops of the chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He planted kisses on both cheeks of presenter Sophia Loren.  
Fittingly, it was Miss Loren who was the only other performer in a 
foreign language film to win an acting Oscar, for ``Two Women'' in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, when he picked up his acting award, Benigni burst into a  
fractured-English riff on joy, gushing about how ``my body is in 
tumult'' and ``everything is in a word that I cannot express.'' At 
one point he said his desire was ``making love with everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Benigni at times was difficult to decipher, so, too, was the  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' did pick up best picture, but director  
John Madden was snubbed. The film's leading lady Miss Paltrow won, 
but her leading man Joseph Fiennes wasn't even nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	And the award to ``Shakespeare's'' Judi Dench gave new meaning  
to the label supporting actress: as Queen Elizabeth I, Dame Judi 
was on screen only briefly, yet still took home an Oscar statue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a  
little bit of him,'' she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare,'' which led all contenders with 13 nominations,  
also picked up Oscars for original screenplay, art direction, 
costume design and musical or comedy score. Madden's film imagined 
a young Shakespeare suffering from writer's block, and falling in 
love with the beautiful woman played by Paltrow.

<HEADLINE> Benigni Wins Oscar As Best Actor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He danced across seat backs and hopped up the  
stage steps before grabbing two Oscars and the dazed, delighted 
heart of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Benigni made Academy history Sunday night by winning a  
best actor Oscar as the star of a foreign language film. ``Life is 
Beautiful,'' which he directed and wrote, also won best foreign 
film and for dramatic musical score. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you say, it's the hailstorm of kindness of gratitude  
for you,'' enthused Benigni, whose exuberant Italian accent and 
animated body language pulled a celebrity audience not easily 
impressed to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenter Sophia Loren praised ``a dear Italian friend'' before  
announcing Benigni's first win of the evening. Famous in Italy, but 
little-known here, Benigni popped up, jumped atop seat backs and 
stepped over heads. 
</P>
<P>
	When he reached Steven Spielberg's chair, he wobbled and  
clutched the famous director's hand as Spielberg's wife, actress 
Kate Capshaw, laughed and held Benigni's leg to keep him from 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage, he wrapped his arms around Loren and his Oscar for best  
foreign film. While Loren wept in the background, and celebrities 
such as Goldie Hawn cried in the audience, Benigni exuded, ``I want 
to dive into this audience, you know, your generosity is too 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Tuscan village where Benigni was born, Italians were  
still wide awake in the wee morning hours today when the hometown 
boy made good on Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roberto! Roberto! Roberto!'' the crowd gathered at a huge TV  
screen set up in the community center at Vergaio cried out when 
Benigni won. 
</P>
<P>
	People jumped to their feet when the awards were announced,  
weeping with joy, dancing around and kissing Benigni's sister 
Albertina, a florist. 
</P>
<P>
	His elderly parents, already exhausted from the recent  
excitement and attention when Benigni got a stunning seven 
nominations, didn't manage to stay up for the party. But Albertina 
said she'd taped the whole Oscar show for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its global popularity, Benigni's film also was  
criticized for trivializing the Holocaust by using comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful,'' follows an Italian Jew and his young son  
into a Nazi concentration camp. Benigni, as the father, protects 
his young boy by pretending the whole experience is a big game with 
prizes awarded for not crying and not giving voice to hunger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazis, Benigni tells his son, are ``the mean guys.''  
</P>
<P>
	The film has become the highest-grossing foreign language film  
in North American history and earned Italy its 10th Oscar, the most 
won by any foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, Benigni was back, winning the best actor statuette. In a  
speech sometimes indecipherable because of his accent and his 
energy, he gushed ``This is a terrible mistake, because I used up 
all my English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite. In big sentences short on continuity, Benigni talked  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not able to express all my gratitude. Now my body is in  
tumult. It is a colossal moment of joy ... I would like to be 
Jupiter and kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making 
love to everybody. Grazie, grazie, America, land of a lotta things. 
I don't deserve this. But I hope to win some other Oscars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni became the first filmmaker in 50 years -- since Sir  
Laurence Olivier and ``Hamlet'' -- to direct his own Oscar-winning 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	He is possibly Italy's most famous living actor, known for his  
physical humor and rubbery face and body. He has worked for 
directors such as Costa-Gavras, Federico Fellini and Jim Jarmusch. 
</P>
<P>
	His American film debut came in Jarmusch's ``Down by Law'' in  
1986, playing a maladjusted Italian on the lam in rural Louisiana 
whose English is, well, bad. 
</P>
<P>
	But Benigni was perfectly understood Sunday when he acknowledged  
those who died in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank those who are not here, who gave their lives  
so that we can say 'Life Is Beautiful.'''

<HEADLINE> GOP Avoiding Education Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ducking a fight with President Clinton,  
Republican congressional leaders intend to jettison a provision the 
Senate added to education legislation recently after a pitched 
battle with Democrats, according to GOP officials. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott discussed the issue at a meeting last week, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been eager to present a less confrontational  
face to the country, given their unexpected loss of House seats 
last November and the politically charged impeachment drama that 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Several aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
House GOP leadership in particular is eager to have Clinton's 
signature on the so-called ``ed flex'' measure as a symbol of 
Congress' ability to record achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying legislation, which has broad bipartisan support  
as well as backing of the nation's governors, would loosen strings 
on federal school aid. 
</P>
<P>
	When the measure came up on the Senate floor, Democrats sought  
to attach a variety of poll-tested proposals, including one to hire 
additional teachers toward Clinton's goal of 100,000, and another 
for after-school programs. After a standoff that lasted several 
days, Republicans voted down the major Democratic proposals. They 
then muscled through a provision of their own to allow the states 
to take $1.2 billion already approved for teacher hiring and apply 
it to educational programs for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed version of the measure contains no comparable  
provision. Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who shepherded the bill to 
passage, said he hoped the Senate would relent. ``I hope they'll 
drop all their amendments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made clear his dislike for the provision, saying it  
amounted to the GOP backing out of an agreement last year to start 
hiring new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate used this bill to undermine one of our most  
important educational achievements,'' Clinton said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
senators are prepared to circulate a letter that would make clear 
any veto of the bill would be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators have not yet met on the bill. They  
may not until after lawmakers return from their recess early next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their retreat, Republicans say the special education  
issue is a political winner for them and intend to bring it up 
again later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has accepted appointment as a  
senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington 
think tank. The former Georgia lawmaker will conduct research and 
write about domestic and security policy, according to an 
announcement, which added that his initial project will be on 
health and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, who stepped down late last year after the Republicans  
unexpectedly lost seats in the 1998 elections, has been making paid 
speeches around the country. His political action committee is 
scheduled to hold a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich represented Atlanta's northern suburbs in Congress for  
20 years. He has been mentioned as a potential contender for 
Georgia's governor in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	The winnowing has begun in Florida, where Republican Sen. Connie  
Mack's decision to retire sparked a rush by House members to 
explore a possible race to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mark Foley has become the first lawmaker to take himself  
out of the race and will run instead for re-election to a fourth 
term from his district along the Atlantic coast. Foley recently was 
given a coveted spot on the House Ways and Means Committee, with 
jurisdiction over taxes, trade and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley's decision is good news for the GOP leadership, which is  
worried about being able to hold control of the House next year. 
``They all were very anxious for me to stay,'' Foley said of the 
leaders who talked with him, including Majority Leader Dick Armey 
and the whip, Rep. Tom DeLay, both from Texas; and Rep. Tom Davis 
of Virginia, who chairs the GOP campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley has held his seat easily since winning it in 1994, but  
President Clinton carried the district both times he ran. ``It 
would be very competitive'' if it were an open race, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party's new chairman, Joe Andrew, is getting help  
to restructure the Democratic National Committee. Yolanda Caraway, 
a Washington consultant, will head his transition efforts, 
according to an official familiar with Andrew's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Caraway helped Ron Brown makes his transition to the DNC in  
1981. Andrew was named chairman Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one of  
the first things Andrew plans to do is replace executive director 
Janet Green with Rob Engel, who has held a similar post with the 
House campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, whose tenure included the surprisingly successful 1998  
elections, is moving on.

<HEADLINE>  Oscar Parties Rage Into Wee Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- After a long Oscars ceremony, they  
partied like it's 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners, losers, also-rans. Famous, infamous, unknowns. They  
vamped, got kissy-faced and celebrated at post-Oscar parties raging 
into the wee hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	After the official academy Governors Ball at the downtown Los  
Angeles Music Center, limousines fanned out across Southern 
California. Many headed to West Hollywood, the most popular 
destination with six major bashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Best-director Steven Spielberg his ``Saving Private Ryan'' star  
Tom Hanks showed up at the DreamWorks-Paramount party at Barnaby's, 
where guests dined on raw oysters, shiitake mushroom pizza and 
chicken pot pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Handshaking. Hugs. Air kisses. Make that big wet kisses from  
Italy's ``Life is Beautiful'' Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni. 
</P>
<P>
	There was head-shaking, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Monica Lewinsky, shrouded in a black gown, showed up at Morton's  
for the annual Vanity Fair fest. She mugged for cameras before 
disappearing inside the fern-laden Melrose Avenue eatery. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern was still inside when Jay Leno,  
king of the Lewinsky jokesters, strolled past the giant Oscar 
topiary at the Morton's entrance and went inside. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known if Leno encountered Ms. Lewinsky, but actress  
Uma Thurman could be seen talking to her at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an eclectic crowd: Madonna dancing with Ricky Martin,  
Edward Burns of ``Saving Private Ryan'' arm-in-arm with actress 
Heather Graham and ``Sling Blade'' star Dwight Yoakam with actress 
Bridget Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Hopkins, Jim Carrey, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Steve  
Martin, Tim Allen, Willem Dafoe, Mariah Carey were all there. 
Steven Baldwin -- blond hair slicked-back, wearing black leather 
pants and an ankle-length overcoat -- also showed up. So did Ed 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only party we're going to go to. We're not into  
this kind of stuff that much,'' McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pagani, Elton John was holding court in a purple Versace  
suit. His annual AIDS bash raises more than $300,000 and partygoers 
included Janet Jackson, Rod Stewart and Leann Rimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Just up the street on Sunset Boulevard, the online Hollywood  
Stock Exchange and Excite! gathering dubbed Rock the Oscars 
featured a performance by Beck on the House of Blues stage. The 
computer-equipped party, described as a ``convergence of the 
digital world and Hollywood,'' allowed Internet users to contact 
partygoers online. 
</P>
<P>
	The pink and posh Beverly Hills Hotel hosted the Night of 100  
Stars party to raise money for Martin Scorsese's film preservation 
foundation. Ernest Borgnine, Elliot Gould, Tony Curtis and Rod 
Steiger were among those invited. 
</P>
<P>
	When the curtain came down on the 71st annual Academy Awards, a  
fleet of stretch limousines were idling outside. But departures 
were delayed for the obligatory rounds at the Governors Ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it networking: Lots of let's-do-lunch and  
have-your-people-call-my-people banter. Governors Ball guests were 
greeted by the sounds of a string band, appropriate considering the 
age of the majority of the guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those inside was 89-year-old director Elia Kazan, whose  
lifetime achievement award created a stir in Hollywood. Sitting at 
a table with Karl Malden, Kazan said: ``I'm glad it's over, but it 
was a nice evening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Oscar winners making the rounds of the ball were Benigni,  
James Coburn, Judi Dench and Gwyneth Paltrow. But most of the stars 
were boarding limos an hour later to hit other parties.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Freeman Making a Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Postseason play has been payback time for  
Connecticut's Kevin Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Snubbed when it came time to pick the Big East's first, second  
or third all-conference teams, the power forward's rebounding and 
clutch shooting have helped carry the Huskies (32-2) to their first 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman had 13 points and a career-high 15 rebounds -- 10 off the  
offensive boards -- in UConn's 67-62 win against Gonzaga to advance 
to St. Petersburg, Fla. In the final minutes, he hit two free 
throws to give UConn the lead for good at 57-55 and then iced the 
game with two more from the line with 6.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	With the game on the line, there were no butterflies. Just net.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can have that same confidence and God will bless  
me with the same strokes to allow the ball to go in,'' Freeman said 
Monday. ``It's just a matter of focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, winners of the West Regional, take on Ohio State on  
Saturday. The Buckeyes (27-8) advanced to the Final Four with a 
77-74 South Regional final win against St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the conference snub, the accolades are  
mounting. Freeman was named to the West Regional All-Tournament 
team. And his performance in the conference tournament earlier this 
month earned him Most Outstanding Player honors. 
</P>
<P>
	His award-winning efforts aren't anything out of the ordinary  
for the 6-foot-7 junior, say his teammates and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the incredible ability to will himself to do things,''  
said coach Jim Calhoun. ``He's done it in a humble sort of way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said he marveled at Freeman's 10 offensive boards  
against the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely phenomenal,'' Calhoun said. ``Coaches just  
don't marvel when you've had the great fortune to have some great 
players play for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's leading rebounder, the muscular Freeman is averaging  
7.3 boards a game. With 12.6 points a game, he's the third top 
scorer behind the higher profile tandem of All-American Richard 
Hamilton and flashy point guard Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	When they've gone cold at times -- El-Amin was 0-for-12 against  
Gonzaga -- the Huskies look inside to Freemen and get results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin brings toughness. He brings it consistently,'' said  
center Jake Voskuhl. ``He's playing the best basketball right now 
that he's played since he's been here. The sky's the limit for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman and the 6-11 Voskuhl have played together for three  
years, and with the addition of 6-8 sophomore Edmund Saunders, are 
formidable in the post. The three combine for nearly 19 boards a 
game and can read each other like a road map. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided early on in the second half of the Gonzaga game to  
get every rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just looked at Kevin, Kevin looked at me,'' said Voskuhl.  
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies went on to get 10 second-chance points in the last  
eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the communication, especially with me and Jake down  
low, is something that develops over time. We have a natural 
bond,'' said Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he's put the Big East snub behind him and just  
tries to prove every game he's one of the top players in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people don't want to recognize it they won't,'' he said.  
``Hopefully we'll continue to win and I'll continue to be the X 
factor that beats you.''

<HEADLINE> Royal Pleads Guilty on Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. pleaded guilty  
Monday to falsifying oil discharge records on a ship that was 
stopped in the Los Angeles port. 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise line admitted that its employees presented false  
pollution prevention records to U.S. Coast Guard officers during 
routine inspections on the ship Nordic Prince, according to the 
U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea relates to three separate incidents between January and  
October 1994, when the ship was berthed in the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew members presented records that claimed the oils and  
oil-contaminated waters had been properly treated prior to being 
thrown overboard. But the equipment designed to separate oil from 
wastewater was inoperative. 
</P>
<P>
	The log and records are required under the Clean Water Act.  
</P>
<P>
	``We did these things and they were terrible. There's no excuse.  
It is a very different company (now) environmentally,'' said Royal 
Caribbean spokeswoman Lynn Martenstein from Miami, where the 
company is headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
	The company faces up to $1.5 million in fines. Each of the three  
counts carries a maximum penalty of a $500,000 fine. Sentencing is 
set for June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Martenstein, the company also pleaded guilty to the  
same charges in June 1998 in federal courts in Miami and San Juan, 
Puerto Rico. In those cases, Royal Caribbean was ordered to pay $9 
million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nordic Prince was sold in 1995.

<HEADLINE>  Six Skaters Make 4-Revolution Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) - There were quads in the air and on the  
ice and it was just the qualifying rounds at the World Figure 
Skating Championships today. 
</P>
<P>
	Six skaters completed the four-revolution jump, the most ever in  
a competition and American Tim Goebel became the first skater to 
land a quad salchow in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the jumps, the real jockeying for positions began today  
the Russians leading the way as expected. Yevgeny Plushenko won one 
group and defending world champion Alexei Yagudin won the other, 
despite a sore left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss came in second to Plushenko and  
former Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov was second to Yagudin. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today the pairs have their short programs. Russians Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikarulidze are the defending world champions 
and hope to rebound from recent poor performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, in the men's qualifying, the quads came in quantity and  
quality, 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko, Elvis Stojko, Weiss, Goebel, Guo Zhengxin of China  
and Anthony Liu of Australia hit them, marking the most in a single 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, three different skaters did them at the 1997 Grand  
Prix final -- future Olympic champion Ilya Kulik, Urmanov and Stojko 
hit them. Stojko and two others hit them at the 1997 world 
championships finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finally nailed a clean quad toe loop. In 1997 he thought  
he had one but the videotape replay hours later showed he had 
slightly two-footed it. There was no doubt about it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I initially wasn't planning on trying it but as soon as I saw  
two of them hit theirs out there, I knew if I wanted to be up there 
in first or second I had to go for it, '' he said. ``It worked 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss also did triple-triple combinations and three other triple  
jumps, but fell on his second triple axel attempt. Still that put 
him ahead of Stojko, pushing the three-time world champion to third 
in the qualifying group 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko hit his first quad but fell on his second. ``I think I  
was just a little sloppy on the landing,'' Stojko said of his brush 
with the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	He found the qualifications, which count in the scoring this  
year, difficult to adjust to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard to do at this point -- to give everything or  
hold back,'' said Stojko, who turned 27 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also didn't do any triple-triple combinations.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the triple-triples would make the difference,'' said  
Weiss, who had marks between 5.6 and 5.8 but, more importantly, the 
advantage over Stojko with five of the second judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko started strong, with his quad but had slight errors on  
a number of his other jumps. Nonetheless, he ranked ahead of Weiss 
on all but the Swiss judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, who has been consistent throughout the season and  
delivered an awesome quad and quad-triple in practice the day 
before, won his group easily without even attempting one. 
</P>
<P>
	His marks were nearly all 5.8s and 5.9s.  
</P>
<P>
	He did eight triples in doing just enough to get into first  
without putting additional pressure on a sore left calf muscle that 
caused him to shake his leg as soon as he finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel came in fifth helped by his quad salchow. In contrast to  
the toe loops, which the other skaters did, the salchow does not 
have use the skate's toe pick to help pole-vault the skater up. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel started slowly, putting two hands down on a triple axel.  
Then he got up and landed the quad salchow, which he had done 
previously at the Goodwill Games and junior Grand Prix finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifying round advances 15 skaters from each group and  
counts for 20 percent of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	The short program accounts for an additional 30 with Thursday's  
long program counting the remaining 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Report: Iraq Executes 93 Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Iraq has executed 93 political detainees in  
a prison near Baghdad, a human rights group affiliated with an 
Iraqi opposition party reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Center for Human Rights said the executions  
took place in November in Radwaniya prison, just west of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	The group provided a list identifying those it said were  
executed, all of whom it said had been detained since an abortive 
Shiite Muslim uprising in southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Human Rights, which is linked to the Iraqi  
Communist Party, said it got its information from sources inside 
Iraq whom it did not identify. It said 63 prisoners were executed 
in Nov. 6 and 30 were executed Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bodies of the executed prisoners were not returned to  
their families and instead they were buried in mass graves in the 
nearby Mashtal area,'' the group said in a statement faxed to The 
Associated Press in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Saddam Hussein's government refuses to comment on such  
charges, and there is no way to get independent confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi opposition groups have accused Iraq of systematically  
executing political prisoners. In January, they claimed 81 
political prisoners were executed in Abu Ghraib prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Human Rights claims thousands are imprisoned at  
Radwaniya, some of them Kurds who have been detained since the 
start of the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war. 
</P>
<P>
	The group called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, all U.N.  
human rights organizations, the Arab League, the Organization of 
the Islamic Conference and the Red Cross to send teams to inspect 
Iraqi prisons.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota's Haskins Denies Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- University of Minnesota men's basketball  
coach Clem Haskins denied Monday giving money to a former player 
and to a tutor who says she wrote hundreds of papers for basketball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deny the allegations of former player Russ Archambault. I  
again deny the allegations of Jan Gangelhoff. They are not true,'' 
Haskins said in a statement issued through the university with the 
approval of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of the state of Minnesota are smart and recognize  
that people in leadership positions can have false allegations 
raised for whatever reason or agenda,'' Haskins said. 
``Fortunately, America has a system of justice that preserves the 
rights of all people, including those of athletes and coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff's claims that she wrote papers and did course work  
for at least 20 current and former Golden Gopher players has 
triggered an investigation into academic fraud at the university. 
She said Haskins paid her to keep tutoring a player after the 
university's academic counseling unit told her to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, Archambault has said Haskins gave him several  
hundred dollars in cash while he was a member of the team from 1996 
through February 1998, when he was dismissed by Haskins for leaving 
his hotel after curfew the night before a game at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that the University of Minnesota is now  
fighting so hard to deny the existence of a conspiracy to keep 
university basketball players eligible to play,'' replied 
Gangelhoff's attorney, Jim Lord. He also is representing her 
sister, Jeanne Payer, another former tutor for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff and Payer are expected to hold a news conference  
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Cravens Named Weber State Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- Weber State, which upset North Carolina in  
the first round of the NCAA tournament, promoted assistant Joe 
Cravens to head coach Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeds Ron Abegglen, the Big Sky coach of the year.  
Abegglem agreed last August to a $95,000 buyout of his contract 
following the season after his wife accused him of domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Abegglen was already on a two-year probation at Weber State for  
recruiting violations. The school-imposed sanctions in 1996 came as 
the NCAA was investigating the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Abegglen's eight-year career at Weber State ended with an 82-74  
overtime loss to Florida in the NCAA tournament's second round 
after the Wildcats had upset third-seeded North Carolina 76-74. 
</P>
<P>
	Cravens, 45, served as interim coach at the University of Utah  
for most of the 1989-90 season while coach Rick Majerus recovered 
from heart surgery. He coached later at Idaho, where he compiled a 
43-40 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Cravens won the job over fellow assistant Guy Beach. He said he  
had offered Beach a position as an associate assistant. Both joined 
Abegglen's staff in 1997. Beach has not decided if he will accept 
Cravens' offer.

<HEADLINE> Devils Acquire Islanders' Nemchinov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils acquired  
veteran center Sergei Nemchinov from the New York Islanders on 
Monday for a fourth-round draft pick in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade gives the Devils a savvy defensive-minded veteran who  
can also kill off penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can play against the top forwards in this league. He's  
proven that,'' Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello said. ``And he 
can also score the timely goal. And he can score a certain type of 
goal at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nemchinov appeared in 67 games for the Islanders this season,  
scoring eight goals and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade is just the latest for the Islanders who have cleaned  
house in recent weeks. The Islanders traded goaltender Tommy Salo 
to Edmonton, center Robert Reichel to Phoenix and left wing Ted 
Donato to Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	It also gives Nemchinov the opportunity to go from a team out of  
the playoffs to one that leads the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always good to play in the playoffs,'' said Nemchinov,  
who was a member of the New York Rangers Stanley Cup winning team 
in 1994. ``I am happy to go to one of the best teams in the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nemchinov is expected to be in New Jersey for Tuesday's game  
against the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamoriello would not say whether he had plans to make another  
deal before the NHL trading deadline expires at 3 p.m. Tuesday. He 
said if a good deal presents itself, he'll make it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamoriello has been known to pull off several blockbuster deals  
just before the trading deadline. He acquired Dave Andreychuk from 
Toronto in 1996. The following year he picked up center Doug 
Gilmour and defenseman Dave Ellett in late season deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils also announced Tuesday that defenseman Scott Stevens  
and forward Jay Pandolfo were being placed on the injured list.

<HEADLINE> Gore Shares Personal Side With Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, in crisp white  
shirt and tie, paused a beat before he decided to share a secret 
with some giggling first-graders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did have a treehouse,'' said Gore. ``I had a really neat  
treehouse when I was growing up on the farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a few minutes as he opened yet another campaign day, Gore  
the candidate turned into Gore the teacher, Gore the student, even 
Gore the grieving son. At least for a bit, he moved from dry policy 
and reveled in the attention he got from youngsters and their 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	He beamed as he walked into a gymnasium at a Sioux Falls  
elementary school filled with squealing youngsters. ``I need 
somebody to give me a high five,'' said Gore, as he plunged into a 
crowd of toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	He went down on one knee to ask a youngster, ``What's the most  
important thing about reading?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later adjourned to the school library, where he sat before  
about a dozen first-graders, reading from the story ``The Giving 
Tree.'' Again dropping to a knee, Gore unbuttoned his suit coat as 
he chatted with the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``How old are you?'' asked one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why I'm about to have my birthday, I'm 50,'' said Gore, to  
groans from the youngsters. ``Does that sound old to you?'' asked 
Gore, seeming surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent campaign swings, Gore has tried to show a more human  
and personal side. There are clear reasons for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown an overwhelming majority of voters know who  
Gore is, but many have questions about his leadership abilities and 
his ability to move out of President Clinton's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the process of introducing ourself to America,'' said  
aide Chris Lehane. ``Who he is and what he's all about. It's quite 
a story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's latest campaign trip has included some old-fashioned  
political business as well. Gore was in the state to collect the 
endorsements of Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and South Dakota 
Sen. Tim Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not every day the vice president gets a two-fer,'' said  
Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign played the song ``Wild Thing'' over the public  
address system as backers waited for the speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	On a quieter personal note, Gore noted that Daschle and he  
shared family pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just recently, both Tom and I lost our dads,'' he said, moving  
on to tell a poignant story about Daschle's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said in an interview that he finds it tough to talk about  
himself and break through the legendary stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not used to it because the way I was raised you don't talk  
about yourself too much,'' said Gore. ``But in a campaign, you've 
got to introduce yourself and the experiences which have shaped 
your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were clear limits to the down-home campaign informality on  
Monday. Gore and his entourage blew into the elementary school with 
a retinue that ground normal activities to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore planned a roundtable with about 20 teachers, saying that he  
wanted to listen to their concerns, that ``one of the best things 
we could do is have a conversation about what works and what 
doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sat sipping tea, from a cup sporting a teacher's apple, and  
responded to teachers' pointed questions about class size, pay and 
preparation time. The conversation was animated, but more in the 
form of a presentation than a conversation. Gore aides pressed him 
to move on. ``They're sending me increasingly agitated notes,'' 
Gore said as aides repeatedly handed him slips of paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Most teachers were keeping one eye on the security guards posted  
at each door, and the staff photographer prowling the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the best class I've ever had,'' said Gore, as he  
shuffled off to the next event.

<HEADLINE> Don't Expect Benigni in Mainstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You can hear the movie pitch now. ``Life is  
Beautiful'' meets ``48 Hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Benigni is the wacky Italian policeman who comes to LA  
to solve an international crime and gets teamed with a smart-mouth 
from the 'hood. 
</P>
<P>
	Only it's probably not going to happen any time soon.  
</P>
<P>
	With his triumph at the Oscars on Sunday night and joyful  
victory dance across the seats, Benigni becomes one of the hottest 
-- if most unlikely -- new properties in Hollywood: a small, balding, 
Italian comic who speaks heavily accented English. 
</P>
<P>
	But for all the offers that are likely to come his way, for all  
those buddy movies and fish-out-of-water high-concept tales, don't 
look for this exuberant actor-writer-director to plunge into the 
American movie mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to be Benigni for hire,'' said Harvey  
Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, which released Benigni's 
triple Oscar-winning ``Life is Beautiful.'' ``He's his own writer. 
He's his own director. He doesn't have to sell his services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage at the Academy Awards, Benigni confirmed as much. He  
said that while the Oscars, including his surprising best actor 
honor, have obviously changed his life, he plans to follow what he 
called ``my same style'' and make the ``same little movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Because when you remain little,'' he explained, ``you can  
watch (the) magnificence of the creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big star in his native country, Benigni has enjoyed creative  
control for years, drawing on his experiences working as an actor 
with some of the greatest international directors, including 
Constantin Costa-Gavras and Federico Fellini. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Benigni had not gained the sort of American recognition  
found by such Italian actors as Marcello Mastroianni or Sophia 
Loren -- until ``Life is Beautiful,'' the tragicomic story of an 
Italian Jew who uses humor to shield his young son from the horrors 
of a World War II concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Oscars, Benigni electrified the ceremony with his  
unabashed expressions of joy and gratitude, pulling off a 
surprising first: winning as best actor in a foreign film for 
``Life is Beautiful,'' which he also wrote and directed. The only 
other performer in a foreign-language film to get an acting Oscar 
was Miss Loren, for ``Two Women'' in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Benigni became the first filmmaker in 50 years to  
direct his own Oscar-winning performance. In 1948, Laurence Olivier 
directed and starred in ``Hamlet,'' for which he won the best 
acting prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The honors for ``Life is Beautiful'' awards capped a big night  
for Miramax, whose ``Shakespeare in Love'' led the evening with 
seven awards, including best picture, best actress for Gwyneth 
Paltrow and best original screenplay for Marc Norman and Tom 
Stoppard. DreamWorks' ``Saving Private Ryan'' won five Oscars, 
including best director for Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lions Gate, which had its own Oscar success with awards for  
James Coburn's supporting role in ``Affliction'' and Bill Condon's 
script for ``Gods and Monsters,'' is planning to re-release 
Benigni's 1994 comedy ``The Monster,'' about a bumbling man 
mistaken by police as a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can do anything he wants right now,'' said Lions Gate  
president Mark Urman. ``But he's not just a talent for hire. He is 
somebody who will create films around his persona.''

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Some 15,000 families have seized 5,000  
acres of vacant land in one of Venezuela's largest squatter 
invasions, Infrastructure Minister Luis Reyes said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide wave of invasions began after Hugo Chavez, the  
leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt who champions the rights of 
the poor, was sworn in as president Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez has refused to call in the National Guard to evict the  
squatters, provoking a storm of protest from state governors and 
businessmen who said he was condoning the invasions and scaring off 
foreign investors worried about respect for private property. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez said he wants the issue settled peacefully and is hoping  
to persuade the squatters to leave by implementing a land reform 
and housing program. 
</P>
<P>
	Well over half of Venezuela's 23 million people live in poverty,  
and the housing deficit is estimated at more than 1 million homes.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Salvadoran police confirmed  
Monday that a Cuban exile suspected of paying two men to carry out 
bombings in Havana entered the country using false credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban authorities last week showed a video of Luis Posada  
Carriles walking on the streets of San Salvador. The video was 
presented during the trial of Ernesto Cruz Leon, one of two 
Salvadorans accused of planting bombs in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim Posada Carriles hired the Salvadorans to carry  
out the attacks in an attempt to hurt tourism on the island. An 
Italian tourist died in one bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol last week ordered an  
investigation into the movements of Cruz Leon and condemned what he 
called Cuban ``espionage'' in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban authorities are seeking the death penalty for Cruz Leon  
and the other suspect, Otto Rodriguez Llerena.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The government is trying to negotiate a  
solution to the case of an Israeli-born media mogul who lost his 
TV-station and citizenship after airing reports critical of the 
military, newspapers reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baruch Ivcher, majority owner of Channel 2, is meeting with  
Peruvian officials in Washington to find a solution to the problem 
that has come to symbolize allegations that President Alberto 
Fujimori is trying to silence media criticism of himself and the 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru's Interior Ministry revoked Ivcher's Peruvian citizenship  
in 1997, after Channel 2 broadcast reports linking the military to 
cases of torture, corruption and telephone espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said Ivcher had never renounced his Israeli  
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Peruvian law prohibits foreigners from owning television  
or radio stations, a court stripped Ivcher of control of Channel 2. 
It awarded control to the pro-government minority owners. Fujimori 
controls Peru's judicial system, human rights groups charge.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The nephew of a former Mexican president  
registered Monday to run for the presidency of the ruling party, 
which for the first time in its 70 years in power will choose its 
leadership through an internal election. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodolfo Echeverria Ruiz, 53, will face former Labor Secretary  
Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez in a secret ballot by the party's 
governing council on March 30. He is the nephew of former President 
Luis Echeverria, who governed from 1970 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	No other candidates registered for the party presidency.  
</P>
<P>
	Echeverria Ruiz, a former state legislator and ambassador to  
Cuba, is backed by the party's old-style politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez Fernandez is widely seen as enjoying the support of  
President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI,  
previously allowed the sitting president to choose the party 
leadership and last week's announcement of an open election took 
many by surprise.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally higher  
Monday, with the key index in Hong Kong rising for the second 
consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 24.32 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 
11,107.24. On Friday, the index had surged 423.60 points, or 4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnover fell to 4.90 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $628  
million), down from Friday's 6.79 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
$870 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hang Seng Index rose on continued selective  
buying of blue-chip stocks following Friday's sharp rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was relatively quiet because of a market holiday in  
Japan on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Hong Kong investors have been using the Tokyo's Nikkei  
Stock Average as a major trading indicator. The Hong Kong market 
rose sharply on Friday in reaction to strong gains in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Singapore closed mostly higher, driven by gains  
in property and finance stocks. The Straits Times Index closed 
24.69 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,497.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan share prices also closed higher, with the key index  
breaching the psychologically important 7,000-point mark following 
a late rally in chip stocks and encouraging trade data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 49.85  
points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,043.23. The index hasn't settled above 
7,000 points since Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to accumulate shares in semiconductor  
companies Monday as the industry shows signs of recovery, dealers 
said. The gains in the market were also helped by news during the 
session showing Taiwan's economy may be on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs reported Monday that  
export orders for the first two months of this year rose 2.12 
percent from a year ago, to U.S. $18.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers  
saying the local market was quiet due to a lack of any real 
direction. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 8.50 points, or 
0.3 percent, to 2,144.45. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher. The 30-company  
Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) rose 12.03 points, or 
0.6 percent, to 2,018.49.

announcing their earnings within the next few weeks. The Composite

</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower on profit-taking. The  
Composite Index fell 1.934 points, or 0.49 percent, to 392.283.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Group Targets Bush, Dole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An abortion rights group launched a series of  
television ads today that accuse presidential hopefuls George W. 
Bush and Elizabeth Dole of camouflaging strict anti-abortion 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The two early favorites for the Republican presidential  
nomination, who have also been attacked by anti-abortion groups 
questioning their commitment to the cause, are now the target of 
ads bought by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action 
League 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, which began airing Monday morning on stations in  
Manchester, N.H., and Des Moines, Iowa, use quotes from the pair in 
an attempt to show they are opposed to abortion. The ads accuse 
them of trying to ``hide their extreme views,'' said NARAL director 
Kate Michelman. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush opposes a woman's right to choose. Elizabeth  
Dole opposes a women's right to choose,'' she said. ``But they both 
know they must communicate more moderate views in order to be 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelman would not say how much money was being spent on the  
campaign or how often the ads would run. ``It is a significant 
buy,'' she said. The ads are running around morning and evening 
newscasts in the two cities, and later will be broadcast in other 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the governor of Texas, has said he is opposed to abortion,  
with exceptions only for the life of the mother, rape and incest. 
Though he personally would like abortions to be outlawed, he says, 
Americans' ``hearts are not right'' on the issue, so Republicans 
should fight for incremental steps such as banning late-term 
abortions and requiring parental consent for abortions for 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect to get everybody's vote should I decide to run  
for the presidency,'' Bush said Monday. ``I'm pro-life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, a former president of the American Red Cross, has  
declined to discuss her abortion views in any depth since entering 
the presidential fray, but her spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said she 
is ``pro-life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These ads illustrate what's wrong with politics today,''  
Fleischer said. ``Eleven months before the primaries, special 
interest groups are running negative attack ads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa is the site of the first presidential caucuses in 2000. New  
Hampshire holds the first primary.

<HEADLINE> Online Retailer Moves Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIBERTY LAKE, Wash. (AP) -- Online computer-equipment retailer  
Egghead.com is moving its headquarters across the state to 
Vancouver, as the company transforms itself into an Internet-only 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Egghead decided last summer to consolidate operations in  
Vancouver, but indicated at the time that headquarters would remain 
in Liberty Lake, where it has been since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the 25 remaining Egghead workers in Liberty Lake were  
told that the headquarters -- and their jobs -- will be relocated to 
Vancouver by June. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees, all in the finance department, will receive  
layoff notices, and Egghead will discuss possible transfers to 
Vancouver, the company said. Employees unable to move will receive 
severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the more than 200 employees in Vancouver have been  
transferred from Liberty Lake, Portland, Ore., and Hood River, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation followed Egghead's $36 million acquisition of  
Surplus Direct, a Hood River company that sold close-out computer 
hardware through catalogs and the Internet, followed by a shift to 
online-only retailing. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Egghead announced that it was closing its remaining  
80 stores, renaming itself Egghead.com and shifting its focus to 
selling both hardware and software on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	When the move was announced, Egghead employed about 1,000  
people, most of whom have since been laid off. 
</P>

	U.S. Warns Yugoslav President  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fearful that a half-dozen countries,  
especially Albania and Macedonia, could be drawn into a conflict 
with Yugoslavia, the Clinton administration is warning President 
Slobodan Milosevic not to lash out beyond Kosovo in the event of a 
NATO attack. There would be ``grave consequences'' if Milosevic 
sent troops beyond Serbia's borders, the State Department cautioned 
Monday. With NATO gearing up to bomb Serb targets for blocking a 
political settlement in Kosovo and violating a cease-fire 
agreement, the potential for a spillover troubles U.S. 
policy-makers. Their aim is to confine the conflict.

	NTSB Crash Investigation Nears End

<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Despite the longest investigation of its  
31-year history, the National Transportation Safety Board remains 
uncertain about what precisely caused USAir Flight 427 to go 
spiraling into a ravine outside Pittsburgh in 1994. Instead, after 
a hearing beginning Tuesday, the board members are expected to 
conclude that there are lingering problems with the type of plane 
that crashed -- the Boeing 737, the world's most common jetliner -- 
and that its manufacturer and the Federal Aviation Administration 
should work to fix them, according to source close to the board.

	Study: Caffeine May Be Good for You  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Caffeine is not addictive for most people, a  
new study concludes, and has little effect on human health. 
According to a much-promoted French study released Monday during 
the American Chemical Society's annual meeting, drinking up to 
three cups of coffee a day has no effect on the part of the brain 
responsible for addiction. And it may actually be good for you. If 
you're a rat. After spending two years with 30 rodents, researcher 
Astrid Nehlig of the French National Health Medical Research 
Institute found that moderate consumption increases energy and 
renders addiction ``quite unlikely.''

government acknowledges that illnesses suffered by thousands of 
veterans are real, but years of study have not come up with clear

Philadelphia for the 12th straight time and ended their two-game 
losing streak. Iverson did not play the last 15 minutes because he 
got a split lower lip in the third period. Detlef Schrempf had 17 
points and 10 rebounds and Dale Ellis added 11 off the bench for 
Seattle. Larry Hughes and Matt Geiger added 13 points apiece for 
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE>  Shakespeare Wins Best Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Bard, and not the boys in uniform, was  
the surprise winner for best picture of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare In Love,'' a witty tale about a young William  
Shakespeare overcoming writer's block by meeting a gorgeous muse, 
beat the favored ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a harrowing tale that 
assaulted audiences' senses with its depiction of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Best director Steven Spielberg dedicated his Oscar to his  
father, and to the men who died during the D-day invasion. But his 
glaring -- and loud -- look at war was surpassed by a 1590s tale of 
Elizabethan life. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Shakespeare, writer of plays and lacking of inspiration,  
finds love in Lady Viola, who inspires him to revamp his latest 
play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Written by playwright Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman,  
``Shakespeare In Love'' won a leading seven Oscars, including 
original screenplay, best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow and best 
supporting actress for Judi Dench. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramar chairman Harvey Weinstein, one of several producers who  
accepted the Oscar on Sunday night, said it was ``an ensemble film 
and it took an ensemble to make it ... This is a movie about life 
and art, and art and life combining is called magic.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-NYC Mayor Ed Koch Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A dangerous plunge in blood pressure sent former  
Mayor Edward I. Koch to the hospital Monday, hours before he 
planned to get arrested for civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm OK,'' Koch, 74, told reporters from his hospital gurney.  
He was still dressed in the gray sweatpants, white sneakers and 
blue T-shirt he wore to the gym that morning. His doctor agreed, 
but kept him for tests before Koch was later discharged. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Scheidt, a cardiologist who saw the talkative  
ex-mayor at the emergency room, called Koch's condition ``near 
syncope'' or almost fainting. He said he did not believe that Koch 
had a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch, who plays a judge on ``The People's Court'' and writes a  
weekly column for the Daily News, had to cancel plans to get 
arrested at a protest against alleged police brutality outside 
police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch had a stroke in 1987. Soon after, he said his doctor called  
it ``a trivial stroke. Trivial to them maybe -- but not to me.''

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Spurred by Win Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs are winning again. More  
important, they're winning on the road and have reason to believe 
they can capture their division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving up the ladder a bit because we were pretty far  
down the ladder for a while,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were 6-8 in February, then regrouped to win 10 of 11 games  
in March, with seven victories in the streak coming on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, midway through this shortened NBA season, San Antonio is  
16-9, three games behind Utah in the Midwest Division. The Spurs 
and Houston Rockets were tied for second entering Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been able to gain some ground on Utah,'' point guard  
Avery Johnson said. ``This is another week where we can't have any 
slipups because you don't when Utah is going to lose again. And we 
don't play them until the end of April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs could be humming by then. They play seven of their  
next eight games at home, beginning Tuesday night against Denver. 
So far, San Antonio has played just 10 games in the Alamodome, 
tying Sacramento for the fewest home games in the conference. The 
Spurs are 7-3 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must try to continue to establish some home-court advantage  
at the dome this year going into the playoffs,'' Johnson said. 
``We've got to get some confidence in our own building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio is getting a boost from the schedule now. In  
February, the Spurs played Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers and Seattle 
twice and Minnesota three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent winning streak included victories over Dallas,  
Denver, Sacramento, Golden State and Vancouver -- all teams with 
losing records. On Friday, San Antonio lost to Portland, which is 
tied with Utah for the lead in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A concern for the Spurs has been David Robinson. The 33-year-old  
center is averaging 14.4 points a game, down from 21.6 points last 
year. He's scored only 21 points in the last three games combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich benched Robinson in the final minutes of the fourth  
quarter in two road games last week, choosing to go with Malik 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said after practice Monday it hurts him not to be  
playing with the game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'd be an understatement,'' he said. ``Sitting on the side  
you have no power to help at all. It's like being a fan over there. 
When I'm in there at least I feel like I can make things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson has seen second-year star Tim Duncan, a fellow  
7-footer, become the team's leading scorer with an average of 21.6 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he is trying to improve his shot. He's encouraged  
by a key jumper he made in overtime Saturday in a victory at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, I've got to get going and make some shots,''  
Robinson said. ``We've still got a lot of things to do. I know I'm 
going to be a big key to that. So if I can get my shot rolling, get 
some things happening, I think it's really going to make us more 
solid.''

<HEADLINE>  Shaffer, Fiala Win at Ski Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Utah (AP) -- Jakub Fiala had the luck of the draw.  
Alex Shaffer made all her own luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Both skiers emerged from a busy day at the U.S. National  
Championships on Monday with the first titles of their careers. 
Fiala won the men's super-G at Snowbasin Ski Resort, while Shaffer 
won the women's giant slalom at Park City Mountain Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiala was the fastest skier on a course in miserable shape after  
over a week of unpredictable, unseasonable weather. Rain on Sunday 
further destabilized large sections of the run which had been 
melting for days, and round-the-clock work was largely unable to 
improve the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	As the third skier down the course, however, Fiala was able to  
catch the snow in its best possible shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just lucky to get to go when I did,'' said Fiala, a New  
Mexico native who now lives in Breckenridge, Colo. ``I had probably 
the best opportunity of anybody to get some speed ... and I was 
fortunate to do it. ... It was luck, basically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiala finished in 1:15.51, edging national downhill champion  
Chad Fleischer, who came in at 1:15.80. Pre-race favorite Daron 
Rahlves started after both Fiala and Fleischer, and he slammed his 
helmet to the ground in frustration after finishing his third-place 
run in 1:16.12. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just terrible,'' Rahlves said of the course. ``The  
weather has just made it ridiculous up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The course conditions were less ridiculous in Park City, where  
Shaffer emerged victorious in the first technical event of the 
six-day competitions. Shaffer, whose family moved to Park City from 
Aspen last year, felt right at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't won a race in three years, so I don't know what to  
think,'' she said. ``I'm in outer space right now. It's definitely 
a nice surprise for the end of the season, and it's even better to 
do it at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer was in first place after both runs, and she was able to  
conclude an uneven international season with a win. Her best World 
Cup results have come in slalom, making her a solid favorite for 
Wednesday's championships in the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely not a monotone person. I need ups and downs to  
get me focused,'' she said. ``Without that I'm lost. Some people 
don't know how to deal with it, (but) I need some high stress 
points to keep me moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even more of a surprise than Shaffer's win was the very  
presence of the skier who finished second. Sarah Schleper, who was 
in the midst of a breakout year on the World Cup circuit when she 
wrecked her knee in France in December, skied her first race since 
the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Friday, she hadn't expected to compete at the  
national championships. But she received clearance from the team's 
medical staff and nearly landed her second straight national GS 
title. She won the event last year in Jackson Hole, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to win, but I'll settle for second place,'' Schleper  
said. ``I'm glad I was able to get back so soon, and I'm looking 
forward to the slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She spent much of the 10 weeks since her injury training and  
rehabilitating on her own. Her time of 2:05.60 was behind Shaffer's 
winning 2:05.21. 
</P>
<P>
	In the freestyle aerials competition at Park City's Utah Winter  
Sports Park, Olympic champion Nikki Stone concluded her career with 
a disappointing fourth-place finish after having trouble on her 
final landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully people will associate me with some of the things  
I've been able to do for the sport,'' said Stone, who won gold in 
the event at the Nagano Olympics. ``It's hard to leave, but it was 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The titles went to U.S. team rookie Marissa Berman and Park City  
resident Joe Pack, both of whom won their first national crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're skiing in competition, all you want to do is land  
on your feet, and I was able to do that today,'' Pack said. ``It's 
nice to be the local kid on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the women will attempt to run their once-postponed  
super-G on the same course which gave the men fits on Monday. The 
men's team will compete in the giant slalom in Park City.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota's Haskins Denies Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- University of Minnesota men's basketball  
coach Clem Haskins denied Monday giving money to a former player 
and to a tutor who says she wrote hundreds of papers for basketball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deny the allegations of former player Russ Archambault. I  
again deny the allegations of Jan Gangelhoff. They are not true,'' 
Haskins said in a statement issued through the university with the 
approval of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of the state of Minnesota are smart and recognize  
that people in leadership positions can have false allegations 
raised for whatever reason or agenda,'' Haskins said. 
``Fortunately, America has a system of justice that preserves the 
rights of all people, including those of athletes and coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff's claims that she wrote papers and did course work  
for at least 20 current and former Golden Gopher players has 
triggered an investigation into academic fraud at the university. 
She said Haskins paid her to keep tutoring a player after the 
university's academic counseling unit told her to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, Archambault has said Haskins gave him several  
hundred dollars in cash while he was a member of the team from 1996 
through February 1998, when he was dismissed by Haskins for leaving 
his hotel after curfew the night before a game at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash payments could bring severe NCAA penalties for Haskins as  
well as the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that the University of Minnesota is now  
fighting so hard to deny the existence of a conspiracy to keep 
university basketball players eligible to play,'' replied 
Gangelhoff's attorney, Jim Lord. He also is representing her 
sister, Jeanne Payer, another former tutor for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff and Payer are expected to hold a news conference  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official investigation began Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Haskins spoke by telephone from Florida with  
university President Mark Yudof, who said he wanted reassurance of 
Haskins' denials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got that,'' Yudof said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he believed Haskins, adding, ``what I personally believe  
is not the issue. We will have investigators who will interview the 
witnesses and look at the document and see what can be corroborated 
and what can't, and we'll go with the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the allegations prove to be true, Yudof promised swift action  
but did not say what that might be.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Australia Attack Steel Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- The governments of Japan and  
Australia combined Monday to launch a joint attack on a plan to 
impose new quotas on U.S. steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior leaders of both governments accused the U.S. Congress of  
ignoring America's obligations under World Trade Organization 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans from steel-producing areas joined minority House  
Democrats last Wednesday in passing a bill to reduce imports of 
foreign steel despite a veto threat from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Kaoru  
Yosano said Monday the bill breaches World Trade Organization 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a concern over moves in the United States Congress,  
such as the passage of the Steel Recovery Act, containing 
restrictive provisions on steel imports, which we find to be 
inconsistent with W.T.O. obligations,'' Yosano said after bilateral 
talks with Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Australia and Japan are at one on this issue,'' said Fischer,  
who is also Australia's Trade Minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The 289-141 House vote -- one short of the total needed to  
override a White House veto, when all 435 members are voting -- 
showed lawmakers' desire for tougher action to help an industry 
struggling against low-priced imports from Japan, Russia and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would limit steel imports to the average levels in  
the three years before July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports already are declining, but the American steel industry  
fears that is only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-priced and in some instances illegally dumped steel imports  
from Russia, Brazil and China have been blamed for the loss of 
10,000 steelworkers jobs and the bankruptcy of three companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosano said Japan's steel exports to the United States had been  
declining over recent years and ``I therefore feel that Japanese 
exports will no longer be a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer said both Australia and Japan had been targeted by  
``elements in Washington'' which claimed both countries' steel 
exports to the United States had been excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We absolutely reject any contention that we have been dumping  
steel product on the American steel market,'' Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say to the United States that we are very concerned  
about growing protection in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their economy is growing at 4 percent or thereabouts, that is  
why they are sucking in imports.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Pump Prices Rising on OPEC Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Gasoline prices are likely to continue  
rising if OPEC fulfills expectations and approves production cuts 
of 2.1 million barrels a day when its representatives meet today. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices already reflect the impact of the expected cuts, and  
industry analysts say refiners of gasoline have wasted no time 
passing on the steeper prices to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that gas prices in North America and the  
rest of the world have risen because of OPEC's decision,'' said 
Doug Terreson of Morgan Stanley, speaking from his office in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries would reduce the world's oil supply by about 2.6 percent, 
in a unified effort with non-OPEC producers to strengthen prices 
for crude that had languished at a 12-year low as recently as 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC oil ministers have said the organization plans to reduce  
daily output by its members to 1.72 million barrels. Non-OPEC 
producers like Mexico, Norway, Russia and Oman are expected to 
account for additional cuts totaling 388,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement to curtail production was reached two weeks ago by  
the group's three biggest members -- Saudi Arabia, Iran and 
Venezuela -- together with Mexico and fellow OPEC member Algeria. 
Crude prices responded by jumping almost $3 a barrel, and gasoline 
prices followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``After it became evident that OPEC was going to cut production,  
the price at the pump really began to move quickly,'' said George 
Gaspar of Robert W. Baird and Co., a financial services firm based 
in Milwaukee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of all grades of gasoline at U.S. service  
stations surged nearly 8 1/2 cents per gallon over the past two weeks, 
according to the Lundberg Survey, the steepest and fastest increase 
since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices shot up more than 9 percent at self-service pumps in the  
United States, where unleaded regular averaged nearly $1.03 in the 
latest survey, compared with just over 94 cents two weeks ago, 
according to the California-based Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say OPEC's plan to curtail production accounted for at  
least half of the rise in gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for more expensive gasoline has been the approach  
of spring, when people usually begin spending more time in their 
cars. Gasoline inventories had been unusually large last fall and 
winter, said Fergus McLeod of the securities firm BT Alex. Brown. 
As inventories began to dwindle, gas prices began to rise from 
their depressed levels. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision by OPEC to pump less oil will likely cause gasoline  
prices to rise further -- by two to three cents a gallon for every 
additional dollar increase in the price for a barrel of oil, McLeod 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If OPEC gets reasonably good compliance with the production  
cuts, that will lead to even higher gas prices in coming months,'' 
Terreson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, contracts for April delivery of light, sweet  
crude have traded in the $15-$15.50 range on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Crude traded as low as $10.72 a barrel on that 
exchange in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaspar foresees prices rising by as much as 10 cents a gallon  
from their current levels. The effect of cuts in oil output could 
continue to buoy gasoline prices well into the fall, he said, when 
gasoline prices typically decrease slightly as colder weather makes 
driving less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	A possible glitch in the seemingly irresistible momentum toward  
OPEC production cuts has come in the form of a protest by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Amer Mohammed Rasheed, Iraq's oil minister, said in a report  
published Monday that Iraq would insist that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's 
largest producer, make additional cuts on its own. Iraq wants Saudi 
Arabia to reduce its output closer to the level it produced at 
prior to the Gulf War. The Saudis began pumping more oil after the 
war to make up for the market share Iraq lost when U.N. sanctions 
barred exports of Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, which now produces more than 8 million barrels a  
day, has pledged to reduce output by 585,000 barrels a day -- more 
than any other OPEC member. But Rasheed would insist that Saudi 
Arabia cut back by an additional 1.1 million barrels or more, he 
told the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly oil review published 
in Nicosia, Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	Other OPEC oil ministers seemed to play down the potential for  
trouble at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreement tomorrow is confirmed,'' said Venezuelan Oil  
Minister Ali Rodriguez.

<HEADLINE> Comcast, MediaOne Announce Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comcast Corp. is buying MediaOne Group Inc. for  
$48.65 billion in stock, combining the nation's third- and 
fourth-largest cable television providers in the industry's richest 
merger ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Comcast will serve 11 million cable customers under the  
deal announced today, with a potential market of 18 million homes. 
Comcast would rank behind only Time Warner Inc. and AT&AMP;T Corp., 
which recently acquired Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne stock jumped 12 percent on news of the deal, but  
Comcast shares dropped 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies are hoping demand will increase for high-speed  
Internet access and phone services over cable lines, which have 
much greater capacity than phone lines. Comcast hopes the deal will 
allow it to offer expanded all-in-one packages of TV, Internet and 
phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne is a spinoff of the phone company U S West Inc., which  
in late 1997 gave up on the idea that cable and phone providers 
could complement each other and split its cable business into a 
separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of today's deal eclipses AT&AMP;T's $44 billion purchase  
of TCI, which was completed two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cable systems, Philadelphia-based Comcast's  
interests include a 57 percent stake in the home-shopping cable 
network QVC Inc.; the National Hockey League's Philadelphia Flyers; 
the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers; and 
stakes in the E! and Golf Channel cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne, based in Englewood, Colo., and also has interests in  
wireless communications businesses outside the United States 
serving more than 3 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined companies generated more than $8 billion in revenue  
last year and will have cable systems throughout the East, as well 
as in the Midwest and West.. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, MediaOne shareholders will receive 1.1  
shares of Comcast stock for each of MediaOne's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading, MediaOne stock shot up $7.25 to $68 per  
share on the New York Stock Exchange, while Comcast shares dropped 
$5 to $67.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement has been approved by the boards of both companies  
but is subject to the approval of Comcast and MediaOne 
shareholders, and of federal and local regulatory agencies. The 
companies said they expect the deal to be closed by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph J. Roberts, the chairman of Comcast, and his son Brian L.  
Roberts, the chief executive and president, will retain their 
posts. MediaOne's president, CEO and chairman, Charles M. Lillis, 
will become vice chairman of MediaOne and join its board of 
directors, along with three additional MediaOne designees. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would allow MediaOne to accept a better offer, but  
would have to pay Comcast $1.5 billion for breaking the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest cable system operators, assuming the  
completion of Comcast Corp.'s acquisition of MediaOne Group Inc. 
and other pending transactions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Time Warner Inc., 12.6 million  
</P>
<P>
	--AT&AMP;T Corp., 12.5 million  
</P>
<P>
	--Comcast Corp., 11 million  
</P>
<P>
	--Adelphia Communications Corp., 4.7 million  
</P>
<P>
	--Cox Communications Inc., 3.8 million

<HEADLINE> Benigni's Village Celebrates Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERGAIO, Italy (AP) -- It was drizzly and chilly at 4 a.m., but  
the Tuscan village where Roberto Benigni was born was still wide 
awake when their hometown boy made good on Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roberto! Roberto! Roberto!'' the crowd watching at Vergaio's  
community center cried out when Benigni's Holocaust fable ``Life is 
Beautiful'' won the Academy Award for best foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni, the son of a poor farmer who survived a German labor  
camp during World War II, was born 46 years ago in Vergaio, a 
village of 3,000 people about 15 miles northwest of Florence. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone there stayed up at least part of the night to  
watch the Oscar broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	And they weren't disappointed. The exuberant Benigni also  
bounded off with the coveted best actor award and his movie snagged 
a third Oscar for the musical score. 
</P>
<P>
	As Vergaio's band struck up a tune, corks popped and people  
jumped to their feet, dancing, kissing and hugging each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Already one of Italy's most popular comedians, Benigni's  
Hollywood success has turned him into a national hero. The movie 
has also raised hopes of a renaissance in Italian cinema, which has 
a distinguished history but has fallen into the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Benigni's Oscars ``honor  
Italian cinema and culture in addition to being a great personal 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy has now won a dozen Oscars for best foreign film. But only  
three have come in the last quarter-century. ``Life is Beautiful'' 
became the most successful foreign film ever in the United States, 
with a box office take of $35.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, who won nine Oscars for  
his 1988 film ``The Last Emperor,'' said Monday that each time a 
foreign film gets a major prize, it levels the Hollywood-dominated 
playing field a little. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni is the first Italian and the first non-English speaker  
to win the best actor award, although best actress honors went 
twice to Italians: Sophia Loren in 1961 for ``Two Women'' and Anna 
Magnani in 1955 for ``The Rose Tattoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni wrote, directed and starred in the tale of an Italian  
Jewish father who uses humor to shield his son from the horrors of 
a concentration camp. He drew inspiration for his role from how his 
own father Luigi spoke of his wartime ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order not to scare me and my sisters, he tried to tell us  
the story really full of gladness, full of life. And this was 
really touching, very touching,'' Benigni said last month. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Oscar ceremony, Benigni honored victims of the  
Holocaust, which include around 7,000 Italian Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to dedicate this movie to the subject: those who  
are not here, those who gave their lives in order that we can say: 
life is beautiful,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Kentucky Denied in Final Four Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The end for Scott Padgett and Heshimu Evans was  
nothing like they'd imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's two seniors were notorious by their absence of  
production in the Midwest Regional final Sunday as the Wildcats 
were denied their fourth consecutive Final Four appearance. Padgett 
had 11 points on 3-of-8 shooting and Evans, after scoring 12 points 
in the first 9:42, went without a point the rest of the way as the 
defending national champions lost 73-66 to No. 1 seed Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was a big reason Kentucky (28-9) twice led by 13 points in  
the first half. But he also played out of control at times on the 
defensive end and sat out much of the second half with foul 
trouble. He was so out of sync that coach Tubby Smith took him out 
with 1:42 to go and the game still hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was off to a great start,'' Smith said. ``I think that hurt  
us, him getting into foul trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was having trouble adjusting to the fact there will be no  
more games and that Kentucky no longer has a shot at becoming the 
first team since Duke in 1990 and '91 to repeat as national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our attention was to make it to the Final Four,'' Evans  
said. ``We knew as the road continued it was going to get tougher. 
But I'm not going to hang my head. We just got beat by a good 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of Padgett's points came in the final 1:42 and his second  
3-pointer in that stretch, with 18.8 seconds to go, cut the gap to 
69-66. But in the final six minutes he also missed the front end of 
the one-and-one from the foul line and the second of two free 
throws in another situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett had a career-high 29 points in the second round against  
Kansas, and scored 14 of his 17 points in the second half on Friday 
night against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually I don't miss too many free throws,'' said Padgett, a  
68-percent shooter. ``Those are the shots you need to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Michigan State's quickness, especially at the forward  
position, was a key to neutralizing his top threats. Kentucky made 
seven of its first 10 shots and shot 51.7 percent in the first 
half, but was 9-for-24 the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I came off a screen, they switched everything,''  
Padgett said. ``When I tried to get to the paint, they switched to 
a big guy and fronted me. I also missed two or three open shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some good looks and I didn't make them today.''  
</P>
<P>
	Don't feel too sorry for Kentucky, which has won 132 games the  
last four seasons to tie its own four-year record set from 1995-98. 
Smith got good production in the tournament from freshmen Tayshaun 
Prince, Desmond Allison and Jules Camara, and sophomore Saul Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince, who had nine points in the first three tourney games,  
had 12 Sunday on 3-of-3 shooting and hit both of his 3-point 
attempts. Allison had seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit here in awe of all the accomplishments and accolades,  
both as a team and individually, that they achieved,'' Smith said 
of the departing seniors. ``They set a template for me to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was Kentucky's first in 10 NCAA tournament games.

	U.S. Envoy, Serb Leader Meet  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke  
came to Belgrade today in an 11th-hour bid to persuade Yugoslavia's 
president to accept a Kosovo peace plan or face NATO attack. An 
attack could come soon after Holbrooke wraps up his talks tonight 
in the Yugoslav capital with hard-line leader Slobodan Milosevic. 
However, chances for any agreement appeared bleak. In a statement 
broadcast as the talks began, Milosevic slammed the Americans and 
their allies. ``You people should be ashamed because you are 
getting ready to use force against a small European nation because 
it protects its territory against separatism and its people against 
terrorism...'' state television quoted Milosevic as saying.

	Fighting Intensifies in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	SRBICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian residents of this  
Kosovo town said black-masked Yugoslav soldiers shot to death as 
many as 22 unarmed people in a weekend campaign to crush separatist 
resistance. Fighting continued in Kosovo today, and ethnic 
Albanians said at least five villages were burning in Drenica along 
with others elsewhere. Serb authorities denied the ethnic Albanian 
reports. ``Albanian terrorists and separatists are trying with 
fresh new manipulations about mass killings to provoke an 
international reaction and increase the pressure on Yugoslavia,'' 
said Col. Bozidar Filic, spokesman for Serb police in Kosovo.

represent himself at his first murder trial today. After the 
ruling, 12 jurors and two alternates quickly were selected out of a 
pool of 80 people. Opening statements got under way this afternoon. 
Kevorkian is charged with the videotaped suicide of a man with Lou 
Gerhig's disease. The retired pathologist will be allowed to 
consult with lawyers David Gorosh and Lisa Dwyer during this trial, 
but he said that defending himself was ``what I've planned all

	TURNAGAIN PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Volunteers with 10-foot poles  
repeatedly poked the snow today in a search for the bodies of as 
many as six people who may have been swept off their snowmobiles in 
an avalanche that killed two others. Two snowmobilers were found 
dead, and State Trooper 1st Sgt. Paul Burke said six others were 
thought to be missing, based on phone calls overnight from people 
reporting that friends or relatives hadn't returned. Troopers also 
were analyzing a videotape taken by an eyewitness to try to 
pinpoint where some victims may be buried. The video shows several 
snowmobilers trying to outrun a part of the slide. They disappear 
in smoky clouds and aren't seen again.

	OPEC Plan Prompts Gas Price Hike  
</P>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC's plan to reduce the world's oil  
supply by about 2.6 percent has already prompted price hikes at 
gasoline pumps in the United States and elsewhere. Formal approval 
of the cuts could push gasoline prices even higher, analysts said. 
Prices shot up more than 9 percent at self-service pumps in the 
United States, where unleaded regular averaged nearly $1.03 in the 
latest survey, compared with just over 94 cents two weeks ago, 
according to the Lundberg Survey.

	Microsoft To Begin Settlement Talks

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. expects to begin negotiations

almost five months of an acrimonious courtroom fight. The company 
indicated anew today that it would consider changing some of its 
most controversial agreements with the nation's computer makers and 
Internet providers. But the software giant won't accept 
government-demanded restrictions on what new features it can add to 
its Windows operating system software, which runs roughly 90

by a Frenchman ranked 74th in the world. Moya, playing his third 
three-set match in three days, lost 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (11-9) to 
Sebastien Grosjean in the fourth round of the Lipton Championships. 
Sampras was to play Albert Costa later and needed a victory to 
reclaim No. 1. Moya became the first Spaniard to top the computer 
rankings when he overtook Sampras last week.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Finish Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and corn futures prices finished sharply  
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes the government 
would purchase more farm products for export to Russia. Wheat also 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans led the gains on speculation the U.S. Agriculture  
Department might announce it planned another donation to cash-strapped 
Russia, with soybean meal or oil as the centerpiece of that package. 
</P>
<P>
        Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said after a meeting with  
Russian officials that they had requested more food aid this year and 
that the U.S. agency would consider that request. 
</P>
<P>
        The Clinton administration is under pressure to boost exports  
as the trade deficit grows and farmers suffer from weak sales because 
of a global economic crisis. That has led to increased food donations 
to economically depressed countries and more government-backed loan 
and credit guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat's gains were limited were expectations the USDA would  
report much of the winter wheat crop remains in good to excellent condition, 
setting the stage for ample supplies amid a time of weak world demand. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for July delivery rose 3/4 cent to $2.86 1/2 a bushel;  
May corn rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.32 1/4 a bushel; May oats rose 4 1/2 
cents to $1.17 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans rose 10 cents to $4.99 1/4 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Meat and livestock also rose sharply, on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, after USDA General Sales Manager Christopher Goldthwait said 
South Korea this week likely will sign a $1 billion export credit guarantee 
that would mean more sales of beef and pork this year. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle rose .35 cent to 67 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .27 cent to 71.42 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose 1.65 cents to 44.45 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose the limit 
3 cents to 54.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Hoffa Sworn In As Teamsters Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Teamsters have sworn in James P. Hoffa as  
the union's new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming a post once held by his late father, Hoffa took the  
oath of office Monday at the union's headquarters. He then 
administered it to other newly elected officers, most of whom were 
sworn in through a conference call, before holding an executive 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The new panel passed several resolutions, including one  
authorizing auditors to review the union's financial records. Hoffa 
has pledged to balance the Teamsters' budget during his first year 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also passed a resolution to create an internal ethics  
panel to help reshape the image of the union, which has been 
tainted by charges of ties to organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa, son of Jimmy Hoffa, defeated Tom Leedham in a rerun  
presidential election last December. A campaign finance scandal 
overturned president Ron Carey's 1996 re-election and barred him 
from trying to reclaim the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Election officer Michael Cherkasky certified the results of  
Hoffa's victory in January. However, he barred one of Hoffa's 
running mates from taking office and delayed certifying the 
election results for two vice presidential posts representing 
Canadian locals. 
</P>
<P>
	Leedham had argued that the election results should not be  
certified until investigations of other candidates on Hoffa's slate 
had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, U.S. District Judge David Edelstein in New York  
affirmed Hoffa's victory and Cherkasky's decision that 
certification of the election results should not be delayed because 
of charges pending against some members of the Hoffa slate.

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate Wipers, Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating  
complaints that windshield wipers are failing on some older model 
Ford Motor Co. cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received  
25 such complaints from motorists about Ford Taurus and Mercury 
Sable cars from model year 1993, according to a monthly agency 
report released Monday. Some drivers said they were forced to pull 
over because they could not see. 
</P>
<P>
	About 555,000 of the popular cars are on the road.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of the investigation and cooperating fully,'' said  
Ford spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is looking into motorist complaints that air  
bags deployed inadvertently on some Mazda Miata cars from the 1995 
model year. 
</P>
<P>
	One driver complained the air bags deployed after the car was  
left parked, and another motorist said the air bags deployed for no 
apparent reason while he was traveling 25 mph to 30 mph, the report 
said. Several motorists said their Miatas struck something in the 
road, in one case an empty cardboard box the size of a briefcase 
and in another case a curb. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorists said the inflating air bags caused one crash and  
three injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mazda recalled the 1995 and 1996 Mazda 626 and MX6  
cars after more than 50 motorists complained the air bags opened 
when the cars hit a pothole or curb, got a flat tire, the driver 
braked or for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last year, General Motors recalled nearly 1 million autos  
to repair sensitive air bag systems after more than 300 motorists 
complained of air bags bursting open without any crash on 
late-model Chevrolet Cavaliers, Pontiac Sunfires and Cadillacs. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, the federal highway safety agency has been  
investigating nearly 1 million Chrysler vehicles and some 
Mitsubishi vehicles based on complaints that air bags are inflating 
inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHTSA opens safety investigations with a preliminary inquiry  
in which the agency and manufacturer exchange paperwork, including 
any complaints, as in the recent Ford and Mazda cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation may then be upgraded to an engineering  
analysis, during which engineers study components to see if they 
are defective. An investigation can lead to a recall or it may be 
dropped.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: NATO United Against Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Monday that NATO is  
solidly behind airstrikes if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
doesn't yield to a last-minute diplomatic plea. ``Serbia's mounting 
aggression must be stopped,'' Clinton asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as he spoke, the Senate took up legislation aimed at  
blocking funds for any military intervention in the Kosovo crisis 
unless the president first obtained congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we go bombing sovereign nations, we ought to have a  
plan,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, a sponsor of the 
restricting legislation. ``There is no clear policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Senate leaders seeking a compromise that would not  
undermine the administration's hard line in dealing with Milosevic, 
special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made another effort in 
Belgrade to pressure Milosevoic to agree to an interim peace 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is strong unity among the NATO allies,'' Clinton said.  
``We all agree that we cannot allow President Milosevic to continue 
the aggression with impunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke and Milosevoic met for four hours Monday and Holbrooke  
briefed Clinton's national security team, including Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and 
national security adviser Sandy Berger on Monday evening, White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Holbrooke gave a pessimistic outlook, telling  
reporters in Belgrade, ``I would be misleading you if I suggested 
that today's talks resulted in any substantial change in the 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ongoing crackdown in Kosovo, where government forces  
are battling Kosovo Liberation Army rebels, ``make it difficult to 
pursue peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said he would ``reassess'' later Tuesday whether to  
continue with his mission. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Serbian leader rejects Holbrooke's latest overture,  
``NATO's military plans must continue to move forward,'' the 
president said. Clinton said he had consulted with European leaders 
over the weekend by telephone and had also sent a letter to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin ``about the urgency of the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has opposed airstrikes. But Clinton said, ``Our objective  
in Kosovo remains clear: to stop the killing and achieve a durable 
peace that restores Kosovars to self-government. ... We and our 
NATO allies and Russia all agree that this is the right goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke outside the White House after he returned from  
Camp David, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked away from the microphones without answering a question  
about when the repeatedly delayed bombing deadline would finally 
expire and result in airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian side in the dispute signed a peace plan last  
week in Paris for returning self-rule to Kosovo, but the 
Milosevic-led Serbian side has refused to sign, or to allow NATO 
peacekeeprs to come into Kosovo, a province of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton invited a bipartisan group of leading House  
and Senate members for a briefing on the crisis Tuesday at the 
White House. Aides to congressional leaders said they anticipated 
that efforts would be discussed at the session to find ways of 
avoiding a bitter Senate debate from continuing while airstrikes 
were imminent or Holbrook still in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters late Monday he believes 
a majority of senators would suppport airstrikes -- if it could ever 
come to a straight yes-or-no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright portrayed  
Holbrooke's mission as Milosevic's last chance to avoid NATO 
bombardment of Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time has run out and that is why Mr. Holbrooke's mission is so  
important,'' Albright said at a brief news conference at the State 
Department. But she sounded pessimistic about the chance the 
Yugoslav leader would reverse course and accept the plan that would 
give self-rule to ethnic Albanians and enforce it with NATO 
peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to deliver the message that airstrikes are being  
prepared,'' Albright said, calling his a ``stark choice'' of 
accepting a six-nation plan for the Serbian province or being force 
to ``bear the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made this last effort because we believe it is  
important as we put Americans into a NATO force that we have gone 
the last mile,'' Albright said, referring to the role Americans 
would take in a bombing operation. 
</P>
<P>
	She said fighting in Kosovo had intensified while the toll of  
refugees fleeing their homes was on the rise. At the same time, 
Albright dismissed reports NATO would go on a ground offensive 
against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate debated legislation sponsored by Senate  
GOP leaders that would bar funds for any U.S. military action in 
Kosovo without prior congressional approval. But even Senate 
leaders seemed a little uncomfortable with the timing -- with 
delicate negotiations going on in Belgrade and a key vote scheduled 
on the Kosovo bill for early afternoon on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accede that the timing is bad, but I don't know when it gets  
better,'' said Mrs. Hutchison, the prime sponsor of the 
legislation. ``This doesn't prohibit the airstrikes. It just says 
that the president has to come to Congress first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats urged a delay in Senate votes -- even while  
agreeing that Clinton should consult more closely with Congress if 
U.S. forces are to be sent into a combat situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very difficult time for us to be sending this  
message to Mr. Milosevic,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he favored a Senate yes-or-no vote on whether to  
proceed with the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	As to the military action itself, Biden indicated he favored  
moving against Milosevic militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the downside of not acting?'' Biden asked. ``It is  
immense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A test vote on the measure, also sponsored by Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., was expected on Tuesday. Lott needs 60 
votes in the 100-member Senate to overcome procedural barriers put 
up by Democrats and to prevail -- a threshold Lott was not expected 
to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were under way among Republican and Democratic Senate  
leaders for common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The House earlier this month narrowly passed a nonbinding  
resolution expressing support for sending U.S. troops to Kosovo as 
part of a future NATO peacekeeping force.

<HEADLINE> John Hancock Urges IOC Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- John Hancock continued to be the most vocal  
Olympic sponsor about the ongoing bribes scandal, calling on IOC 
member Phil Coles to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt, Mr. Coles has sincere and personal reasons for  
staying,'' the sponsor said in a written statement released Monday. 
``He has made many important contributions to the Olympics over the 
years. But now, he is damaging the movement worldwide as well as 
Australia's outstanding efforts to stage what will be extraordinary 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``By leaving, he can right that unintentional wrong.''  
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said last week he is asking  
Coles, the Australian's ex-wife and Greek Olympic officials for 
more information regarding expensive gifts the Coles were said to 
have received. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgina Coles, who was divorced from Coles almost six years  
ago, sent a fax to IOC officials Friday in which she said the 
couple received a gold-and-diamond necklace and cufflinks while 
visiting Athens, which made an unsuccessful Olympic bid in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The items have been appraised at $6,300 -- far beyond the IOC's  
$150 limit on gifts from bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Morning Herald reported Monday that a Greek jeweler  
has admitted supplying the Athens Olympic bid team with fine 
jewelry, including a gold necklace owned by the wife of Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Already slapped with a severe censure for accepting lavish  
travel in the Salt Lake City bid scandal, Coles could be expelled 
if the board finds he previously violated the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney Olympics chief Michael Knight has called on Coles to  
``stop the pain'' by quitting the board of SOCOG, the organizing 
committee for the 2000 Games. But Coles said Friday he would not 
resign from the SOCOG board or the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock praised the way SOCOG has responded to the scandal.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have been blunt, direct and relentless in pursuing the  
truth and demanding accountability,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock president and chief operations officer David  
D'Alessandro previously said he had seen nothing from the two days 
of Olympic meetings that would cause him to resume TV ad 
negotiations with NBC for the games or return the Olympic rings to 
company reports and billboards, two actions he took as the scandal 
unfolded.

<HEADLINE> Broadcast.com Shares Jump 37 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Broadcast.com Inc. jumped 37 percent  
Monday following a report that Yahoo! Inc. is in talks to acquire 
the Internet audio and video provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeover rumors started Friday with a Business Week Online story  
that said Yahoo! is ``hot to snap up Broadcast.com.'' The report 
cited a source familiar with discussions between the two companies. 
Internet chat rooms picked up the story and have tossed in other 
likely suitors for Broadcast.com. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yahoo! spokeswoman said the company does not comment on market  
speculation. A spokeswoman for Broadcast.com said company 
executives did not know why its stock was up and had no 
announcement to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Broadcast.com is perhaps best known for its Webcast  
of Victoria's Secret live fashion show last month. But analysts say 
the online distribution of audio and video on the Internet could 
become a very profitable business as high-speed, also known as 
broadband, access to the Web becomes more widely available. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make Broadcast.com attractive to Yahoo! The Santa  
Clara, Calif., which provides a gateway and search engine for the 
Internet, may be looking to add content to its Web site to attract 
more customers and keep them on the site longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need more features and capabilities,'' said Charles Lax,  
general partner of SoftBank Venture Capital, which is Yahoo!'s 
biggest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lax said he didn't know if the two companies were in talks. But,  
he added, Broadcast.com would give Yahoo! broadband content, which 
is something Yahoo! doesn't have, but its rival Excite Inc. does. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! wasn't the only name being bandied around as an  
attractive partner for Broadcast.com. Participants in chat rooms on 
the Internet speculated that America Online and General Electric 
Corp., which owns NBC, could also be interested in buying the audio 
and video distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast.com's stock rose $31.50 to close at $116.50 on heavy  
volume on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Yahoo!'s shares fell $5 to $165, 
also on Nasdaq.

<HEADLINE> Gwyneth Paltrow Wins Best Actress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gwyneth Paltrow established herself as a fresh, elegant symbol  
of Generation X style, but she won the actress Oscar by going back 
to a much earlier time: 16th century England. She played the 
willowy lover who inspires a youthful Bard in the romantic comedy 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Paltrow wasn't the filmmakers' first choice for Viola, the  
playwright's fictional lover and purported inspiration for ``Romeo 
and Juliet.'' She got the part when filming was postponed and the 
cast reorganized around a young, romantic Will. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Roberts originally was named for the part of Viola.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	--From the podium: Shaking slightly and stammering at times, her  
performance at the ceremony was anything but cool and composed. The 
actress sobbed as she thanked everyone from her ``Grandpa Buster'' 
to her ``soulful partner (co-star) Joseph Fiennes.'' ``I would not 
have been able to play this role had I not understood love of a 
tremendous magnitude and for that I thank my family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hollywood roots: Her father is movie producer Bruce Paltrow and  
her mother is actress Blythe Danner. 
</P>
<P>
	--Early breakthroughs: Her first movie role was in ``Shout'' with  
John Travolta. A chance meeting with Steven Spielberg led to her 
casting as Wendy in his grown-up version of Peter Pan, ``Hook.''

<HEADLINE> Albert To Make TNT Debut Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marv Albert needs no introduction to a national  
audience, but Turner Sports will give him one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert makes his Turner debut in the studio on Tuesday night  
throughout the Heat-Jazz telecast at 8 p.m. on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to introduce him as a member of our team,''  
said Turner spokesman Greg Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, fired by NBC in 1997 after pleading guilty to biting a  
woman during a sexual encounter, is scheduled to make his 
play-by-play debut on TNT's broadcast of the Los Angeles Lakers 
game at Phoenix on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a cameo,'' Albert said. ``The toughest moments  
for me are out of the way. Coming back to the (Madison Square) 
Garden was huge. Now I'm just trying to do my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert has called Knicks games on radio this season for Madison  
Square Garden Network. 
</P>
<P>
	He will work six regular-season games this season for Turner,  
then will be placed in the regular announcing rotation during the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next season, Albert will become a full-time member of  
the Turner on-air staff, announcing a full slate of about 25 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's last national basketball telecast was the NBA Finals in  
1997 with NBC, where he worked for 20 years. Later that year, after 
the trial, he was fired by NBC and resigned from the MSG Network.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. Coach Looks for Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Duke has a great coach, a great  
basketball program, a great team. And Michigan State coach Tom Izzo 
says ``they are pretty much unbeatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Izzo sure isn't conceding Saturday's semifinal game,  
especially after his gritty Spartans' come-from-behind victory 
Sunday against Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no bigger upset than Michigan State beating Duke,''  
Izzo said. ``All I have to do is make sure our kids understand 
that. And knowing these players and knowing their toughness, I'm 
sure we're not going in there scared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nervous, maybe. Scared, no.''  
</P>
<P>
	Duke (36-1) and Michigan State (33-4), the top two teams in the  
final AP poll, met earlier this season, with the Blue Devils 
winning 73-67 in the Great Eight tournament. Saturday's game at 
Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla., has a little more at stake 
with the winner taking on either Ohio State or Connecticut for the 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said Michigan State matches up with Duke somewhat, at least  
in size. And even though Duke has been the dominant team this 
season, the Michigan State coach has hopes for a big upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no doubt we're going to be an underdog, but we've been  
the underdog before,'' he said. ``I'm really looking forward to it; 
I really am. I'm not looking forward to it in a cocky way, thinking 
that hey, we're just going to go out and beat Duke, but in a 
confident way where I think we can do some things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Spartans want some inspiration, they and their fans don't  
have to look further than Sunday's game, in which Michigan State 
rebounded from an early 13-point deficit to beat Kentucky 73-66. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember: A slow start and a good ending is a lot better than  
a fast start and a bad ending,'' Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State may pick up an edge from happy Spartan fans.  
After Sunday's victory, the team returned to Lansing around 
midnight to find about 300 fans crowding the airport, and Izzo 
could sense the enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was such an emotional event ... seeing all those  
people out there at 12:30 at night,'' he said. ``I think the campus 
is electric right now; people are caught up in the spirit of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only the students but this entire community has kind of  
taken a grasp of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of those caught up in the green-and-white spirit are former  
Spartan players and coaches, many of whom have shown up to root on 
this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching from the stands in St. Louis on Sunday, among others,  
were Magic Johnson and former coach Jud Heathcote, who teamed to 
lead the Spartans to the NCAA title in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great he took the time to come back,'' Izzo said of  
Heathcote. And, he said, Johnson ``thinks we can win it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of faith in what he thinks, so I'll just go with  
that,'' Izzo added.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Freeman Making a Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Postseason play has been payback time for  
Connecticut's Kevin Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Snubbed when it came time to pick the Big East's first, second  
or third all-conference teams, the power forward's rebounding and 
clutch shooting have helped carry the Huskies (32-2) to their first 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman had 13 points and a career-high 15 rebounds -- 10 off the  
offensive boards -- in UConn's 67-62 win against Gonzaga to advance 
to St. Petersburg, Fla. In the final minutes, he hit two free 
throws to give UConn the lead for good at 57-55 and then iced the 
game with two more from the line with 6.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	With the game on the line, there were no butterflies. Just net.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can have that same confidence and God will bless  
me with the same strokes to allow the ball to go in,'' Freeman said 
Monday. ``It's just a matter of focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, winners of the West Regional, take on Ohio State on  
Saturday. The Buckeyes (27-8) advanced to the Final Four with a 
77-74 South Regional final win against St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the conference snub, the accolades are  
mounting. Freeman was named to the West Regional All-Tournament 
team. And his performance in the conference tournament earlier this 
month earned him Most Outstanding Player honors. 
</P>
<P>
	His award-winning efforts aren't anything out of the ordinary  
for the 6-foot-7 junior, say his teammates and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the incredible ability to will himself to do things,''  
said coach Jim Calhoun. ``He's done it in a humble sort of way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said he marveled at Freeman's 10 offensive boards  
against the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely phenomenal,'' Calhoun said. ``Coaches just  
don't marvel when you've had the great fortune to have some great 
players play for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's leading rebounder, the muscular Freeman is averaging  
7.3 boards a game. With 12.6 points a game, he's the third top 
scorer behind the higher profile tandem of All-American Richard 
Hamilton and flashy point guard Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	When they've gone cold at times -- El-Amin was 0-for-12 against  
Gonzaga -- the Huskies look inside to Freemen and get results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin brings toughness. He brings it consistently,'' said  
center Jake Voskuhl. ``He's playing the best basketball right now 
that he's played since he's been here. The sky's the limit for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman and the 6-11 Voskuhl have played together for three  
years, and with the addition of 6-8 sophomore Edmund Saunders, are 
formidable in the post. The three combine for nearly 19 boards a 
game and can read each other like a road map. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided early on in the second half of the Gonzaga game to  
get every rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just looked at Kevin, Kevin looked at me,'' said Voskuhl.  
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies went on to get 10 second-chance points in the last  
eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the communication, especially with me and Jake down  
low, is something that develops over time. We have a natural 
bond,'' said Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he's put the Big East snub behind him and just  
tries to prove every game he's one of the top players in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people don't want to recognize it they won't,'' he said.  
``Hopefully we'll continue to win and I'll continue to be the X 
factor that beats you.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 14 In Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened narrowly mixed. The Dow  
Jones industrial average is down 14 points in today's early 
trading. Advancers and decliners are evenly split on the New York 
Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq Composite Index is up six points and the 
S&AMP;P 500 Index is down a fraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks may look for a rebound today, after the market lost  
ground on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say with recent weakness in the technology sector,  
and new worries about corporate profits, the market likely won't go 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow traded above the 10,000-level during three different  
sessions last week -- but failed to close above the mark each time. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Power of Words Wins Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Academy paused for a few moments, between  
the year that brought us the incredible sinking ship and another 
that promises the digital wonders of a ``Star Wars'' prequel, to 
admire the greatest movie effect of all: the power of words. 
</P>
<P>
	How else to explain the unusual victory of ``Shakespeare in  
Love'' over ``Saving Private Ryan'' at Sunday's ceremony? 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly the Academy respected ``Ryan,'' the brutally realistic  
World War II epic, from a technical standpoint. The movie won for 
cinematography, film editing and the two sound categories. 
</P>
<P>
	And clearly the Academy applauded Steven Spielberg's efforts to  
pay homage to the sacrifices of his father's World War II 
generation by showing battle as it truly is in the famed opening 
sequence. Spielberg picked up the best director award, the second 
of his career, after winning for ``Schindler's List'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a somewhat rare move -- it's happened 18 times in the 71  
Academy Awards -- voters split the ticket and gave best picture to 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' the rollicking Elizabethan romp about the 
Bard as a struggling young playwright. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare'' won even though the director didn't, and even  
though the leading man, Joseph Fiennes, who was called on to carry 
most of the scenes as Shakespeare, wasn't even nominated (though 
lead actress Gwyneth Paltrow did win). 
</P>
<P>
	It had to have come down to the words.  
</P>
<P>
	The meaty, talky script, full of lengthy quotations from ``Romeo  
and Juliet,'' won best original screenplay for the team of 
Hollywood scribe Marc Norman and playwright Tom Stoppard. 
</P>
<P>
	Using such Shakespearean devices as star-crossed lovers and  
mistaken identities and double- and triple-entendres, ``Shakespeare 
in Love'' carried audiences on an emotional ride, while appealing 
with equal power to Shakespeare novices and those who know and love 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Working on several different levels at once, the movie was a  
romance, an adventure, a comedy, a satire of Hollywood and a love 
letter to the greatest playwright of all time, an amazing feat that 
no computer, no blue-screen effect, could ever match. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring the Academy's love of the word this year was the  
award for best adapted screenplay. Bill Condon's script for ``Gods 
and Monsters,'' based on a novel about the fictional final days of 
``Frankenstein'' director James Whale's life, was a small, 
character-driven drama, essentially a play opened up slightly for 
the screen, without an asteroid in sight.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: NATO United Against Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Monday that NATO is  
solidly behind airstrikes if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
doesn't yield to a last-minute diplomatic plea. ``Serbia's mounting 
aggression must be stopped,'' Clinton asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as he spoke, the Senate took up legislation aimed at  
blocking funds for any military intervention in the Kosovo crisis 
unless the president first obtained congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we go bombing sovereign nations, we ought to have a  
plan,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, a sponsor of the 
restricting legislation. ``There is no clear policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Senate leaders seeking a compromise that would not  
undermine the administration's hard line in dealing with Milosevic, 
special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made another effort in 
Belgrade to pressure Milosevoic to agree to an interim peace 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is strong unity among the NATO allies,'' Clinton said.  
``We all agree that we cannot allow President Milosevic to continue 
the aggression with impunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke and Milosevoic met for four hours Monday and Holbrooke  
briefed Clinton's national security team, including Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and 
national security adviser Sandy Berger on Monday evening, White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart declined to characterize the sessions, but he said  
further consultations between Holbrooke and Milosevic were expected 
later Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Serbian leader rejects Holbrooke's latest overture,  
``NATO's military plans must continue to move forward,'' the 
president said. Clinton said he had consulted with European leaders 
over the weekend by telephone and had also sent a letter to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin ``about the urgency of the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has opposed airstrikes. But Clinton said, ``Our objective  
in Kosovo remains clear: to stop the killing and achieve a durable 
peace that restores Kosovars to self-government. ... We and our 
NATO allies and Russia all agree that this is the right goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke outside the White House after he returned from  
Camp David, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked away from the microphones without answering a question  
about when the repeatedly delayed bombing deadline would finally 
expire and result in airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian side in the dispute signed a peace plan last  
week in Paris for returning self-rule to Kosovo, but the 
Milosevic-led Serbian side has refused to sign, or to allow NATO 
peacekeeprs to come into Kosovo, a province of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton invited a bipartisan group of leading House  
and Senate members for a briefing on the crisis Tuesday at the 
White House. Aides to congressional leaders said they anticipated 
that efforts would be discussed at the session to find ways of 
avoiding a bitter Senate debate from continuing while airstrikes 
were imminent or Holbrook still in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters late Monday he believes 
a majority of senators would suppport airstrikes -- if it could ever 
come to a straight yes-or-no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright portrayed  
Holbrooke's mission as Milosevic's last chance to avoid NATO 
bombardment of Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time has run out and that is why Mr. Holbrooke's mission is so  
important,'' Albright said at a brief news conference at the State 
Department. But she sounded pessimistic about the chance the 
Yugoslav leader would reverse course and accept the plan that would 
give self-rule to ethnic Albanians and enforce it with NATO 
peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is going to deliver the message that airstrikes are being  
prepared,'' Albright said, calling his a ``stark choice'' of 
accepting a six-nation plan for the Serbian province or being force 
to ``bear the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made this last effort because we believe it is  
important as we put Americans into a NATO force that we have gone 
the last mile,'' Albright said, referring to the role Americans 
would take in a bombing operation. 
</P>
<P>
	She said fighting in Kosovo had intensified while the toll of  
refugees fleeing their homes was on the rise. At the same time, 
Albright dismissed reports NATO would go on a ground offensive 
against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate debated legislation sponsored by Senate  
GOP leaders that would bar funds for any U.S. military action in 
Kosovo without prior congressional approval. But even Senate 
leaders seemed a little uncomfortable with the timing -- with 
delicate negotiations going on in Belgrade and a key vote scheduled 
on the Kosovo bill for early afternoon on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accede that the timing is bad, but I don't know when it gets  
better,'' said Mrs. Hutchison, the prime sponsor of the 
legislation. ``This doesn't prohibit the airstrikes. It just says 
that the president has to come to Congress first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats urged a delay in Senate votes -- even while  
agreeing that Clinton should consult more closely with Congress if 
U.S. forces are to be sent into a combat situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very difficult time for us to be sending this  
message to Mr. Milosevic,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he favored a Senate yes-or-no vote on whether to  
proceed with the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	As to the military action itself, Biden indicated he favored  
moving against Milosevic militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the downside of not acting?'' Biden asked. ``It is  
immense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A test vote on the measure, also sponsored by Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., was expected on Tuesday. Lott needs 60 
votes in the 100-member Senate to overcome procedural barriers put 
up by Democrats and to prevail -- a threshold Lott was not expected 
to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were under way among Republican and Democratic Senate  
leaders for common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The House earlier this month narrowly passed a nonbinding  
resolution expressing support for sending U.S. troops to Kosovo as 
part of a future NATO peacekeeping force.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices fell Tuesday morning on  
profit-taking in reaction to the sharp advance on Friday. The 
dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 219.71 points, or 1.34 percent, to  
16,159.07 points at the end of the morning session. On Friday, the

</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.77 yen, up 1.25 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and also above its level of 118.11 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo financial markets were closed Monday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shares started slightly higher on

	So team captain Tom Gullikson hopes his underdog team can draw  
strength from that. 
</P>
<P>
	The squad announced Monday will include Jim Courier, Todd  
Martin, Jan-Michael Gambill and Alex O'Brien against Great Britain 
on April 2-4 in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes controversy exacts a positive,'' Gullikson said at a  
news conference during the Lipton Championships. ``It helps make 
you stronger and really increases your resolve to take these guys 
here -- Alex and Jan-Michael, Todd and Jim -- who are really 
committed to it and really go out and give a wonderful 
performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, angry about the recent firing of the team physician,  
said Saturday he'll never play Davis Cup again. Sampras has been 
criticized for refusing to help the U.S. team in 1998 and again 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an honor to get to play for your country,''  
O'Brien said. ``I wish the rest of our guys felt that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Sampras and Agassi, Gullikson acknowledged that the  
British should be favored. Their team will be led by Tim Henman and 
Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing at home and they have two top-10 players,''  
Gullikson said. ``So I think the pressure is on them to win the 
match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier and Martin have long, successful histories in Davis Cup,  
and both were part of the U.S. team that won the cup in 1995. 
Courier is 15-9 in Davis Cup competition, and Martin is 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambill and O'Brien are each 1-1 in cup competition.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Irabu Has Strong Outing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hideki Irabu found his control, allowing  
three hits in five shutout innings and striking out five Monday in 
a Triple-A spring training game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a step forward ... a step in the right  
direction,'' New York Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said. 
``His change up was better and his curveball was improved. He did a 
good job mixing up his pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu pitched for Columbus against Scranton, the Philadelphia  
Phillies' top farm club. Although the Yankees had an off day, Irabu 
made the trip to the team's minor-league camp to throw on his 
scheduled day to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu, who has struggled since the middle of last season, threw  
46 of 69 pitches for strikes. His fastball reached 92 mph, and 
Stottlemyre said its location was much better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my mechanics were a little off until now,'' Irabu said  
through interpreter George Rose. ``I think I'm ready to throw 100 
pitches with everything I've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three previous spring starts, Irabu allowed eight runs, 11  
hits and five walks in 10 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Strawberry, slowed by lingering knee problems during his  
comeback from colon cancer surgery, went 1-for-4 with a walk as the 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, Strawberry stole a base and scored from second  
on a single. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran the best he's run since the games started,'' Yankees  
general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It was definitely much better 
than we've seen. He's making steps in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Strawberry still has some work to do in outfield  
drills before making his spring debut in left field. Strawberry 
remains optimistic he will be ready this week. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte, who hasn't pitched since  
straining a muscle in his throwing elbow March 7, will throw 
12-to-15 minutes off a bullpen mound Tuesday. Stottlemyre said 
Pettitte, who could miss his first regular season start, may throw 
a few curveballs and changeups. ... Cashman said it is likely the 
Yankees will break camp with Luis Sojo as the lone backup 
infielder.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Thwarts Temple's Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Temple dared Duke to beat its  
aggressive, famed 2-3 zone from the outside in the East Regional 
final on Sunday, and Trajan Langdon did just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon took the brashness out of the Temple's zone by hitting  
three straight 3-pointers and scoring 11 points in a row in an 
early 17-2 spurt that led No. 1 Duke to an 85-64 win and its first 
Final Four berth since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon, a fifth-year senior who had never made the Final Four,  
hit 6 of 7 shots from the field, including 5 of 6 from 3-point 
range and finished with a game-high 23 points in denying Temple's 
John Chaney his first trip to the Final Four in 27 years of 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against Duke, we knew Langdon was going to hit shots, you just  
didn't know how well,'' Chaney said. ``He was coming off screens, 
turning and shooting over a 6-foot-10 player and that just doesn't 
happen that often. We just didn't know how well he was going to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the game, Temple packed the inside of its zone to  
stop Elton Brand with the hope that its defenders would jump out 
quickly and get a hand in Langdon's face. 
</P>
<P>
	In three previous games, the sixth-seeded Owls had not given up  
more than 55 points in any game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our defense wasn't as aggressive as against the other teams we  
played,'' forward Mark Karcher said. ``But Langdon is a good 
shooter. We had hands in his face, two or three people running at 
him. He is just a real good shooter and he was on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke forward Chris Carrawell said Temple made a mistake  
challenging Langdon, a 45 percent shooter from the field in the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how you can dare him,'' Carrawell said. ``If you  
dare anyone, I'd dare me. If they were going to dare me, OK. They 
might have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't dare Trajan Langdon. It's as simple as that,''  
Carrawell said. ``He's the best shooter in the country and he 
showed why today. He can knock them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karcher said after Langdon banged a couple of shoots down early  
Temple (24-11) tried to adjust. The problem was the Owls spread the 
zone and offered the Blue Devils a chance to drive and find Brand 
and company inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand finished with 21 points on 8 of 10 shooting.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once we thought we had Langdon for a minute, somebody else  
would come and somebody else would come,'' Karcher said. ``That's 
what makes Duke a great team. They can just constantly bring in 
good player after good player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple guard Rasheed Brokenborough said anyone playing Duke in  
the future needs to pick a couple of players to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't stop all of them and that's what we tried to do,''  
Brokenborough said. ``You got to let one or two guys beat you. If 
they shoot the ball and miss we'll live with that. But you can't 
let the guys beat you who are supposed to beat you, like Langdon 
and Brand.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges No NATO Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- On the eve of an important trip to the United  
States, Russia Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov again urged America 
and its allies not to unleash airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov would like to concentrate on getting loans for Russia's  
failing economy while in Washington this week. But with the crisis 
in Kosovo seemingly headed for a showdown, the sharp U.S.-Russian 
differences look likely to become the focus of his trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are categorically against the use of force against  
Yugoslavia,'' Primakov told reporters after meeting Monday with 
visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ``We believe 
that political levers to influence the situation are far from being 
exhausted yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his departure for the United States might be postponed  
because of the situation in Kosovo, Primakov was evasive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope there will be no raids,'' said Primakov, who was  
scheduled to leave Tuesday for Washington for talks with President 
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has warned it is likely to use force if Yugoslavia does not  
accept an interim political settlement in Kosovo, a province where 
Yugoslav forces are battling ethnic Albanian guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is an ally of Yugoslavia, but has no effective means of  
halting NATO air strikes. Russia also sees NATO and its expansion 
into eastern Europe as a threat to its own security, and bombing 
raids would only further strain frayed relations. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO attacks ``would have an irreparable destabilizing effect on  
the situation in Kosovo, the former Yugoslavia, Europe and the 
whole world,'' Primakov said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian prime minister has been a vocal critic of U.S.  
global dominance. Yet he knows he will need some measure of U.S. 
support if Russia is to win new loans from foreign lenders, 
including the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's deep-rooted economic problems have become even more  
acute since its financial markets imploded last August. Russia 
faces $17.5 billion in foreign debts this year, but can't afford to 
pay more than half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is seeking at least $4 billion in new loans from the IMF,  
Russia's Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said Monday. 
However, the IMF has been critical of Russia's economic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov is to meet IMF chief Michel Camdessus in Washington,  
but no decision on Russia's loan bid is expected until after the 
Russian prime minister returns home. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov's government has stabilized the sinking economy in the  
past few months. The ruble is relatively steady, inflation is down 
to about 4 percent a month and store shelves remained full through 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gerashchenko acknowledged that the Central Bank's hard  
currency reserves would not be sufficient to keep the ruble stable 
and pay off the country's foreign debts for much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserves stood at $11.4 billion last week, a small sum  
relative to the size of Russia's population and its debts.

<HEADLINE> Majerus Won't Coach San Diego State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Utah's Rick Majerus on Monday night turned down  
San Diego State's offer to take over its moribund men's basketball 
program, a day after Gonzaga's Dan Monson withdrew his name from 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus had been San Diego State's No. 1 choice since Fred  
Trenkle announced on Feb. 11 that he was resigning at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal of Majerus and Monson apparently moves former St.  
John's coach Fran Fraschilla to the top of athletic director Rick 
Bay's list, although Bay said he is considering other candidates. 
One of them could be Purdue's Gene Keady. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus said from Salt Lake City that his decision ``had nothing  
to do with anything other than some personal issues in my life'' 
which he wouldn't elaborate on. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay said Majerus was ``very complimentary'' of the Aztecs'  
offer, but neither man would discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not make as much money as I make at Utah,'' Majerus  
said. ``I turned down a pro job just a couple of weeks ago. If this 
was a money issue, I would go to the pros.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus said he was contacted after Trenkle resigned, but that  
the discussions with San Diego State took place only after Utah was 
eliminated from the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed a little time to sort things out,'' Majerus said.  
</P>
<P>
	That apparently was Monson's reason for pulling his name out of  
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an excellent job and a great opportunity, but I  
just don't think it's for me at this time,'' Monson said from 
Spokane, Wash. ``I think I have a good situation here and I'm 
emotionally not ready to make a decision like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson spoke by phone Sunday with San Diego State athletic  
director Rick Bay. Gonzaga reached the final eight before losing 
67-62 to Connecticut on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego State was 4-22 this year, its fourth losing season in  
five years under Trenkle. The Aztecs have had just one winning 
season since their last NCAA tournament appearance, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus said the Aztecs' program can be salvaged.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a terrific job,'' he said. ``Whoever gets that  
job will work for a terrific athletic director, a terrific 
president, in a great city with a great environment. That job is a 
good job.''

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Returns to Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Rangers center Wayne Gretzky's  
return from a neck injury came sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was held scoreless without a shot in 15 shifts --  
totaling 11:15 -- in the Rangers' 6-3 loss to the Tampa Bay 
Lightning Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said Sunday's injury to Ulf Samuelsson, who will be  
sidelined two to three weeks with a broken bone in his foot, 
prompted him to inform coach John Muckler on Sunday's flight to 
Tampa that he could play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those situations where probably if Sammy didn't  
get hurt, I probably would have waited until Wednesday (at 
Florida),'' Gretzky said. ``I felt all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's game against Pittsburgh, Gretzky said he felt  
fine and hoped to get back into action either against the 
Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday or the New York Islanders on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said he wasn't worried about what his role will be in  
Wednesday's contest against the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't have a big ego as far as what John and the  
coaches want me to do for this team,'' Gretzky said. ``Come 
Wednesday, whatever they want me to do, that's fine with me. All I 
can do is work hard and get ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky had been sidelined since Feb. 26.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers went 6-3-3 during Gretzky's absence. However, New  
York was 1-3-2 over the final six games without him.

<HEADLINE>  Last-Minute Diplomacy in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Declaring ``we are on the brink of  
military action,'' a special U.S. envoy came to Belgrade today in 
an 11th-hour bid to persuade Yugoslavia's president to accept a 
Kosovo peace plan or face NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
	An attack by NATO forces could come soon after Richard Holbrooke  
wraps up his talks tonight in the Yugoslav capital with hard-line 
leader Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances for any agreement appeared bleak. Fighting raged today  
in the Serbian province, with the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo 
Information Center saying at least five villages were burning in 
the central Drenica region and Lapastica, the rebel headquarters 
for northeastern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government showed no sign of dropping its  
opposition to the international peace plan agreed to last week in 
Paris by the ethnic Albanian rebels -- especially for any NATO 
troops sent into Kosovo to police the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Zivadin Jovanovic, the Yugoslav foreign minister, said today  
that ``no pressure can change our principled stand.'' Yugoslavia 
doesn't ``accept foreign troops,'' he said, and if any NATO 
soldiers are sent in, ``of course it will be met by force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovic told CNN ``we are not looking for confrontation'' but  
that his country considers any NATO force sent to Kosovo to be an 
``aggression against a sovereign country, Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American envoy, Holbrooke, stopped in Brussels, Belgium, for  
talks with senior officials from the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body, today  
authorized Secretary-General Javier Solana to order airstrikes on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana is conducting a series of consultations with the allies  
before issuing an order for what the council described as ``subject 
to further consultation, on a broader range of air operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said that means a second phase of air operations  
encompassing a much more diverse list of targets and allowing a 
much more intense pace of operations. Precise details weren't 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	After the NATO visit, Holbrooke warned that if Milosevic does  
not reconsider, ``the consequences will be clear and severe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the brink of military action,'' Holbrooke said.  
``It's not too late to avoid it, but the window is narrowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement later to the local independent TV station  
Anem, Holbrooke tried to present the issue of foreign troops in 
Kosovo as something that would benefit Serbs as well as ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a misunderstanding in my view on the part of  
many people in Yugoslavia concerning this force,'' Holbrooke said. 
``I want it to be clear that this force, if the Yugoslav government 
invites them in, will be a force composed of many nations including 
NATO nations, Russia and other countries that would bring peace to 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the peacekeeping troops ``would protect both the  
Albanian and Serb communities from the kinds of violence, 
indiscriminate and unnecessary violence, which has been taking 
place in Kosovo recently,'' he said. ``This force would be for the 
benefit of all people in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslavs remained defiant. The Yugoslav army today accused  
the United States of ``saber-rattling,'' and there was no letup in 
the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Battles escalated Saturday after international monitors withdrew  
to Macedonia and the army stepped up its operations against the 
Kosovo Liberation Army. The U.N. relief agency said 25,000 people 
had been driven from their homes in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Srbica, KLA fighters ambushed police today, triggering a  
gunbattle that lasted several hours, witnesses reported. Serb 
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said rebels attacked 
the police station in Malisevo with mortars and automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters saw houses burning in Srbica and talked to ethnic  
Albanians who alleged mass killings by Serb forces, claims that 
could not immediately be verified. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Holbrooke briefed NATO and European officials about  
his mission. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said he was not 
optimistic any progress could be made. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving in Belgrade, Holbrooke went to the Russian  
Embassy to confer with U.S., Russian and European Union mediators 
from last week's failed peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Holbrooke would  
be delivering a stark message: ``Move to the path of peace or face 
the punishment of NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An allied fleet of warships and attack planes is ready for a  
possible bombardment of Yugoslavia that likely would begin with 
pilotless cruise missiles fired at the country's air defense 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 350-400 allied aircraft are designated for the air  
campaign, in addition to a fleet of U.S. and allied ships. Most are 
stationed at Aviano Air Base in northern Italy. Some are in Germany 
and England. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruise missiles are a weapon of choice for the opening barrage  
of any air campaign because they eliminate the risk of losing 
pilots to Yugoslavia's extensive air defense network. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force B-52s standing by in England are armed with  
air-launched cruise missiles. Other B-1 Lancers and B-2 Spirits 
bombers based in the United States might also see action. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace plan that the Yugoslavs object to calls for 28,000  
NATO troops -- including 4,000 Americans -- to supervise the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have died and 300,000 have been driven  
from their homes in a year of conflict in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Rapper ODB in Trouble Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper ODB is in trouble again.  
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old singer for the Wu-Tang Clan was arrested Monday  
on misdemeanor drug charges after police found he was carrying a 
small amount of crack cocaine, said police spokesman Lt. Dennis 
Cirillo. 
</P>
<P>
	ODB, whose real name is Russell Jones, was stopped by officers  
who allegedly found the drugs when searching his 1996 Range Rover. 
His attorney, Peter Frankell, did not return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Brooklyn grand jury decided Jones would not face  
attempted murder charges after an encounter with officers who 
stopped his car for allegedly not having its lights on. The 
officers said that when they approached the driver's window two 
shots were fired, and they shot back. No gun was found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted of second-degree assault in New York in  
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested last month in Los Angeles when he parked in a  
no-parking zone and police found he was wearing a bulletproof vest. 
He has pleaded innocent to violating a law banning felons from 
wearing body armor.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans suffered opening setbacks from Friday's late  
rally, but then recovered on expectations that weekly exports may 
remain relatively strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by prospects the U.S. Agriculture  
Department would report winter wheat conditions remain mostly in 
the good-to-excellent category, at a time when world exports 
continue to be depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.87 a bushel; May  
corn was unchanged at $2.29 a bushel; May oats rose 3 1/2 cents to 
$1.16 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans rose 1/4 cent to $4.89 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork bellies futures were higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle and lean hogs were mixed.

<HEADLINE> NYC Opera Brings Back Double Ravel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Opera doesn't have to be grand and tragic. The  
New York City Opera has brought back two sparkling short operas by 
Ravel designed by Maurice Sendak. 
</P>
<P>
	The music is beautiful in Ravel's only operas. It floats as  
lightly as a Viennese waltz. Sendak's sets and costumes, designed 
in 1990 and not seen here since, are delightful. Except for dense 
trees that move and overlap, the sets and costumes are not as scary 
as they appear in his book, ``Where the Wild Things Are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Spanish Hour'' opened the evening Friday before ``The  
Bewitched Child'' at the New York State Theater. ``The Spanish 
Hour'' is a tidbit featuring clocks. There are men hiding inside 
grandfather clocks -- one even stands on his head -- and people on a 
moving track jerking like mechanical figures in town clocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Burton sang the woman whose suitors hide in the clocks and  
Kurt Ollmann made his company debut, singing with round tones and 
appearing nonchalant, as the mule driver who carries clocks around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bewitched Child,'' with a libretto by the novelist  
Colette, starts with a petulant little boy who throws books and 
china and wants to chop off a squirrel's tail. The magic begins 
when a chair in which he's sitting dumps him and then scoots away. 
The chair and other objects and animals will teach the child 
manners. 
</P>
<P>
	Marguerite Krull, whose soprano is clear and pure, made her  
company debut as the child. The broken cup and teapot enter as 
dancers Jean Barber and William Ward; their voices come from Leah 
Summers and Benjamin Brecher in the orchestra pit. Anita Johnson 
made her company debut as the princess from the torn picture book. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most delightful scenic effects, colorful numbers  
hop on stage and pile on top of each other, indicating the child 
doesn't apply himself to arithmetic. He isn't better off when he's 
outdoors. Scary trees move by and dragonfly, nightingale, bat, frog 
and owl, in beautiful costumes, declare he must be punished for 
harming their kind. 
</P>
<P>
	He brings a happy ending, though, by bandaging a squirrel's paw.  
The animals hop around him, stars come out and his mother appears, 
as the music gives its benediction. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the operas began, the company's general director, Paul  
Kellogg, spoke in tribute to Sendak and director Frank Corsaro. 
This was their fourth production together. Corsaro has directed 41 
productions for the company in 41 years. 
</P>
<P>
	George Manahan conducted.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Urged Not To Play in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bob Menendez wrote Monday to each player  
on the Orioles urging that Baltimore not play exhibition games 
against Cuba's national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when the Cuban regime is struggling to retain  
control and when the Cuban people are risking their welfare and 
personal freedom to be heard, it is not the time to play ball with 
Cuba,'' the New Jersey Democrat wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are to play in Havana on Sunday, and the Cubans are  
to play a return game at Camden Yards in Baltimore on May 3. 
Sunday's game marks the first by a major league team in Cuba since 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez, a Cuban-American and the fourth-ranking Democrat in  
the House, has criticized the baseball series since it was proposed 
in January. He urged players to consider ``the plight of your Cuban 
colleagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike American players, members of Cuba's national baseball  
team cannot organize labor unions, go on strike, be paid market 
wages or even leave their country without permission,'' Menendez 
wrote. ``Cuba violates many of the very rights that you as players 
have fought so hard to obtain n this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles pitcher Juan Guzman, scheduled to pitch against the New  
York Mets on Saturday, says he won't accompany the team to Cuba. 
Guzman, a native of the Dominican Republic, lives in a Miami 
neighborhood alongside many Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week in Florida, about 125 people, many of them exiled  
Cubans, protested outside Fort Lauderdale Stadium before a spring 
training game between Baltimore and the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Foss, the Orioles' vice chairman for business and finance,  
responded to the protest by saying the team hopes the exhibition 
games with Cuba's team ``can help people in the two countries come 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What occurs in political change is not our responsibility and  
is not our motivation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Finds Steel Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel producers in six countries have  
illegally dumped stainless steel in the United States at prices 
below production costs or home-market prices, the Commerce 
Department concluded today. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce found that three of the countries -- Belgium, Italy and  
South Africa -- also gave producers unfair subsidies that 
effectively lowered prices. Canada, South Korea and Taiwan were 
guilty only of dumping, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those countries face tariffs of up to 60 percent on that product  
if the independent U.S. International Trade Commission determines 
the practice has injured or threatens to hurt U.S. steel makers. 
The commission is to rule by May. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased,'' said Jack W. Shilling, president of  
Allegheny Ludlum Corp. ``These decisions will help to correct the 
problems we have faced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department finding applies only to a specialized  
steel product known as stainless steel plate in coils. It comes 
rolled up like carpet and is used in specialized tasks such as 
chemical processing, pollution control and petroleum refining. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the product makes up a small part of overall steel  
consumption, it is among the first of the dumping complaints to 
wind their way through the administration since steel import levels 
began to rise dramatically in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A much larger case involving hot-rolled carbon steel is pending  
before the department, with a final ruling due next month. Commerce 
already has issued preliminary rulings finding evidence that Japan, 
Russia and Brazil had engaged in illegal dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry contends that low-priced imports have  
resulted in thousands of layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
The House defied a presidential veto threat last week and passed 
legislation establishing quotas on foreign steel, although aides 
say stainless steel would not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Commerce Department, imports of the stainless  
steel product from the six countries combined more than doubled 
from 1997 to 1998. U.S. steelmakers contend they cannot compete 
when foreign governments offer subsidies or adjust their pricing to 
undercut the U.S. producers in their own market. 
</P>
<P>
	Any tariffs levied would effectively bring prices of foreign  
steel closer to the price of a similar product made domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Mullaney, a lawyer for the main South African producer, said  
South Africa was an ``innocent bystander'' blamed for import surges 
caused by other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for other producers either had no comment or did not  
return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint was filed by Allegheny Ludlum, Armco Inc. and J&AMP;L  
Specialty Steel Inc., all based in Pittsburgh, Lukens Inc. of 
Coatesville, Pa., and North American Stainless of Ghent, Ky., as 
well as by unions representing workers at those companies.

<HEADLINE>  Three First-Timers Make Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last season's Final Four was filled with first-time coaches.  
This weekend, there will be three debuts and a coach with a chance 
to join a very exclusive list. 
</P>
<P>
	For Jim Calhoun of Connecticut, Jim O'Brien of Ohio State and  
Tom Izzo of Michigan State, St. Petersburg, Fla., will be the site 
of their first Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, this weekend will be a chance for a  
third national championship, a number reached only by John Wooden, 
Adolph Rupp and Bob Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get a chance to play for the national championship  
until you get to the Final Four,'' Krzyzewski said after his 
top-ranked Blue Devils beat sixth-seeded Temple 85-64 Sunday in the 
East Regional final. ``Now we can talk about winning the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people expect Duke (36-1), which has won 31 straight games,  
to do that as the Blue Devils are the most prohibitive favorite 
since UNLV in 1991. That year was Krzyzewski's first championship 
and the Blue Devils ended UNLV's season in the national semifinals. 
They repeated in 1992, the fifth straight year Duke reached the 
Final Four. Its last appearance was 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time coming and it's something I haven't  
experienced,'' fifth-year senior Trajan Langdon said. ``Coming into 
this game I knew it was my last chance to go to the Final Four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke will play Michigan State on Saturday, a rematch of the Blue  
Devils' 73-67 victory in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4) beat defending champion Kentucky 73-66  
Sunday in the Midwest Regional, their 22nd straight win, the last 
three all by less than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even care about the next game right now,'' Izzo said.  
``There are 37 games there's been pressure on this team and I'm 
going to enjoy this day. I love Duke, they're a great team and I'll 
deal with them tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (32-2), the only other team besides Duke to be  
ranked No. 1 this season, always seemed to find a way not to get to 
the Final Four. Whether it was a buzzer-beater by Duke's Christian 
Laettner or a path that went through North Carolina's home state, 
the Huskies had never gotten there. 
</P>
<P>
	This time they advanced with a 67-62 win over 10th-seeded  
Gonazaga in the West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fate and other good teams and players got in the way and we  
didn't move on,'' Calhoun said. ``I'm sure ours fans are going to 
come in mass. There's nothing like Husky Mania. People don't 
realize how much people in our state care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (27-8), at No. 4 the only non-No. 1 seed to advance,  
shattered some trivia with the 77-74 win over third-seeded St. 
John's in the South Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	No team had ever reached the national semifinals without having  
been in the tournament the year before. The Buckeyes were 8-22 last 
season and won just one conference game. The addition of guard 
Scoonie Penn, who came along with O'Brien from Boston College, was 
the key to the remarkable turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said when we came here we'd had a great season but it had  
to end here,'' Buckeyes guard Michael Redd said. ``I wonder what 
they're going to say now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a while since the Big Ten's two Final Four teams had  
been there. Michigan State was last there in 1979 when Magic 
Johnson led the Spartans to the national championship. Ohio State 
was last there in 1968 when Bill Hosket starred for the Buckeyes.

<HEADLINE>  In Egypt Mrs. Clinton Looks Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO (AP) -- In a most unlikely place to talk American politics  
-- at an Egyptian health clinic -- Hillary Rodham Clinton 
acknowledged an interest in running for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	She's been making ``lots of calls'' on the subject over the past  
month but hasn't made a decision, she said. The only thing she is 
certain of, she added, is that she wants to keep a public role 
after she and her husband leave the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was the second day of Mrs. Clinton' s 12-day tour of  
Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, and word of her possible candidacy for 
a Senate seat from New York got here before she did. At the Khan 
el-Khalili marketplace, Mona Abdel clapped her hands together and 
shook with excitement as Secret Service agents filed down the 
market's alleyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's applying for the Congress,'' said Abdel, 25. ``I will  
nominate her for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told reporters that whatever happened in her  
political future, ``I do know that I want to continue speaking out 
on behalf of the issues that I've spent more than 25 years working 
on. Any way I can continue to do that, I intend to. But the form 
that will take I really can't predict at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference Monday was her most expansive discussion of  
running for office. Mrs. Clinton took six questions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lobby of Cairo's El Bassatine clinic for women and  
children, reporters noted that her husband had expressed his 
support if she decided to run for the Senate. An Egyptian 
journalist stepped forward to ask Mrs. Clinton about her ``plans 
for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady momentarily played it coy. ``Well, tomorrow I'm  
going to Luxor,'' she said to chuckles from the assembled doctors, 
nurses and Egyptian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	It took three more questions to draw her out on the topic.  
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, I've made lots of calls over the past month,''  
she said. She has been sounding out friends, advisers and political 
consultants on her chances in a bid for the seat of retiring 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue that when I return home,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But, she added before darting off to lunch with the wife of  
President Hosni Mubarak, ``right now I want to focus on the issues 
that are really at the base of this very important partnership and 
friendship between the United States and Egypt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in the first lady's political ambitions was evident in  
the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are nominating her,'' Wahiba el-Sayed said through a  
translator. ``She's a very strong woman, a very active woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The veiled, 50-year-old woman, a garment maker, insisted  
photographers snap a picture of her kissing the first lady's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Abdel nodded that they were aware of President Clinton's  
recent personal and legal troubles in the Monica Lewinsky affair, 
but the subject was not for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a family thing,'' said Mrs. el-Sayed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to talk about it,'' agreed Abdel.  
</P>
<P>
	Metalworker Sayed el-Said Mahmoud el-Sharaky had engraved two  
brass, copper and silver picture frames -- one for Mrs. Clinton and 
one for daughter Chelsea, who set off sightseeing on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Sharaky said the allegations against Clinton were trumped up  
by jealous opponents. ``If somebody asked me to nominate him again, 
I would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the president's wife?  
</P>
<P>
	``I will nominate her 10 times,'' el-Sharaky grinned.  
</P>
<P>
	In her speech at the clinic, Mrs. Clinton singled out as her  
priorities creating opportunities for women, improving the lives of 
children and improving relations between world democracies. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that she wanted to prevent ``bad abortions,'' and  
spoke up for ``integrated family-planning'' services for all women. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a decline in abortions, which is very important, when  
you have accessible family-planning services,'' Mrs. Clinton said.

</P>
<P>
	``We see a decline in abortions, which is very important, when  
you have accessible family-planning services,'' Mrs. Clinton said.

western New England. Snow fell from Vermont and parts of New 
Hampshire, south across New York and Pennsylvania into eastern 
Ohio. Most of the snowfall was light. 
</P>
<P>
	A cool and stable airmass remained in place across much of the  
mid-Atlantic states and Southeast as high pressure continues to 
build. Fair skies were seen from Indiana, through Kentucky, into 
Florida and the Carolinas.

<HEADLINE> Courier, Martin Head Davis Cup Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi will not  
play for the U.S. Davis Cup team in its first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	So team captain Tom Gullikson hopes his underdog team can draw  
strength from that. 
</P>
<P>
	The squad announced Monday will include Jim Courier, Todd  
Martin, Jan-Michael Gambill and Alex O'Brien against Great Britain 
on April 2-4 in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes controversy exacts a positive,'' Gullikson said at a  
news conference during the Lipton Championships. ``It helps make 
you stronger and really increases your resolve to take these guys 
here -- Alex and Jan-Michael, Todd and Jim -- who are really 
committed to it and really go out and give a wonderful 
performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, angry about the recent firing of the team physician,  
said Saturday he'll never play Davis Cup again. Sampras has been 
criticized for refusing to help the U.S. team in 1998 and again 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an honor to get to play for your country,''  
O'Brien said. ``I wish the rest of our guys felt that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Sampras and Agassi, Gullikson acknowledged that the  
British should be favored. Their team will be led by Tim Henman and 
Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing at home and they have two top-10 players,''  
Gullikson said. ``So I think the pressure is on them to win the 
match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier and Martin have long, successful histories in Davis Cup,  
and both were part of the U.S. team that won the cup in 1995. 
Courier is 15-9 in Davis Cup competition, and Martin is 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambill and O'Brien are each 1-1 in cup competition.

<HEADLINE> Comcast, MediaOne Announce Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comcast Corp. is buying MediaOne Group Inc. for  
$48.65 billion in stock, combining the nation's third- and 
fourth-largest cable television providers in the industry's richest 
merger ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Comcast will serve 11 million cable customers under the  
deal announced today, with a potential market of 18 million homes. 
Comcast would rank behind only Time Warner Inc. and AT&AMP;T Corp., 
which recently acquired Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne stock jumped 12 percent on news of the deal, but  
Comcast shares dropped 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies are hoping demand will increase for high-speed  
Internet access and phone services over cable lines, which have 
much greater capacity than phone lines. Comcast hopes the deal will 
allow it to offer expanded all-in-one packages of TV, Internet and 
phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne is a spinoff of the phone company U S West Inc., which  
in late 1997 gave up on the idea that cable and phone providers 
could complement each other and split its cable business into a 
separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of today's deal eclipses AT&AMP;T's $44 billion purchase  
of TCI, which was completed two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cable systems, Philadelphia-based Comcast's  
interests include a 57 percent stake in the home-shopping cable 
network QVC Inc.; the National Hockey League's Philadelphia Flyers; 
the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers; and 
stakes in the E! and Golf Channel cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne, based in Englewood, Colo., and also has interests in  
wireless communications businesses outside the United States 
serving more than 3 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined companies generated more than $8 billion in revenue  
last year and will have cable systems throughout the East, as well 
as in the Midwest and West.. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, MediaOne shareholders will receive 1.1  
shares of Comcast stock for each of MediaOne's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading, MediaOne stock shot up $7.25 to $68 per  
share on the New York Stock Exchange, while Comcast shares dropped 
$5 to $67.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement has been approved by the boards of both companies  
but is subject to the approval of Comcast and MediaOne 
shareholders, and of federal and local regulatory agencies. The 
companies said they expect the deal to be closed by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph J. Roberts, the chairman of Comcast, and his son Brian L.  
Roberts, the chief executive and president, will retain their 
posts. MediaOne's president, CEO and chairman, Charles M. Lillis, 
will become vice chairman of MediaOne and join its board of 
directors, along with three additional MediaOne designees. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would allow MediaOne to accept a better offer, but  
would have to pay Comcast $1.5 billion for breaking the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest cable system operators, assuming the  
completion of Comcast Corp.'s acquisition of MediaOne Group Inc. 
and other pending transactions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Time Warner Inc., 12.6 million  
</P>
<P>
	--AT&AMP;T Corp., 12.5 million  
</P>
<P>
	--Comcast Corp., 11 million  
</P>
<P>
	--Adelphia Communications Corp., 4.7 million  
</P>
<P>
	--Cox Communications Inc., 3.8 million

<HEADLINE> NCAA Ratings Are Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite few close games, CBS' tournament  
coverage is managing to hold its own in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Sunday's regional finals, CBS had a 6.0 overnight rating  
and a 13 share, down 3 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we can make up some ground in the Final Four,'' said  
Mike Aresco, CBS' vice president for programming. ``The ratings 
tell the story of the tournament strength because we've hardly had 
any buzzer-beaters and some blowouts that really don't happen that 
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had a 7.8 overnight rating for the four regional finals this  
past weekend, which was up 1 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four matchups posted gains. The Gonzaga-Connecticut  
game posted a 7.4, up 14 percent from Arizona-Utah in 1998; 
Duke-Temple got a 7.0, 9 percent higher than Stanford-Rhode Island; 
and St. John's-Ohio State received a 8.3, up 1 percent from 
Connecticut-North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The only weekend game that fell was the Michigan State-Kentucky  
matchup, which posted a 8.7, down 12 percent from the Duke-Kentucky 
thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Author Sues 'Shakespeare in Love' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A best-selling author is suing the makers of  
the Oscar-winning film ``Shakespeare in Love,'' claiming they stole 
the tale of a lovelorn bard from her 1989 Elizabethan era-novel 
``The Quality of Mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard won the best original screenplay  
Oscar for the movie Sunday night. Novelist Faye Kellerman sued them 
in federal court on March 16, less than a week before the Academy 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting that it won the award, but as I said in the  
complaint it should have been for best adapted screenplay,'' Barry 
Novak, Ms. Kellerman's attorney, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Named in the lawsuit are Norman and Stoppard, Miramax Film Corp.  
Inc., Universal City Studios Inc. and script publisher Hyperion 
Press Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the novel and the movie, a young William Shakespeare  
romances a woman who masquerades as a man. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax officials say the similarities end there.  
</P>
<P>
	``The two stories are so different that the idea that one was  
copied from the other is absurd,'' Miramax spokesman Andrew Stengel 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Quality of Mercy'' detailed Shakespeare's attempts to  
solve the murder of a friend while his love-interest helps Jews 
flee the Spanish Inquisition by smuggling them into London, 
according to a 1989 review of the novel from Publisher's Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' focused on the playwright's struggle to  
compose ``Romeo and Juliet'' while his lover cross-dresses her way 
onto the Elizabethan stage, where women were forbidden to perform. 
The film won seven Oscars, including best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks profits from the film and unspecified damages  
for Kellerman, who has penned such thrillers as ``Prayers for the 
Dead'' and ``The Ritual Bath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She declined to comment on the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Stengel said the timing of the lawsuit ``suggests a publicity  
stunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are familiar with the claim and believe that it has  
absolutely no merit,'' he said. ``We are confident that the court 
will reach the same conclusion.''

<HEADLINE> Capitals Send Chorske to Flames </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Capitals sent left wing Tom  
Chorske to the Calgary Flames on Monday for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chorske, acquired from the New York Islanders in October, spent  
more time injured than playing during his stint in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the lineup last week after missing 48 games  
following abdominal surgery and had just two assists in 16 games 
played with the Caps. 
</P>
<P>
	Chorske joins a Calgary team fighting Edmonton for the final  
playoff berth in the National Hockey League's Western Conference. 
The eighth-place Flames led the Oilers by two points before the 
teams played each other Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals also announced that leading scorer Peter Bondra,  
who has 31 goals this season, has been diagnosed with a broken hand 
and will miss at least two more weeks. Bondra has missed the last 
three games with what was originally thought to be a bruised hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chorske trade leaves the Capitals with eight players set to  
become free agents this summer. Brad Shaw was traded to St. Louis 
last Friday, and several players who last year helped the team win 
the Eastern Conference title -- Joe Juneau, Brian Bellows, Dale 
Hunter, Mark Tinordi and Craig Berube -- could be next. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the Capitals reassigned defenseman Steve Poapst to  
Portland of the American Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Hear Siblings Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court today refused to take up  
the question of whether siblings put up for adoption have the right 
to stay together, ending a little boy's quest to grow up in the 
same household with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The children in the case were known in court papers as  
4-year-old ``Hugo'' and 6-year-old ``Gloria'' to protect their 
identities. They were said to be so close that Gloria translated 
for her developmentally disabled little brother when his speech was 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	They lived together with a foster mother in Boston for about two  
years before they were separated in January under a ruling by the 
state's high court. An aunt from New Jersey won custody of Hugo, 
while his sister remained 200 miles away in Boston with the foster 
mother, who has adopted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the boy appealed to the Supreme Court to reunite  
brother and sister. Without comment, the high court refused to hear 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad this separation will be permanent, that they won't be  
able to grow up together as brother and sister,'' said Susan 
Dillard, a lawyer for Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling in favor of the boy could have reunited some 35,000  
siblings in similar situations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely disappointed the Supreme Court won't be  
addressing the question of whether siblings have a constitutionally 
protected right to the preservation of their relationship,'' Ms. 
Dillard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Social Services Department had supported Hugo  
as his case moved through the state's courts because ``it was in 
his best interest to remain with his sister,'' department 
spokeswoman Lorraine Carli said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the department changed sides when the case went to the U.S.  
Supreme Court, saying there should not be a blanket rule when it 
comes to what is best for a child. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably going to be some instances when it's not in  
the best interest of siblings to be together,'' Ms. Carli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo was placed in foster care three days after he was born. He  
may have been injured by the cocaine his mother used while 
pregnant, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The foster mother who has had both Gloria and Hugo for the past  
two years, identified in court papers as ``Enid,'' wanted to keep 
both children. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hugo's father believed the boy would be better off with the  
New Jersey aunt, who has raised her own special-needs child. The 
aunt has not sought custody of Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Drogin, who represents the father, said the family is  
thrilled and relieved the court battle finally seems to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hugo and Gloria were separated in January, the two  
families said they would try to work out a visitation agreement. 
Ms. Drogin said they are still working it out, and the siblings 
have not seen each other, but they speak on the phone once a week, 
and Hugo ``has been doing very well.''

<HEADLINE> And the Oscar Goes to ... </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Best Actress: Gwyneth Paltrow    	
</P>
<P>
	Gwyneth Paltrow, who made tabloid headlines over her failed  
romance with actor Brad Pitt, firmly established herself as a 
fresh, elegant symbol of Generation-X style, winning the best 
actress Oscar for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Paltrow wasn't the filmmakers' first choice for Viola, the  
playwright's fictional lover and purported inspiration for ``Romeo 
and Juliet.'' She got the part when filming was postponed and the 
cast reorganized around a young, romantic Will. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Roberts originally was cast as Viola.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaking slightly and stammering at times as she accepted the  
Oscar from Jack Nicholson, Miss Paltrow sobbed as she thanked 
everyone from her ``Grandpa Buster'' to her co-star Joseph Fiennes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not have been able to play this role had I not  
understood love of a tremendous magnitude and for that I thank my 
family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow, 25, is the daughter of movie producer Bruce Paltrow and  
actress Blythe Danner. 

</P>
<P>
 *Best Supporting Actor: James Coburn    	
</P>
<P>
	James Coburn's Oscar-winning performance as a cop's abusive  
father in ``Affliction'' caps a career of more glamorous tough-guy 
roles in movies like ``The Great Escape'' and ``The Magnificent 
Seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working and doing this work for, like, over half my  
life and I finally got one right I guess,'' the silver-haired actor 
growled with a grin as he accepted the Academy Award for supporting 
actor from Kim Basinger. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Oscar nomination for Coburn, 70, who has made  
more than 80 movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affliction'' isn't necessarily the stuff of Oscar dreams,  
dealing in depression and drunkenness and the relationships between 
a loser lawman and his family in a small New England town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them you do for money and some of them you do for  
love,'' Coburn said. ``This is a love child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Coburn's busy career came to a near-halt when he  
was stricken with crippling arthritis. 

</P>
<P>
 *Best Supporting Actress: Judi Dench    	
</P>
<P>
	Judi Dench was nominated for an Academy Award last year for her  
portrayal of Queen Victoria in John Madden's ``Mrs. Brown.'' The 
Oscar went to Helen Hunt for ``As Good As It Gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Dench, 64, begged Madden to call on her for his next film,  
and he did, casting her once again as a queen. This time it was 
aging Queen Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and it was an 
Oscar-winning performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually wrote to John Madden after `Mrs. Brown' and said,  
`I will do anything in your next film. If you want somebody to 
slouch in a doorway you can count on me,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The supporting-actress Oscar was the first for Miss Dench, whose  
roles range from traditional Shakespeare on stage to the 
hard-boiled spymaster ``M'' in some James Bond flicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Her extraordinarily short performance in ``Shakespeare in Love''  
has drawn comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for eight minutes I'm on the screen I should only get a  
little of him,'' the actress said as she clutched the supporting 
actress Oscar handed her by Robin Williams.

<HEADLINE>  'Shakespeare in Love' Wins 7 Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Academy Awards were a lot like a Roberto  
Benigni acceptance speech: long, full of surprises and sometimes 
difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-plus Oscar hours Sunday night -- the longest ceremony ever --  
narrowly favored the Bard over blood and love over war, as the 
romantic romp ``Shakespeare in Love'' reaped seven awards, 
including best picture and best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The violent World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan'' won five  
Oscars, including the directing award for Steven Spielberg in an 
unusual -- though hardly unprecedented -- split between best picture 
and best director. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Benigni who charmed the audience with his exuberance  
in pulling off a stunning first: winning as best actor in a foreign 
film for ``Life is Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni, who wrote and directed ``Life is Beautiful,'' also  
became the first filmmaker in 50 years to direct his own 
Oscar-winning performance. In 1948, Laurence Olivier directed and 
starred in ``Hamlet,'' for which he won the best acting prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful,'' a tragicomic film set mostly in a Nazi  
concentration camp, won additional Oscars for foreign film and 
dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a moment of joy and I want to kiss everybody,''  
Benigni enthused in accepting the foreign-language Oscar, after he 
bounded to the stage by walking across the tops of the chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He planted kisses on both cheeks of presenter Sophia Loren.  
Fittingly, it was Miss Loren who was the only other performer in a 
foreign language film to win an acting Oscar, for ``Two Women'' in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, when he picked up his acting award, Benigni burst into a  
fractured-English riff on joy, gushing about how ``my body is in 
tumult'' and ``everything is in a word that I cannot express.'' At 
one point he said his desire was ``making love with everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Benigni at times was difficult to decipher, so, too, was the  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' did pick up best picture, but director  
John Madden was snubbed. The film's leading lady Miss Paltrow won, 
but her leading man Joseph Fiennes wasn't even nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	And the award to ``Shakespeare's'' Judi Dench gave new meaning  
to the label supporting actress: as Queen Elizabeth I, Dame Judi 
was on screen only briefly, yet still took home an Oscar statue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a  
little bit of him,'' she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare,'' which led all contenders with 13 nominations,  
also picked up Oscars for original screenplay, art direction, 
costume design and musical or comedy score. Madden's film imagined 
a young Shakespeare suffering from writer's block, and falling in 
love with the beautiful woman played by Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax Films, which released both ``Shakespeare in Love'' and  
``Life is Beautiful,'' was a big winner Sunday night. The two 
movies combined for 10 Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``Saving Private Ryan'' was another curiosity.  
Spielberg and the cinematographer both won, but the film didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-time directing winner -- Spielberg was honored for  
``Schindler's List'' in 1993 -- he earnestly expressed gratitude to 
all families who lost sons in World War II, and addressing his 
father, a veteran, said: ``Dad, this is for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie also took prizes for cinematography, editing, sound  
and sound effects editing. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Oscar voters split between best picture and  
director was in 1989, when ``Driving Miss Daisy'' won for best 
picture and Oliver Stone for ``Born on the Fourth of July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg had a hand in another winning film. The Holocaust  
movie, ``The Last Days,'' won the documentary feature award. 
Spielberg was executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth,'' another best picture nominee, won just one award,  
for makeup. The fifth contender, ``The Thin Red Line,'' Terrence 
Malick's comeback movie about WWII in the Pacific, was shut out 
entirely despite seven nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	James Coburn won the first Oscar of his long career -- as the  
alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this work for like over half my life, and I

	The most controversial moment of the ceremony came and went  
quickly, as director Elia Kazan -- reviled by some for naming names 
during the Hollywood blacklist era -- stepped out to accept a 
lifetime achievement award. Many members of the audience applauded 
heartily, some stood, while others, like actors Nick Nolte and Ed 
Harris, sat silently.

	She changed costumes repeatedly to mimic film characters,  
getting the show off to a rousing start when she came out in full

announced with an accent that was more Bette Davis than British, 
``I am the African Queen.''

<HEADLINE>  'Shakespeare in Love' Wins 7 Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Academy Awards were a lot like a Roberto  
Benigni acceptance speech: long, full of surprises and sometimes 
difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-plus Oscar hours Sunday night -- the longest ceremony ever --  
narrowly favored the Bard over blood and love over war, as the 
romantic romp ``Shakespeare in Love'' reaped seven awards, 
including best picture and best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The violent World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan'' won five  
Oscars, including the directing award for Steven Spielberg in an 
unusual -- though hardly unprecedented -- split between best picture 
and best director. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Benigni who charmed the audience with his exuberance  
in pulling off a stunning first: winning as best actor in a foreign 
film for ``Life is Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Ex-NYC Mayor Ed Koch Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A dangerous plunge in blood pressure sent former  
Mayor Edward I. Koch to the hospital today, hours before he planned 
to get arrested for civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm OK,'' Koch, 74, told reporters from his hospital gurney.  
He was still dressed in the gray sweatpants, white sneakers and 
blue T-shirt he wore to the gym that morning. His doctor agreed, 
but kept him for tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Scheidt, a cardiologist who saw the talkative  
ex-mayor at the emergency room, called Koch's condition ``near 
syncope'' or almost fainting. He said he did not believe that Koch 
had a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch, who plays a judge on ``The People's Court'' and writes a  
weekly column for the Daily News, had to cancel plans to get 
arrested at a protest against alleged police brutality outside 
police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch had a stroke in 1987. Soon after, he said his doctor called  
it ``a trivial stroke. Trivial to them maybe -- but not to me.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Province Halts Ford, GM Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A southern Brazilian province is  
suspending more than $250 million in fiscal incentives to General 
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Corp., saying the money is needed for 
infrastructure projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern state of Rio Grande do Sul on Monday said it would  
suspend disbursement of $257 million in investments, loans and 
other incentives originally earmarked for the Brazilian 
subsidiaries of the two U.S. automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money has to be used where it is needed most,'' Marcelo  
Lucca of the State's Industrial Development Department said. ``It 
has to be used for education, health, basic sanitation and to pay 
civil servants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of a $470 million package put together in 1997  
by the state's previous government to lure the two automakers to 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Motors expects the state of Rio Grande do Sul to meet  
all of its contractual obligations,'' GM's corporate director Jose 
Carlos Pinheiro Neto said in a statement. Ford said it requested a 
meeting with State Governor Olivio Dutra, but would not comment on 
the matter until after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucca said state officials were negotiating with the two  
automakers ``to seek ways we can honor Rio Grande do Sul's 
commitments without dipping into the state's coffers. There is 
simply not enough money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to see General Motors or Ford leave the state,''  
Lucca said. ``The money has to come from somewhere else, like 
international lending organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GM plant in Rio Grande do Sul is scheduled to begin  
operating at the end of the year with an annual production capacity 
of 120,000 vehicles. The Ford plant is also expected to begin 
making 120,000 cars a year as of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Portsmouth Company Gets the Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Limited by an uncooperative wavelength, the  
color blue never has been done justice on computer or movie 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
	A Portsmouth company is trying to change that.  
</P>
<P>
	The Corporation for Laser Optics Research, or COLOR, has spent  
about $12 million developing a projection system that is true to 
blue light, whose short wavelength makes it the most difficult 
color to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The key is creating a powerful blue laser, something the company  
believes it accomplished recently when it produced a seven-watt 
beam of blue light. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen A. Benton, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
professor and a director of the company, said that when mixed with 
red and green lasers, the blue laser will have applications in 
movie theaters, televisions, computer monitors and large screens at 
sports stadiums. Lasers are far more powerful and cheaper to 
maintain than the thousands of tiny television tubes or florescent 
light bulbs used in older stadium screens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more power you have, the brighter the image. That's what  
people want -- brighter images,'' Benton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier versions of COLOR's screens hang in the lobby of the  
Museum of Science in Boston, and in Manchester Airport's baggage 
claim, where passengers can watch 24-hour news and weather. Those 
screens are 7 1/2 feet by 10 feet and cost about $250,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-sided COLOR screen hangs in the Crown arena in  
Cincinnati, and the Army paid $1.5 million for lifelike projections 
of tanks to use during target practice in Yuma, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the technology was new when the Museum of Science and  
Manchester Airport screens were installed, last year and in 1997 
respectively, they have bugs that cause images to ``speckle,'' said 
Pendleton White, the company's vice president for business 
development. The new, more powerful blue laser has helped eradicate 
the problem, he said, and the new system will be more efficient and 
less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Although blue lasers are a hot research field, COLOR's  
technology is in a vein different from the low-power beams being 
developed for eye surgery, cutting narrower grooves in compact 
disks and other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	COLOR produces blue lasers by converting infrared light; the  
lower-powered beams are generated from semiconductors or 
light-emitting diodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Because laser beams maintain their diameter and don't spread out  
the way flashlight beams do, they can be used to create brighter, 
more precise images, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, White said, replays on screens at sports stadiums  
often look washed out. COLOR's technology would allow the screens 
to show more colorful images, even in broad daylight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one giant potential customer has shown interest in the  
technology. Last fall, Sony Corp. bought stock in COLOR, an 
11-year-old firm with about 25 employees. A Sony representative 
sits on its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	COLOR's primary backer is Venture Investment Management Corp. of  
Boston, which has provided the company with $12 million. Like most 
young technology companies, COLOR has not turned a profit. It 
expects to start breaking even next year after it begins producing 
the new projection system. 
</P>
<P>
	A prototype expected to be finished in about a month will be  
half the size of a refrigerator -- about 35 percent smaller than 
units being used now and up to twice as powerful, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another unit, being designed for boardroom use, will be about  
the size of a breadbox, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arto Nurmikko, a Brown University engineering and physics  
professor, said COLOR's technology is not revolutionary, but could 
be an improvement of existing systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incremental advance. Anyone who makes an advance in  
terms of efficiency or compactness is contributing to the field of 
blue laser research,'' Nurmikko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says its seven-watt blue laser is the strongest ever  
recorded. Previously, COLOR and a German university recorded about 
five watts.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Langdon Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Trajan Langdon has been Duke's money player  
the last three seasons, the guy the Blue Devils go to for clutch 
3-pointers and smooth baseline jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	That was until the postseason rolled around, where Langdon was a  
major flop in 1997 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	He shot 19-for-68 from the field (28 percent), including  
11-for-38 from beyond the arc as the Blue Devils were ousted from 
the NCAA tournament by Providence and eventual national champion 
Kentucky the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 senior rectified his tournament shooting woes in a  
major way the last two weeks. Duke (36-1) now heads to the national 
semifinals against Michigan State with a sizzling shooter in its 
already potent arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the first tournament game against Florida A&AMP;M with  
a foot injury, Langdon has gone 19-for-30 in his last three games, 
including 11-for-18 from 3-point range in winning the East Regional 
MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are monkeys (on your back) and then there are monkeys,  
and if the monkey is how well you've done in late postseason play 
that's a good monkey to have on,'' coach Mike Krzyzewski said 
Monday of Langdon. ``A lot of people never play with that monkey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Langdon's shooting problems late in those years can be  
traced to Duke's lack of offense, where Langdon was not only the 
major option in the team's attack, but sometimes its only option. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is he hadn't shot like the player he is,'' Krzyzewski  
said. ``It may be because we've been so dependent on him that it 
wasn't the monkey but it was us on his shoulders that he had been 
carrying. Maybe we've just given him a little bit more help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trajan is not one who would ever succumb to pressure, but he  
is a human being and he can get worn down. He got worn down because 
he carried us -- further probably than we should have advanced a 
couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon, one of the best free-throw shooters in Atlantic Coast  
Conference history and a 44 percent 3-point shooter this year, said 
he didn't give his postseason shooting troubles a thought. That is 
until the media brings it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys put it in my mind. That's all you guys talked  
about,'' Langdon told reporters Monday. ``I wasn't concerned about 
it. I wanted to do well, and then I came down with the foot injury, 
all I was thinking about was getting back on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did admit there is less pressure on his shooting this year  
with a host of other offensive options. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a different mindset. I put too much pressure on myself  
in the postseason these last couple of years. We have such a 
talented team they really don't need my shot, or if I don't shoot 
well we can win. We've even won big when I haven't shot well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said he feels a special bond with Langdon, who helped  
bridge the gap between Duke's disastrous 13-18 season of 1994-95 
and this year's dominating Final Four squad that has won 31 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he walked off the court (Sunday), my smile was a smile  
for Trajan,'' Krzyzewski said of the team's East Regional title win 
over Temple. ``When I saw that kid and watched him walk off I 
wished I could be him at his age. I could never have been him at 
his age -- and I thought I was a pretty hot ticket. So, I admire 
what he has done for us.''

<HEADLINE> Starr Prosecutor Testifies Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The head of Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr's Arkansas office testified Monday for the second time in 
less than a week, outlining an unsubstantiated allegation that 
Webster Hubbell, a friend of the Clintons, may have tried to stop 
an investigation while a Justice Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	Subpoenaed as a witness in a civil lawsuit, Starr deputy Hickman  
Ewing Jr. testified about a meeting initiated last year by Mike 
Salem, a disgruntled former employee of the Lane poultry company 
that was purchased by Tyson Foods more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Salem is suing the three trustees of Lane, trying to force them  
to identify the recipients of $13 million in payments from Tyson 
for the purchase of the Lane company. Salem says he didn't get any 
of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees subpoenaed Ewing in an attempt to show that Salem  
has engaged in a pattern of harassment that included an effort to 
trigger a criminal investigation by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on the witness stand for a half-hour before Pulaski  
County Chancery Court Judge Ellen Brantley, Ewing testified that 
Salem repeatedly brought up Hubbell's name in meeting with him last 
May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Salem suggested that Starr's office look into Hubbell's  
activities at the Justice Department at a time when ``elements of 
the department'' were looking into the actions of the Lane 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salem wanted to make us aware'' that ``Hubbell had been at the  
Justice Department'' and that ``what had happened up there needed 
investigating,'' Ewing testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Ewing's appearance, a lawyer for the trustees, Judy  
Henry, cross-examined Salem for two hours. Salem testified that ``I 
wanted to voice my concern'' to Ewing about a meeting Salem 
understood had taken place between trustee John Peterson and 
Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell attorney John Nields declined to comment when informed  
Monday night of the testimony regarding his client. Starr's office 
has two criminal cases pending against Hubbell, a former associate 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Ewing testified under subpoena in the case  
against Susan McDougal, revealing that he had once drafted a 
proposed indictment against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 
Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer is trying to show that Starr's  
prosecutors tried to get her to falsely implicate President Clinton 
and the first lady in wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Gov. Cancels Photo Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Headlines Headlines Headlines .....    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Gov. Jim Hodges, who previously said he  
could not cancel South Carolina's contract to sell nearly 4 million 
driver's license photos for a fraud-prevention system, reversed 
course today and ordered the agreement broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges said he was persuaded to move when he found out this  
weekend that 4,200 photos of children as young as 10 had been 
transmitted to Image Data LLC of Nashua, N.H. The children's photos 
are from Public Safety Department identity cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Carolinians have spoken clearly that they want these  
records to be kept private and we as state government must move 
forward to do that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data's president said the company had not decided whether  
to sue, but Hodges said he was willing to take that risk. The 
company has paid $6,000 of the $27,000 it owes and will be 
reimbursed, Public Safety Director Boykin Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously disappointed at Governor Hodges' recent  
action,'' company President Bob Houvener said. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data also bought driver's license photos from Florida and  
Colorado. The company challenged a temporary restraining order on 
the sale of license photos in Florida. Colorado stopped selling 
license photos while the Legislature considers outlawing sales of 
personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data's fraud-prevention system briefly shows merchants the  
picture of a credit card holder or check writer. The company says 
the pictures are encoded so they cannot be saved or otherwise 
transmitted.

<HEADLINE> Oscars Weren't Huge TV Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Academy Awards can't have titanic television  
ratings every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for Sunday night's long-winded Oscar telecast sank 18  
percent from 1998, when the box office blockbuster ``Titanic'' 
helped give the telecast its highest Nielsen Media Research numbers 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The show had a 28.6 household rating and a 46 share. The  
telecast, which stretched over four hours, had an average audience 
of 45.6 million viewers, down from the 55.2 million viewers of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second-lowest rated Oscar telecast since 1991. The  
1997 broadcast, when ``The English Patient'' was named best 
picture, had a 27.4 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said they expected the numbers to drop since big winners  
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' weren't as 
popular as ``Titanic.'' But executives said they had a 15 percent 
increase in younger viewers this year over the 1997 telecast, 
meaning many of the young people drawn in last year came back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that last year was a home run because of `Titanic' and  
those type of Academy Awards are few and far between,'' said Larry 
Hyams, ABC's vice president of audience analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The network hoped that moving the Oscar telecast from Monday to  
Sunday night would give the ratings a boost, but that appeared to 
make little difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a few ears remained singed Monday from host Whoopi  
Goldberg's blue-tinted jokes and a Joan Rivers tirade over her 
access to stars on an E! Entertainment Television Oscar pre-show 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg raised a few eyebrows with her jokes, including several  
references to sex and bodily functions. Larry Marino, host of 
``Morning Magazine'' on KIEV, a conservative-leaning AM radio talk 
station in Los Angeles, said he got a lot of negative calls this 
morning about the Oscars and Goldberg's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't get them all on,'' Marino said. ``In my opinion,  
her jokes were sophomoric and much like you would hear from 
15-year-olds in a bus back from the day at the beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC executive in charge of specials said the network felt  
``very positive'' about Goldberg's performance and said it was 
harsh to judge her on the basis of a few lines in a four-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoopi is a stand-up comedian,'' said Michael Davies,  
executive vice president for alternative series and special 
programming. ``I don't think it was that different from the last 
time we had seen her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, whose pre-Oscar telecast asking stars about their  
wardrobes has quickly become an awards show staple, was seething 
Sunday night about ABC hampering her access to the stars. For the 
first time, ABC showed an Oscar-sanctioned pre-show of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABC is hogging everything. ... They're being very naughty,''  
Rivers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies wouldn't second-guess the people who run the Oscars for  
the show's length. At just over four hours, ending past 12:30 a.m. 
Monday on the East Coast, it was the longest Academy Award telecast 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	In rehearsals, the show timed out at 3 1/2 hours, which Davies said  
is the ideal length. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the nature of live television,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Florida Club Bans Soap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Feel free to work up a sweat on the  
racquetball courts, take a swim in the Olympic-size pools or soak 
in the hot tub at the Bonaventure Town Center Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't lather up in the locker room -- soap has been banned  
for fear of more litigation. And not just bar soap, but body wash, 
shampoo, conditioner and shaving cream, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been sued. We've settled. We've lost a lot of money,''  
said Bob Fedderwitz, executive director of the recreation center in 
Weston, a well-to-do community near Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	The club banned soap after it was sued by people who slipped and  
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedderwitz would not say how much his club had paid out or how  
many lawsuits it has been hit with since its 1984 opening, except 
that it's ``quite a few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just a litigious society,'' Fedderwitz said. ``Anybody  
who hurts themselves, when they see an establishment like ourselves 
that's required to carry X dollars in insurance, that's very 
attractive to attorneys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And very unattractive to insurance companies.  
</P>
<P>
	Fedderwitz said the club's insurer was considering dropping its  
coverage if the place didn't do something about the lawsuits. The 
ban went into effect a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At Century Village in Deerfield Beach, soap has been banned in  
locker rooms and at poolside showers since the retirement community 
was built 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15,000 residents of Century Village, where the average age  
is 70 to 75, are accustomed to community regulations, and most 
respect the soap ban, said Amadeo Trinchitella, the 81-year-old 
chairman of the recreation committee. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the occasional suds smuggler, ``we try to say that  
there's going to be penalties -- such as we're going to keep you 
from going to the (community) shows,'' Trinchitella said. ``But 
it's kind of an idle threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fedderwitz said people at the Town Center Club aren't in a  
lather about the ban. He said there have been only a few 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he said, ``if they really want to take a soapy shower  
and not worry about smelling, they're three minutes from their 
house.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Davis Improves on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- After setting a club record with 34 errors  
last season, Seattle third baseman Russ Davis knew he had to do 
work on his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I jumped the rope a little bit here and there. I did some box  
drills, jumping back and forth here and there,'' he said. ``But I'm 
not going to sit here and tell you I went home and killed myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Improvement has been noticeable this spring. He didn't make his  
first error of the spring until Monday, an 11-9 loss to the Chicago 
White Sox that included his fifth homer of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked on his agility,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``He  
gets himself in a better position now. He's got more range. There's 
never been anything wrong with his hands. His body just wasn't in 
position before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a lineup featuring All-Stars Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex  
Rodriguez, Davis is another strong offensive player, matching his 
career high with 20 homers and driving in a career-best 82 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	But his fielding was so bad that Piniella took him off third  
base -- where he wound up making 32 errors in 137 games -- and put 
him in left field -- where he made two errors in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five of Davis' error came before the All-Star break.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real happy with the way I finished up with my defense last  
year,'' Davis said. ``I finished real strong. So far so good this 
spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners' defense was 12th in the AL as Seattle slumped to a  
76-85 record, 11 1/2 games behind first-place Texas in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awful,'' Davis said. ``But I know if we would have been  
winning that half, the things that were said wouldn't have been 
brought up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has come up with a new strategy to keep his mental health  
intact: He doesn't plan to read any newspapers, listen to any radio 
stations or watch any TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do good, I'll forget about it,'' he said. ``Yesterday was  
yesterday. If I do bad, yesterday was yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners are counting on getting a big year from Davis, who  
came to them in a trade that sent Tino Martinez and Jeff Nelson to 
the New York Yankees in December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 29, thinks he can have his best season. And that includes  
his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think mechanically there's a whole lot wrong with what  
I do out there,'' he said. ``My feet move around good. My hands are 
in good position. I think the main thing for me is just to stay 
focused. My concentration should be there for every pitch.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall in Light Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With BC-Bonds-Glance    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds fell Monday, retreating for a second  
session as traders braced for the sale of $21 billion in new debt 
securities from the government and AT&AMP;T later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/4 point,  
or $2.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.57 percent from 5.55 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With no major economic news to steer the market, traders were  
awaiting Tuesday's pricing of a record $7 billion in bonds being 
sold by AT&AMP;T Corp. and Wednesday's government auction of $14 
billion in new two-year Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 1/16 and 3/32 point from late Friday, while 
intermediate maturities fell between 3/32 and 3/16 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.57 
points to 1,282.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.51 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from late Friday to 4.40 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.64 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.47 percent. One-year yields were 
unchanged at 4.71 percent, while the discount held steady at late 
Friday's 4.49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 percent from late Friday's 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 125 1/8. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged from late Friday's 5.17 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Shakespeare Wins Best Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Bard, and not the boys in uniform, was  
the surprise winner for best picture of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare In Love,'' a witty tale about a young William  
Shakespeare overcoming writer's block by meeting a gorgeous muse, 
beat the favored ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a harrowing tale that 
assaulted audiences' senses with its depiction of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Best director Steven Spielberg dedicated his Oscar to his  
father, and to the men who died during the D-day invasion. But his 
glaring -- and loud -- look at war was surpassed by a 1590s tale of 
Elizabethan life. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Shakespeare, writer of plays and lacking of inspiration,  
finds love in Lady Viola, who inspires him to revamp his latest 
play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Written by playwright Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman,  
``Shakespeare In Love'' won a leading seven Oscars, including 
original screenplay, best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow and best 
supporting actress for Judi Dench. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramar chairman Harvey Weinstein, one of several producers who  
accepted the Oscar on Sunday night, said it was ``an ensemble film 
and it took an ensemble to make it ... This is a movie about life 
and art, and art and life combining is called magic.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech Fires Basketball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Tech men's basketball coach  
Bobby Hussey was fired Monday after two years with the Hokies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussey guided Virginia Tech to records of 10-17 and 13-15 after  
replacing Bill Foster as coach before the 1997-98 season. He did 
not attend the news conference and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became apparent this season that the program no longer held  
the respect of its fan base,'' said athletic director Jim Weaver. 
``This was evidenced by the poorest attendance in the 38-year 
history of Cassell Coliseum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's team drew an average of 4,040 to the 10,052-seat arena  
this season, more than 1,000 fewer than the women's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver said he made the decision to replace Hussey a few weeks  
ago but waited to announce it because the Hokies women's team was 
in the midst of its deepest run in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the search for a new coach has begun immediately.

<HEADLINE> Suns' Robinson Loses Loan Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Phoenix Suns forward Clifford Robinson must  
pay a partnership the $517,000 he owes on a home loan, a federal 
appeals court ruled Monday, saying Robinson waited too long to 
claim fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the  
basketball player was bound by a 1993 contract with 389 Orange 
Street Partners, one of the lenders for his $1.5 million home in 
Newtown, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, then with the Portland Trail Blazers, paid interest on  
the loan for three years but failed to pay the $468,000 principal, 
which was due in a balloon payment in May 1996. The damage award 
also includes late fees and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, now in his second year with Phoenix, recently signed a  
one-year, $3.5 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In defense of his non-payment, Robinson filed claims in August  
1996 against the lenders and others involved in the transaction, 
saying he had been defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a judge who summarized his claims, Robinson said  
his agent, Larry Gillman, who arranged the loan, took $77,000 of 
the proceeds for his own use and two of the partners in 389 Orange 
Street Partners took $97,000 as purported brokerage fees. Robinson 
said the payments were concealed from him. 
</P>
<P>
	He settled a separate suit against Gillman for $457,000 in 1997.  
That suit alleged Gillman took kickbacks from contractors who were 
building Robinson's home and used some of the money to remodel his 
own home and build a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, however, refused to consider the fraud claims  
in the lender's suit against Robinson. The court said Robinson made 
the claims more than three years after the alleged fraud, the 
deadline for filing such claims under Connecticut law. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting Judge John Noonan said the claims should have been  
considered under a portion of state law that allows certain late 
claims to be heard ``if justice so requires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to know what justice does require if the facts  
and the inferences from the facts of this case do not require that 
Robinson be given the opportunity to show at trial that he was 
swindled by his agent ... and by his lenders,'' Noonan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court majority said Robinson failed to invoke the  
``justice'' exception until after his claims had been dismissed by 
U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice is not served by permitting a litigant to drop the  
ball in his lawsuit and seek to have it resurrected -- at the 
expense of the other parties and the taxpaying public -- by alleging 
egregious facts which invoke sympathy for the litigant's plight,'' 
wrote Judge Stephen Trott, joined by Judge David Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	John Geil, Robinson's lawyer, said he would recommend that  
Robinson appeal to the Supreme Court. If a lender commits fraud, he 
said, ``I think it's fair that it should be treated as a defense to 
any collection'' on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Richard Senders, whose firm represented the lenders,  
declined comment, saying he had not seen the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is 389 Orange Street Partners vs. Arnold, 97-35877.

<HEADLINE> NJ Lawmaker Proposes Boxing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A New Jersey lawmaker introduced a  
bill Monday that would require state officials -- not promoters and 
sanctioning bodies -- to appoint and pay boxing judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill by State Sen. Richard Codey comes in the wake of the  
disputed draw of the March 13 heavyweight title fight between 
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Codey says the three main boxing bodies -- the WBC, WBA and IBF --  
appoint judges for boxing matches in New Jersey and the promoter 
pay their fees and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the state Athletic Control Board said the  
state chooses judges in all but the title fights, and even then has 
approval of the selections. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend the current system encourages judges to feel  
beholden toward the sanctioning bodies and the promoter because 
they choose the judges and pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Holyfield-Lewis fight, IBF judge Eugenia Williams of  
Atlantic City was the only one of three judges to call Holyfield -- 
who holds the IBF title -- the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the fight was held in New York, Codey thinks New  
Jersey should examine its system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having promoters involved in paying the judges and apparently  
selecting them smells of fight-fixing, whether that occurs in 
reality or not,'' said Codey, the minority leader of the New Jersey 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF president Bob Lee dismissed Codey's proposal as a  
``knee-jerk reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's right for the public sector to take the  
authority away from a private company,'' he said. ``If the title 
belongs to the IBF, then we ought to have something to say about 
the people who are officiating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhonda Utley-Herring, executive assistant to state boxing  
commissioner Larry Hazzard, said the state already appoints the 
three judges and one referee for each match. 
</P>
<P>
	In non-title fights, the commission assigns all four officials,  
she said. In world title fights, the commission assigns two 
officials and the sanctioning body makes a recommendation on the 
other two, with the state empowered to either approve or reject the 
recommendations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses and fees, meanwhile, are paid for by the promoter. The  
checks are deposited into the state treasury and the commission 
then issues separate state checks to the officials, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Codey said that wasn't so. He said promoters still pay officials  
directly. In either case, he said, the bill would make direct 
payments against the law.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the euro in quiet  
trading but rose against the yen Monday as traders speculated about 
how high Japanese officials want the U.S. currency to go against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.11  
Japanese yen, up from 117.28. The euro was quoted at $1.0908, up 
from $1.0892. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was also quiet in Asia, where Japanese markets were  
closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell below 117 yen, but traders pushed the dollar  
higher to where Bank of Japan officials previously have indicated 
they prefer to see the dollar against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market believes the BOJ would like to see the dollar at  
117-119 yen,'' said Ben Strauss, a vice president of foreign 
exchange at Bank Julius Baer &AMP; Co. ``That's been the range for the 
last couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other markets failed to give the dollar a boost.  
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices fell and volume on the New York Stock Exchange was  
down significantly, halting the Dow's march towards closing above 
10,000 points. The Dow didn't even reach 10,000 points Monday as it 
did last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4631 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4657, and 1.5035 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5153. The British 
pound remained unchanged at $1.6287. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7931 German 
marks, down from 1.7957; 6.0132 French francs, down from 6.0241; 
and 1,776.20 Italian lire, unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Gen. Westmoreland Donates Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Retired Army Gen. William Westmoreland,  
who commanded U.S. troops in the Vietnam War, donated hundreds of 
thousands of personal papers and hundreds of books to the 
University of South Carolina today. 
</P>
<P>
	Westmoreland, who turns 85 Friday, was joined by family and  
friends at a luncheon where university officials announced the 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Westmoreland's collection, including a 700-volume library, will  
become part of the South Caroliniana Library collection. The 
Spartanburg native who now lives in Charleston said he wanted the 
collection to go to a university in his native state. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection of documents, which if put in cardboard boxes  
end-to-end would stretch 150 feet, will take about two years to 
catalogue, said Herbert Hartsook, the library's curator of modern 
political collections. 
</P>
<P>
	George Terry, vice-provost and dean of university libraries,  
said the collection will be an important resource for historians 
studying the Vietnam era. It also includes correspondence relating 
to Westmoreland's later libel suit against CBS.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Soar About 8 1/2 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) -- Gasoline prices have surged nearly 8 1/2  
cents per gallon at the pump over the past two weeks, reflecting a 
rise in crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average, including all grades and taxes, was  
$1.0869 cents per gallon on Friday, up 8.41 cents from two weeks 
earlier, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was only the second since September and followed a  
half-cent hike recorded two weeks ago, analyst Trilby Lundberg said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharpest increase, averaging 14 cents, was in the Midwest.  
The smallest, at a nickel, was in the West, where prices had jumped 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few weeks ago, gas at the BP station in northern Columbus  
was about 89 cents per gallon, said cashier Tanya Kuseski, 20, of 
Columbus. On Sunday, prices ranged from $1.06 to $1.26 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Henry, 25, of Columbus, has noticed at least a 20 cent  
jump in prices in the past few weeks. ``It would be nice if they 
were cheaper, but there's not much you can do,'' he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising crude oil prices were to blame, and the causes for that  
are complex, involving global politics and local disasters, analyst 
Trilby Lundberg said from Texas, where she is attending a refiners' 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	They include OPEC's announcement that it plans to cut oil  
production by 2 million barrels a day, and the Feb. 23 explosion at 
a Tosco Corp. oil refinery in Martinez, Calif., that killed four 
people and sent gasoline buyers chasing alternative supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reasons range from disruption of Iraq's oil pipeline by  
U.S. air raids to greater demand thanks to an improving world 
economy, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-service prices nationwide were $1.0284 per gallon for  
regular, $1.13.39 for mid-grade and $1.2191 for premium. 
Full-service prices were $1.4361 for regular, $1.5276 for mid-grade 
and $1.6013 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Contract Awarded for Plutonium Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department today awarded a $130  
million contract to a consortium, including two U.S. utilities, for 
the disposal of plutonium by converting it into a fuel for civilian 
power reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The department previously had announced its plan to get rid of  
about 36 tons of weapons-grade plutonium by converting it into a 
mixed oxide, or MOX, fuel that can be used in a civilian reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was awarded to the French nuclear fuel  
manufacturer, Cogema, and two U.S. utilities, Duke Power and 
Virginia Power Co., that will burn the MOX fuel in four of their 
reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The first MOX shipments are expected to arrive at the reactors  
in 2007. A processing plant for converting plutonium to MOX fuel 
has yet to be built. Such a fuel is used in reactors in Europe and 
will be increasingly used in Japan soon. But the United States has 
not used such a fuel in civilian reactors because of a general 
policy against reactor fuel reprocessing. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel to be used in the Energy Department program will come  
from processing plutonium left over from the weapons program. 
Critics have argued that the decision to use plutonium-based MOX 
fuel in civilian reactors will erode the sharp line historically 
separating U.S. military and civilian nuclear programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department denies any such blurring of the separation  
of military and civilian programs. Senior department officials also 
have rejected suggestions by some critics that it is less safe to 
use MOX fuel than conventional uranium in civilian reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Control Institute, a private nuclear proliferation  
watchdog group, has criticized the use of MOX fuel in U.S. 
reactors, maintaining it will add to safety risks and contribute to 
proliferation concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The group on Monday also charged that the program will cost  
taxpayers millions of dollars in subsidies to the two U.S. 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``DOE should be concentrating on the other alternative it is  
pursuing for warhead plutonium disposition, which is cheaper, 
faster, and safer,'' said Tom Clements, the NCI's executive 
director. He said the preferred disposal is to combine plutonium 
with other nuclear waste and bury or otherwise immobilize it. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Maher, a spokesman for Duke Power, based in Charlotte, N.C.,  
has said the utility is convinced that burning MOX fuel is safe and 
cited a National Academy of Sciences endorsement of such disposal 
methods for plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Zuercher, a spokesman for Virginia Power, has said the  
utility has been assured that use of MOX fuel would ``pose no added 
risk to the employees or the public, and that's a safe thing to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Power has said it would use two reactors at the McGuire  
plant south of Charlotte, N.C., and two reactors at Catawba plant 
near Rock Hill, S.C. Virginia Power plans to use its two reactors 
at the North Anna plant near Mineral, Va. Cogema would process 
plutonium into MOX fuel at a yet-to-be-built facility at DOE's 
Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Morris To Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Matt Morris, expected to be the ace of the St.  
Louis Cardinals pitching staff, will miss the entire season because 
of a torn ligament in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris was examined Sunday by Dr. Frank Jobe and will require  
ligament replacement surgery, a procedure Jobe pioneered 25 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tough break for him and for us,'' Cardinals manager Tony La  
Russa said. ``You just don't replace a Matt Morris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old right-hander was 7-5 with a team-leading 2.53  
ERA last season, missing all but one start in the first half 
because of a shoulder surgery. He was bothered arm stiffness this 
spring, threw two scoreless innings against Kansas City in his 
first start, then felt pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put in a lot of work in the offseason on his shoulder, and  
then something like this,'' La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 12-9 with a 3.19 ERA two years ago in his rookie season,  
joined a growing list of prominent NL Central pitchers with arm 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Cubs ace Kerry Wood, the NL Rookie of the Year, will  
miss the season because of a torn elbow ligament. Cincinnati Reds 
ace Denny Neagle may start the season on the disabled list because 
of a chronic shoulder problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are also without another promising young pitcher,  
Alan Benes. Benes, 27, missed all of last season after rotator cuff 
surgery. He had additional surgery in September, and the team isn't 
sure when he'll return. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other guys will have to step up,'' Benes said. ``Matt  
Morris was a big part of our staff. We feel terrible for him. But 
we still have a talented staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan Osborne, who has been on the disabled list a number of  
times himself over the past several seasons, appears likely to 
become the Cardinals' No. 1 starter, 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Mercker, Kent Bottenfield and Darren Oliver also are  
expected to start. The fifth starter will likely be either Manny 
Aybar, impressive at Triple-A but is 8-10 with a 5.18 ERA in parts 
of two big league seasons, or rookie Jose Jimenez, 3-0 with a 2.95 
ERA during a September callup.

<HEADLINE> IRS Wants Easier Business Filings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service wants to free  
small businesses from a requirement that they file computerized tax 
returns, IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drew plaudits from critics who for three years have  
argued the electronic-filing rule ties up managers' time and drives 
up costs. IRS officials compare it with making automatic bill 
payments, saying it eliminates traditional coupon-and-check 
paperwork and allows deposits by telephone, personal computer or 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``While electronic payment of taxes is increasingly popular due  
to its speed and convenience, the decision to raise the threshold 
requiring the use of EFTPS shows understanding and flexibility for 
the needs of smaller businesses,'' said Bennie L. Thayer, president 
and chief executive officer of the National Association for the 
Self-Employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businesses that currently pay more than $50,000 in payroll  
taxes must use the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System; the IRS 
proposes to raise the threshold to $200,000, beginning next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said about 9 percent of businesses will be required to  
use the electronic system, but he predicted many more would elect 
to continue to do so. More than 2 million taxpayers use the 
electronic payment system, which has taken in more than $2 trillion 
in its three-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that most of the businesses that are currently  
using the system will continue to do so because they find it easier 
to use,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri GOP Sen. Christopher Bond, Small Business Committee  
chairman, urged the government to continue to waive penalties on 
businesses that still must file electronically. The IRS said Monday 
it would waive penalties from July 1 through Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with the new more reasonable threshold, businesses should  
not be penalized if they make a mistake the first time they try to 
use the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System,'' Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	A public hearing on the proposed regulations is set for May 11.

<HEADLINE> Study: Caffeine May Be Good for You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Caffeine is not addictive for most people, a  
new study concludes, and has little effect on human health. No, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a much-promoted French study released Monday during  
the American Chemical Society's annual meeting, drinking up to 
three cups of coffee a day has no effect on the part of the brain 
responsible for addiction. And it may actually be good for you. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're a rat.  
</P>
<P>
	After spending two years with 30 rodents, researcher Astrid  
Nehlig of the French National Health Medical Research Institute 
found that moderate consumption increases energy and renders 
addiction ``quite unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by the French coffee industry and her  
employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank loan officer Laura Comstock doesn't hesitate when asked if  
she agrees with Nehlig's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' she replies flatly.  
</P>
<P>
	Comstock must have at least two caffeinated drinks -- usually tea  
or Diet Coke -- to get through the day, plus a midmorning cup of 
joe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get headaches if I don't drink coffee,'' she said, seated at  
a coffee house during lunch, a cup of decaf in hand. ``There's got 
to be something to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Nehlig, seven or eight cups of java would have to  
be consumed in quick succession to create the same addictive brain 
activity as a low dose of, say, morphine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Addiction to caffeine is not the same as addiction to  
methamphetamines or cocaine or morphine,'' Nehlig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not denying that there can be a dependence on caffeine,  
I'm just saying that there is no adverse physical effects to using 
caffeine in moderate levels,'' the researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caffeine studies are all over the map when it comes to health  
effects. Some say the drug increases productivity. The Center for 
Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based watchdog group, 
said it may degenerate bone mass and endanger fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Roland Griffiths, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at  
Johns Hopkins University, has done extensive research on caffeine. 
He's skeptical of Nehlig's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start extrapolating from rats to humans, all kinds of  
things change,'' he said. And ``there is pretty substantial 
literature in animals and humans showing chronic administration of 
caffeine produces acute dependency syndrome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgina Rocha, who operates an outdoor coffee stand in Los  
Angeles, sees some of that every day. Does she believe caffeine is 
healthy for her customers? 
</P>
<P>
	``When I drink it, I get all jumpy and hyper, so it can't be  
good for them, either,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 'Judge Judy' Revives Court Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Head to the bench, Oprah and Rosie. The new  
queen of daytime television takes no guff. 
</P>
<P>
	Tart-talking ``Judge Judy'' Sheindlin has single-handedly led a  
revival of the court show genre and surged to the top of the 
daytime ratings by dispensing no-nonsense justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Judy'' passed Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Springer and Rosie  
O'Donnell in the ratings during TV's February ``sweeps'' period. 
Her Nielsen Media Research numbers are up 60 percent over last year 
while her three biggest rivals are down. 
</P>
<P>
	``People respond to her in the same way they responded to Jesse  
Ventura,'' said Larry Lyttle, president of Big Ticket Television, 
which produces the show. ``There's a certain attitude and 
directness and succinctness that people relate to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like other court shows, combatants air their grievances before  
Sheindlin and she makes a ruling. ``Judge Judy'' seeks cases where 
the people involved have a prior relationship in order to fire up 
more passion, Lyttle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheindlin -- who wrote a book titled ``Don't Pee on My Leg and  
Tell Me It's Raining'' -- doesn't take kindly to being bamboozled or 
sassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very strong personality and people like that,'' said  
Marc Berman, a television analyst for Seltel. ``People watch her to 
see how she rules a courtroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court shows were big in the 1980s, when Judge Wapner's  
``People's Court'' was the rage. But in the cyclical world of 
syndicated television, they soon burned out. None were left on the 
air by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyttle decided to take a chance on reviving the genre when he  
met with Sheindlin, a former Family Court judge in New York, and 
the show premiered in fall 1996. He wondered how the country would 
respond to such a clearly New York personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if people would be captivated by it or turned  
off by it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Judy'' slowly caught on and she soon had rivals. Former  
New York City Mayor Edward Koch now presides over a revived 
``People's Court.'' Former boxing referee Mills Lane and Judge Joe 
Brown started shows this season. 
</P>
<P>
	None are sensations like ``Judge Judy,'' but all are doing well  
enough to stick around, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next fall brings two new ones, including a revival of ``Divorce  
Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The courtroom shows are thriving as talk shows fade, largely due  
to oversaturation. Ratings for ``Oprah'' in February were down 18 
percent over 1998, ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' was off 16 percent 
and Springer dropped by 10 percent, Berman said. Roseanne's show is 
struggling for its life. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheindlin, meanwhile, reportedly wants to sweeten her contract  
with an ownership stake and may not tape any more shows until she's 
satisfied, the New York Daily News reported, quoting sources it did 
not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge wasn't available to talk and a spokeswoman refused  
comment on her contract situation. Lyttle said Sheindlin is under 
contract and hadn't expressed to him any desire to renegotiate. He 
said he didn't expect her to boycott work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure she'd like to make more money,'' he said. ``I'd like  
to make more money. If the show continues to do well, I'm sure we 
all will.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa Hires Steve Alford As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- The last time Steve Alford was in the Big  
Ten Conference, he was a sharpshooting guard at Indiana. Alford 
returned Monday as Iowa's new basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, who guided Southwest Missouri State to the NCAA  
tournament's Sweet 16, was hired to replace Tom Davis, whose 
contract was not renewed after 13 years in Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, 34, made it clear he intends to stay in Iowa City a long  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a Big Ten person. Now I am in the Big Ten,'' said Alford,  
a two-time All-American who led the Hoosiers to the NCAA title in 
1987 and was the school's No. 2 career scorer with 2,438 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need to be looking anywhere else. This is where I  
would like to call home for a long, long time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Sam, who will join him at Iowa as an assistant, said  
that was his take on his son's new job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this could be a long-term project,'' Sam Alford said.  
``He would like it to be the final move in coaching for him. Money 
was not the top priority. I think being in the Big Ten is the big 
priority in this job. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford accepted a five-year contract that calls for a base  
salary of about $350,000 annually. He made about $188,000 at 
Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	With camps, shoe-and-clothing contracts and broadcasting  
contracts, that could swell to about $600,000, Iowa athletic 
director Bob Bowlsby said. Additional, incremental incentives will 
be negotiated that would put Alford ``in the $900,000 range,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, who led the Bears to a 22-11 mark this season, was 78-48  
at Southwest Missouri State. He began his coaching career at 
Manchester College in 1992 and took the team to the NCAA Division 
III title game in 1995 before moving on to SMS. 
</P>
<P>
	His career coaching record is 156-77 in eight seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be more excited about the future of the Iowa  
basketball program,'' said Bowlsby, who has been looking for Davis' 
replacement since April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over that period of time, I spoke with dozens of people about  
potential basketball coaches. A few names kept coming up over and 
over and over again, and one of those was Steve Alford,'' Bowlsby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was 269-140 at Iowa but fell out of favor because he never  
won a conference title. The Hawkeyes finished 20-10 this season -- 
their fifth straight 20-win season -- after NCAA tourney wins 
against Alabama-Birmingham and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Their season, and Davis' Iowa career, ended last Thursday when  
they lost 78-68 to Connecticut in the West Regional semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears beat Wisconsin and Tennessee in the first two rounds  
of tournament play before falling 78-61 to top-ranked Duke in the 
NCAA East Regional semifinal last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like match play -- Iowa advanced and I knew we  
needed to advance,'' said Alford, who said he and Bowlsby had 
reached a ``gentlemen's agreement'' by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford said he hopes to have his coaching staff completed in the  
next two weeks. He said he would talk with current Iowa assistant 
Rich Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the current Hawkeyes need to share his passion for  
the game while shooting for a conference title and a shot at a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not the goal they want, then there's probably going to  
be more changes,'' Alford said. ``I'm not in the business to beg. I 
don't beg people to play or to come to the University of Iowa. 
Hopefully, the individual players that make up the team right now 
are going to have the same vision that I have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that takes place, I don't think you'll see anybody leaving.  
If those visions differ, then I think you're going to have some 
people that may want to go the other way. I hope that's not the 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the returning Hawkeyes said they couldn't wait for next  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to this. This is a great new change for  
us. I'm ready to get started,'' said forward Jacob Jaacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's exactly how I feel. I'm just real excited to get the  
opportunity to work with him,'' guard Ryan Luehrsmann said. ``The 
other guys feel the same way. We're real (eager) about it and feel 
that he's got a great vision and we're excited to be a part of 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Privacy Group Chides Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A watchdog organization financed partly by  
Microsoft to monitor how Internet sites protect consumer privacy 
chided the company Monday over a glitch in its software but took no 
further action. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E of Palo Alto, Calif., said Microsoft's uses of an  
identifying number that could be used to trace authors of some 
electronic documents -- even when they want to remain anonymous -- 
``compromise consumer trust and privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics pressing for new federal privacy laws said Trust-E's  
awkward role of being asked to investigate one of its biggest 
benefactors illustrates the risks of letting the industry regulate 
its own behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has urged the Internet industry to find ways to  
police itself or face possible new privacy legislation from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really undercuts the whole administration's claim that  
self-regulation works,'' said David Banisar, a staff lawyer at the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ``This was the 
big one. This was Microsoft, the major computer company in the 
United States. And they just missed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E receives $100,000 annually each from Microsoft and nine  
other sponsors. It agrees to regulate Internet privacy policies for 
about 500 companies in exchange for a fee and a seal of approval 
for their Web sites to reassure online customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trust-E said the bug in Microsoft's Windows 98 software that  
permitted the company to harvest those identifying numbers did not 
violate privacy promises it made with Trust-E over its Web site -- 
Microsoft.Com. 
</P>
<P>
	``When consumers go to a company and see a statement of a  
privacy policy, they expect that will deal with their data for that 
company regardless of whether it's on the Web,'' complained Deirdre 
Mulligan of the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet 
civil liberties group. ``Is there a self-regulatory remedy that 
gets to problems not at the Web site?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E could have denied Microsoft use of its seal of approval.  
</P>
<P>
	``We followed our methodology when we deal with any consumer  
dispute,'' said Susan Scott, the group's executive director. ``We 
did not treat Microsoft any differently than any of our other 
licensees we have received complaints on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Catlett, who filed the complaint, said he never seriously  
expected Trust-E to investigate Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believing in self-regulatory seal programs is like dealing  
with a shady insurance company,'' said Catlett, who runs 
Junkbusters Corp., a privacy group. ``The policy looks impressively 
long, but when something goes wrong, they point to a piece of 
fine-print legalese and you're left with zip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confirmed earlier this month that its latest version  
of Windows generates a unique serial number for each computer. That 
number partly is planted within some documents created with its 
popular collection of Office 97 business programs, which include 
Word and Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are part of a 32-digit identifier created by  
Windows 98 whenever customers register their software with 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company acknowledged it may have been collecting  
those serial numbers from customers -- along with names and 
addresses -- even when customers explicitly had indicated they did 
not want the numbers disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denied it ever used the serial number together with  
its customer lists to track documents. But privacy groups 
complained that it made it technically possible for the company to 
trace documents to a specific computer even when an author wished 
to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	The company offered two free software programs last week on its  
Internet site to strip out the identifying numbers.

<HEADLINE> Book: IRS Whistle-Blowers Hounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agents who blew the whistle on abusive  
practices at the IRS are suffering reprisals, says a Republican 
senator whose hearings led to the law aimed at reform. 
</P>
<P>
	In a book he wrote to keep the heat on the Internal Revenue  
Service even as it implements changes, Sen. William Roth of 
Delaware says there is continuing evidence of an ingrained culture 
of taxpayer abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the culture of the IRS will require more than  
legislation,'' wrote Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee. ``It will take a decade of training and oversight, 
vigilance by Congress and zero tolerance for abuse and 
mismanagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Committee's high-profile hearings on taxpayer horror  
stories led to last year's sweeping IRS reform law giving Americans 
more rights and improving oversight of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Power to Destroy,'' Roth and co-author William Nixon  
said that despite IRS pledges that it wouldn't happen, several 
agency witnesses who testified about problems appear to be 
suffering reprisals on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been deeply disturbed to hear from several that they  
are being hounded by their superiors,'' Roth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	One unnamed employee in the IRS examinations branch is quoted in  
the book as telling Roth she has gotten failing grades on 
evaluations since the hearings, compared with ``good to superior'' 
for 15 years prior to that. The employee's bosses also have 
intervened in some of her tax cases, something she said never 
happened before. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to build a case against me, to get rid of me,''  
Roth quotes the woman as telling him recently. ``Once I contacted 
people outside the agency, things started falling apart for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon said in an interview that IRS Commissioner Charles  
Rossotti met last week with him and Roth to discuss the reprisal 
allegations. IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek confirmed the meeting, and 
Rossotti said in a brief interview Monday that the agency will 
enforce ``specific instructions'' against any retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done everything that's humanly possible to make sure  
those employees are treated fairly and we will continue to do 
that,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth wrote that Congress should take further steps to make sure  
IRS employees aren't held to a Mafia-like ``omerta'' code of 
silence so they can ``share information necessary for appropriate 
oversight and reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book also discloses IRS in-house surveys of 80,000 employees  
in 1995 and 1997. These surveys found that 30 percent had observed 
at least one instance of ``unfair or uncaring'' treatment of a 
taxpayer, while 13 percent had seen such abuse at least three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 15 percent said they knew of agents ``lying or  
misleading'' a taxpayer to force compliance, while 19 percent had 
seen situations where taxpayers with political clout were given 
preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said these problems stemmed from intense pressure on agents  
to meet now-scrapped numerical enforcement quotas in an agency 
shrouded by secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too many decades, power and insufficient accountability  
have corrupted,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The book has nothing but praise for Rossotti, who left a  
computer and consulting business he founded to take over the IRS in 
mid-1997. Roth wrote that Rossotti ``can do great things to correct 
the service from the inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IRS statement in response to Roth's book says the service has  
``made substantial progress'' in changing how it deals with 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IRS clearly received its marching orders, and we took them  
seriously,'' the statement says. ``Much more remains to be done, 
and we are committed to that end.''

<HEADLINE> New Republic Gets New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New Republic, struggling to maintain its  
niche in the increasingly crowded business of political commentary, 
is getting a new look. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magazine as it is now is a pretty gray production,''  
editor Charles Lane said Monday from Washington. ``We wanted to 
reach out to folks who are used to seeing something brighter in 
what they read. ... It's going to be a younger look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 85-year-old magazine -- once solidly on the political left  
but now offering a more centrist Democratic perspective -- hopes its 
sharper image will boost newsstand sales. With an ocean of 
political opinion available on cable television, Internet chat 
sites and elsewhere in the print media, editors worry The New 
Republic's voice may be drowned out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a more competitive environment,'' said publisher Will  
Lippincott. ``Especially the last year, during the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, everyone had an opinion and everyone wanted to share it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The redesign, which will debut in the magazine's April 12 issue,  
will not affect editorial content, Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to start doing fashion,'' he said. ``Our  
magazine, even as it's getting a brighter package, wants to be a 
place where thoughtful people come to have their assumptions 
challenged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Editors plan to lighten text-heavy pages with color -- until now  
reserved only for the magazine's cover -- as well as more and larger 
illustrations and photos. Cover art will be brighter and the 
magazine's title will have a new, bolder typeface, Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say that we made a concession to a more visual  
age,'' Lippincott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Republic, which touts itself as a weekly forum for  
iconoclastic, intellectually original opining, has a circulation 
that has long hovered around 100,000, and often loses money, said 
owner Martin Peretz. Recent losses have run as high as $500,000 
annually, but Peretz said he expects to break even this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine has lost a string of top editors in recent years,  
and was forced to apologize to readers last summer after 
discovering that a former associate editor invented all or part of 
27 articles he wrote for the publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the troubles, those at the magazine say The New  
Republic's quality and independent voice separate it from the 
shrill, superficial analysis offered in other quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't make it easy,'' Peretz said. ``These are articles  
that furrow the brow. You puzzle over them. ... There isn't a lot 
that's obvious in The New Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the editor of The Nation, a liberal weekly competitor, said  
The New Republic's long-running drift toward the political center 
might make it harder to appeal to readers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nation ``meets needs that aren't being answered in the  
mainstream press,'' said Katrina Vanden Heuvel. ``The New Republic 
is trying to compete more with the newsweeklies by virtue of this 
redesign -- Time, Newsweek -- and I worry that it might lose its 
mandate as a publication of ideas. ... I think the magazine today 
is unclear about what its role is.''

<HEADLINE> Two Inducted Into Golf Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) -- The World Golf Hall of Fame made room  
Monday for a little girl who couldn't live without golf and a 
dashing Spaniard who gave golf life. 
</P>
<P>
	Seve Ballesteros and Amy Alcott, who each started with nothing  
more than a sawed-down club and big dreams, were inducted into the 
hall along with the late Lloyd Mangrum, a World War II veteran and 
U.S. Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who was going to tell me that a little boy who started as a  
caddie in Pedrena, a small village in Spain, would be here today,'' 
said Ballesteros, the winner of five major championships and nearly 
80 tournaments around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 members of the Hall of Fame looking on under a blazing  
sun, the induction of Ballesteros, Alcott and Mangrum brought the 
number to 76 of those enshrined at the World Golf Village. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little numb,'' Alcott said. ``I look down that list and  
I've taken my place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros was elected last year on the international ballot  
but deferred his induction until Monday. Alcott, whose 29 victories 
include five major championships, became eligible in February when 
the LPGA changed its criteria. Mangrum was elected on the PGA Tour 
ballot in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf gave a little girl the life she imagined sitting in front  
of a television,'' Alcott said. ``I was mesmerized by the rhythm of 
the swing, the sound of the golf ball, the whole dance. It's been a 
great dance, and I hope to keep dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros and Alcott grew up in different worlds and played  
different tours. All that links them is the way they discovered 
golf -- Alcott with a cut-down club she used to tear up her yard in 
Santa Monica, Calif., Ballesteros with a 3-iron that taught him 
shots few others would even dream of hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of imagination,'' Ballesteros said. ``That came  
from learning the game with only one club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Spaniard made a spectacular debut at the 1976  
British Open at Royal Birkdale. Although he lost a third-round lead 
to Johnny Miller, his bump-and-run that threaded two bunkers on the 
closing hole served notice that there would never be a dull moment 
when he was around. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Open three years later at Royal Lytham &AMP; St. Annes,  
making a birdie from a parking lot on the 16th hole in the final 
round. Ballesteros won two more British Opens, along with the 
Masters in 1980 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	He also became the heart and soul of the Ryder Cup, his  
intensity and determination making it the biggest worldwide event 
in golf, and he was idolized by today's young stars in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Arnold Palmer did more in American than I did in  
Europe,'' Ballesteros said. ``I feel very proud to help the people 
back in Europe. I as the one who opened the door for them. And I 
feel very good about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott's impact on women's golf goes beyond the record she  
shares with JoAnne Carner for winning at least once her first 12 
years on tour. She's responsible for victory splash at the Nabisco 
Dinah Shore, which began when she won in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	She took host Dinah Shore into the pond with her in 1991, the  
last time Alcott won on tour. She would have needed one more 
victory to get into the Hall of Fame under the previous 
requirements, which were so difficult that it was regarded the 
toughest shrine in sports to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new points system approved in February, Alcott would  
have qualified 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mangrum won most of his 36 victories after an Army career that  
took him to Omaha Beach on D-Day and earned him two Purple Hearts. 
He won the 1946 U.S. Open, was a member of five Ryder Cup teams and 
won the Vardon Trophy twice. 
</P>
<P>
	He was represented by his stepson and was introduced by Byron  
Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great golfer who was somewhat forgotten,'' Nelson  
said. ``He was a tough competitor and an excellent putter. Any time 
you beat him, you could know you were playing well.''

<HEADLINE> Candidate Alexander Targets Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Lamar Alexander  
joined the ribbing of Al Gore today by pointing out that the vice 
president, who has claimed credit for the Internet, isn't the only 
inventive Tennesseean. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is true that I, Lamar Alexander, invented plaid,''  
Alexander told the Atlanta Rotary Club, prompting laughter. ``I 
created, myself, the fabric that makes our nation great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, a former Tennessee governor who also ran for  
president in 1996, was often seen that year in folksy television 
commercials wearing plaid shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was widely lampooned by Republicans last week after he  
claimed to have invented the Internet. His comment prompted Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to claim credit for the paper 
clip.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Actions at a Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to let an Indiana school district require all high  
school students suspended for disciplinary reasons to undergo drug 
testing before they are reinstated. A lower court ruled the policy 
violated students' privacy rights, saying that drug testing in such 
cases must be restricted to students individually suspected of 
using drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowed Charlottesville, Va., to enforce a teen curfew  
generally requiring children under age 17 to stay off the streets 
from midnight to 5 a.m. weekdays and 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. on Saturdays 
and Sundays. A lower court upheld the curfew as a valid tactic 
aimed at reducing juvenile violence and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected a challenge to the federal Violence Against Women Act  
filed by the first woman convicted under the law. Rita Gluzman of 
New Jersey was sentenced to life in prison for her husband's 1996 
murder. She argued that Congress exceeded its power to control 
interstate commerce by making it a crime to cross state lines to 
harm a spouse or intimate partner. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide whether prosecutors violate defendants' rights  
by implying that their presence at trial lets them hear other 
witnesses and tailor their own testimony to fit the evidence. 
Prosecutors in a New York case say such comments to a jury do not 
burden defendants' constitutional right to be present at trial and 
confront the witnesses against them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide whether Hawaii may limit by race the voters  
who elect a nine-member board that oversees a program benefiting 
only residents who are ethnic Hawaiians. A white resident of Hawaii 
says the state law discriminates against him. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled in an Ohio case that states do not violate the  
Constitution when they cancel the right of public university 
professors to negotiate workload rules as part of their union 
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Salmon Gets Little Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- To his Anaheim Angels teammates and manager,  
Tim Salmon is an All-Star despite the fact he's never been selected 
to play in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody came up the other day and asked me if I thought Tim  
Salmon is going to have a breakout season,'' manager Terry Collins 
said, shaking his head. ``I said I didn't realize that guys who 
average 30 homers, more than 100 RBIs and .300 need breakout 
seasons. That pretty much tells you he doesn't get the recognition 
he deserves for the numbers he puts up. He's a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon has a .294 batting average during six full seasons in the  
majors. He hit 30 or more homers and drove in 95 runs or more in 
each of the four years he was injury free. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly underrated,'' said pitcher Tim Belcher, signed  
by the Angels as a free agent during the offseason. ``He has put up 
some big numbers. When you talk about the elite, I don't think he 
should be left out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon became the first Angels player voted AL Rookie of the  
Year in 1993, when he hit .283 with 31 homers and 95 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hampered by a hamstring pull in 1994, ended his season  
with a broken finger on his left hand, then came back to hit .330 
with 34 homers and 105 RBIs in 1995. In 1997, he hit .296 with 33 
homers and 129 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Salmon batted .300, hit 26 homers and drove in 88  
runs despite limping because of a torn ligament in his left foot. 
Used at designated hitter because of the injury, he put off surgery 
until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon is able to accept the fact he's never been an All-Star,  
at least most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only bothers me at All-Star time,'' he said. ``Maybe 360  
days a year, I don't even think about it. But then the week before 
the All-Star game ... I really don't know if there's anything I can 
do about it on the field. I guess it might be different if I played 
in a bigger market; maybe the only way it would happen would either 
be playing on the East Coast or getting into the postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only four Angels position players -- Chili Davis, Gary DiSarcina,  
Jim Edmonds and Darin Erstad -- have been selected to play in the 
All-Star game since Salmon's rookie season, and those four made it 
just once each, 
</P>
<P>
	Collins is impressed by Salmon's dedication, noting the way he  
kept going despite the painful foot injury last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got everything it takes to be a superstar on and off the  
field. He's got a great personality, and he knows what's expected 
of him,'' the manager said. ``When he was hurt, he just went out 
there and dragged it (the foot). In my opinion, that's why he's a 
great player, because he doesn't let anything bother him or stand 
in his way.''

<HEADLINE> Shaffer, Fiala Win at Ski Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Utah (AP) -- Jakub Fiala had the luck of the draw.  
Alex Shaffer made all her own luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Both skiers emerged from a busy day at the U.S. National  
Championships on Monday with the first titles of their careers. 
Fiala won the men's super-G at Snowbasin Ski Resort, while Shaffer 
won the women's giant slalom at Park City Mountain Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiala was the fastest skier on a course in miserable shape after  
over a week of unpredictable, unseasonable weather. Rain on Sunday 
further destabilized large sections of the run which had been 
melting for days, and round-the-clock work was largely unable to 
improve the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	As the third skier down the course, however, Fiala was able to  
catch the snow in its best possible shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just lucky to get to go when I did,'' said Fiala, a New  
Mexico native who now lives in Breckenridge, Colo. ``I had probably 
the best opportunity of anybody to get some speed ... and I was 
fortunate to do it. ... It was luck, basically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiala finished in 1:15.51, edging national downhill champion  
Chad Fleischer, who came in at 1:15.80. Pre-race favorite Daron 
Rahlves started after both Fiala and Fleischer, and he slammed his 
helmet to the ground in frustration after finishing his third-place 
run in 1:16.12. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just terrible,'' Rahlves said of the course. ``The  
weather has just made it ridiculous up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The course conditions were less ridiculous in Park City, where  
Shaffer emerged victorious in the first technical event of the 
six-day competitions. Shaffer, whose family moved to Park City from 
Aspen last year, felt right at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't won a race in three years, so I don't know what to  
think,'' she said. ``I'm in outer space right now. It's definitely 
a nice surprise for the end of the season, and it's even better to 
do it at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer was in first place after both runs, and she was able to  
conclude an uneven international season with a win. Her best World 
Cup results have come in slalom, making her a solid favorite for 
Wednesday's championships in the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely not a monotone person. I need ups and downs to  
get me focused,'' she said. ``Without that I'm lost. Some people 
don't know how to deal with it, (but) I need some high stress 
points to keep me moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even more of a surprise than Shaffer's win was the very  
presence of the skier who finished second. Sarah Schleper, who was 
in the midst of a breakout year on the World Cup circuit when she 
wrecked her knee in France in December, skied her first race since 
the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Friday, she hadn't expected to compete at the  
national championships. But she received clearance from the team's 
medical staff and nearly landed her second straight national GS 
title. She won the event last year in Jackson Hole, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to win, but I'll settle for second place,'' Schleper  
said. ``I'm glad I was able to get back so soon, and I'm looking 
forward to the slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She spent much of the 10 weeks since her injury training and  
rehabilitating on her own. Her time of 2:05.60 was behind Shaffer's 
winning 2:05.21. 
</P>
<P>
	In the freestyle aerials competition at Park City's Utah Winter  
Sports Park, Olympic champion Nikki Stone concluded her career with 
a disappointing fourth-place finish after having trouble on her 
final landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully people will associate me with some of the things  
I've been able to do for the sport,'' said Stone, who won gold in 
the event at the Nagano Olympics. ``It's hard to leave, but it was 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The titles went to U.S. team rookie Marissa Berman and Park City  
resident Joe Pack, both of whom won their first national crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're skiing in competition, all you want to do is land  
on your feet, and I was able to do that today,'' Pack said. ``It's 
nice to be the local kid on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the women will attempt to run their once-postponed  
super-G on the same course which gave the men fits on Monday. The 
men's team will compete in the giant slalom in Park City.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Refugees Seek Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIANAK, Indonesia (AP) -- Sleeping on palm mats in a sports  
stadium, more than 2,000 people left homeless by fighting took 
refuge here today from violence in Borneo that has left more than 
100 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Madurese refugees said they were too frightened to  
return to their villages after the brutal assaults, in which 
fighters from other ethnic groups paraded at times with severed 
heads and other grisly tokens from the slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so scared by the attacks on our people, and I lost my  
husband in the chaos,'' said Ni'mah, 35, a mother of four children, 
including a son she gave birth to during the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding her 2-day-old boy, Ni'mah said she last saw her husband,  
Mahari, moments before troops evacuated her from their village, 
Seungian. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she hadn't even been able to give her new son a name  
since fleeing their home and losing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 15,000 Madurese have fled their villages in cars,  
boats or military trucks. Some 2,200 of them took refuge in 
Pontianak sports stadium along with some 5,000 others elsewhere in 
the city, located on Borneo's western coast, 385 miles northeast of 
Jakarta, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic violence has consumed the coastal region of Borneo, a  
large island shared by both Indonesia and Malaysia, since armed 
gangs of ethnic Malay, Dayak and Bugis men set upon the Madurese 
immigrants from the island of Madura early last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports on the death toll have differed. A top police source in  
Tabas district, one of the hardest-hit areas, said in an interview 
that 165 people have been killed, 90 percent of them Madurese. He 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian media gave other death tolls: Kompas newspaper  
said 110 people have died. The ruling party newspaper, Suara Karya, 
put the death toll at 104. And the evening daily Berita Buana said 
more than 200 have died and about 23,000 have been left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very difficult to get an exact death toll because so  
many of the bodies have been dismembered,'' Taslim, an official in 
Singkawang town, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the Indonesian military has stayed clear of  
the fighting raging close to the Malaysian border, about 100 miles 
north of Pontianak. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the violence in Sambas town and surrounding  
villages, hundreds of euphoric warriors -- some wearing shirts 
stained with victims' blood -- looted and burned abandoned homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A chunk of flesh dangled by a string from the spear of one  
fighter and a few men carried pieces of scalp. At street 
intersections, cheering crowds assembled to view the severed heads 
of Madurese men. 
</P>
<P>
	Old customs of tribal warfare that were thriving when British  
and Dutch colonists ventured into the Borneo interior centuries ago 
were being played out in gruesome shows of public rejoicing.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Lawyer Claims Juror Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge today refused to  
dismiss a juror whose impartiality had been questioned by attorneys 
for Whitewater figure Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's trial was put on hold so District Judge George  
Howard Jr. could consider the defense's motion to remove juror 
Charles Adams from the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the judge's chambers, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos,  
played a scratchy audiotape that he said was recorded off her 
father's answering machine. On it, Geragos said, a local jail 
chaplain claimed that a friend of hers had heard from a friend of 
his that one of the jurors was biased against Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is triple hearsay!'' complained Whitewater assistant  
prosecutor Mark Barrett. ``There is no indication of any taint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Geragos, Adams expressed disdain for President  
Clinton and for Mrs. McDougal, a partner of Clinton in the 
Whitewater land development. 
</P>
<P>
	In questioning for jury selection, Adams said he had not formed  
an opinion of Mrs. McDougal. His sister, Evelyn Gentry, told the 
court that Adams had a negative opinion of Clinton, but had not 
indicated an opinion of Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard refused to question Adams, however, and directed Geragos  
to file a formal motion if he wanted to pursue his complaint. ``I'm 
not about to let the system be manipulated,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, one of the alternate jurors was dismissed because of  
ties between her family and the prosecution and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's jury trial on charges of criminal contempt and  
obstruction of justice entered its third week Monday. Her refusal 
to answer questions in front of a federal grand jury about Clinton 
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton led to criminal charges 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos said Monday that he will probably call three witnesses  
before Mrs. McDougal takes the stand. He said he may ask her the 
same questions she refused to answer for the grand jury Sept. 4, 
1996, and April 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has said she refused to answer the questions  
because she believed Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr would 
twist her words if she didn't say what he wanted to hear.

<HEADLINE> Academic Bill of Rights Is Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minority children, who often attend poor or  
struggling schools, could suffer under new efforts to make schools 
more accountable for their students' performance, some civil rights 
leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's education proposals, which include tying a  
child's promotion or graduation to rigorous testing, should include 
plans to fix city schools and provide better teachers there, said 
Hugh B. Price, National Urban League president. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights organization has called for an academic bill of  
rights that would require school districts to prove they are giving 
minority children an equal education before adopting such 
test-based promotion plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accountability begins with quality,'' Price said. ``Few urban  
districts can claim that the key ingredients are available to all 
students, especially low-income minority pupils.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for minority children have long complained that  
high-stakes testing and other changes rarely address the real needs 
of children: more qualified teachers, better equipped classrooms, 
stronger courses and more money in general. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department's proposals to change federal law will  
require states to increase such resources in tandem with ending 
social promotion, said Judith Johnson, the assistant secretary who 
oversees kindergarten-through-12th grade programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The accountability plans, to be released in April, will include  
federal money and support to target poor and minority areas, she 
said 
</P>
<P>
	Some states, such as Texas and Ohio, have resisted the idea of  
excluding minority children from tests, arguing that all students 
should be held to the same higher standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show schools with high minority enrollments are more  
likely to have less-experienced teachers and older equipment, as 
well as lower test scores. Many, especially black children, are 
also more likely than white children to have low birth weights, 
poor health care and come from impoverished families, all factors 
that usually hinder learning ability. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis City Schools Superintendent Gerry House says the  
district, which is 85 percent minority, holds all children to the 
same standards, but also recognizes that many children don't have 
computers at home or parents who read to them, so it set up 
after-school programs to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not literally or figuratively fail our children  
because it's easier than recognizing our own failures,'' said 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	New standards should aim to rid poor schools of low-level  
courses and programs, said Vinetta C. Jones of the College Board, 
who noted that many high-school math courses in schools with poorer 
students don't emphasize algebra or calculus. 
</P>
<P>
	Budgets and grants computed from lower property taxes and census  
undercounts mean less money for poor communities, said Wade 
Henderson, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a 
civil rights law watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to compensate for years of deprivation,'' said  
Henderson.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Human Rights Unit Faults U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- As the U.N. Human Rights Commission opened its  
annual session Monday, Amnesty International departed from its 
traditional criticism of China and instead denounced police 
brutality and executions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human rights violations in the United States of America are  
persistent, widespread and appear to disproportionately affect 
people of racial or ethnic minority backgrounds,'' Amnesty's 
Secretary-General Pierre Sane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation leader, Nancy Rubin, disagreed, saying the  
United States was ``proud of our political and judicial system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-nation commission is the world's top human rights  
watchdog, even though much of its debate is politicized. Many 
foreign dignitaries are due to speak, as are dozens of 
non-governmental groups, during the six-week session. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Anderson of Ireland was elected president of this year's  
session, which is being held amid tight security for fear of 
violent demonstrations by Kurds over Turkey's detention of their 
leader, Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the United States, Sane said Amnesty wanted to  
focus the U.N. commission's attention on abuses in Turkey, Algeria, 
Cambodia, and the African Great Lakes area of Rwanda, Burundi and 
Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We meet today at the end of a century which has witnessed  
brutality on a scale without historical precedent,'' said Mary 
Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protection and prevention must define the commission's work in  
the years to come,'' the former Irish president said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the meeting, violations in countries such as Iraq, Sudan,  
Myanmar and the Yugoslav province of Kosovo will also come under 
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International has traditionally mounted a high-profile  
campaign against China before the commission. Not so this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And European Union foreign ministers decided Monday not to push  
for formal condemnation of China for human rights abuses. However, 
even without a formal censure motion, the EU said it would use this 
year's meeting to ``express its growing concerns on the human 
rights situation in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty would risk its credibility if it stayed silent about the  
United States, where despite the international trend toward 
abolishing capital punishment, more than 350 prisoners had been 
executed since 1990 with another 3,500 on death row, Sane said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said increasing numbers of asylum-seekers were being detained  
alongside common criminals and that female prisoners were victims 
of rape and abuse from male guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Police brutality is systematic and widespread from coast to  
coast,'' said Sane. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation hit back at the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``We disagree strongly that civil and human rights violations in  
the United States are persistent, widespread or indeed the 
implication that they go unpunished,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proud of our political and judicial system. We have  
appropriate mechanisms in place to address shortcomings and are 
continually taking action against abuses wherever they occur.''

<HEADLINE> Wu-Tang Clan Rapper Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trouble-prone rapper ODB was arrested Monday  
after police allegedly found three small containers of crack 
cocaine on him during a traffic stop in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wu-Tang Clan rapper, whose real name is Russell Jones, was  
stopped by officers who saw a 1996 Range Rover without license 
plates, double-parked. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver did not have a license or registration, police said.  
When Jones, 30, gave his name, a record check revealed he had a 
suspended license and was wanted for failure to pay child support -- 
leading to a search that turned up the drugs, Lt. Dennis Cirillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was in custody awaiting arraignment on misdemeanor drug  
charges. His attorney, Peter Frankell, did not immediately return 
calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Brooklyn grand jury decided Jones would not face  
attempted murder charges stemming from an encounter with officers 
who stopped Jones' car for allegedly not having its lights on. The 
officers said that when they approached the driver's window two 
shots were fired, and they shot back. No gun was found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted of second-degree assault in New York in  
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested last month in Los Angeles when he parked in a  
no-parking zone and police found he was wearing a bulletproof vest. 
He has pleaded innocent to violating a law banning felons from 
wearing body armor. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to facing shoplifting charges in Virginia, he is  
accused in Los Angeles of threatening to kill the mother of his 
1-year-old child and making death threats to guards at a nightclub.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Stay Extra 60 Days in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mike Tyson won't be leaving a Maryland jail  
for at least another month. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a judge might reduce the former heavyweight champion's  
one-year sentence for assault in Maryland to time already served, 
Tyson then would would have to begin serving 60 days for violating 
terms of his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, even if the Maryland sentence is modified,  
he will not be released from jail on Friday,'' spokeswoman Beverly 
Phillips of the Marion County prosecutor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has been jailed in Maryland since Feb. 5 on charges he  
assaulted two motorists after a minor traffic accident in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has requested that his assault sentence be reduced to  
eight months, and a hearing is set for Friday at Montgomery County 
(Md.) District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Greenberg, one of Tyson's two lawyers in the Maryland  
case, had said last week that such a reduction could free his 
client from jail by Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County prosecutor Scott Newman, Tyson lawyer James Voyles  
and Marion Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford conferred Monday 
in Indianapolis and also talked to Maryland authorities. They 
agreed the boxer still must serve the extra time for his probation 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the judge modifies his sentence, at that point his Indiana  
sentence will begin,'' Phillips said. ``There's no retroactive in 
any of these calculations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Indiana sentence begins, Tyson could serve as little as  
30 days, depending on time off for good behavior and other 
provisions, she said. That means Tyson could leave jail by April 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	``The integrity of both the Indiana and the Maryland sentences  
will be honored,'' Voyles said. He declined to speculate on how the 
court hearing Friday will turn out or when Tyson may leave jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Tyson struck a deal with Newman and Maryland  
authorities in which he agreed to serve his Indiana jail time in 
Maryland after he completes his assault sentence.

<HEADLINE> Jug Wine Sales Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jug wine shipments from California wineries  
were down in 1998, but a boom in premium varietals more than made 
up for it, the Wine Institute reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Total sales of California wines in the United States and abroad  
was about 437 million gallons in 1998, a 3 percent increase over 
the previous year. Most of that wine was purchased in the United 
States -- 338 million gallons -- giving California wines 73 percent 
of the domestic market, institute figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated retail value of the state's wine shipments  
domestically was $12 billion, up 5 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Premium California table wine shipments to the United States  
were up 8 percent last year, to 75.1 million cases. Jug wines, 
meanwhile, fell 3 percent, to 67.8 million cases over the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``American consumers are moving upscale to high-end varietal  
wines, shifting their preferences away from many white and blush 
jug wines, which declined in food stores last year,'' said industry 
analyst Jon Fredrikson of Gomberg, Fredrikson &AMP; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	California wines most in demand were aged reds and wines in  
limited production. Wines priced at $7 and up was the 
fastest-growing segment, up 14 percent. While those pricier wines 
represented only 19 percent of the state's wine gallonage, they

	Total 1998 wine sales in the United States from all sources was

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Fall in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Consumer prices in recession-mired Hong Kong  
fell for a fourth consecutive month in February, the government 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory's Consumer Price Index fell 1.7 percent compared  
with February 1998, following year-on-year drops of 1.1 percent in 
January and 1.6 percent in December, a statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The past four months are the first time Hong Kong has  
experienced deflation since the government began keeping such price 
statistics in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Hong Kong people paid less money for  
clothing, shoes, durable goods, food and housing last month. 
Clothing prices fell by a staggering 18.5 percent. Prices were 
higher for alcohol, tobacco, transportation, fuel and light. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail discounts accounted for the sharper fall in prices in the  
period, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The falling prices are not good news for the territory which is  
mired in its worst recession in years. Unemployment is also at a 
record high 6.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally higher  
Monday, with the key index in Hong Kong rising for the second 
consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 24.32 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 
11,107.24. On Friday, the index had surged 423.60 points, or 4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnover fell to 4.90 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $628  
million), down from Friday's 6.79 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
$870 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hang Seng Index rose on continued selective  
buying of blue-chip stocks following Friday's sharp rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was relatively quiet because of a market holiday in  
Japan on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Hong Kong investors have been using the Tokyo's Nikkei  
Stock Average as a major trading indicator. The Hong Kong market 
rose sharply on Friday in reaction to strong gains in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Singapore closed mostly higher, driven by gains  
in property and finance stocks. The Straits Times Index closed 
24.69 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,497.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan share prices also closed higher, with the key index  
breaching the psychologically important 7,000-point mark following 
a late rally in chip stocks and encouraging trade data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 49.85  
points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,043.23. The index hasn't settled above 
7,000 points since Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to accumulate shares in semiconductor  
companies Monday as the industry shows signs of recovery, dealers 
said. The gains in the market were also helped by news during the 
session showing Taiwan's economy may be on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs reported Monday that  
export orders for the first two months of this year rose 2.12 
percent from a year ago, to U.S. $18.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers  
saying the local market was quiet due to a lack of any real 
direction. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 8.50 points, or 
0.3 percent, to 2,144.45. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher. The 30-company  
Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) rose 12.03 points, or 
0.6 percent, to 2,018.49.

	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly higher. The All  
Ordinaries Index rose 1.00 point to 2,985.5.

trading, with investors expecting more bad news from companies 
announcing their earnings within the next few weeks. The Composite 
Index fell 6.3 points, or 1.2 percent, to 507.55. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower on profit-taking. The  
Composite Index fell 1.934 points, or 0.49 percent, to 392.283. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Begins Search for Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame officials interviewed  
Princeton's Bill Carmody on Monday for their vacant head coaching 
position and plan to meet with Xavier's Skip Prosser soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton sports information director Jerry Price said Notre  
Dame contacted the school last week for permission to meet with 
Carmody and was scheduled to meet with him Monday afternoon in New 
York. He said he didn't know any details of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Carmody is 73-14 in his three seasons as Princeton's head coach  
after serving as an assistant there for 14 years. He took the 
Tigers to the NCAA Tournament in his first two seasons and lost to 
Xavier in the NIT quarterfinals this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame officials wouldn't say Monday whether athletic  
director Mike Wadsworth was in New York interviewing candidates. 
Still, the South Bend Tribune reached him at a Manhattan hotel 
Sunday night, though he declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably 15 million other people here, including some  
other basketball coaches, so draw any inference you like,'' he told 
the Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth's trip to New York coincided with the appearances  
there of several other coaches believed to be on Notre Dame's short 
list, including Prosser and Utah's Rick Majerus, who many believe 
to be the frontrunner for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosser is in New York this week to prepare his team for the NIT  
Final Four. Contacted by The Associated Press last week, he 
declined to say if he had talked to Notre Dame, saying it was a 
private matter between him, his players, his family and Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
	But Xavier athletic director Mike Bobinski said Monday that  
Notre Dame has asked the school for permission to interview 
Prosser, though he did not know when they would meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when, where or how, but they said they were in  
the process of meeting some people and Skip was on their list and 
that it was somewhat in the preliminary stages of their process,'' 
said Bobinski, a Notre Dame alum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobinski said Prosser has asked in the past that interviews for  
coaching opportunities wait until the season is over, and he 
assumed that would happen with Notre Dame. That means Irish 
officials will have to wait until Friday at the earliest for a 
meeting with Prosser. Xavier faces Clemson in the NIT semifinals 
Tuesday and will play Thursday in either the championship or 
consolation contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus worked as a college basketball analyst for CBS in New  
York over the weekend, and on Saturday he repeated on the air that 
he is 99 percent sure he will coach at Utah next season. He has 
said several times that Notre Dame is his ``1 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware's Mike Brey, believed to be the fourth candidate on  
Notre Dame's short list, declined to comment Monday on whether he's 
been contacted about the opening, as did athletic director Edgar 
Johnson. Johnson would only say he's happy Brey has been successful 
enough with the Blue Hens to attract the attention of other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth has declined to discuss the coaching search publicly  
since John MacLeod resigned under pressure March 9. At the time, he 
said he hoped to have a list of candidates in place by last Friday 
and be able to name a coach by April 7, the signing date for high 
school recruits.

<HEADLINE> Senators Demand Pressure on Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators representing both parties demanded  
Monday that Vice President Al Gore press Russia's prime minister in 
meetings this week to stop his country's cooperation with Iran on 
missiles and nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter, the 34 senators said Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov must be convinced that ``an Iran armed with nuclear 
weapons and advanced ballistic missiles is no more in Russia's 
interests than in our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to urge you to make Iranian acquisitions of Russian  
ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology an issue of the 
highest priority in these talks,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Initiated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the letter was  
signed by 20 Democrats and 14 Republicans, including Foreign 
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov arrives Tuesday, with meetings set to begin Wednesday.  
Anti-Russian demands on the vice president by one-third of the 
Senate's membership adds another edge to a visit already made tense 
by Russia's opposition to possible military action against 
Yugoslavia by NATO to force a political settlement in violence-torn 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov's visit was planned largely to win favor for a $4  
billion Russian loan request from the International Monetary Fund. 
Developments in Kosovo have intervened, and now Iran, which already 
was on the agenda, will take on new importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to show the broad support this issue has in the  
Senate,'' said Howard Gantman, spokesman for Ms. Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Russia's atomic energy minister, Yevgeny Adamov,  
offered to stop cooperation with Iran if sanctions were lifted from 
leading Russian nuclear research institutes. The State Department 
welcomed the offer but said cooperation should be stopped first. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring pressure from the United States, Russia has sold  
nuclear and missile technology partly because of the hard currency 
it brings to the suffering Russian economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Clinton administration barred 10 Russian  
research centers from any work in the United States as punishment 
for providing Iran technology that could help development of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	It is those sanctions the Russians want lifted.  
</P>
<P>
	Monday's letter noted that both Congress and the administration  
have acted against the Russian-Iranian connection, but it said 
``the leakage of Russian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons 
technology ... has not abated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that the Russian government's efforts to stanch  
the flow of this dangerous technology to Iran have been decidedly 
lackluster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By acquiring such technology, the senators wrote, ``Iran would  
be in a far stronger position to dominate the Persian Gulf region, 
and it would pose an immediate threat to U.S. forces in the gulf, 
to our allies throughout the Middle East and even to some locations 
in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said Russia was likely to seek the right to launch  
more U.S. satellites, a major source of hard currency. It said Gore 
should tell Primakov that an increase would not be considered 
without ``a sustained comprehensive effort by the Russian 
government to shut off the flow'' of dangerous technology to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Primakov will meet Wednesday with leading U.S.  
financial and economic figures, then co-chair the U.S.-Russian 
Joint Commission on Economic and Technical Cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Hang On, Make Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ohio State guard Michael Redd had the  
Final Four hat, the Final Four shirt, a piece of the net, a big 
grin on his face and a question to ask. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said when we came here we'd had a great season but it had  
to end here,'' he said, wandering the court long after the fans had 
left the Buckeyes' 77-74 South Regional championship victory over 
St. John's. ``I wonder what they're going to say now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a minimum, they'll say Ohio State is in the Final Four for  
the first time since 1968. And that the Buckeyes have outrun the 
memory of last year's 8-22 season, and fled all the losing that 
preceded it -- 72 games in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll say that Ohio State isn't exactly a longshot in St.  
Petersburg, Fla. They're a fourth seed. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of them will say unprintable things when they look at  
their office pool brackets with scratches through the Final Four 
slot reserved for the South champion, crossed-out names like Auburn 
or Maryland or St. John's or Syracuse or Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	And if they watched Saturday's regional final against St.  
John's, they'll say the Buckeyes deserve to be there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State used 38 minutes of excellent play to survive two  
minutes of white-knuckled terror to send a good St. John's team 
home. They'll take on another Big East team, Connecticut, the No. 1 
seed from the West Regional, in the first round of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes once again rode outstanding play from their guards,  
Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn was named the Most Outstanding Player of the regional after  
a 22-point, eight-rebound, five-assist performance Saturday against 
the Red Storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Redd carried the load in the first half with 17 of his 20  
points, including a 3-pointer at the halftime buzzer that was 
classic stuff: top of the key, clock ticking down, back and forth 
between his legs in a hushed gym, letting fly like he was playing 
HORSE in the back yard for a 41-33 lead at the break. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really amazing,'' said St. John's coach Mike Jarvis.  
``I've watched the great teams play and they always seem to be the 
ones that close the end of a half. ... I'll be seeing those two 
guys in my sleep for the next couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes were Ken Johnson's 12 points and seven blocks, two  
on the opening possession of the game that told the Red Storm to 
come inside with a purpose if they dared come at all. 
</P>
<P>
	They were Jason Singleton cutting behind the zone St. John's was  
forced to use in the second half to control Redd, taking a 25-foot 
bullet from Penn on the way to 13 points, making 6-of-7 shots from 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes shot 55 percent and won despite getting  
out-rebounded 45-28. 
</P>
<P>
	They were shaky at the end when St. John's ``refused to go  
nicely,'' in the words of coach Jim O'Brien. The Buckeyes led 73-64 
on Singleton's bucket with 2:47 left, but turned it over on three 
straight possessions and missed the front of two one-and-ones as 
the Johnnies crept closer. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's trailed 76-74 and had the ball when point guard Erick  
Barkley committed his only turnover of the game, dribbling the ball 
off his leg into Redd's waiting hands with six or seven seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Redd ended it with a free throw. The Buckeyes go to St.  
Petersburg at 27-8. That's 19 games better than they were a year 
ago. They took out the No. 1 seed and the No. 3 seed in the 
regional. Their backcourt is about as good as you'll see. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes are in the Final Four.  
</P>
<P>
	What do you say now?

<HEADLINE> Vivendi Buying U.S. Filter Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- Vivendi SA is buying U.S. Filter  
Corp. for about $6.2 billion in cash, enabling the French 
conglomerate to get a stronger foothold in the U.S. water market. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction announced today would be the largest French  
acquisition ever made in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would have more than $12 billion in annual  
revenue and the deal would nearly double revenues of Vivendi's 
water treatment business, Generale des Eaux, based in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal approved by boards of both companies, Vivendi  
would pay $31.50 per share of U.S. Filter common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to regulatory approval in the United States  
and Europe. U.S. Filter would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Vivendi. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we recognize is that we share a vision of a full-service,  
global water enterprise,'' said Jean-Marie Messier, chairman of 
Vivendi. ``The world's population is continuing to grow. Industry 
is demanding ever-higher standards of processed water for 
manufacturing and the demand for quality wastewater treatment to 
protect the environment has never been greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Filter Chairman Richard J. Heckmann will serve on the board  
of directors for Generale des Eaux and become a member of the 
Vivendi water group executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Generale des Eaux provides water treatment services to more than  
25 million people and wastewater treatment services for 16 million 
residents. Worldwide, the Vivendi subsidiary provides services to 
65 million people on every continent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its water treatment business, Vivendi owns 34  
percent to French pay-TV operator Canal Plus and has interests in 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Filter purchased Culligan Water Technologies in February  
1998 for about $1.5 billion in stock. In 1997, U.S. Filter made 
numerous acquisitions, most notably purchasing Memtec Ltd., an 
Australian maker of water filters, for about $399 million in stock.

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Spurred by Win Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs are winning again. More  
important, they're winning on the road and have reason to believe 
they can capture their division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving up the ladder a bit because we were pretty far  
down the ladder for a while,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were 6-8 in February, then regrouped to win 10 of 11 games  
in March, with seven victories in the streak coming on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, midway through this shortened NBA season, San Antonio is  
16-9, three games behind Utah in the Midwest Division. The Spurs 
and Houston Rockets were tied for second entering Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been able to gain some ground on Utah,'' point guard  
Avery Johnson said. ``This is another week where we can't have any 
slipups because you don't when Utah is going to lose again. And we 
don't play them until the end of April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs could be humming by then. They play seven of their  
next eight games at home, beginning Tuesday night against Denver. 
So far, San Antonio has played just 10 games in the Alamodome, 
tying Sacramento for the fewest home games in the conference. The 
Spurs are 7-3 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must try to continue to establish some home-court advantage  
at the dome this year going into the playoffs,'' Johnson said. 
``We've got to get some confidence in our own building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio is getting a boost from the schedule now. In  
February, the Spurs played Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers and Seattle 
twice and Minnesota three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent winning streak included victories over Dallas,  
Denver, Sacramento, Golden State and Vancouver -- all teams with 
losing records. On Friday, San Antonio lost to Portland, which is 
tied with Utah for the lead in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A concern for the Spurs has been David Robinson. The 33-year-old  
center is averaging 14.4 points a game, down from 21.6 points last 
year. He's scored only 21 points in the last three games combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich benched Robinson in the final minutes of the fourth  
quarter in two road games last week, choosing to go with Malik 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said after practice Monday it hurts him not to be  
playing with the game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'd be an understatement,'' he said. ``Sitting on the side  
you have no power to help at all. It's like being a fan over there. 
When I'm in there at least I feel like I can make things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson has seen second-year star Tim Duncan, a fellow  
7-footer, become the team's leading scorer with an average of 21.6 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he is trying to improve his shot. He's encouraged  
by a key jumper he made in overtime Saturday in a victory at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, I've got to get going and make some shots,''  
Robinson said. ``We've still got a lot of things to do. I know I'm 
going to be a big key to that. So if I can get my shot rolling, get 
some things happening, I think it's really going to make us more 
solid.''

<HEADLINE> Weiss Gets First Quadruple Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- This is just what Michael Weiss needed  
going into the World Figure Skating Championships -- his first clean 
quadruple jump in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to get that monkey off my back,'' said Weiss, who  
leads an American men 's contingent that looks stronger than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's usual strength in the pairs also came under challenge  
Monday, as China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo were close behind world 
champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze in the short 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	American pairs were weak: the highest placement was Kyoko Ina  
and John Zimmerman in eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	As impressive as the quad was as a personal mark for Weiss, its  
drama was upstaged by fellow American Tim Goebel, who hit the first 
quad salchow ever accomplished in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel had previously landed the jump at the Goodwill Games and  
the junior Grand Prix finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Registering it at the world championships raises a challenge to  
others. The salchow is more difficult than the quad toe loops 
because the skater does not use the toe pick to boost his launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other skaters also managed quads, which just three years  
ago were very rare: China's Guo Zhengxin, Anthony Liu of Australia, 
Russia's Yevgeny Plushenko and Canada's Elvis Stojko, who still 
seemed troubled by a year-old groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	But amid the cavalcade of quads, one of the top performances of  
the day came from a man who didn't even try one, Alexei Yagudin of 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin placed at the top of one of the two qualifying groups by  
concentrating on executing lesser jumps with great precision, 
although he did hit one triple-triple combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he'd done a quad and a quad-triple in practice the day  
before, Yagudin said he didn't want to take risks in the qualifier, 
partly because he was nursing a sore calf and partly because he 
dislikes the new regime under which the qualifying round counts for 
20 percent of the final score. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided not to skate the full routine two times,'' he said.  
``This is too stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Plushenko at the top of one qualifying group, Yagudin at  
the other and Alexei Urmanov just behind Yagudin, the Russians go 
into the final rounds in a strong position. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have speculated the Russian troika would sweep the medals,  
but Yagudin predicted Russians would take no more than two and that 
Weiss was likely to be the spoiler. Weiss was second behind 
Plushenko in his group, followed by Stojko. Takeshi Honda of Japan 
was third in the other group behind Yagudin and Urmanov. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pairs short program, Berezhnaya streaked a remarkably  
long distance through the air in a throw triple and the performance 
was marred only by side-by-side spins that were a bit out of synch. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a showing that reaffirmed Sikhuralidze's belief that  
Russians and figure-skating have a special relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, the Russian personality, the Russian mind, is really  
close to figure-skating, because in Russia we have nice ballet, 
nice theater,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shen and Zhao drew gasps of both delight and dismay -- the former  
coming with a lovely delayed double twist in which Shen seemed to 
hang in suspended animation, the latter when she put her hands to 
the ice coming out of a throw triple loop. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's Dorota Zagorska and Mariuz Siudek were in third place  
at the end of the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Current U.S. champions Danielle and Steve Hartsell, plagued by  
falls, ended in 13th place.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Begin Settlement Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. expects to begin negotiations  
with the government soon in an effort to settle its landmark 
antitrust case, but the sides remain far apart on core issues after 
almost five months of an acrimonious courtroom fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The company indicated anew Monday that it would consider  
changing some of its most controversial agreements with the 
nation's computer makers and Internet providers. But the software 
giant won't accept government-demanded restrictions on what new 
features it can add to its Windows operating system software, which 
runs roughly 90 percent of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	No negotiations have been scheduled, people close to the case  
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft believes it has established a strong legal record on  
the key issues, but also thinks settling the case would be good for 
everyone, including the industry and consumers, said a company 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The company considers itself under orders from the judge to  
explore a settlement. When the trial broke last month for a 
six-week recess, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson 
privately urged lawyers for both sides to use their time wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is expected to resume no earlier than April 12.  
</P>
<P>
	The government has not received any settlement proposal from  
Microsoft, said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of 
the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department has always been and remains open to a  
settlement that fully protects consumers and assures that similar 
antitrust violations do not occur in the future,'' Klein said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort to reach a compromise last May broke down, and  
Microsoft already has started to formulate plans to appeal a trial 
verdict. Jackson probably will rule this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very tough negotiators and will not give unless they  
think they have to give,'' predicted Marc Schildkraut, a Washington 
lawyer who negotiated with Microsoft during an antitrust 
investigation when he worked at the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft wields its considerable  
influence to force other companies into restrictive agreements to 
exclude potential competitors. These contracts, for example, limit 
the ways computer-makers can modify the Windows software sold with 
their computers. Others limit ways Internet companies can promote 
or distribute rival browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft official indicated again Monday that it is willing  
to change some ways it does business with other technology 
companies, including computer manufacturers and Internet providers, 
to address the government's concerns about its contract language. 
At the same time, the official said that any settlement must 
preserve the company's ability to innovate and add new features to 
its products. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also charges that Microsoft uses its market  
dominance to maintain what it describes as monopoly power and to 
extend its influence into emerging areas of technology. For 
example, the company established the popularity of its own Internet 
browser software after bundling it with newer versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Microsoft introduced a new version of its  
Internet software that lets customers listen to digital radio 
broadcasts while browsing the Web, similar to rival technology 
already offered by Seattle-based RealNetworks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial hasn't hurt Microsoft's stock. Since the government  
filed its antitrust lawsuit last May, the price has more than 
doubled in value. 
</P>
<P>
	The key players for any talks will be in Washington this week.  
Attorneys general for the 19 states suing Microsoft with Justice 
expect to be here for a previously scheduled conference. Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates also is visiting on a book tour, although he 
isn't planning to meet with government lawyers.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Is a Big Betting Favorite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- This city's oddsmakers aren't taking any  
chances with Duke's chances of winning a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils are such a prohibitive favorite in Las Vegas  
sports books that bettors would have to wager $7 for every dollar 
they could win on Duke winning its last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Odds vary at each sports book, but most have had to make Duke  
such a big favorite to try to discourage bets on the Blue Devils 
and get some money bet on the other three teams in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the biggest favorites we've ever had,'' said  
Pete Korner, who helps set odds for sports books at Las Vegas 
Sports Consultants. ``We're just trying to get some money on the 
other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korner opened Duke at a 1-3 favorite, but most sports books went  
well beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Las Vegas Hilton, bettors wanting to put money on Duke on  
Monday found the Blue Devils a 1-7 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not getting that many bets on Duke now,'' book manager  
Chuck Esposito said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Duke the heavy favorite, bettors can get 9-2 on Connecticut  
winning the title, 10-1 on Michigan State and 12-1 on Ohio State at 
the Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is such a big favorite because the public wants to see if  
they can keep winning like they have,'' Esposito said. ``They 
really haven't been tested in the second half of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is listed as an 11 1/2-point favorite in Saturday's semifinal  
against Michigan State, while Connecticut is a 5 1/2-point favorite 
over Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA tournament generally is a big betting event at casino  
sports books, second in total volume only to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the tournament began, bettors could wager not only on  
individual games but on which team would win the national 
championship.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Violence Law Appeal Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first woman convicted under the federal  
Violence Against Women Act, sentenced to life in prison in the 1996 
murder of her husband, lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away the New Jersey  
woman's argument that Congress exceeded its power to control 
interstate commerce when in 1994 it made it a crime to cross state 
lines to hurt, harass or intimidate a spouse or intimate partner. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York-based federal appeals court had upheld the law and  
Rita Gluzman's conviction under it. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's denial of review did not mean the Supreme Court agreed  
with the appeals court, and did not preclude the possibility that 
the justices someday might choose another case to judge the federal 
law's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a Richmond-based federal appeals court ruled earlier  
this month that the Violence Against Women Act unconstitutionally 
gives victims of rape and domestic violence the right to sue their 
attackers in federal court. Legal experts expect that Virginia case 
to make its way to the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying both cases was the scope of a 1995 Supreme Court  
decision that struck down as unconstitutional the federal Gun-Free 
School Zones Act. The justices ruled then that the law, making it a 
federal crime to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of any school, was 
insufficiently linked to interstate commerce and usurped states' 
authority over such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress can enact laws under its commerce powers only to  
regulate activity that ``substantially'' affects commerce, the 
court said in a decision that was quickly hailed by states-rights 
advocates as a landmark victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case acted on Monday, Mrs. Gluzman, a resident of Upper  
Saddle River, N.J., was arrested by New York police in the murder 
of her husband, prominent biologist Yakov Gluzman. Six days later, 
federal prosecutors interceded and charged her with the crime of 
``interstate domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Mrs. Gluzman and an accomplice, Vladimir  
Zelenin, traveled from New Jersey to Pearl River, N.Y., where her 
estranged husband was living, to murder him. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelenin had been arrested while dumping parts of Gluzman's  
dismembered body into the Passaic River. 
</P>
<P>
	After a federal trial, Mrs. Gluzman was convicted and sentenced  
to life on the domestic-violence crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld her conviction,  
giving short shrift to her argument that the federal law is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Supreme Court appeal told the justices they should use her  
case to halt ``a pronounced tendency in the lower courts ... to 
restrict (the 1995 decision) to its facts and relegate its guiding 
principles to a quaint footnote in this court's ... 
jurisprudence.''

$48.65 billion in stock, combining the nation's third- and 
fourth-largest cable television providers in the industry's richest

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell today, forcing investors to  
contend with the possibility that the Dow Jones industrial average 
might not close above 10,000 any time soon. The blue-chip index 
crossed 10,000 several times last week in intraday trading. Today 
it failed even to do that, meandering throughout the session and 
ending off 13.04 at 9,890.51. That's about 110 points away from 
10,000, but the Dow is still up over 8 percent so far this year. 
Cable TV and Internet stocks provided some upward momentum to the 
technology sector, but personal computer shares sold off, leaving 
the Nasdaq composite down 25.35 at 2,395.92 and the Standard &AMP;

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States announced today it was  
preparing a new list of sanction targets to retaliate against 
Europe's refusal to allow the sale of American beef treated with 
growth hormones. The preliminary target list covers more than $900 
million in European imports, primarily farm products. The 
sanctions, which would effectively double the price of the products 
in the American market, would go into effect at the latest by early 
July, administration officials said in making the announcement. The 
new target list is in addition to $520 million in European products 
targeted in the earlier trade fight involving European restrictions 
on banana shipments by American companies.

	OPEC Cuts Prompt Gas Price Hike

<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC's plan to reduce the world's oil  
supply by about 2.6 percent has already translated into a spike in 
prices at gasoline pumps in the United States and elsewhere. Formal 
approval of the production cuts at the group's meeting tomorrow 
would push gasoline prices even higher, analysts say. OPEC is 
widely expected to approve cuts in oil output totaling 2.1 million 
barrels a day. The average price of all grades of gasoline at U.S. 
service stations surged nearly 8 1/2 cents per gallon over the past 
two weeks, according to the Lundberg Survey, the steepest and 
fastest increase since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

The transaction announced today would be the largest French 
acquisition ever made in the United States. The combined company 
would have more than $12 billion in annual revenue and the deal 
would nearly double revenues of Vivendi's water treatment business, 
Generale des Eaux, based in Paris. The deal is subject to

officials. The EU was thrown into turmoil last week after Jacques 
Santer, head of the group's executive Commission, and 19 other 
senior officials abruptly resigned following a report alleging 
fraud and cronyism in their ranks. Former Italian Prime Minister 
Romano Prodi has emerged as the front-runner to succeed Santer, a 
former prime minister of Luxembourg. Prodi has said he is ready to 
take the job but only for a full five-year term. Santer's outgoing 
commission was due to step down Dec. 31.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing new

the government of billions of dollars a year, Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers said today. The Treasury Department 
plans as early as next month to release a major paper outlining the 
scope of the tax shelter problem. To create ``real financial 
risks'' for people who devise and use tax shelters, Summers said, 
the administration wants Congress to approve a 25 percent excise 
tax on promoter and lawyer fees. In addition, an unspecified excise 
tax would be imposed on contingency fees, sometimes used when part 
of the deal depends upon a favorable ruling by the Internal Revenue 
Service.

also upheld an agreement between Gucci and French retailer 
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute in which PPR will take a 40 percent 
interest in the company. But the court suspended any parts of the 
agreement that would hamper the negotiations between Gucci and

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Hear Siblings Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 4-year-old's battle to grow up in the same home  
as his older sister has ended with the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal 
to take up the question of whether siblings put up for adoption 
have the right to stay together. 
</P>
<P>
	The children in the case were known in court papers as ``Hugo''  
and ``Gloria'' to protect their identities. They were said to be so 
close that 6-year-old Gloria translated for her developmentally 
disabled brother when his speech was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision Monday means the boy will likely remain in  
the New Jersey home where he has been living for the last two 
months, while his sister grows up 200 miles away in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	They lived together with a foster mother in Boston for about two  
years before they were separated in January under a ruling by the 
state's high court. An aunt from New Jersey won custody of Hugo, 
while his sister remained in Boston with the foster mother, who has 
adopted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the boy appealed to the Supreme Court to reunite  
brother and sister. A ruling in favor of the boy could have 
reunited some 35,000 siblings in similar situations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Without comment, the high court refused to hear the case.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad this separation will be permanent, that they won't be  
able to grow up together as brother and sister,'' said Susan 
Dillard, a lawyer for Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Social Services Department had supported Hugo  
as his case moved through the state's courts because ``it was in 
his best interest to remain with his sister,'' department 
spokeswoman Lorraine Carli said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the department changed sides when the case went to the U.S.  
Supreme Court, saying there should not be a blanket rule when it 
comes to what is best for a child. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably going to be some instances when it's not in  
the best interest of siblings to be together,'' Ms. Carli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo was placed in foster care three days after he was born. He  
may have been injured by the cocaine his mother used while 
pregnant, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The foster mother had both Gloria and Hugo for the past two  
years, identified in court papers as ``Enid,'' wanted to keep both 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hugo's father believed the boy would be better off with the  
New Jersey aunt, who has raised her own special-needs child. The 
aunt has not sought custody of Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Drogin, who represents the father, said the family is  
thrilled and relieved the court battle finally seems to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hugo and Gloria were separated in January, the two  
families said they would try to work out a visitation agreement. 
Ms. Drogin said the siblings have not seen each other, but speak on 
the phone once a week and Hugo ``has been doing very well.''

	Serbs Get Last Chance for Peace

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With NATO missiles and warplanes  
poised to strike, a U.S. envoy began a last bid today to persuade 
Yugoslavia's president to accept a Kosovo peace plan and the 
thousands of foreign troops that would enforce it. Richard 
Holbrooke held four hours of talks with President Slobodan 
Milosevic this evening. A brief report on Serbian television gave 
no indication of any breakthrough. Further consultations were 
expected early tomorrow, the White House said. Meanwhile, fighting 
raged today between government forces and the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army in Kosovo. Several villages were ablaze and there 
were unconfirmed reports of mass killings near the town of Srbica.

Sund, 42. Officials said they may use DNA testing to identify the

executioner, he was merely carrying out his professional duty in a 
videotaped suicide shown on ``60 Minutes.'' Kevorkian was charged 
after he gave a lethal injection to a patient with Lou Gehrig's 
disease. In his opening statement, Kevorkian said he acted out of 
compassion for 52-year-old Thomas Youk and was no more culpable 
than an executioner. Kevorkian will be allowed to consult with his 
lawyers during the trial but said that defending himself was ``what

	Four Dead in Alaska Avalanche

<P>
	TURNAGAIN PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Volunteers recovered two more  
bodies today from an avalanche that swept through a popular 
snowmobiling spot yesterday, raising the death toll to four. As 
many as seven other people were missing. About 85 volunteers moved 
shoulder-to-shoulder with poles today, probing for bodies in areas 
where witnesses had reported seeing snowmobilers disappear or where 
machines had been discovered. Police have also asked the military 
for 200 people to help in the search.

	Court Rules on Rights of Teen-Agers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Handling two disputes over the rights of  
teen-agers and parents, the Supreme Court today allowed a city to 
continue imposing a nighttime curfew, but barred two high schools 
from requiring drug tests for all students suspended for 
disciplinary reasons. A nighttime curfew for minors has never been 
fully reviewed by the nation's highest court. Today's action may 
encourage other communities to consider adopting similar 
ordinances. The court's denial of review in the drug-testing case, 
meanwhile, is likely only to confuse the already murky legal status 
of student drug-testing.

	PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Destructive winds and heavy rain  
battered western Australia Tuesday as the powerful cyclone that has 
flattened scores of homes and downed power lines continued its 
inland march. A man who had refused to evacuate the area near where 
Cyclone Vance made its landfall was missing and presumed dead. 
There were no other immediate reports of casualties. As it moved

<HEADLINE> Vivendi To Buy U.S. Filter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The French conglomerate Vivendi SA plans on  
buying U.S. Filter Corp. and its Culligan brand in a $6.2 billion 
deal that will combine two of the world's leading water-treatment 
businesses and give Vivendi a stronger foothold in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction announced Monday marks the largest French  
acquisition ever in the United States, creating a company with more 
than $12 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Filter's operations range from the retail sale of bottled  
drinking water through its Culligan subsidiary to the construction 
and running of big water treatment plants for cities and factories. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Filter, based in Palm Desert, Calif., about 100 miles east  
of Los Angeles, operates 100 such plants in 94 countries. The 
company reported revenue of more than $5 billion during 1998 and 
has 27,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, U.S. Filter will operate as a wholly owned  
subsidiary of Vivendi. The acquisition is subject to regulatory 
approval in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Vivendi's water treatment subsidiary Generale des Eaux provides  
water treatment services to more than 65 million people worldwide. 
Paris-based Vivendi also owns 34 percent of French pay-TV operator 
Canal Plus and has interests in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we recognize is that we share a vision of a full-service,  
global water enterprise,'' said Jean-Marie Messier, chairman of 
Vivendi. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world's population is continuing to grow. Industry is  
demanding ever-higher standards of processed water for 
manufacturing and the demand for quality wastewater treatment to 
protect the environment has never been greater,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Filter Chairman Richard J. Heckmann will serve on the board  
of directors for Generale des Eaux and become a member of the 
Vivendi water group executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our customers, shareholders and employees all benefit from  
this agreement,'' Heckmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal approved by boards of both companies, Vivendi  
would pay $31.50 a share for U.S. Filter common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little reaction on Wall Street. U.S. Filter slipped  
12 1/2 cents to $30.37 1/2 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 
analysts believe the price should have been in the range of $32 to 
$35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Filter has traded during the past year at more than $36 per  
share. The stock hit a 52-week low of $11.43 in October, but 
climbed back into the $30 range in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an attractive price for Vivendi,'' said Rod Lache, an  
analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ``You could have 
argued for a higher valuation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason is that demand for industrial and municipal water  
services is growing rapidly, driven in part by water scarcity. More 
companies are hiring outside firms to build and manage water 
treatment plants, Lache said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a strong industry. You've got a fairly nice growth rate  
for a mature industry, 8 to 9 percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its founding in 1990, U.S. Filter has grown in large  
measure through acquisitions. The company purchased Culligan Water 
Technologies in February 1998 for about $1.5 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, U.S. Filter made numerous acquisitions, most notably  
purchasing Memtec Ltd., an Australian maker of water filters, for 
about $399 million in stock.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Coach Awed by Turnaround </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Before the season, Jim O'Brien's goal  
wasn't to get Ohio State to the Final Four. A practical man, he was 
just hoping to get above .500 following his worst season as a 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the Buckeyes headed to the NCAA semifinals in St.  
Petersburg, Fla., O'Brien is a mystified as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally just wanted to win more than we lost. I know it  
sounds a little ridiculous right now but I thought that was real,'' 
he said. ``I just thought that after five straight losing seasons 
that a winning record would have been nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In O'Brien's first season at Ohio State, the Buckeyes went 8-22,  
losing 17 straight games and tying the school record for losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the most ardent fan would have felt foolish to ask for a  
winning season this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that would have gotten us to the NIT and would have  
shown some pretty good progress,'' O'Brien said. ``Obviously, we 
have far exceeded that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, they have. The record is downright startling: 27-8, with  
Connecticut (32-2) up next on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest victory came in the South Regional title game, a  
77-74 win over St. John's 77-74. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the Buckeyes' first trip to the Final Four in 31 years.  
The last time they went, O'Brien was a scrawny freshman point guard 
at Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain of the last Ohio State team to make it to the Final  
Four gives a lot of the credit to O'Brien for the remarkable 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the catalyst,'' said Bill Hosket, a Columbus businessman  
and Big Ten basketball commentator. ``He's getting the most out of 
the kids, but more than that he's doing a terrific job of hiding 
their weaknesses. That's something he's done well for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question of which team had the best coaching in the  
last 80 minutes of basketball I saw in Knoxville. It's phenomenal 
what the guy has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's leading scorer, Michael Redd, said there are  
several reasons why the Buckeyes have survived this long -- and all 
are attributes nurtured by O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teamwork. Playing hard. Every possession we played with a lot  
heart,'' he said. ``That was the key for us. It really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season, point guard Scoonie Penn brashly predicted  
the Buckeyes would make it to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at him like, you know, he's nuts,'' O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
	Penn insists the Buckeyes are deserving of the trip to St.  
Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something we work real hard for,'' he said. ``I don't  
think anyone thought we could do it, but here we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over the Buckeyes two years ago, O'Brien inherited  
several malcontents and borderline students, but they all 
transferred or quit. His only two holdovers are seniors Neshaun 
Coleman and Jason Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, O'Brien points to the character of his players and  
the contributions from the entire roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just when you don't know if they can keep giving there's  
always more,'' he said. ``They always come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien has been a head coach for 17 years at Ohio State, Boston  
College and St. Bonaventure. He was an assistant for five years 
before that at, of all places, UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	The moment is not lost on him. He hugged his daughters and then  
danced with his players after the victory over St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys coach forever and ever and never get a chance to get to  
the Final Four,'' he said. ``People go through their careers, 
players play three or four years, and never get this opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to be thankful that we get this opportunity. It's  
special.''

<HEADLINE>  Oscarcast: Long, Dull and Tacky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's an old saying that no one ever left the  
theater humming the scenery. But if there was anything about the 
Oscarcast worth singing about, it was the set. 
</P>
<P>
	That, and Roberto Benigni. In fact, among mere mortals on hand  
Sunday, the excitable, ecstatic writer-director-star of ``Life Is 
Beautiful'' was almost the sole salvation of ``The 71st Annual 
Academy Awards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Could this year's telecast have been any duller? Only if the  
Italian superstar hadn't been on hand to accept two Oscars in his 
rapid-fire, euphoric broken English. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to kiss everybody,'' he exalted after stepping from  
seat-back to seat-back to reach the stage for his best foreign 
language film trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	A little while later, the Oscarcast got another welcome jolt  
when Benigni returned to claim the best actor award: ``I would like 
to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody,'' he bubbled, ``and lie down in 
the firmament making love with everybody!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows what would have gone on had he won a third?  
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the broadcast, which ABC aired live from Los Angeles'  
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, was rated ZZZ. And that couldn't all be 
blamed on its record-breaking length: 4 hours, 2 minutes. The show 
was just dull. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting sure wasn't, though. Did it look like a rotunda  
dome? A lunar module? A huge, glorious umbrella? It was all that 
and more. It had far more excitement than most of the stars with 
which it shared the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dull? Even the drama surrounding Elia Kazan's life achievement  
award thudded to an anticlimax. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than anybody, he inspired us,'' said Robert De Niro three  
long hours into the broadcast. De Niro had joined director Martin 
Scorsese to present the award, an object of bitter debate between 
admirers of the great director and those who denounced him for 
naming colleagues four decades ago in a government investigation of 
communist influence on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you all very much,'' said the 89-year-old Kazan. ``I  
think I can just slip away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was that.  
</P>
<P>
	In her third turn as host, Whoopi Goldberg had little new to  
offer. Hers was the same tacky, self-satisfied display she had 
visited on the Oscarcast before. 
</P>
<P>
	Her appearances in various Oscar-related costumes, beginning  
with the finery of Queen Elizabeth (not to mention her wearing 
white-face), should have been funny. But Goldberg has a fixation on 
bodily functions and rude double entendres that reduces her act to 
the level of a naughty 8-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, she made a pun on ``we ... we.'' Later on, she made a  
pun about leaks. Observing that William Shakespeare has had a good 
year at the movies, she purred suggestively, ``Little Willie is 
very large.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After one of such wisecracks, Goldberg made a cackling reference  
to past Oscarcast host Billy Crystal. ``You're missin' Billy just 
about now -- aincha?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you only knew, Whoopi.  
</P>
<P>
	What became an Oscar snoozefest had begun promisingly with its  
first award, best supporting actor. It went to James Coburn for 
``Affliction.'' But instead of rising to the occasion, the veteran 
actor, a sentimental favorite after some 70 films without so much 
as a nomination, slowed things to a crawl with his laundry list of 
thank-yous. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually surefire, presenters Robin Williams and Chris Rock were  
each downright listless. 
</P>
<P>
	And as for the dance number showcasing nominated musical scores:  
It was nice to look at, but Savion Glover tap-dancing to a theme 
from ``Saving Private Ryan''? What was up with that?! 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, Gwyneth Paltrow's sobbingly grateful acceptance of her  
best actress Oscar for ``Shakespeare in Love'' was memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	And four separate farewell tributes -- including those for Roy  
Rogers, Frank Sinatra and director Stanley Kubrick -- were each 
moving. Oscar knows how to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, could Oscar say goodbye to Whoopi Goldberg as host? And  
before next year, maybe hire that funny, never-dull Roberto 
Benigni!

<HEADLINE> Big Holyfield-Lewis Bets Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A late flood of money -- perhaps more than $1  
million -- was bet on Evander Holyfield just before he stepped into 
the ring with Lennox Lewis, drawing the attention of investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Gaming Control Board confirmed Monday that it is  
looking into the bets made at a number of Las Vegas sports books in 
the hours before the March 13 fight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of the money ended up being refunded to bettors when  
the fight was ruled a draw, even though Holyfield appeared to have 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe by gambling regulators comes on top of investigations  
by a Manhattan grand jury, a state Senate committee and the New 
York State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada investigators are primarily concerned with whether the  
money was bet on behalf of one individual or group by so-called 
``messenger'' bettors, which is against Nevada law. But a source 
close to the probe told The Associated Press that the agency was 
also working with out-of-state agencies investigating the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at any betting patterns we can find,'' said  
Keith Copher, chief of enforcement for the agency that regulates 
Nevada casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $1 million may have been bet just before the fight in  
Las Vegas sports books and those run out of the Caribbean, causing 
the odds favoring Holyfield to jump. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime Las Vegas bettor said the betting pattern was so  
unusual that he suspected the money was bet with inside knowledge 
of what the outcome might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a real scam, except it didn't work,'' said Lem  
Banker, one of a very few sports bettors who has made a living over 
the years wagering on sporting events and is well respected in the 
industry. ``There was a lot of what I call `unnatural money' 
wagered on Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield had been a slight favorite in the week before the  
fight, but the bout was nearly a pick 'em by Saturday, said Pete 
Korner of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which sets the odds for 
most Las Vegas sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	Then just before the fight began close to midnight EST, a rush  
of money pushed odds to as much as 8-5 and 9-5 on Holyfield, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously somebody or some group was playing Holyfield very  
late,'' Korner said. ``They did their homework well waiting for the 
price to come down before they bet it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Lupo, sports book director at the Stardust hotel, said the  
late Holyfield money caused the line to move from minus 130 to 
minus 160 (8-5) just before the fight. But Lupo said he believes 
the bets were not out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see any unusual betting,'' Lupo said. ``It was all  
small money, no real large wagers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mirage, which has one of the largest casino sports books,  
had no comment, according to spokeswoman Jenn Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, investigators want to know whether the money  
was bet by ``messenger'' bettors who fanned out to various casinos 
to make bets at the direction of one bettor. 
</P>
<P>
	Messenger betting is done primarily by big bettors to get bets  
down at various casinos without the odds being raised too quickly 
and to avoid the identification forms that must be filled out for 
any bet of $10,000 or more.

<HEADLINE> Study:Military Computers Vulnerable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military computer and communications systems  
are ``increasingly compromised'' and vulnerable to attack by 
hackers and high-tech enemies, concluded a Pentagon-sponsored study 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Defense Department is working to improve  
cybersecurity, the study said technological advances are outpacing 
the Pentagon's sluggish moves to protect vital information used in 
today's battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're unchallenged on the muscle side of this equation,'' said  
James McGroddy, chairman of the National Research Council committee 
that wrote the study. ``The problem here is the invisible enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGroddy said command, control, computer, communications and  
intelligence systems -- ``the nervous system of the military'' -- are 
aging fast while the high-tech tools to attack it are generally 
thought to be improving by a factor of 10 every five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have now, you know, will be obsolete very soon,''  
McGroddy said at a news conference. ``Cyberattacks will find the 
weakest point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department, the report said, ``is in an increasingly  
compromised position. The rate at which information systems are 
being relied on outstrips the rate at which they are being 
protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, recognizing the problem after hacker attacks on  
its computers and cyberwar games, in December set up a ``network 
computer defense'' joint task force of military and intelligence 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Money, the civilian official in charge of the Pentagon's  
information security, told a Senate Armed Service Committee panel 
last week that the military is working to better protect its more 
than 2 million computers from outside penetration and inside 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is developing tools for ``real-time'' sensing and  
warning of cyberattacks and technology for built-in protection 
against inadvertent or malicious modification of data, among other 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States now relies on information systems to such an  
extent that an attack against those systems would present a genuine 
threat to U.S. security,'' Money said in prepared testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In a military test at Fort Bragg, N.C., a year ago, an Army  
helicopter crew strayed far off course and nearly out of training 
range after its Global Positioning System signals were blocked, 
Money noted. GPS is a navigation system that uses information from 
satellites to guide military and civilians crafts. The system also 
can be used to help direct high-tech bombs and missiles to their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a national security team of about 20 people, in a  
cyberwar game lasting three months, gained access to unclassified 
Pentagon computers, giving the team the ability to disrupt troops 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, teen-agers in the United States and Israel  
attempted to break into Pentagon computers. The intrusion was 
quickly detected, but it took days before military and law 
enforcement officials determined it was not an attack by a foreign 
government or an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents prompted the Pentagon to make cybersecurity a high  
priority, but the National Research Council committee recommended 
the Defense Department move far more quickly and change a military 
culture that puts more emphasis on warfighting tanks than 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The troops don't take information defense seriously,'' said  
McGroddy, a retired senior vice president of research at IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ordered the Pentagon to commission the report in 1995.  
The National Research Council is an independent organization that 
advises government.

<HEADLINE> AmWest Seeks To Lure Travelers Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Now that America West Airlines and its flight  
attendants have made peace with one another, they can begin the 
process of making peace with the airline's customers. 
</P>
<P>
	America West averted a strike last weekend by reaching an $80  
million settlement with the Association of Flight Attendants. For 
days, both sides had been threatening one another in a labor 
dispute that could have stranded 100,000 passengers during the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Longman, an analyst at Arnhold &AMP; S. Bleichroedoer in New  
York, said Monday the airline would probably have to make things up 
to its business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem has been over the last two weeks because  
business travelers have booked away. Clearly, they will have to put 
out some inducements to business travelers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those inducements could include free frequent-flier miles, seat  
upgrades or a fare sale -- though Longman said a sale at the 
nation's ninth-largest carrier would likely be confined to the 
Phoenix area and not go nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	America West, based in suburban Tempe, has hubs here, in Las  
Vegas and Columbus, Ohio, serving 53 domestic destinations and 
eight cities in Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Patty Nowack, a spokeswoman for the airline, refused to comment  
on what the company might do to woo travelers back. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least one airline analyst, Michael Boyd of the Boyd  
Group, said America West won't have to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute the press release went out saying 'We have a  
settlement,' customers put it behind them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the sides reached an agreement before a strike, America  
West didn't sustain any significant damage, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Longman said America West chairman William Franke would need to  
do some public relations repair with investors, though. Franke 
himself acknowledged as much, saying after the agreement that ``we 
need to focus on the customer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America West's history of tumultuous labor relations, both with  
the flight attendants and the mechanics group with which it reached 
agreement in October, has pushed down the value of the company's 
stock, Longman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Franke is going to want to spend some more time on  
investor relations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Clarkson, a spokeswoman for the flight attendant's union,  
said she was cautiously optimistic that the agreement reached 
Friday would begin a new era of relations between the airline and 
its flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the feud that led to last week's strike countdown began  
years ago. Employees at the carrier took a 10 percent pay cut to 
help the company recover after it filed for bankruptcy in 1991. The 
pay was not restored even though the company posted record profits 
in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had (Franke) given us a few extra bucks and a pat on the back  
and acknowledged the work we do a few years back, he has no idea 
what that would have done,'' Clarkson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That Franke showed up in person for the last several hours of  
the contract negotiations and shook hands with union 
representatives made a major difference, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that kind of respect continues outside those doors, I think  
that can be the beginning of a different sort of relationship,'' 
Clarkson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract, which union leaders hope will be ratified by  
members in the next 20 to 30 days, includes a pay raise. Top-paid 
flight attendants will see their salary rise from $23,800 to 
between $33,000 and $37,000. That's about 80 percent to 90 percent 
of the $41,200 paid by rival Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase would lift America West flight attendants from the  
bottom of the top-10 carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants would also get a ``per diem'' for the  
first time -- an extra payment for every hour they are on the job or 
awaiting a flight to their home base.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Put Cassell on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Newly acquired point guard Sam Cassell was  
placed on the injured list by the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday, one 
day after aggravating an ankle injury during his first appearance 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks activated forward Scott Williams from the injured list  
to take Cassell's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks had acquired Cassell from the New Jersey Nets as part  
of a three-team trade March 11 that also sent point guard Terrell 
Brandon from the Bucks to the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell, sidelined with an ankle injury before the trade, made  
his first appearance for the Bucks in Sunday's game against 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcomed with a standing ovation from Milwaukee fans, he scored  
13 points before going up for a rebound and coming down on the foot 
of the Hornets' Chucky Brown with about three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell fell to the floor in pain, having aggravated the severe  
sprain of his right ankle. Teammate Robert Traylor eventually 
carried him to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks said X-rays of Cassell's ankle Monday proved negative  
and the ankle was placed in a cast ``to quiet the joint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is to be reevaluated in 10 to 14 days.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams was acquired from Philadelphia in another trade March  
11. He had been placed on the injured list at that time with stress 
fractures in both legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was scheduled to be in uniform Monday night for the  
game with the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Haywoode Workman, signed to a 10-day contract March 17, has been  
filling in at point guard along with reserve Vinny Del Negro in 
Cassell's absence.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Owner Welcomes Harbaugh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Alex Spanos welcomed Jim Harbaugh as only an  
impatient owner could. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching his San Diego Chargers win just nine games the  
last two seasons, due largely to some disastrous play at 
quarterback, Spanos delivered the same impassioned speech he always 
gives to major acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim, I tell you what, I just hate losing,'' Spanos said at a  
news conference Monday introducing Harbaugh as the team's new 
quarterback. ``You're here to help us win, and believe me, I'll be 
right there with you. I promise you. A sigh of relief knowing that 
Jim Harbaugh is sitting to my right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spanos handed Harbaugh his No. 4 jersey, then embraced his new  
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim, I want to thank you. I tell you, you've excited all of  
us, me especially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funny, but Spanos made similar statements to Ryan Leaf last  
year, both when the Chargers made him the second overall pick in 
the draft, and again when they lavished the rookie with a $31.25 
million contract. But that was before Leaf's meltdowns, on and off 
the field, that led to the Chargers (5-11) seeking a veteran 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanos said after Monday's news conference that he still  
believes Leaf will be as good as he was once advertised. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just going to learn as he goes along. And it's going to  
take some time. I've gone through two years, that's enough. Right 
now, I want to start winning. That's why he (Harbaugh) is here,'' 
Spanos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like that intensity,'' said Harbaugh, who added that he owns  
a 20-percent stake in an Indy Racing League team and understands 
wanting to see an investment do well. ``I can appreciate Mr. 
Spanos' desire to win. I'm here. I want to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh was acquired from the Baltimore Ravens for a  
conditional fifth-round pick in the 2000 draft. Under contract for 
$3.25 million for 1999, Harbaugh took a pay cut to join the 
Chargers, agreeing to a $2.75 million, two-year deal, plus 
incentives. By comparison, the Chargers have already paid Leaf $8.3 
million of his $11.25 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh, 35, is entering his 13th NFL season. He's been on six  
playoff teams, including the 1995 Indianapolis Colts, who 
embarrassed the defending AFC champion Chargers 35-20 in a 
wild-card game in San Diego. The Chargers haven't been back to the 
playoffs or had a winning season since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a young 35, if there is such a thing,'' Harbaugh  
said. ``A little tread's come off the tires after about 12 years of 
playing, but I really look forward to working back into shape. I 
look forward to that every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers like Harbaugh's toughness, scrambling ability and  
veteran presence, and feel his addition will complement their 
swarming defense, which ranked first overall and against the run 
last year. New coach Mike Riley reiterated that Harbaugh is all but 
penciled in as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if we were to make an educated guess right now as  
to where we would be opening day, he would be our quarterback,'' 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh said that when Leaf is ready, ``he's the guy, there's  
no doubt about that. It may take some pressure off of him to have a 
guy like me here ready to step in and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh started 12 of 14 games he played last year, throwing  
for 1,839 yards and 12 touchdowns, with 11 interceptions. Even in 
his two worst years, when he was intercepted 28 times in 1991-92 
with Chicago, he still didn't throw as many interceptions as Leaf 
and Craig Whelihan did last year, when they tied the club record 
with 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh called Riley's offense ``slick'' and ``cutting edge,''  
and will get his first chance to run it when the team holds its 
first minicamp April 6-8.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Warns of Speed Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- First there was the CB radio. Then lead-footed  
motorists trying to avoid a speeding ticket used radar detectors 
and snazzy police scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they can just take a spin on the Web.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based Speedtrap Registry gives online visitors a  
heads-up on where traffic police and road hazards lurk for all 50 
states and 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, developed by 22-year-old computer engineer Andrew  
Warner, includes trap locations, average fine, type of car the 
police use and the local scanner frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire town counts as a speed trap,'' reads an entry for  
the Massachusetts town of Dover. ``They will pull you over for less 
than 5 mph over the limit at any location, even if you're riding a 
bicycle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dover Police Chief Joseph Griffin called that an exaggeration.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not quite that zealous,'' he said, laughing. ``But if  
somebody says, `I better not speed in that town,' then someone else 
has done my job for me. That's wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Web site -- at www.speedtrap.com -- would seem to give  
wannabe speeders an edge in their efforts to elude police, other 
law-enforcement officials agreed with Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of speed enforcement is to reduce car crashes and  
save lives,'' said Massachusetts State Police Capt. Robert Bird. 
``Whether you can get people to slow down by warning that police 
may be there or by catching them in the act, it accomplishes the 
same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, who says he has only one speeding ticket to his name,  
lets online visitors submit new traps, search for them by region or 
subscribe to a mailing list of recent updates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started out mainly in the South, looking at entrapment  
cases,'' said Warner, who refuses to include sobriety checkpoints. 
``But it's evolved into a general driver's service. Everybody can 
relate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On an average week, more than 100,000 people visit the site,  
some leaving remarkably specific warnings to their fellow road 
warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of trees make you feel like you are on a remote country  
highway, so you are tempted to drive fast. DON'T,'' says an entry 
for Rothrock Road in Copley, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The State Trooper drives a gold Ford Crown Vic,'' says a  
Connecticut entry. ``You don't see him until it's too late ... I 
have seen him parked sideways using laser, so beware, he is very 
tricky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the cops may be the ones winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anywhere I go in Woodbridge, there seems to be a cop running  
radar -- none of these roads are safe to speed on,'' says an entry 
from Woodbridge, Conn. -- a warning that would make any officer 
proud.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Renews Call for Base Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen renewed his  
request for another round of military base closures Monday and said 
communities near bases should look at shutdowns as an opportunity, 
not a setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Base closure need not be an economic death knell,'' Cohen said  
in an address to a Pentagon-sponsored conference of community 
leaders and military officials. ``It can, in fact, be a starting 
bell for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he would soon make his base-closing pitch again on  
Capitol Hill, where many members of Congress strongly oppose the 
Clinton administration's proposal for holding two more rounds of 
base closings, in 2001 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult task,'' Cohen said of the challenge of  
persuading Congress to agree to more base closures. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has not said how many bases it thinks should  
be closed. That decision would be made by a congressionally 
authorized Base Realignment and Closure Commission, subject to 
presidential approval. The Pentagon lacks the authority to close 
bases on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he is bothered that communities face unnecessary  
bureaucratic obstacles once a goes on the closure list. 
</P>
<P>
	``The closure process is still too complicated,'' he said,  
referring to lengthy delays in the cleanup and transfer of base 
properties. To address the problems, Cohen said he is creating 
``special re-use teams'' of senior military and civilian officials 
to cut through the red tape and help speed up property transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the billions of dollars expected to be saved by  
closing excess military bases is needed urgently to finance 
military modernization and to improve the quality of life for 
troops. Without those investments, ``we will see an exodus out of 
the military'' and a slide in combat readiness, the secretary said.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Wilson Will Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Paul Wilson's surgery total is nearing his wins total.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who hasn't pitched a major league game since  
reconstructive shoulder surgery in November 1996, needs 
reconstructive elbow surgery and will miss this season and possibly 
a significant part of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's very, very discouraging, as far as Paul has  
gone to come back from where he was,'' Mets general manager Steve 
Phillips said Monday during a telephone conference call from Port 
St. Lucie, Fla. ``It's just devastating for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury means all three of the young pitchers touted by the  
Mets in the late 1990s needed ligaments replaced in their pitching 
elbows. Jason Isringhausen is still working his way back to the 
majors and Bill Pulsipher returned, only to be traded to Milwaukee 
last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, a right-hander who turns 26 next week, was the top pick  
in the 1994 amateur draft. He was 1-0 this spring, allowing six 
hits in nine scoreless innings with three walks and one strikeout, 
then partially tore the medial collateral ligament in his right 
elbow on Friday while warming up for his first spring start for 
Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched anyway, allowing six runs and eight hits in three  
innings, but the pain didn't go away the following day and he 
informed team officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many pitchers now in the major leagues who have come  
back from this,'' said Phillips, who originally thought the injury 
wasn't serious, perhaps a bone spur. ``It certainly is 12 months. 
Then you have to build up stamina and strength, then you have to 
get innings under your belt again. Hopefully, it's short of two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wilson's only major league appearances, he was 5-12 with a  
5.38 ERA for the Mets in 26 starts in 1996. He went 4-1 with a 4.52 
ERA in seven starts last season at Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll work as hard again to do what he has to do to get  
back,'' Phillips predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, whose farm system produced Hall of Famers Tom Seaver  
and Nolan Ryan and noted pitchers such as Dwight Gooden, hasn't had 
much success of late. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen had arthroscopic shoulder and elbow surgery in  
September 1996 and a ligament replaced in his right elbow in 
January 1998. Pulsipher had reconstructive surgery on his left 
elbow in April 1996 and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers last 
July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was especially upsetting to the Mets because Wilson  
had worked so hard following the shoulder operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was crushed,'' Mets trainer Fred Hina said after talking  
with Wilson. ``Nobody sweats more than Paul Wilson.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Mets re-signed 25-year-old right-hander Oscar  
Henriquez, cut from the major league roster last week, to a minor 
league contract. They also traded Jonathan Guzman, an 18-year-old 
outfielder who played for New York's team in the Dominican Summer 
League last year, to Kansas City for utility player Shane Halter, 
primarily a shortstop. Halter hit .286 (6-for-21) with eight RBIs 
after hitting .221 with two homers and 13 RBIs in 265 at-bats last 
season. He also played the outfield, other infield positions and 
even pitched one inning for the Royals. Halter has been practicing 
at catcher this spring.

<HEADLINE> Florida Club Bans Soap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Feel free to work up a sweat on the  
racquetball courts, take a swim in the Olympic-size pools or soak 
in the hot tub at the Bonaventure Town Center Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't lather up in the locker room -- soap has been banned  
for fear of more litigation. And not just bar soap, but body wash, 
shampoo, conditioner and shaving cream, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been sued. We've settled. We've lost a lot of money,''  
said Bob Fedderwitz, executive director of the recreation center in 
Weston, a well-to-do community near Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say how much the club had paid out or how many  
lawsuits it has been hit with since its 1984 opening, except that 
it's ``quite a few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just a litigious society,'' Fedderwitz said. ``Anybody  
who hurts themselves, when they see an establishment like ourselves 
that's required to carry X dollars in insurance, that's very 
attractive to attorneys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And very unattractive to insurance companies.  
</P>
<P>
	Fedderwitz said the club's insurer was considering dropping its  
coverage if the place didn't do something about the lawsuits. The 
ban went into effect a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At Century Village in Deerfield Beach, soap has been banned in  
locker rooms and at poolside showers since the retirement community 
was built 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15,000 residents of Century Village, where the average age  
is 70 to 75, are accustomed to community regulations, and most 
respect the soap ban, said Amadeo Trinchitella, the 81-year-old 
chairman of the recreation committee. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the occasional suds smuggler, ``we try to say that  
there's going to be penalties -- such as we're going to keep you 
from going to the (community) shows,'' Trinchitella said. ``But 
it's kind of an idle threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fedderwitz said people at the Town Center Club aren't in a  
lather about the ban. He said there have been only a few 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he said, ``if they really want to take a soapy shower  
and not worry about smelling, they're three minutes from their 
house.''

<HEADLINE> Cabletron To Sell Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Cabletron Systems will sell its  
manufacturing division to Canada's Celestica Inc., which will make 
Cabletron's computer networking products in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how many of Cabletron's 5,900 jobs  
would be lost. The move would save Cabletron $50 million in the 
first year, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to reduce its work force by about 900  
employees over the next nine months. It plans to close its Ironton, 
Ohio, plant and lay off 300 workers there. About 600 employees at 
the Rochester plant being bought by Celestica will be laid off by 
Cabletron and rehired by Celestica, Cabletron spokesman Darren 
Orzechowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest driving factors behind doing this is we  
were able to partner with a company that's committed to New 
Hampshire,'' he said. ``We expect that almost all of the 
(Rochester) employees ... will be offered positions by Celistica.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celestica already has a plant in Exeter. Workers there and in  
Rochester will be moved to a new plant Celestica plans to build in 
Portsmouth within the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Celestica, which is based in North York, Ontario, has 14,000  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement, Cabletron said its loss in the  
fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended Feb. 28 narrowed to $8.25 
million, or 5 cents a share, from $263.4 million, or $1.67 a share, 
a year earlier. Sales rose to $345.1 million from $311.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full fiscal year, the company's loss widened to $240  
million, or $1.43 a share, on $1.41 billion in sales from a loss of 
$127.1 million, or 81 cents a share, on $1.38 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabletron has lost market share to key competitors, including  
3Com Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. It laid off a total of 780 
employees in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Several high-ranking personnel changes and delays entering new  
markets prompted speculation earlier this year that the company 
might be bought. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabletron recently has tried to narrow its focus to  
data-networking equipment for corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Celestica has a full range of advanced manufacturing services  
that we will leverage to our competitive advantage,'' John 
d'Auguste, Cabletron's president of operations, said in a statement 
announcing the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Polistuk, president and chief executive officer of  
Celestica, said the move would allow his company to expand into the 
networking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced after markets closed. Cabletron rose 31 1/4  
cents to close at $10.06 1/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where Celestica fell 37 1/2 cents to close at $27.43 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders Gucci, LVMH To Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A Dutch court ruled Monday that  
fashion group Gucci NV must negotiate with French luxury goods 
maker LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton over LVMH's $7.86 billion 
hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The court in Holland, where Gucci is based, also upheld an  
agreement between Gucci and French retailer 
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute in which PPR will take a 40 percent 
interest in the company. But the court suspended any parts of the 
agreement which would hamper the negotiations between Gucci and 
LVMH. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges also said Gucci's current management and supervisory  
board would have to enter negotiations with LVMH, meaning PPR won't 
be able to install any new members on Gucci's board, as planned 
under the original agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also restores LVMH's voting rights on its 26 percent  
stake in the Italian luxury goods maker, which had been suspended 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci had said earlier Monday it was seriously considering the  
$81-a-share offer from LVMH. The French group's offer, made Sunday, 
includes the shares in Gucci that are owned by PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian firm expanded its capital by 40 percent last week to  
ward off what has become a hostile acquisition attempt by LVMH.

	In the case heard Monday in Amsterdam, LVMH was trying to  
overturn defensive moves made by Gucci earlier this year which made 
it difficult for LVMH to gain a majority of the company's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Gucci issued about 37 million shares to its  
employees to deter an earlier bid from the French company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Gucci rose sharply Monday as investors speculated that  
LVMH will increase the $81-a-share offer or that another company 
will make a counter-bid. The stock closed at 73.70 euros ($80.35) 
per share on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, an increase of 10 
percent.

<HEADLINE>  Six Skaters Make 4-Revolution Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) - There were quads in the air and on the  
ice and it was just the qualifying rounds at the World Figure 
Skating Championships today. 
</P>
<P>
	Six skaters completed the four-revolution jump, the most ever in  
a competition and American Tim Goebel became the first skater to 
land a quad salchow in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the jumps, the real jockeying for positions began today  
the Russians leading the way as expected. Yevgeny Plushenko won one 
group and defending world champion Alexei Yagudin won the other, 
despite a sore left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss came in second to Plushenko and  
former Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov was second to Yagudin. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today the pairs have their short programs. Russians Yelena  
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikarulidze are the defending world champions 
and hope to rebound from recent poor performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, in the men's qualifying, the quads came in quantity and  
quality, 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko, Elvis Stojko, Weiss, Goebel, Guo Zhengxin of China  
and Anthony Liu of Australia hit them, marking the most in a single 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, three different skaters did them at the 1997 Grand  
Prix final -- future Olympic champion Ilya Kulik, Urmanov and Stojko 
hit them. Stojko and two others hit them at the 1997 world 
championships finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finally nailed a clean quad toe loop. In 1997 he thought  
he had one but the videotape replay hours later showed he had 
slightly two-footed it. There was no doubt about it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I initially wasn't planning on trying it but as soon as I saw  
two of them hit theirs out there, I knew if I wanted to be up there 
in first or second I had to go for it, '' he said. ``It worked 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss also did triple-triple combinations and three other triple  
jumps, but fell on his second triple axel attempt. Still that put 
him ahead of Stojko, pushing the three-time world champion to third 
in the qualifying group 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko hit his first quad but fell on his second. ``I think I  
was just a little sloppy on the landing,'' Stojko said of his brush 
with the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	He found the qualifications, which count in the scoring this  
year, difficult to adjust to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard to do at this point -- to give everything or  
hold back,'' said Stojko, who turned 27 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also didn't do any triple-triple combinations.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the triple-triples would make the difference,'' said  
Weiss, who had marks between 5.6 and 5.8 but, more importantly, the 
advantage over Stojko with five of the second judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko started strong, with his quad but had slight errors on  
a number of his other jumps. Nonetheless, he ranked ahead of Weiss 
on all but the Swiss judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, who has been consistent throughout the season and  
delivered an awesome quad and quad-triple in practice the day 
before, won his group easily without even attempting one. 
</P>
<P>
	His marks were nearly all 5.8s and 5.9s.  
</P>
<P>
	He did eight triples in doing just enough to get into first  
without putting additional pressure on a sore left calf muscle that 
caused him to shake his leg as soon as he finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel came in fifth helped by his quad salchow. In contrast to  
the toe loops, which the other skaters did, the salchow does not 
have use the skate's toe pick to help pole-vault the skater up. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel started slowly, putting two hands down on a triple axel.  
Then he got up and landed the quad salchow, which he had done 
previously at the Goodwill Games and junior Grand Prix finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifying round advances 15 skaters from each group and  
counts for 20 percent of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	The short program accounts for an additional 30 with Thursday's  
long program counting the remaining 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Military Computer Systems Said Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military's key communications  
infrastructure linking combat, intelligence and command forces is 
dangerously vulnerable to attacks from cyberspace and requires 
urgent changes in Defense Department policy, said a study released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence  
systems, known as C4I, is compromised by security problems and also 
by a military culture prone to treating such problems as a lesser 
priority, the National Research Council reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate at which information systems are being relied on  
outstrips the rate at which they are being protected,'' it said. 
``The time needed to develop and deploy effective defenses in 
cyberspace is much longer than the time required to develop and 
mount an attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite evidence of security lapses in C4I -- which handles  
communications and warning tasks all along the chain of command -- 
the Pentagon's ``words regarding the importance of information 
systems security have not been matched by comparable action,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troops in the field did not appear to take the protection of  
their C4I systems nearly as seriously as they do other aspects of 
defense,'' said the report, which Congress ordered the Pentagon to 
commission in 1995. The council is an independent organization 
chartered by Congress to advise the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The report indicated the problems were due more to the  
Pentagon's management of the systems than to the technology itself. 
It cited C4I workers' lack of stature compared with traditional 
combat forces, compatibility problems between the services and a 
need for more budget flexibility on the matter from both the 
Defense Department and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the Pentagon acknowledged that the U.S.  
military's strength ``is our information technology,'' and that 
``our dependence on such assets, which may be subject to malicious 
attack, makes information technology our weakness as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said that as the council's report was being prepared, the  
Defense Department had already improved protection against computer 
attack by implementing new programs, establishing a joint task 
force for computer defense and expanding training of its 
information technology personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Allard, an analyst who has written about C4I, said  
its weaknesses are in part the fault of ``Industrial Age'' military 
acquisition policies -- applying to computers as well as tanks, 
ships and aircraft -- that give the services their own procurement 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ships and tanks may perform different tasks, he said, but the  
Army, Navy and other services need a single-standard computer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-first century combat is the war of the databases, in  
which information flows must go from the foxhole to the White House 
and back down again,'' said Allard, a former Army colonel and 
analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who 
had not yet read the council's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommended:  
</P>
<P>
	--Making C4I a greater budget priority in defense spending, with  
a flexibility that can ``exploit unanticipated advances in C4I 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Designating an organization responsible for providing direct  
defensive operational support to commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	--Funding a program to conduct frequent, unannounced penetration  
testing of C4I systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensuring that programs are operable even if one part has been  
penetrated by an adversary. 
</P>
<P>
	--Emphasizing the importance of information technology in the  
military leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishing an Institute for Military Information Technology,  
possibly as part of an existing body.

<HEADLINE> Son To Honor Taylor at Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor's 17-year-old son will be  
his presenter at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really wanted to do it and asked if he could. It means a  
lot to me,'' Taylor said Sunday at an autograph-signing and reunion 
of the Giants' 1990 Super Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, one of the dominant defensive players in NFL history,  
had thought he would have to choose between his former coach, Bill 
Parcells, and Giants president Wellington Mara, to present him at 
the Aug. 7 ceremony in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	But his son, Lawrence Taylor Jr., asked him if he could do it,  
according to The Record of Hackensack, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to Jim Brown recently and he said it's too often  
that sons really don't care that much about their fathers. That's 
why I'm really happy T.J. wants to do it,'' Taylor told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who spent 13 seasons with the Giants, also said he no  
longer is angry about the controversy his personal problems caused 
over his nomination to the hall. He faces drug charges in New 
Jersey and Florida and filed bankruptcy papers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all in the past now, and I'm looking forward to the  
induction,'' Taylor said. ``I really think I deserve to be there.''

<HEADLINE> Online Auto Dealers Going Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Two Internet auto sellers are going  
public with stock sales this week as shoppers on the virtual 
highway begin to usurp neighborhood car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to get two cars online last year without having to  
go down to a dealership and haggle,'' said Linda Hill of Lafayette, 
Calif. ``It made the process a lot simpler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, more than 2 million consumers used the Internet to  
research their new-car purchases. A report from Forrester Research 
Inc., predicts that by 2003 nearly 8 million new-car purchases will 
be influenced by the Internet and nearly half a million new cars 
will be purchased entirely online. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rise of online car buying will radically alter the  
automobile and retailing landscape,'' said James L. McQuivey, a 
senior analyst at Forrester. ``Some of these changes will be 
wrenching, as manufacturers rethink their role. Other changes will 
come more naturally, like the increased emphasis on customer 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This new way of shopping is spawning a thriving online auto  
sales business. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-based purchasing services Autoweb.com and Autobytel.com  
have been so successful they are both are planning initial stock 
sales this week -- Autoweb on Tuesday and Autobytel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Clara-based Autoweb.com Inc. plans to sell 5 million  
shares at $10 to $12, raising about $55 million. Autobytel.com 
plans to sell 4.5 million shares at $16 to $18, raising about $76.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies, along with Microsoft Carpoint, lead the  
online auto sales market. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works: A carbuyer points and clicks their way  
through a Web site to submit an online request of the make and 
model they want to buy. Then the online car dealers connect the 
customer with an accredited dealership, which e-mails or calls the 
customer within 24 hours with a non negotiable and supposedly rock 
bottom offer. The customer can then go to the dealership and buy 
their car. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford University's Graduate School of Business recently  
released an auto industry research report that concludes that the 
Internet is shaking up the $1 trillion auto market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised by the way such a staid industry is  
completely revolutionizing itself in such a short time,'' said 
graduate student Jorge Borbolla, who worked on the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that the increased online commerce could shrink  
the number of dealers in the United States from 22,000 to 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glen Reiken, fleet manager at Almaden Mazda in San Jose,  
said he's not worried about becoming obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're looking at on the web, a picture on a computer,  
is not touching, feeling, tasting, like they get when the come in 
and test drive,'' he said. ``At a dealership, customers get the 
same price as online and they get to have a relationship with the 
seller as well. That's important.''

<HEADLINE> Muslim Pilgrims Begin Mecca Rituals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Muslim pilgrims clothed in white  
began the ritual circling of the sacred Kaaba stone structure 
Monday in the holy city of Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaaba, an ancient cubic structure in Mecca's Grand Mosque,  
is Islam's holiest site. Believed to date to the time of the 
prophet Abraham, the Kaaba has been covered with a new black cloth 
that is richly embroidered. 
</P>
<P>
	As Muslims from around the world converged for the start of the  
pilgrimage, or hajj, on Friday, Saudi Arabia said it was ready to 
help and protect the estimated 2 million people expected to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35,000 police, national guardsmen and volunteers were  
dispersed to keep watch over the pilgrims during the rituals, which 
last about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ambulances and medical centers have been readied to  
deal with emergencies. Stampedes or fires at past pilgrimages have 
killed hundreds and sent hundreds of others to clinics and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, some pilgrims are overcome with emotion and need medical  
help. Others succumb to temperatures that can exceed 97 degrees 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Grand Mosque, when loudspeakers blared the midday call to  
prayer, the procession around the Kaaba ground to a peaceful halt. 
Pilgrims paused to listen to verses from the Koran, Islam's holy 
book, and join in prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pilgrims, unable to make it into the mosque because of the  
crowds, prayed outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Zayed, a 32-year-old man from India, said that  
participating in a pilgrimage was exhilarating. ``As soon as I saw 
the Haram (Grand Mosque), I had goose bumps,'' he said. ``My tears 
flowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims are required to make the hajj at least once in a  
lifetime, if they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	George Tomasevich, 56, from Middletown, N.J., said he was  
astounded by the spirituality of Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truly, this is the original home of God,'' said Tomasevich,  
who converted to Islam last November. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 2 million people expected will come from  
abroad, the rest from inside the kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 180 pilgrims died when a stampede broke out as  
pilgrims were performing the ``stoning the devil'' ritual. A 
similar stampede in 1994 left 270 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1997 pilgrimage, fires driven by high winds tore  
through a sprawling, overcrowded tent city at Mina outside Mecca, 
trapping and killing more than 340 pilgrims and injuring 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia has since installed fireproof tents, increased the  
numbers of rescue vehicles and provided safer stoves.

<HEADLINE> Dow Dips, Nasdaq Sees Lift / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed today, as investors searched  
for direction after the Dow Jones industrial average repeatedly 
tried without success to close above 10,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was off 1.67 at 9,901.88.  
</P>
<P>
	But broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq  
composite up 6.48 at 2,427.75, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
up 0.63 at 1,299.92. 
</P>
<P>
	No fresh economic figures were released this morning. Interest  
rates dipped on the bond market, with yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds slipping to 5.54 percent in early trading from 5.55 percent 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was continuing its Dow 10,000 watch after several  
nail-biting sessions last week, when the blue-chip index climbed 
numerous times above the five-digit number on an intraday basis but 
failed to close there. On Friday, the Dow got as high as 10,085.31, 
then skidded as earnings estimates for IBM were lowered. It dropped 
94.07 to close at 9,903.55 and broader indexes also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow did manage two record closing highs last week, the  
second one on Thurday at 9,997.62. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 did 
the same, closing at a high on Thursday at 1,316.55. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, technology shares were again disappointing, with  
IBM down 1 1/8 at 167 7/16, and Dell down 2 at 38 1/4. Declining issues 
edged out advancers by 1,118 to 1,114 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume came to 82.81 million shares in the first 
half hour, lower than Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas markets, the Japan's stock market was closed for a  
holiday. In afternoon trading in Europe, all eyes were on U.S. 
markets. Germany's DAX index was off 0.99 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 was flat, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.41 percent.

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Block Waste From N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department, getting the go-ahead  
from a federal judge, said Monday it will send its first shipment 
of radioactive waste to a disposal site in New Mexico this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and four environmental groups had sought to block the  
shipments, but U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn refused Monday 
to issue an injunction postponing the shipments. He said the 
facility was legally free to accept waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department gave notice to New Mexico this month that  
it would begin shipping 36 containers of highly radioactive waste 
from its Los Alamos National Laboratory to the Waste Isolation 
Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., pending a court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making formal notification to the appropriate parties  
that non-mixed waste will be shipped from Los Alamos National 
Laboratory to WIPP starting this week,'' Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson said in a statement after Penn's ruling. ``It is our 
intention to ship the first load ... on Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from New Mexico officials. State  
Attorney General Patricia Madrid was en route to Washington for a 
conference. Her office in Santa Fe had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Hancock, a lawyer for the Southwest Research and Information  
Center, one of the groups that sought the injunction, said the 
group had ``not given up'' and would see if an appeal of Penn's 
decision was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of that, the 36 containers of so-called transuranic waste  
from Los Alamos, also in New Mexico, will be shipped by special 
trucks and placed in a vault 2,000 feet below the surface, where it 
eventually will be encased in surrounding salt beds. The waste, 
left over from the government nuclear weapons program, will remain 
radioactive for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said the state and other plaintiffs, who asked for an  
injunction to delay the shipments, had ``failed to demonstrate that 
they will suffer irreparable injury'' if the shipments were allowed 
to proceed. Nor had the plaintiffs shown a likelihood they would 
succeed in blocking the opening of WIPP. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had argued that no shipments should be allowed to  
proceed until the state issues a hazardous waste permit for the 
disposal facility. Such a permit is expected to be issued by the 
end of the year, state officials had argued at a court hearing 
March 12. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Energy Department has maintained that the 36 drums held  
at Los Alamos contained ``nonmixed'' radioactive waste, or waste 
that while radioactive does not contain toxic chemicals that fall 
under federal or state hazardous waste laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn agreed with the department. The judge also rejected  
arguments by the state that the WIPP should not be allowed to open 
because of a 1992 injunction, saying that injunction applied only 
to the facility's ``test phase,'' which long had concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``WIPP is ready to open,'' Richardson told a Senate hearing last  
week. He said he was ``troubled and dismayed'' by the state 
Department of Environment's ``lack of interest in certifying'' the 
facility, after the federal Environmental Protection Agency gave 
its approval last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn's decision applies only to the Los Alamos waste that has  
been ready for shipment for months. But the Energy Department hopes 
the court action will lead to other shipments from the government's 
weapons facilities. There are 42 containers of transuranic waste 
awaiting movement from another Energy Department facility in Idaho 
and the government has promised to begin their removal by the end 
of April. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the government has clearance to put as much as 6.2  
million cubic feet of transuranic waste into WIPP. Currently there 
is an inventory of about 2.3 million cubic feet of such waste at 20 
Energy Department facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Transuranic waste is contaminated material left over from  
decades of weapons research, production and storage. It consists 
generally of protective clothing, tools, equipment, soils and 
sludge that has been contaminated with plutonium and other highly 
radioactive elements. By law, WIPP cannot be used to store used 
reactor fuel, which is even more radioactive. The government is 
trying to determine whether that waste can be buried at Yucca 
Mountain in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The WIPP facility has been under construction and review since  
the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups who had joined New Mexico in seeking an injunction  
from Penn, were the Natural Resources Defense Council, the 
Environmental Defense Fund, the Concerned Citizens for Nuclear 
Safety in Santa Fe, N.M., and the Southwest Research and 
Information Center in Albuquerque, N.M.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Trial Attendance Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether prosecutors violate defendants' rights by implying that 
their attendance at trial lets them tailor their testimony to fit 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear New York prosecutors' argument that  
such comments to a jury do not burden defendants' constitutional 
right to be present at trial and confront the witnesses against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Agard of Queens was convicted in 1991 of sodomy and weapons  
possession, and sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison. He testified 
in his own defense at his New York state court trial. 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments, a prosecutor told jurors that unlike  
other witnesses, Agard was allowed to be in court and hear all the 
other testimony before he testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gives you a big advantage, doesn't it?'' the prosecutor  
said. ``You get to sit here and think, `What am I going to say? ... 
How am I going to fit it into the evidence?''' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge turned down Agard's appeal, but the 2nd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the prosecutor's argument 
violated his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor ``cast suspicion upon the defendant's unique  
Sixth Amendment right to be present at his trial and hear all 
testimony'' as well as his Fifth Amendment right to testify in his 
own defense, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an argument might be allowed if it were based on factual  
elements of a defendant's testimony, the appeals court said. But it 
said a prosecutor cannot make a general attack on a defendant's 
credibility because he exercised his right to attend his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, prosecutors said the 2nd Circuit  
court's ruling was an improper extension of a 1965 Supreme Court 
decision that said prosecutors cannot comment in court on a 
defendant's exercise of his right not to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Agard's lawyers said the 2nd Circuit court did not create a  
rigid rule but said the propriety of such comments by prosecutors 
would depend on a case's facts. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Portuondo vs. Agard, 98-1170.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Lobbying for Government Aid / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They don't agree on what should be done, but  
scores of farmers are flying into the nation's capital this month 
to appeal for government help to survive another year of low 
commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat ``at my local elevator is $3 a bushel and that's not  
enough to make it,'' said Mark Sitz of Drake, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	He is among 150 members of the National Farmers Union who fanned  
out across Capitol Hill on Monday to lobby lawmakers for billions 
of dollars worth of proposals, including increased price supports, 
payments for on-farm grain storage, purchases of low-price corn for 
ethanol production, and a short-term land-idling program to reduce 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fundamental changes must be made in farm policy,'' Farmers  
Union President Leland Swenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger American Farm Bureau Federation is sending 3,000 of  
its members to Washington over the course of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	While they oppose production controls supported by the Farmers  
Union, the Farm Bureau members say in a letter to members of 
Congress that the 1996 farm law needs a ``thorough reexamination'' 
to ``assure adequate economic and disaster assistance for all 
commodities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law gave farmers more flexibility on what they could  
plant but it sharply cut crop subsidies that were intended to 
provide a safety net with prices dropped significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau wants the Agriculture Department to expand its  
use of export subsidies and the Conservation Reserve Program and is 
asking Congress for tax cuts and a moratorium on new regulations 
that affect agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lack of significant progress in these areas combined with  
significant economic troubles in the world are throwing farmers a 
devastating punch,'' the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress provided $5.9 billion in assistance last fall, a month  
before the election. This isn't an election year, but Swenson said 
farmers are ahead of where they were at this time last year in 
convincing lawmakers that they need extra government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we have a steep hill to climb, absolutely,'' Swenson said.  
But last March ``we were told we had zero chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Department researchers say a  
biodegradable film made from an oilseed byproduct called soapstock 
may offer a new material for encapsulating chemicals, packaging 
fresh produce and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Soapstock results from using hexane and other industrial  
substances to extract and refine edible oil from the seed of 
cotton, safflower and sunflower crops, the department's 
Agricultural Research Service says. It noted that cottonseed 
processors alone generate 60 million to 120 million pounds of 
soapstock annually. Most goes into animal feedstuffs containing 
seedmeal. 
</P>
<P>
	But oilseed processors are seeking new, more profitable uses,  
said Sam Kuk and Amy Ballew of the ARS office in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	About a year ago, Kuk and Ballew began experimenting with ways  
to exploit soapstocks cache of plant esters, glycerides, and 
phospholipids -- substances that make it biodegradable, malleable 
and soluble in both water and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible commercial use would be in developing a packaging  
material to wrap fresh produce like bell peppers or cucumbers that 
perish easily. Another possibility is encapsulating fungicides and 
other chemicals in slow-release formulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show that when placed in water, the soapstock capsules  
degrade at a rate that delays the release of fungicide by about 
three hours. This may also apply for pharmaceutical compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists also are testing a soapstock gel for hair styling and  
coloring.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lists More Targets in Beef War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States, already in a trade war with  
Europe over bananas, on Monday targeted $900 million in European 
products in a separate fight over Europe's ban on American beef 
treated with growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the dispute is settled, American consumers could see  
Danish hams, French truffles and Belgian chocolates disappearing 
from store shelves by this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 81 European products were put on a preliminary target  
list from which the Clinton administration said it will select a 
final list of goods that will be subject to punitive tariffs of 100 
percent starting as early as June. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher tariffs would effectively double the prices and are  
designed to eliminate the goods from the U.S. market in retaliation 
for lost sales the American cattle industry says it is suffering 
because of Europe's ban on imports of beef containing growth 
hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has put the lost export sales at $500 million  
annually. More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed 
hormones approved by the Food and Drug Administration to cattle to 
make them grow faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The EU's 10-year, arbitrary and scientifically unjustified ban  
on U.S. beef has had a substantial negative impact on U.S. beef 
producers,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Scher, America's trade negotiator on agricultural matters,  
told reporters that all 15 nations in the European Union had 
products on the list in an effort to bring maximum pressure on the 
European Union to drop its beef ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The list, while covering predominantly agriculture products,  
contains a limited number of manufactured goods, including Italian 
moped motorcycles and hair clippers. The agriculture goods included 
canned hams from Denmark, other types of pork, beef, poultry, a 
variety of tomato products, Roquefort cheese, truffles, onions, 
chestnuts, paprika, goose liver, chewing gum, chocolate and mineral 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	This list will be pared after an April 21 public hearing, when  
the administration will give U.S. importers a chance to argue that 
certain products should be excluded from the tariffs because of 
economic harm to their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hit list is in addition to $520 million in European  
products ranging from Scottish cashmere sweaters and French 
handbags to Italian cheese and German coffee makers targeted in a 
separate battle involving European import restrictions that limit 
shipments by American-based banana companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the banana fight, the administration began requiring  
importers to post bonds equal to the 100 percent duties as of March 
3, pending a ruling by the World Trade Organization on the proper 
amount of penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports indicate that WTO arbitrators believe the $520  
million damage estimate in the banana case is too high and should 
be reduced. The administration has said it will comply with 
whatever damage figure the WTO deems appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the banana case and the beef dispute, the United States  
is seeking to impose trade sanctions after the European Union 
refused to abide by WTO rulings in favor of the U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union said in a statement that the beef sanction  
threat ``will inevitably have a chilling effect on trade'' between 
the world's two largest trading partners and questioned the $900 
million package of threatened sanctions, saying it was 10 times 
larger than the amount the U.S. side had been claiming in damage 
just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials have resisted sales of hormone-treated beef,  
citing fears about possible long-term health consequences, in a 
dispute that has stretched for more than 10 years. In 1989, the 
United States actually imposed 100 percent tariffs on $94 million 
in products, including canned tomatoes, wine coolers and pet food. 
Those punitive tariffs remained in effect for five years, until 
Europe agreed to allow a scientific panel to study the issue.	   Leonard Condon, vice president for international trade at the 
American Meat Institute, said the U.S. industry would like to see 
the administration try a rotating approach to sanctions that would 
target a different group of European products every six months in 
an effort to bring maximum pressure on the European Union to change 
its position. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing trade tensions between the United States and the  
European Union are coming at a time when the U.S. trade deficit is 
skyrocketing as the global financial crisis cuts into American 
exports of manufactured goods and farm products.

<HEADLINE> HHS Warns on Medicaid Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As states make it tougher for poor families to  
get welfare, the federal government is telling officials they must 
continue to quickly provide and process applications for Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The most dramatic problems have come in New York City, where a  
federal judge ruled that the welfare offices were wrongly delaying 
applications for Medicaid and food stamps until applicants had 
looked for work. Federal officials suspect there may be similar 
problems in Pennsylvania, North Dakota and perhaps other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Because many states use one application for both cash and  
Medicaid, sometimes deliberate delays in processing an application 
for cash can lead to wrongful delays in Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to stem the problem, the Department of Health and Human  
Services wrote state welfare and Medicaid directors Monday, warning 
them that they must continue providing Medicaid to people even if 
they no longer qualify for cash assistance. HHS included a 28-page 
guide detailing the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, HHS told states they must provide and process  
Medicaid applications immediately, no matter what their welfare 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``As essential pillar of family self-sufficiency is the ability  
to obtain and keep health insurance coverage,'' the guide says. 
</P>
<P>
	Food stamp applications raise similar concerns, but that program  
is administered by the Agriculture Department, so the HHS letter 
and guide do not address it. 
</P>
<P>
	The system used to be much simpler: People who applied and  
qualified for welfare automatically got Medicaid. But the 1996 
welfare overhaul -- which made it much easier for states to deny 
welfare to families -- severed the link between the two programs, 
assuring that families would still qualify for health insurance 
even if they no longer received cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the poor worry that states may be delaying  
Medicaid unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many, many states have isolated cases and have some  
statistical evidence,'' said Liz Schott of the liberal Center for 
Budget and Policy Priorities. But she added: ``There's no place 
that is as dramatic or deliberate as New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has gotten tougher to get cash, it has gotten easier  
to qualify for health insurance , at least for children. A new 
Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, lets states offer 
Medicaid or other insurance to children living in working poor 
families not poor enough to qualify for traditional Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The HHS guide addresses eligibility for both Medicaid and CHIP.  
And it addresses families that are diverted from the welfare rolls 
when they apply and those who are kicked off welfare for failing to 
comply with rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty states have some sort of ``diversion'' program, which  
tries to prevent people from signing up for welfare by requiring an 
immediate job search or by giving people a lump sum of money to 
take care of some sort of emergency -- fixing a car, for instance -- 
that will keep them from needing welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are perfectly appropriate tools in cash assistance,''  
said HHS spokeswoman Melissa Skolfield. ``The guidebook is simply 
to be clear that a delay in cash shouldn't mean a delay in 
enrollment for Medicaid or CHIP.''

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian To Represent Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian won the right to  
represent himself at his first murder trial Monday despite the 
misgivings of a judge who warned him he could spend the rest of his 
life in prison for the videotaped suicide of a man with Lou 
Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was charged after the video of the lethal injection  
was shown on ``60 Minutes'' and he dared prosecutors to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you understand you could spend the rest of your life in  
prison?'' Judge Jessica Cooper asked him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' the 70-year-old Kevorkian said.  
</P>
<P>
	After the ruling, 12 jurors and two alternates quickly were  
selected out of a pool of 80 people. Several candidates were 
dismissed after saying they had strong opinions about the case. 
Opening statements got under way in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own count, Kevorkian has taken part in more than 130  
suicides since 1990. He has been tried four times on assisted 
suicide charges, with three acquittals and one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired pathologist will be allowed to consult with lawyers  
David Gorosh and Lisa Dwyer during this trial but said that 
defending himself was ``what I've planned all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain points I can bring out better than anyone  
else,'' Kevorkian said. ``There are certain questions I can ask.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Cooper asked Kevorkian whether he knew what the inside of a  
state prison looked like, Kevorkian replied that he had seen ``The 
Shawshank Redemption'' twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper warned Kevorkian that that what he says in court can be  
used against him in future proceedings. But he countered: ``I plan 
to say nothing but the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper then reluctantly granted his request. Sitting at the  
defense table, Gorosh shook his head. The lawyer has said he 
advised Kevorkian not to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is charged with killing Thomas Youk, 52, of Waterford  
Township. Youk had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou 
Gehrig's disease, a progressively fatal illness that eventually 
leaves victims unable to speak, swallow or move. His family said 
Youk was having trouble breathing and was afraid of choking on his 
own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	The video aired on ``60 Minutes'' shows a man's hands injecting  
Youk three times with a needle. 
</P>
<P>
	``You killed him,'' Mike Wallace told Kevorkian in an interview  
during the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did, but it's going to be manslaughter, not murder,''  
Kevorkian replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Kevorkian won the right to act as his own lawyer, Gorosh  
said he planned to argue that Kevorkian's intent was to relieve 
Youk's pain and suffering and that the action did not amount to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper has ruled out testimony during the trial about Youk's  
suffering, but the defense still can refer to it.

<HEADLINE> Shoney's Settles 3 Suits for $18M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Shoney's Inc. has agreed to pay $18  
million to settle three class-action lawsuits with current and 
former employees who sued over pay and labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville-based restaurant company also announced Monday a  
first-quarter 1999 loss of $15.9 million, including a $14.5 million 
charge to help cover the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had set aside $3.5 million in the last quarter of  
1998 after U.S. District Judge Todd Campbell ruled in December that 
the company improperly reduced salaries of Shoney's managers and 
assistant managers to cover cash shortages at their restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoney's had been scheduled to go to trial this June to  
determine damages the company owed to the 1,000 plaintiffs in that 
lawsuit, filed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The second lawsuit, filed in 1996, alleged that hourly employees  
were working off the clock, paid inappropriately and overtime hours 
were rolled from one week to another. About 18,000 workers joined 
that lawsuit, and trial was set for Jan. 4, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, managers at Captain D's seafood restaurants alleged  
that its parent company reduced salaries to cover cash shortages, 
and used empty titles of ``manager'' and ``assistant manager'' to 
avoid paying overtime. About 250 people joined in the suit, which 
had not been set for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell and the restaurant company's lenders still must approve  
the settlement deal, which would split the money among 19,000 
current and former employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoney's operates and franchises 1,217 Shoney's, Captain D's,  
Pargo's and Fifth Quarter restaurants in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The company closed 104 restaurants last year and announced the  
closure of 47 more this year as part of a restructuring plan hoped 
to turn around the struggling company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's first-quarter loss was 32 cents per share on  
revenue of $300 million, compared to 23 cents a share, or $11 
million, on revenues of $339.1 million, for the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoney's stock closed down 81 1/4 cents at $2.43 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Oil-Price Crisis Hits Saudis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- For Saudi Arabia, the world's  
largest oil exporter, last year's sharp drop in oil prices was an 
economic catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	The kingdom's oil revenues shrank to $30 billion -- a drop of $20  
billion from the year before -- and plunged its budget deeply into 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Government hiring has been frozen, construction projects have  
been shelved and foreign military contracts are being rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank has had to intervene at least once, and  
possibly twice, to keep speculators from forcing the depreciation 
of the Saudi currency, the riyal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been our warning, our wake-up call,'' said Mohammed  
Tunisi, editor of the financial daily Al-Eqtisadiah. ``If we learn 
the lessons, it gives me hope for the coming century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most important lesson, experts say, is that Saudi Arabia has  
to diversify its economy so that it's not at the mercy of the ups 
and downs of world oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Taecker, chief economist at the Saudi American Bank, said  
that even if OPEC production cuts under discussion in Austria this 
week boost prices, ``it doesn't change the fact that Saudi Arabia 
has to stay focused on economic policies that promote 
diversification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's easier said than done in a country which has one-quarter  
of the world's oil reserves -- 260 billion barrels -- and has been 
dependent on that one commodity for the past five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also difficult because the kingdom's 20 million people have  
become used to government largesse that includes free education and 
health care, subsidized utilities, low-interest housing loans and 
guaranteed jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet because of the oil crunch, once-unthinkable reforms are  
being discussed openly, including limiting the monthly stipends 
that go to the royal family's 7,000 princes and princesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am against having salaries for the royal family,'' said  
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire entrepreneur who is a 
grandson of the late King Abdel-Aziz, the founder of modern Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no sign yet that royal stipends are being reduced. But  
Crown Prince Abdullah, who has managed day-to-day operations in the 
kingdom since King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, reportedly has 
ordered scofflaw princes to make good on water, electricity and 
phone bills that they have long ignored or face cutoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with a budget deficit of $12 billion this year for  
the second year in a row, the government also is being forced to go 
ahead at long last with reforms that have been on the drawing board 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity and telephone utilities are being privatized, and  
customers already have been warned to expect significant rate hikes 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia also is moving to encourage private business. A  
long-discussed investment law is expected to be adopted this 
summer, and a capital markets act should follow, ministers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah Dabbagh, adviser to the Council of Saudi Chambers of  
Commerce and Industry, said one aim is to get Saudis to bring home 
the estimated $420 billion they have stashed outside their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to get this money and foreign money is to open  
new venues to investment,'' said Dabbagh, who also is a member of 
the kingdom's advisory Consultative Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ``new'' investors could be big American oil companies  
that lost their holdings in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s when the 
country nationalized the oil-producing Aramco. 
</P>
<P>
	At the invitation of Abdullah, U.S. oil companies already have  
begun discussing proposals -- not for oil exploration but for 
development of the kingdom's vast natural gas fields and industries 
that use gas, including petrochemicals and fertilizers.

<HEADLINE> Study: Direct Chemo Can Extend Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Injecting chemotherapy directly into a  
tumor and cutting off its blood supply can double the survival rate 
of adults with colon cancer that has spread to the liver, a medical 
researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 51 patients at the University of Pennsylvania  
Medical Center, those treated with the technique survived an 
average of two years -- twice as long as those undergoing systemic 
chemotherapy, in which cancer-killing drugs are delivered into the 
bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least we've bought them some time,'' said Dr. Michael  
Soulen, the lead researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was presented in Orlando at the 24th Annual Scientific  
Meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional 
Radiology. There were 51 patients in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jack Wands, a liver research expert at Brown University,  
called the study provocative but said it needs to be expanded to a 
larger group of people before any conclusions can be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon cancer is the third most common fatal cancer in the United  
States, with about 150,000 new cases a year. Half of those patients 
die when cancer spreads to the liver and becomes difficult to 
treat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, the patients underwent the treatment known as  
chemoembolization. A nick the size of a pencil tip is made in the 
patient's groin and a catheter is placed in an artery. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors then inject chemotherapy that is 20 to 200 times  
stronger than what is used for systemic chemotherapy. Plastic 
particles are used to block the artery, cutting off about 25 
percent of the liver's blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Choking the tumor's energy source prevents the tumor from  
washing out the chemotherapy, and blocking the artery keeps the 
poison in the tumor, Soulen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects from systemic chemotherapy, such as hair loss and  
mouth sores, also are significantly reduced in chemoembolization, 
Soulen said. The procedure, however, can cause liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to systemic chemo, it's much more comfortable,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two to four more years of trial studies using a broader  
population are needed before the technique can be considered for 
popular treatment.

<HEADLINE> Driver's Attorney Disputes Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Three witnesses to the deadly Amtrak  
crash have given possibly conflicting statements about when warning 
signals and crossing gates activated at the crossing, a federal 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Finch, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety  
Board, would not go into detail about what the witnesses reported 
but said all three had different vantage points. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the truck driver involved in the March 15 crash,  
which killed 11 people and injured more than 100, said his client 
did not attempt to go around downed crossing gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense tells me there is something wrong with that  
system of how those gates come down,'' said Leonard Sacks, attorney 
for John Stokes, 58. ``There is no reason for him to go around 
them. It doesn't make any sense. And now we have more eyewitnesses 
and more corroboration of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sacks said Stokes' view was impaired by two freight trains  
parked along the tracks before the Amtrak train plowed into his 
tractor-trailer, killing 11 people and injuring more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people remain in critical condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, last week said  
the engineer reported that the trucker tried to zigzag his 
tractor-trailer through the down crossing gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The train's engineer has been released from the hospital, but  
Finch said investigators plan to give him another two to three 
weeks to recuperate before conducting an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, a Chicago law firm filed lawsuits on behalf of one  
woman who died in the crash and four passengers who were injured. 
All were traveling to Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which does not specify monetary damages, names as  
defendants Stokes, his employer -- Melco Transfer Inc. -- and 
Illinois Central Gulf Railway Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar lawsuit was filed last week on behalf of a New Orleans  
couple. It also named Amtrak as a defendant.

<HEADLINE> SEC chairman Wants to Expand Power / Mutual Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's top securities regulator  
wants to expand the power of independent directors of mutual fund 
companies in an effort to better protect the millions of Americans 
who invest in the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, made the proposals in a speech Monday to the Investment 
Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The protection of investors and the preservation of their  
confidence require a universal vigilance and a common determination 
for constant improvement,'' Levitt said in the speech in Palm 
Desert, Calif. ``That improvement, for the mutual fund industry, 
lies in promoting and safeguarding independence, accountability and 
transparency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 77 million Americans now invest in mutual funds, whose  
total assets exceeded $5.5 trillion at the end of last year, up 
from around $1 trillion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent fund directors, who come from diverse backgrounds,  
are watchdogs responsible for protecting investors' interests and 
maintaining the funds' integrity. Their duties include overseeing 
mutual fund fees, monitoring financial performance and preventing 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Levitt also has been pushing the industry for  
improved disclosure of fund fees and investment risks. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed Monday that the SEC:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require the boards of mutual fund companies to have a majority  
of independent directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current rules, less than a majority -- 40 percent -- of fund  
companies' directors must be independent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt noted that most large fund companies voluntarily have a  
majority of independent directors. He did not specify how large the 
new required majority should be. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that any new independent directors be nominated by  
current independent directors rather than fund company managers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that there be attorneys available to directors who also  
are independent from company management. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that investors be given information by which to judge  
the independence of their funds' directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said the SEC, which must vote to formally open the  
proposals to public comment, will act on them immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, Chris  
Wloszczyna, said the group had no specific comment on Levitt's 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mutual funds have the strongest system of governance in the  
private sector, and independent directors ... are a crucial 
component of this highly effective system,'' ICI Chairman John J. 
Brennan said in a statement. ``It makes sense to examine the 
industry's best practices to see if a good system can be made even 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ICI announced it had formed an advisory group on best  
practices for fund directors, comprised of independent directors 
and industry officials, which would prepare a report. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's proposals grew out of a two-day SEC conference last  
month on the role of independent fund directors. 
</P>
<P>
	At that meeting, Paul Roye, the SEC's top mutual fund regulator,  
said independent directors have played an important role in keeping 
the industry remarkably free from scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Roye added, the SEC will ``aggressively and vigorously  
pursue'' reports of legal violations brought to it by independent 
directors of mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Roye did not specifically mention any avenues the SEC might  
take, but it was clear he referred to the agency's power to bring 
civil lawsuits against fund company officials.

<HEADLINE> Feds Seek To Curb Tax Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing new  
penalties and increased scrutiny of corporate tax shelters that rob 
the government of billions of dollars a year, Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers told a Tax Executives Institute conference that the  
Treasury Department will strive for a ``culture of compliance'' 
focusing on both the peddlers of tax shelters and their purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about demagoguing. This is not about anything that  
will seize revenue,'' Summers said. ``This is about a fairer tax 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department plans as early as next month to release  
a major paper outlining the scope of the tax shelter problem. 
Estimates of losses in federal revenue are sketchy, but a single 
example cited by Summers was pegged at some $30 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In his fiscal 2000 budget plan, President Clinton proposed to  
eliminate several specific tax shelters. But Summers said the 
administration is not stopping there. 
</P>
<P>
	To create ``real financial risks'' for people who devise and use  
tax shelters, Summers said, the administration wants Congress to 
approve a 25 percent excise tax on promoter and lawyer fees. In 
addition, an unspecified excise tax would be imposed on contingency 
fees, sometimes used when part of the deal depends upon a favorable 
ruling by the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such deterrents, Summers said, ``The temptation for some  
taxpayers to play the audit lottery is just too great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other actions the Treasury Department is taking on its own  
include guidelines on specific questionable transactions that would 
be retroactive, stepped-up compliance efforts within the IRS and 
possible suggestions for new standards of conduct within 
professional legal and accounting groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's tax shelter proposals have met with  
resistance from many tax practitioners, and several questioners in 
the audience today complained that they are vague and too broad. 
But Summers said it would be wise for professionals to do more than 
simply criticize the ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not in our interest to subject taxpayers to  
out-of-control enforcement actions,'' he said. ``Conversely, we do 
believe there is a major problem.''

<HEADLINE> Greatest Y2K Danger May Be Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The greatest danger from the Year 2000  
computer problem may be panic among Americans convinced there will 
be major disruptions, emergency experts told a House hearing 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panelists did, however, caution people to be ready for minor  
breakdowns in basic services. The International Association of 
Emergency Managers said communities should prepare as if for a 
storm, including aftereffects, lasting about seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to say the sky is not falling because of  
Y2K,'' said Mike Walker of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
which is helping local emergency systems deal with the computer 
problem. ``There is no need to hoard, there is no need to take 
money out of banks, there is no need to head for the hills,'' he 
told the House Government Reform Committee's government management 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fear of unknown consequences places citizens at the risk of  
either overreacting or not reacting at all,'' said the 
subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem arises out of the ability of many computers to  
read only the last two digits in dates. Those computers would read 
the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, causing computers to malfunction 
or break down, possibly threatening services ranging from 
electricity to food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker joined other experts in concluding that, after spending  
billions to fix computers, the federal government and the large 
service industries can say there will be no major infrastructure 
problems on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But there has also been disinformation and hype, much on the  
Internet, that has some people girding for catastrophic events. 
``There are those who will panic,'' said Rep. Jim Turner of Texas, 
the subcommittee' top Democrat. He said his own father was talking 
about spending more than $2,000 for an electric generator. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Mann of Kitsap County, Wash., president-elect of the  
International Association of Emergency Managers, said it was 
crucial to give people with reliable and consistent information to 
counterbalance the ``alarmists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a guideline, the IAEM is recommending that people have on  
hand enough food and water for a seven-day storm. They should have 
a 30-day supply of medication and should make copies of car, 
mortgage and credit card payments in case of problems with bank 
computers. They should also keep their gas tanks full. 
</P>
<P>
	FEMA has published its own manual for local emergency managers  
that outlines how to avoid Y2K problems and handle any problems 
that do occur. Among the many areas of concern cited: 911 services 
could go down, street lights and railroad crossing signals might 
fail, problems might occur with jails or prisons, leading to 
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler said  
that while large hospitals have generally fixed their computers, 
which monitor crucial health records and medical equipment, 
``municipal and county hospitals lag far behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She urged the government to set up a ``super health care Web  
site'' to help health care providers avoid what could be 
life-threatening situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the heads of the Senate's special panel on the Y2K  
problem, Sens. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
wrote to Vice President Al Gore asking him to take up Russia's 
serious Y2K issues when he meets this week with Russian Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russian failure to address Y2K will only worsen its economic  
woes, further degrade its aging defense systems and possibly lead 
to humanitarian and environmental problems for its citizens and 
neighbors,'' they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Hostage Terry Anderson Sues Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former hostage Terry Anderson filed a $100  
million lawsuit against Iran on today for allegedly financing and 
directing the terrorists who kept him shackled and blindfolded for 
nearly seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, former chief Middle East correspondent for The  
Associated Press, was taken captive in Beirut, Lebanon, on March 
16, 1985, as he returned from a morning tennis game. His Hezbollah 
captors shuttled Anderson between stuffy rooms, beat and berated 
him and taunted him with the false hope of release, his lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the entire period of his captivity, Anderson saw the  
sun once,'' the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson became so depressed he banged his head against a wall  
until he bled and continued to suffer problems related to 
depression after his release in December 1991, the suit said. He 
and his family asked for $100 million compensation plus unspecified 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Islamic Republic of Iran provides material support and  
resources'' to Hezbollah, and provided the group with ``funding, 
direction and training for its terrorist activities in Lebanon,'' 
the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit in U.S. District Court in Washington is similar to  
claims filed by other Americans held hostage in Lebanon during the 
1980s. Iran has not paid damages awarded to other hostages, nor to 
the family of an American student killed in a bus bombing in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran denies it sponsored Hezbollah and claims American courts  
have no power over foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> How Garth Brooks Fared on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Monday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks was hitless in two at-bats and made an  
error in left field in the Padres' split-squad, 7-7 tie with the 
Chicago Cubs at HoHoKam Park. He is 1-for-13 (.077) this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* Brooks nearly had his second hit in two days, but  
Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez made a nice play behind the bag and 
threw out Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``Thank God Mesa has only one ballpark,'' said  
Brooks, who went to the wrong field in Tucson on Saturday for the 
Padres' previous road game. 
</P>
<P>
	HoHoKam's version of the Bleacher Bums were all over Brooks.  
Some examples: ``Are you the guy who sang `Achy Breaky Heart?'; 
``Hey, it's Brooke Shields''; ``Hey, Tony (Gwynn), is Garth going 
to beat you out?''; and ``Hey Garth, I just bought you for $3 on my 
fantasy league team.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Seek To Curb Tax Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is intent on  
pursuing tougher penalties and increased scrutiny of corporate tax 
shelters that sidestep billions of dollars in taxes, a top Treasury 
Department official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our aim is not merely to protect revenues but to protect those  
taxpayers who are willing to pay their fair share,'' Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told a conference of the Tax 
Executives Institute, comprising 5,000 tax specialists at U.S. 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the Treasury Department will strive for a ``culture  
of compliance'' focusing on both the peddlers of tax shelters -- 
accounting firms, investment bankers and consultants -- and the 
companies that use them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department plans as early as next month to release  
a major study outlining the scope of the tax shelter problem. 
Estimates of losses in federal revenue are sketchy, but a single 
example cited by Summers was pegged at $30 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally speaking, a tax shelter is a financial arrangement  
aimed mainly at escaping taxes with no other economic or business 
purpose. In his fiscal 2000 budget plan, President Clinton proposed 
to eliminate several specific shelters, but Summers said the 
administration won't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
	To create ``real financial risks'' for people who devise and use  
tax shelters, Summers said, the administration wants Congress to 
approve a 25 percent excise tax on promoter and lawyer fees. In 
addition, an unspecified excise tax would be imposed on contingency 
fees, sometimes used when part of the deal depends upon a favorable 
ruling by the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such deterrents, Summers said, ``The temptation for some  
taxpayers to play the audit lottery is just too great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other actions the Treasury Department is taking on its own  
include guidelines on specific questionable transactions that would 
be retroactive, stepped-up compliance efforts within the IRS and 
possible suggestions for new standards of conduct within 
professional legal and accounting groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposals have met with resistance from  
many tax practitioners. Michael Murphy, executive director of the 
Tax Executives Institute, said problems center on the ``vagueness'' 
of how shelters are defined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned that a lot of taxpayers who are trying to  
comply are going to feel a lot of uncertainty about such a broad 
definition of shelters and the fairness of the penalties 
involved,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the government wants to work with tax professionals  
to come up with a workable new system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not in our interest to subject taxpayers to  
out-of-control enforcement actions,'' he said. ``Conversely, we do 
believe there is a major problem.''

<HEADLINE> Thai Gov't Wants To Cut Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Faced with declining revenues and  
spiraling costs, Thailand's government wants to cut bureaucrats' 
salaries and eventually trim their ranks, a government spokesman 
said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Akaphol Sorasuchart said government salaries were eating up more  
than 50 percent of Thailand's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should not be more than 40 percent,'' he said. ``In the  
short term, we would like to cut salaries. In the long term, we 
would like to reduce the number of government officials, to 
restructure the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gave no specific targets for the reductions.  
</P>
<P>
	Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern  
times and is receiving a $17.2 billion bailout from the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	As personal and corporate incomes drop and more people lose  
their jobs, Thailand's tax revenues have fallen, putting a serious 
dent in the nation's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF recently approved deficit spending of 6 percent of gross  
domestic product for the Thai government. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers will hurt the most by the budget shortfall, Akaphol  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers are suffering even more this year because, aside from  
the unemployed migrating back to their families in rural areas and 
increasing the burden on many families, prices for farm goods are 
dropping,'' Akaphol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers account for about 60 percent of Thailand's population.  
The country also has a large number of people who migrate to the 
cities in search of work during good times, and return to the 
farmlands when work is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus of the government's budget in the coming year will  
be aimed at solving social problems, especially in rural areas. 
That is our priority,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Akaphol said, however, that the government would have to seek  
new loans from international agencies to be able to meet its goal 
of helping the rural poor.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche: Four Dead, Six Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURNAGAIN PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Volunteers with 10-foot poles  
poked the snow Monday and recovered two more bodies from an 
avalanche that swept through a popular snowmobiling spot the day 
before, raising the death toll to four. As many as six other people 
were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-foot wave of powdery snow roared down the mountainside  
Sunday afternoon, while hundreds of snowmobilers enjoyed 
temperatures in the 40s and bright sunshine. Witnesses described a 
wall of snow that sounded like a train and a wind blast that drove 
icy particles into their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Two snowmobilers were found dead shortly after the slide and two  
more were discovered on Monday. State Trooper 1st Sgt. Paul Burke 
said six others were considered missing, based on calls from people 
reporting that friends, relatives and co-workers hadn't returned 
from snowmobiling in the area. Those included a man thought to have 
been snowboarding in the area who has not been heard from since 
Sunday, troopers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke has asked for 100 more volunteers after a request for help  
from the military ran into bureaucratic snags. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no tried-and-true way of doing this,'' Burke said.  
``The reality is we may not find anybody until spring. That's not a 
good way to do it, but that's where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities called off the search Monday evening and planned to  
resume searching at first light Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanche buried a grove of 10-foot-high spruce trees, and  
Burke said he fears some victims may be entangled in the uprooted 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers also were analyzing a videotape taken by an eyewitness  
to try to pinpoint where some victims may be buried. The video 
shows several snowmobilers trying to outrun a part of the slide. 
They disappear in smoky clouds and aren't seen again. 
</P>
<P>
	About 85 volunteers moved shoulder-to-shoulder with the poles  
Monday, probing for bodies in areas where witnesses had reported 
seeing snowmobilers disappear or where machines had been 
discovered. Dogs trained to sniff out buried bodies accompanied 
searchers, who were soaked by heavy snow mixed with rain as 
temperatures were again in the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanche extended nearly two miles across the face of a  
mountain high in Turnagain Pass, a popular recreation area in the 
Chugach National Forest about 55 miles southeast of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second of two slides that occurred about 20 minutes  
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanches may have been triggered by ``highmarking,'' a  
contest in which snowmobilers drive straight uphill to see who can 
make the highest mark on the mountain, said Greg Wilkinson, a 
spokesman for the Alaska State Troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dan Hourihan, chairman of the Alaska Mountain Rescue  
Group, said there were probably other causes, including the warm 
weather and eight feet of fresh snow that had fallen in the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service and the U.S. Forest Service issued  
warnings last week that the conditions had raised the danger of 
snowslides. 
</P>
<P>
	The first slide, which broke loose around 4 p.m., filled a  
ravine and scattered some of the hundreds of snowmobilers who were 
driving in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger avalanche began at the top of a 3,000-foot ridge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I watched a guy halfway up the mountain get his machine stuck,  
and as he was digging it out the slide broke,'' said Brian Stewart, 
who was on his snowmachine when the slide tumbled down the ridge. 
``A 30-foot wall of snow hit him and the machine. He flew up in the 
air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said he saw three other riders buried while he was  
speeding away. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Swan, president of the Anchorage Snowmachine Club, said  
highmarking is strongly discouraged. ``We warn all of our people at 
meetings to shy away from stuff like that,'' Swan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four known victims were identified by authorities as Jodi  
Combs, 26, Jeff Saunders, 29, and Christopher Scott, 28, all of 
Anchorage; and Dan Demers, 37, of Eagle River.

<HEADLINE> Longtime AP Reporter Dies at 84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- J.D. Holmes, an Associated Press reporter  
who covered Montana state government for 30 years, died Sunday. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes covered the Legislature from 1948 until 1978. He was  
known for the depth of his knowledge of state government; even 
legislators relied on his notes and math to be sure the state 
budget was in balance. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered 16 regular and six special sessions of the  
Legislature for the AP. One of the special sessions was necessary 
when Holmes discovered a major mistake in an appropriations bill 
after legislators had gone home. 
</P>
<P>
	State representatives in 1991 honored Holmes with a resolution  
recognizing his ``high standards and personal dedication.'' He was 
honored in a packed legislative chamber after being formally 
escorted to the well of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Francis Bardanouve, a longtime Appropriations  
Committee chairman, said Holmes ``knew more about how much money we 
spent than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was meticulous in preparation,'' Bardanouve said. ``I  
recognized him as a very careful student of the Legislature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement, Holmes returned to the Legislature to  
lobby for Montana artists until 1983. He ran unsuccessfully in 1981 
for the Helena City Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	As a reporter, Holmes began each day methodically clipping  
articles about government and politics from several newspapers. His 
clippings eventually filled 71 file drawers, and Holmes and his 
family were worried that the upstairs floor in their home would 
collapse from the weight. 
</P>
<P>
	After he retired, Holmes donated his records to the Montana  
Historical Society, where they still are used for reference. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, whose initials stood for Joseph Defrees, joined the AP  
in Helena after several years as managing editor of the Lewistown 
Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, he owned or operated three weekly newspapers -- the  
Sweet Grass News at Big Timber, the Yellowstonian at West 
Yellowstone and the Fergus County Argus at Lewistown. He also 
worked for newspapers in Sheridan, Wyo., and Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two daughters and a son.

<HEADLINE> Benigni Wins Oscar As Best Actor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He danced across seat backs and hopped up the  
stage steps before grabbing two Oscars and the dazed, delighted 
heart of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Benigni made Academy history Sunday night by winning a  
best actor Oscar as the star of a foreign language film. ``Life is 
Beautiful,'' which he directed and wrote, also won best foreign 
film and for dramatic musical score. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you say, it's the hailstorm of kindness of gratitude  
for you,'' enthused Benigni, whose exuberant Italian accent and 
animated body language pulled a celebrity audience not easily 
impressed to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenter Sophia Loren praised ``a dear Italian friend'' before  
announcing Benigni's first win of the evening. Famous in Italy, but 
little-known here, Benigni popped up, jumped atop seat backs and 
stepped over heads. 
</P>
<P>
	When he reached Steven Spielberg's chair, he wobbled and  
clutched the famous director's hand as Spielberg's wife, actress 
Kate Capshaw, laughed and held Benigni's leg to keep him from 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage, he wrapped his arms around Loren and his Oscar for best  
foreign film. While Loren wept in the background, and celebrities 
such as Goldie Hawn cried in the audience, Benigni exuded, ``I want 
to dive into this audience, you know, your generosity is too 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Tuscan village where Benigni was born, Italians were  
still wide awake in the wee morning hours today when the hometown 
boy made good on Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roberto! Roberto! Roberto!'' the crowd gathered at a huge TV  
screen set up in the community center at Vergaio cried out when 
Benigni won. 
</P>
<P>
	People jumped to their feet when the awards were announced,  
weeping with joy, dancing around and kissing Benigni's sister 
Albertina, a florist. 
</P>
<P>
	His elderly parents, already exhausted from the recent  
excitement and attention when Benigni got a stunning seven 
nominations, didn't manage to stay up for the party. But Albertina 
said she'd taped the whole Oscar show for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its global popularity, Benigni's film also was  
criticized for trivializing the Holocaust by using comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful,'' follows an Italian Jew and his young son  
into a Nazi concentration camp. Benigni, as the father, protects 
his young boy by pretending the whole experience is a big game with 
prizes awarded for not crying and not giving voice to hunger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazis, Benigni tells his son, are ``the mean guys.''  
</P>
<P>
	The film has become the highest-grossing foreign language film  
in North American history and earned Italy its 10th Oscar, the most 
won by any foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, Benigni was back, winning the best actor statuette. In a  
speech sometimes indecipherable because of his accent and his 
energy, he gushed ``This is a terrible mistake, because I used up 
all my English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite. In big sentences short on continuity, Benigni talked  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not able to express all my gratitude. Now my body is in  
tumult. It is a colossal moment of joy ... I would like to be 
Jupiter and kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making 
love to everybody. Grazie, grazie, America, land of a lotta things. 
I don't deserve this. But I hope to win some other Oscars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni became the first filmmaker in 50 years -- since Sir  
Laurence Olivier and ``Hamlet'' -- to direct his own Oscar-winning 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	He is possibly Italy's most famous living actor, known for his  
physical humor and rubbery face and body. He has worked for 
directors such as Costa-Gavras, Federico Fellini and Jim Jarmusch. 
</P>
<P>
	His American film debut came in Jarmusch's ``Down by Law'' in  
1986, playing a maladjusted Italian on the lam in rural Louisiana 
whose English is, well, bad. 
</P>
<P>
	But Benigni was perfectly understood Sunday when he acknowledged  
those who died in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank those who are not here, who gave their lives  
so that we can say 'Life Is Beautiful.'''

<HEADLINE> Holiday Sought for Pearl Harbor Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Some would say the calendar is already  
crammed with holidays, but Rep. Jack Quinn thinks there's room for 
one more. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kelly agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelly was eating breakfast in the mess hall at Pearl Harbor just  
before 8 a.m. on Dec. 7, 1941, when he heard popping sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like a bunch of firecrackers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelly and his Army buddies ran to the door and looked up at a  
sky full of planes. He at first thought the Air Force was having 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I saw the symbol of the rising sun on one of the  
planes,'' Kelly said. ``I could see the pilot. The landing gear was 
down. The planes were so low that if I had stood on top of the 
barracks, I could have reached up and grabbed one of them by the 
wheels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly joined Rep. Quinn, a Republican, on Sunday in announcing  
legislation that would designate Pearl Harbor Day as a federal 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack killed 2,403 men, women and children and drew the  
United States into World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there is no day set aside to represent World War  
II,'' said the 78-year-old Kelly, a San Diego native and a member 
of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	His 22 1/2 years of Army service included 11 months spent in a  
Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened at Pearl Harbor brought this country together  
and made it the strongest country in the world,'' said Kelly, who 
moved to Buffalo in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn, chairman of the Veterans' Benefits Subcommittee, said the  
idea to promote Pearl Harbor Day came from veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pearl Harbor marks one of the most significant dates in  
American history,'' said Quinn, who made his announcement at the 
Naval &AMP; Military Park on Buffalo's waterfront. ``It put the United 
States into World War II and as a result of America's involvement 
in the war, it established our country as a dominant world power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is meeting with resistance from those who argue there  
already are too many holidays, including Memorial Day and Veterans 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's true,'' Quinn said. ``But if the United States  
hadn't responded to the events at Pearl Harbor, there wouldn't be 
any other holidays for us to talk about.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. Coach Looks for Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Duke has a great coach, a great  
basketball program, a great team. And Michigan State coach Tom Izzo 
says ``they are pretty much unbeatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Izzo sure isn't conceding Saturday's semifinal game,  
especially after his gritty Spartans' come-from-behind victory 
Sunday against Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no bigger upset than Michigan State beating Duke,''  
Izzo said. ``All I have to do is make sure our kids understand 
that. And knowing these players and knowing their toughness, I'm 
sure we're not going in there scared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nervous, maybe. Scared, no.''  
</P>
<P>
	Duke (36-1) and Michigan State (33-4), the top two teams in the  
final AP poll, met earlier this season, with the Blue Devils 
winning 73-67 in the Great Eight tournament. Saturday's game at 
Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla., has a little more at stake 
with the winner taking on either Ohio State or Connecticut for the 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said Michigan State matches up with Duke somewhat, at least  
in size. And even though Duke has been the dominant team this 
season, the Michigan State coach has hopes for a big upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no doubt we're going to be an underdog, but we've been  
the underdog before,'' he said. ``I'm really looking forward to it; 
I really am. I'm not looking forward to it in a cocky way, thinking 
that hey, we're just going to go out and beat Duke, but in a 
confident way where I think we can do some things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Spartans want some inspiration, they and their fans don't  
have to look further than Sunday's game, in which Michigan State 
rebounded from an early 13-point deficit to beat Kentucky 73-66. 
</P>

	``Remember: A slow start and a good ending is a lot better than  
a fast start and a bad ending,'' Izzo said.

	Michigan State may pick up an edge from happy Spartan fans.  
After Sunday's victory, the team returned to Lansing around 
midnight to find about 300 fans crowding the airport, and Izzo 
could sense the enthusiasm.

	``Yesterday was such an emotional event ... seeing all those  
people out there at 12:30 at night,'' he said. ``I think the campus 
is electric right now; people are caught up in the spirit of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only the students but this entire community has kind of  
taken a grasp of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of those caught up in the green-and-white spirit are former  
Spartan players and coaches, many of whom have shown up to root on 
this year's team.

	Watching from the stands in St. Louis on Sunday, among others,  
were Magic Johnson and former coach Jud Heathcote, who teamed to 
lead the Spartans to the NCAA title in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great he took the time to come back,'' Izzo said of  
Heathcote. And, he said, Johnson ``thinks we can win it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of faith in what he thinks, so I'll just go with  
that,'' Izzo added.
